ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND  - ------------------------------------------------------------------------          FINANCIAL CONDITION          -------------------       The Fairchild Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in October, 1969.  The Company changed its name from Banner Industries, Inc. to The Fairchild Corporation on November 15, 1990.  RHI Holdings, Inc. ("RHI") is a direct subsidiary of the Company.  RHI is the owner of all of the common stock of Fairchild Industries, Inc. ("FII") which, in turn, is the 100% owner of VSI Corporation ("VSI").  The Company's operations are conducted primarily through VSI.  RHI also holds a significant equity interest in Banner Aerospace, Inc. ("Banner").  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS       On December 23, 1993, the Company consummated the sale of its 43.9% stock interest in Rexnord Corporation ("Rexnord"), consisting of 8,083,248 shares, for $22.50 per share, to BTR Dunlop Holdings, Inc.  The Company received $181.9 million in proceeds and realized a pre-tax gain of $129.1 million, net of expenses, in the second quarter of Fiscal 1994.      During the first quarter of Fiscal 1994, the Company adopted Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions", and No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", and elected to take one-time non-cash charges totaling $10.9 million, of which $8.0 million was for postretirement benefits and $2.9 million for change in accounting for income taxes.  These charges are reflected in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, and represent cumulative effects on prior years of the accounting changes.  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, the effect of the changes on pretax income from continuing operations was not material.       On June 10, 1994, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of Convac GmbH for approximately $4,700,000.  Convac GmbH ("Convac") is a leading designer and manufacturer of high precision state-of-the-art wet processing tools, equipment and systems required for the manufacture of semi- conductor chips and related products and for compact and optical storage discs and liquid crystal displays.  The results of operations will be reported as part of the Industrial Products segment in the future and were immaterial in Fiscal 1994.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The Company currently operates in three principal business segments:  Aerospace Fasteners, Industrial Products and Communications Services.  The following table illustrates the historical sales and operating income of the Company's continuing operations for the past three years.                                            For the years ended June 30, (In thousands)                         --------------------------------                                        Reported    Reported    Reported                                          1994        1993        1992                                        --------    --------    --------        Sales by Business Segment:    Aerospace Fasteners...............   $203,456    $247,080    $299,270   Industrial Products...............    166,499     148,449     132,238   Communications Services...........     74,190      68,038      58,272                                         -------     -------     ------- Total                                  $444,145    $463,567    $489,780                                         =======     =======     ======= Operating Income (Loss) by   Business Segment:    Aerospace Fasteners*..............   $(32,208)   $(15,398)   $ 15,654   Industrial Products...............     21,024      19,081      15,250   Communications Services...........     16,483      14,688      13,399                                         -------     -------     ------- Total                                     5,299      18,371      44,303    Corporate administrative expense..

FISCAL 1994 VERSUS FISCAL 1993  General - -------       Overall sales declined by 4.2% for Fiscal 1994, compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily caused by price erosion due to excess capacity in the aerospace fasteners industry, reduced order rates from commercial and military aerospace customers in the Aerospace Fasteners segment and lower revenues due to the disruption caused by the earthquake.  Reduced order rates were principally due to reductions in defense spending and reduced build rates of commercial airplane original equipment manufacturers, due to conditions in the airline industry.  The decline in sales at the Aerospace Fasteners segment was partially offset by significant sales increases at the Industrial Products and Communication Services segments in the Fiscal 1994 period.  The Industrial Products segment included sales in the current period by Fairchild Data Corporation which had been classified as a discontinued operation in the prior periods.       Operating income decreased by $13.5 million in Fiscal 1994, compared to Fiscal 1993.  A restructuring charge of $18.9 million was recorded in Fiscal 1994 to further implement the Aerospace Fasteners segment restructuring plan. A $4.0 million charge for earthquake damage and related business interruption also affected this segment in Fiscal 1994.  Operating income was up in the Industrial Products and Communications Services business segments for Fiscal 1994, however, in the Aerospace Fasteners segment operating income declined $16.8 million for Fiscal 1994, compared to the prior year.  Other corporate income also decreased in Fiscal 1994.  (See discussion below.)  Aerospace Fasteners - -------------------       Sales in the Aerospace Fasteners segment decreased 17.7% in Fiscal 1994, compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to the reduced order rates.  Ordering activity remained at low levels at original equipment manufacturers, and in the replacement markets.  In addition, customers are rescheduling orders to take later delivery in line with reduced aircraft build rates.       The operating loss in the Aerospace Fasteners segment increased by $16.8 million in Fiscal 1994, compared to the Fiscal 1993 period.  During the Fiscal 1994 period, as a result of the sustained soft worldwide demand for aircraft, aircraft engines and the resulting decline in new order rates and prices for aerospace fasteners, the Company has continued to undertake further restructuring actions to further downsize, reduce costs, reduce cycle times and improve margins.  These restructuring efforts include discontinuance of certain aircraft engine bolt and other product lines, increased cellularization of manufacturing processes, including relocation of its New Jersey operations into California and re-engineering certain manufacturing processes and methods to meet increased customer quality standards.       The Company recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $18.9 million in Fiscal 1994 to cover the cost of the above mentioned restructuring activities, including the write down of goodwill and surplus assets related to certain product lines, severance benefits and the nonrecurring costs associated with the cellularization and reengineering of manufacturing processes and methods.  Depending on future demand and prices of aerospace fasteners, the Company may take further restructuring actions in the future and may record additional restructuring charges to cover the cost of these activities.  The Fiscal 1993 period included a restructuring charge of $15.5 million relating to further downsizing fastener operations in Europe and California, and severance and early retirement benefits for terminated employees.       On January 17, 1994, the Company's Chatsworth, California Aerospace Fasteners manufacturing facility suffered extensive damage from the Southern California earthquake.  As a result, the Company has relocated the Chatsworth manufacturing operations to its other Southern California facilities.  This disruption has caused increased costs and reduced revenues in Fiscal 1994 and will likely negatively affect Fiscal 1995 as well.  While the Company carries insurance for both business interruption and property damage caused by earthquakes, the policy has a 5% deductible.  The Company has recorded an unusual pretax loss in Fiscal 1994 of $4.0 million to cover the currently estimated net cost of the damages and business interruption caused by the earthquake.  Included in prepaids and other current assets is an insurance claim receivable of $5.9 million for recoverability of costs related to business interruption and property damage.       Operating income in Fiscal 1994 was also affected by (1) reduced demand and price erosion; and (2) higher quality control costs resulting from customers' intensified quality requirements.  A large customer's disapproval in the third quarter of Fiscal 1993, of the quality system at one of the Aerospace Fasteners segment's plants negatively affected sales and operating income in Fiscal 1994.  The disapproval resulted in the plant being ineligible to receive new orders, delayed shipments due to on-site customer inspection of finished product, and increased quality costs.  The segment has implemented a program to comply with the customer's quality requirements and the plant's quality system was requalified by the customer during the first quarter of Fiscal 1994.  The quality improvement program requires that the plant reinspect its inventories and modify certain manufacturing processes and quality procedures at all major facilities.  This program has resulted in one time start-up costs and increased recurring quality costs, each of which negatively affected the Fiscal 1994 operating results, and will likely negatively affect the future profit margins of this segment.  Industrial Products - -------------------       Sales in the Industrial Products segment increased 12.2% in Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993.  The inclusion of Fairchild Data Corporation sales in Fiscal 1994 accounted for 76.5% of the increased sales in this segment.  The increase in sales in the current period reflects customer response to   D-M-E Company's ("DME") fast delivery programs, new products, and growth of the domestic economy.  Domestic demand for tooling for plastics has been strong while foreign demand has been sluggish in certain countries, reflecting the economic conditions abroad.  However, expansion into selected foreign markets is being pursued and appears to have potential.       Operating income in the Industrial Products segment increased 10.2% in Fiscal 1994, compared to Fiscal 1993.  The inclusion of Fairchild Data Corporation operating income in Fiscal 1994 accounted for 48.9% of the increase in operating income in this segment.  The improved results in the current period resulted from a higher sales volume and improved operating margins.  In recent years the Industrial Products segment has implemented several cost savings steps, including overhead reduction and improved inventory management programs, which have contributed to the higher operating margins.  The improvements in inventory management and delivery systems resulted in faster deliveries, reduction in inventory, and higher inventory turnover.  In addition, DME has continued to implement improved manufacturing methods that have reduced cycle times and costs.  Communications Services - -----------------------       Sales in the Communications Services segment increased 9.0% in Fiscal 1994, compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to the inclusion of sales from acquisitions, the addition of telecommunications franchises in new office buildings, and growth at existing sites.       Operating income in the Communications Services segment increased 12.2% in Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to increased sales resulting from the reasons given above and related economies of scale.  Operating income as a percent of sales in Fiscal 1994 was slightly higher than Fiscal 1993.  Other Expenses/Income - ---------------------       Corporate Administrative Expense - Corporate administrative expense decreased by 13.5% in Fiscal 1994, as compared to Fiscal 1993.  This decline resulted primarily from cost controls, including a reduction in work force and wage and salary caps that were in effect for most corporate employees and the sale of the Company airplane during Fiscal 1994.  Excluding severance payouts, corporate administrative expense declined over 15.9% in Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993.       Other Corporate Income - Other corporate income decreased $3.1 million in Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to the absence of amortization of over accrued retiree health care expense in Fiscal 1994 and the write down of a corporate facility held for sale.       Net Interest Expense - Net interest expense decreased 1.0% in Fiscal 1994, compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to higher interest income in the Fiscal 1994 period as a result of higher cash balances.       Investment Income - Investment income was higher by $3.5 million in Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily as a result of gains realized on the liquidation of investments in Fiscal 1994.  Also included in Fiscal 1994 were $2.8 million of dividends realized on participating pension annuity contracts.       Equity in Earnings of Affiliates - Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $12.1 million in Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993, due to the lower earnings of Banner, after recording nonrecurring charges for discontinued operations, and of Rexnord prior to the Company selling its interest in Rexnord.  Consequently, the current year period includes no earnings for Rexnord subsequent to the sale date.       Minority Interest - Minority interest includes dividend expense on FII's Series C Preferred Stock, issued August 22, 1992 by FII.       Non-Recurring Income - Non-recurring income in Fiscal 1994 includes the net pre-tax gain of $129.1 million on the Company's 43.9% stock interest in Rexnord, which was sold to BTR Dunlop Holdings, Inc. for $22.50 per share on December 23, 1993.       Income Taxes - For Fiscal 1994, the Company provided an income tax provision at a rate of 47.4%.  The provision tax rate was higher than the statutory rate, largely due to the write off and amortization of goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes.    Accounting Changes:       1)  Postretirement Benefits - Using the immediate recognition method, the after-tax charge to earnings representing the cumulative effect of the accounting change was $.5 million.  The unamortized portion of an overstated liability of $10.4 million for discontinued operations substantially offset the transition obligation of $10.9 million for active employees and retirees of continuing operations.  In addition, a $7.5 million charge, net of the Company's related tax benefit, was recorded for the Company's share of Rexnord's cumulative charge resulting from this change in accounting.       2)  Accounting for Income Taxes - The Company elected the immediate recognition method and recorded a $2.4 million charge representing the cumulative effect on prior years.  This charge represents deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the tax basis and book basis of fixed assets, prepaid pension expense, and inventory.  In addition, a $.5 million charge was recorded for the Company's share of Rexnord's cumulative charge resulting from this accounting change.       Extraordinary items - net included in Fiscal 1993 is an extraordinary charge of $11.8 million, net of tax, which is 42% of the Rexnord extraordinary charge related to premiums paid to repurchase debt and the write off of deferred loan costs.  In addition, FII recorded a charge of $.8 million, net of tax, for deferred loan fees written off from the portion of the term loan repaid.       Net Earnings (Loss) - The $71.9 million increase in the Fiscal 1994 net earnings compared to Fiscal 1993 was primarily due to the $129.1 million gain on the sale of shares of Rexnord, offset partially by a $13.5 million drop in operating income, decreased equity earnings of $12.0 million, an $11.0 million charge, net of tax, for the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, and increased taxes on the higher level of income.  FISCAL 1993 VERSUS FISCAL 1992 - ------------------------------  General - -------       Overall sales declined by 5.4% for Fiscal 1993, compared to Fiscal 1992, primarily caused by price erosion due to excess capacity in the aerospace fasteners industry and reduced order rates from commercial and military aerospace customers in the Aerospace Fasteners segment.  The decline in sales at the Aerospace Fasteners segment was partially offset by significant sales increases at the Industrial Products and Communication Services segments in the Fiscal 1993 period.  Operating income decreased 83.9% for Fiscal 1993, compared to Fiscal 1992.  Operating income was up in the Industrial Products and Communications Services business segments for Fiscal 1993; however, in the Aerospace Fasteners segment, operating income declined $31.1 million for Fiscal 1993, compared to the prior year.  Both twelve month periods ended June 30, 1993, and June 30, 1992, included restructuring charges in the Aerospace Fasteners segment.  Corporate administrative expense declined and other corporate income also improved in Fiscal 1993.  (See discussion below.)  Aerospace Fasteners - -------------------       Sales in the Aerospace Fasteners segment decreased 17.4% in Fiscal 1993, compared to Fiscal 1992, primarily due to the reduced order rates mentioned above.  Ordering activity remained at low levels at commercial airplane original equipment manufacturers, engine manufacturers, in defense related procurement, and in the replacement markets served by distributors.  In addition, customers rescheduled orders to take later delivery in line with reduced aircraft build rates.       Operating income in the Aerospace Fasteners segment decreased $31.1 million in Fiscal 1993, in relation to the comparable Fiscal 1992 period.  During the Fiscal 1993 period, the Company continued to implement restructuring plans and included restructuring charges of $15.5 million to further downsize fastener operations in Europe and California and close and consolidate its New Jersey operations into California.  This resulted in severance costs, plant closing and relocation costs, and the write off of excess assets.  The Fiscal 1992 period included restructuring charges of $2.5 million related to severance and early retirement benefits for terminated employees.  Operating income in Fiscal 1993 also was negatively affected by (1) reduced demand and price erosion; (2) higher quality control costs resulting from customers' intensified quality requirements; and (3) increased provisions for excess and slow moving inventory, which amounted to $7.4 million in Fiscal 1993 versus $5.1 million in Fiscal 1992.  Industrial Products - -------------------       Sales in the Industrial Products segment increased 12.3% in Fiscal 1993 compared to Fiscal 1992.  The increase in sales in Fiscal 1993 reflected customer response to D-M-E's fast delivery programs, new products, and moderation of the impact of the economic recession which adversely affected results in Fiscal 1992.  Domestic demand for tooling for plastics was strong while foreign demand was weak.        Operating income in the Industrial Products segment increased 25.1% in Fiscal 1993, compared to Fiscal 1992.  The improved results in Fiscal 1993 resulted from a higher sales volume and improved operating margins.  Early in Fiscal 1992, the Industrial Products segment implemented several cost savings steps, including overhead reduction and improved inventory management programs, which have contributed to the higher operating margins.    Communications Services - -----------------------       Sales in the Communications Services segment increased 16.8% in Fiscal 1993, compared to Fiscal 1992, primarily due to the inclusion of sales from acquisitions, the addition of telecommunications franchises in new office buildings, and growth at existing sites.       Operating income in the Communications Services segment increased 9.6% in Fiscal 1993 compared to Fiscal 1992, primarily due to increased sales.  Operating income as a percent of sales declined in Fiscal 1993 to 21.6% from 23.0% in Fiscal 1992.  The decline was due to lower long distance margins partially offset by lower selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales.  Other Expenses/Income - ---------------------       Corporate Administrative Expense - Corporate administrative expense decreased by 11.2% in Fiscal 1993 as compared to Fiscal 1992.  This decline resulted primarily from cost controls including salary reductions and wage and salary freezes that were in effect for most corporate employees in Fiscal 1993.       Other Corporate Income - Other corporate income includes royalty income, rental income, and the reversal of excess reserves no longer deemed necessary.  Other corporate income increased $1.7 million in Fiscal 1993 compared to Fiscal 1992, primarily due to the adjustment of overstated health care liabilities of $2.7 million no longer deemed necessary in Fiscal 1993.       Net Interest Expense - Net interest expense increased 1.2% in Fiscal 1993, compared to Fiscal 1992, primarily due to lower interest income in the Fiscal 1993 as a result of lower cash balances.  Interest expense was lower in Fiscal 1993 as a result of lower interest rates.       Investment Income - Investment income was lower by $6.8 million in Fiscal 1993 compared to Fiscal 1992, primarily as a result of reduced dividends received on participating pension annuity contracts, and lower gains on securities sold as a result of a smaller investment portfolio.        Equity in Earnings of Affiliates - Equity in earnings of affiliates improved $3.9 million in Fiscal 1993, primarily due to better performance of Rexnord in Fiscal 1993 compared to Fiscal 1992, partially offset by lower earnings of Banner.       Minority Interest - Minority interest increased in Fiscal 1993 since it included dividend expense on the Series C Preferred Stock issued by FII early in Fiscal 1993.       Income Taxes - For Fiscal 1993, the Company recorded an income tax benefit.  This benefit represents the realizable portion of the tax effect of the current years operating loss net of foreign and state tax provisions.  The benefit tax rate was lower than the statutory rate, largely due to permanent differences between financial reporting and tax accounting, the majority of which resulted from the acquisition of FII by the Company in 1989.  The most significant differences were depreciation related to the write-up to fair value of property, plant and equipment and amortization of goodwill, neither of which is deductible for tax purposes.  In addition, the benefit also included a change in tax accruals of $4 million no longer required.        Extraordinary Items - Net - Extraordinary items - net in Fiscal 1993 includes an extraordinary charge of $11.8 million net of tax which was the Company's share of the Rexnord extraordinary charge related to premiums paid to repurchase debt and the write off of deferred loan costs, plus $.8 million for the write off of deferred loan costs at FII related to the portion of the term loan repaid.  In Fiscal 1992, after-tax gains were recognized on the early extinguishment of RHI's Senior Subordinated Debentures.       Net Earnings (Loss) - The $33.3 million increase in the Fiscal 1993 net loss compared to Fiscal 1992 was primarily due to the $21.8 million decline in operating income, the $6.8 million drop in investment income, and the $12.9 million increase in the extraordinary charges.  However, reducing this loss was an additional tax benefit of $4.3 million with no impact from discontinued operations in Fiscal 1993 compared to $3.0 million from discontinued operations in Fiscal 1992.  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Working capital at June 30, 1994 was $145.8 million which was $78 million higher than at June 30, 1993.  Cash increased $32.3 million resulting from the sale of shares of Rexnord, and current debt decreased by $51.8 million.  Offsetting this increase was an increase in the income tax payable account reflecting taxes recorded on the sale of shares of Rexnord.  An increase in accounts receivable of $9.8 million was substantially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, which was largely due to the acquisition of Convac in June 1994.       The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and borrowings under the Credit Agreement.  As a result of certain amendments to its Credit Agreement, and the issuance of FII's Senior Secured Notes due 1999, $50 million of VSI's revolving credit facility has been extended from 1994 to 1997.       The Company also expects to generate cash from the sale of certain assets and liquidation of investments.  Net assets held for sale at June 30, 1994 had a book value of $36.4 million and included several parcels of real estate in California and an 88 acre parcel of real estate located in Farmingdale, New York, which the Company plans to sell,lease or develop, subject to the resolution of environmental matters and market conditions.  Included in long-term investments at June 30, 1994 is a contractual obligation for the Company to receive $12.9 million from an individual which has a net carrying amount of $9.3 million.  The obligation in part, may be satisfied by 7.1% of the outstanding common stock of Bidermann Industries USA, Inc., a closely held company, held by the Company.  In addition, the Company has attached substantially all of the individual's property.  The individual filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code on July 7, 1993.  However, subsequent to the 1994 fiscal year end, on a motion by the Company, the Bankruptcy Court dismissed the Chapter 11 proceedings.  The Company believes that liquidation of assets held or attached by the Company will be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of this investment.  (See Note 19 to the Financial Statements).       The Company's principal cash requirements include debt service, capital expenditures, acquisitions, payment of other liabilities and payment of dividends on preferred stock.       The level of the Company's capital expenditures varies from year to year, depending upon the timing of capital spending for new production equipment, periodic plant and facility expansion, acquisition of building telecommunication assets, as well as cost reduction and labor efficiency programs.  For Fiscal 1994, capital expenditures including the cost of acquisitions were $18.2 million.  Capital expenditures for Fiscal 1993 and Fiscal 1992 were $22.9 million and $35.9 million, respectively.  The Company anticipates that capital expenditures in Fiscal 1995 will approximate $19.6 million.       During Fiscal 1994, goodwill was reduced by $7.0 million as a result of the restructuring charge which included a write down of goodwill related to certain aerospace fasteners product lines which are in the process of being discontinued.       Investments and advances - affiliated companies decreased $58.4 million, primarily due to the sale of the Company's stock interest in Rexnord, combined with accounting changes and restructuring charges recorded by Rexnord during the first half of Fiscal 1994 and charges for discontinued operations recorded at Banner in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 1994.       Long term debt decreased $44.1 million during Fiscal 1994 as a result of the Company repurchasing some of its senior debt.       Other liabilities that require the use of cash include post-employment benefits for retirees, environmental investigation and remediation obligations, litigation settlements and related costs.       The Company expects that cash generated from operations, borrowings, asset sales and the ability to refinance portions of its debt will be adequate to satisfy cash requirements.       The Company's Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants including, achieving cumulative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, ("EBITDA Covenant"), and maintaining certain coverage ratios.  The Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreement as of the end of Fiscal 1994.  The Company has negotiated an amendment to the Credit Agreement (i) to accommodate the unusual loss from the January 17, 1994 Southern California earthquake, and (ii) to reduce by $5.0 million the Company's minimum requirement under the EBITDA Covenant for the duration of the Credit Agreement.  To comply with the minimum EBITDA Covenant requirements (as amended), the Company's subsidiary, VSI, must earn for the cumulative total of the trailing four quarters, EBITDA as follows:  $68.6 million for the first quarter of Fiscal 1995, $70.4 million for the second quarter of Fiscal 1995, $72.1 million for the third quarter of Fiscal 1995, and $75.0 millon for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 1995.  VSI's ability to meet the minimum requirement under the EBITDA covenant in Fiscal 1995 is uncertain, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able in the future to comply with the minimum requirements under the EBITDA Covenant and other financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.  Noncompliance with any of the financial covenants, without cure, or waiver would constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement.  An event of default resulting from a breach of a financial covenant may result, at the option of lenders holding a majority of the loans, in acceleration of the principal and interest outstanding, and termination of the revolving credit line.  If necessary, management believes a waiver can be obtained.       FII may transfer available cash as dividends to RHI if the purpose of such dividends is to provide the Company with funds necessary to meet its debt service requirements under specified notes and debentures.  All other dividends to RHI are subject to certain limitations under the Credit Agreement.  As of June 30, 1994, FII was unable to provide dividends to RHI.  The Credit Agreement also restricts all additional borrowings under the Credit Facilities for the payment of any dividends.   IMPACT OF FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES   Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan - ------------------------------------------------       On July 1, 1994 the Company implemented SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" ("SFAS No. 114").  SFAS No. 114 is a change in accounting principle that requires the Company, as a creditor, to evaluate for impairment (i) the collectibility of the contractual principal and interest of accounts receivable and notes receivable with terms longer than one year, and (ii) all loans restructured in a troubled debt restructuring.  Accordingly, any loan impairment shall be recognized in the financial statements.  The effect of implementing SFAS No. 114, by the Company, was not material.
