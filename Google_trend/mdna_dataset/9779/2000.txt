ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND          FINANCIAL CONDITION    The Fairchild Corporation was incorporated in October 1969, under the laws of the State of Delaware, under the name of Banner Industries, Inc.  On November 15, 1990, we changed our name from Banner Industries, Inc. to The Fairchild Corporation.  We are the owner of 100% of RHI Holdings, Inc. and Banner Aerospace, Inc. RHI is the owner of 100% of Fairchild Holding Corp.  Our principal operations are conducted through FHC and Banner Aerospace. During the periods presented, we held significant equity interests in Nacanco Paketleme and Shared Technologies Fairchild Inc.    The following discussion and analysis provide information which management believes is relevant to the assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  GENERAL    We are a leading worldwide aerospace and industrial fastener manufacturer and distribution supply chain services manager and, through Banner Aerospace, an international supplier to airlines and general aviation businesses, distributing a wide range of aircraft parts and related support services. Through internal growth and strategic acquisitions, we have become one of the leading suppliers of fasteners to aircraft OEMs, such as Boeing, European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, General Electric, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman.    Our aerospace business consists of two segments: aerospace fasteners and aerospace distribution. The aerospace fasteners segment manufactures and markets high performance fastening systems used in the manufacture and maintenance of commercial and military aircraft. The aerospace distribution segment stocks and distributes a wide variety of aircraft parts to commercial airlines and air cargo carriers, fixed-base operators, corporate aircraft operators and other aerospace companies.

We do not intend to update these forward-looking statements in this Annual Report, even if new information, future events or other circumstances have made them incorrect or misleading.                                         14   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Business Transactions    The following summarizes certain business combinations and transactions we completed which significantly affect the comparability of the period to period results presented in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.   Fiscal 2000 Transactions    On July 29, 1999, we sold our 31.9% interest in Nacanco Paketleme to American National Can Group, Inc. for approximately $48.2 million. In fiscal 2000, we recognized a $25.7 million nonrecurring gain from this divestiture. We also agreed to provide consulting services over a three-year period, at an annual fee of approximately $1.5 million. We used the net proceeds from the disposition to reduce our indebtedness.    On September 3, 1999, we completed the disposal of our Camloc Gas Springs division to a subsidiary of Arvin Industries Inc. for approximately $2.7 million. In addition, we received $2.4 million from Arvin Industries for a covenant not to compete. We recognized a $2.0 million nonrecurring gain from this disposition.    On December 1, 1999, we disposed of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of our Dallas Aerospace subsidiary to United Technologies Inc. for approximately $57.0 million. No gain or loss was recognized from this transaction, as the proceeds received approximated the net carrying value of these assets. Approximately $37.0 million of the proceeds from this disposition were used to reduce our term indebtedness.    On April 13, 2000, we completed a spin-off to our stockholders of the shares of Fairchild (Bermuda) Ltd.  On April 14, 2000, Fairchild (Bermuda) sold to Convac Technologies Ltd. the Optical Disc Equipment Group business formerly owned by Fairchild Technologies. Subsequently, on April 14, 2000, Fairchild (Bermuda), renamed Global Sources Ltd., completed an exchange of approximately 95% of its shares for 100% of the shares of Trade Media Holdings Limited, an Asian based, business-to-business online and traditional marketplace services provider. Immediately after the share exchange, our stockholders owned 1,183,081 shares of the 26,152,308 issued shares of Global Sources. Global Sources shares are listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol "GSOL".   Fiscal 1999 Transactions    On December 31, 1998, Banner consummated the sale of Solair, Inc., its largest subsidiary in the rotables group of the aerospace distribution segment, to Kellstrom Industries, Inc., in exchange for approximately $60.4 million in cash and a warrant to purchase 300,000 shares of common stock of Kellstrom. In December 1998, Banner recorded a $19.3 million pre-tax loss from the sale of Solair. This loss was included in cost of goods sold as it was primarily attributable to the bulk sale of inventory at prices below the carrying amount of inventory.    On February 22, 1999, we used available cash to acquire 77.3% of SNEP S.A.  By June 30, 1999, we had purchased significantly all of the remaining shares of SNEP. The total amount paid was approximately $8.0 million, including $1.1 million of debt assumed, in a business combination accounted for as a purchase. The total cost of the acquisition exceeded the fair value of the net assets of SNEP by approximately $4.3 million, which is being allocated as goodwill, and amortized using the straight-line method over 40 years.  SNEP is a French manufacturer of precision machined self-locking nuts and special threaded fasteners serving the European industrial, aerospace and automotive markets.    On April 8, 1999, we acquired the remaining 15% of the outstanding common and preferred stock of Banner Aerospace, Inc. not already owned by us, through the merger of Banner with one of our subsidiaries. Under the terms of the merger with Banner, we issued 2,981,412 shares of our Class A common stock to acquire all of Banner's common and preferred stock (other than those already owned by us). Banner is now our wholly-owned subsidiary.                                         15     On April 20, 1999, we completed the acquisition of all the capital stock of Kaynar Technologies Inc. for approximately $222 million and assumed approximately $103 million of existing debt, the majority of which was refinanced at closing. In addition, we paid $28 million for a covenant not to compete from Kaynar Technologies' largest preferred shareholder. The total cost of the acquisition exceeded the fair value of the net assets of Kaynar Technologies by approximately $282 million, which is being allocated as goodwill, and amortized using the straight-line method over 40 years. The acquisition was financed with existing cash, the sale of $225 million of 10 3/4% senior subordinated notes due 2009 and proceeds from a new bank credit facility.    On June 18, 1999, we completed the acquisition of Technico S.A. for approximately $4.1 million and assumed approximately $2.2 million of Technico's existing debt. The total cost of the acquisition exceeded the fair value of the net assets of Technico by approximately $3.4 million, which is being allocated as goodwill, and amortized using the straight-line method over 40 years. The acquisition was financed with additional borrowings from our credit facility.   Fiscal 1998 Transactions  On November 28, 1997, we acquired AS+C GmbH, Aviation Supply + Consulting in a business combination accounted for as a purchase. The total cost of the acquisition was $14.0 million, which exceeded the fair value of the net assets of AS+C by approximately $8.1 million, which is allocated as goodwill and amortized using the straight-line method over 40 years. We purchased AS+C with cash borrowings. AS+C is an aerospace parts, logistics, and distribution company primarily servicing the European OEM market.    On December 19, 1997, we completed a secondary offering of public securities. The offering consisted of an issuance of 3,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock at $20.00 per share, which generated $57 million of net proceeds. On December 19, 1997, immediately following the Offering, we restructured our FHC and RHI credit agreements by entering into a new six-and-a-half-year credit facility to provide us with a $300 million senior secured credit facility consisting of (i) a $75 million revolving loan with a letter of credit sub- facility of $30 million and a $10 million swing loan sub-facility, and (ii) a $225 million term loan.    On January 13, 1998, Banner Aerospace completed the disposition of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of certain of its subsidiaries to two wholly-owned subsidiaries of AlliedSignal Inc. (now Honeywell International), in exchange for shares of AlliedSignal common stock with an aggregate value of $369 million. The assets transferred to AlliedSignal consisted primarily of Banner Aerospace's hardware group, which included the distribution of bearings, nuts, bolts, screws, rivets and other types of fasteners, and its PacAero unit. Approximately $196 million of the common stock received from AlliedSignal Inc. was used to repay outstanding term loans of Banner Aerospace's subsidiaries, and related fees.    On February 3, 1998, with the proceeds of the equity offering, term loan borrowings under the credit facility, and a portion of the after tax proceeds we received from the Shared Technologies Fairchild, we refinanced substantially all of our then existing indebtedness (other than indebtedness of Banner), consisting of (i) $63.0 million to redeem 11 7/8% Senior Debentures due 1999; (ii) $117.6 million to redeem 12% Intermediate Debentures due 2001; (iii) $35.9 million to redeem 13 1/8% Subordinated Debentures due 2006; (iv) $25.1 million to redeem 13% Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2007; and (vi) accrued interest of $10.6 million.    On March 2, 1998, we acquired Edwards and Lock Management Corporation, doing business as Special-T Fasteners, in a business combination accounted for as a purchase. The cost of the acquisition was approximately $50.0 million, of which 50.1% of the contractual purchase price was paid in shares of our Class A common stock and 49.9% was paid in cash. The total cost of the acquisition exceeded the fair value of the net assets of Special-T by approximately $23.3 million, which is being allocated as goodwill, and amortized using the straight-line method over 40 years.  Special-T manages the logistics of worldwide distribution of Company-manufactured precision fasteners to customers in the aerospace industry, government agencies, OEMs, and other distributors.    On March 11, 1998, Shared Technologies Fairchild Inc. merged into Intermedia Communications Inc. Under the terms of the merger, holders of Shared Technologies Fairchild common stock received $15.00 per share in cash. We received                                         16   approximately $178.0 million in cash (before tax and selling expenses) in exchange for the common and preferred stock of Shared Technologies Fairchild we owned. In fiscal 1998, we recorded a $96.0 million gain, net of tax, on disposal of discontinued operations, from the proceeds received from the merger of Shared Technologies Fairchild with Intermedia. The results of Shared Technologies Fairchild have been accounted for as discontinued operations.    On May 11, 1998, we commenced an offer to exchange, for each properly tendered share of common stock of Banner, a number of shares of our Class A common stock, par value $0.10 per share, equal to the quotient of $12.50 divided by $20.675 up to a maximum of 4,000,000 shares of Banner Aerospace's common stock. The exchange offer expired on June 9, 1998 and 3,659,364 shares of Banner Aerospace's common stock were validly tendered for exchange and we issued 2,212,361 shares Class A common stock to the tendering shareholders.   Consolidated Results    We currently report in two principal business segments: aerospace fasteners and aerospace distribution.  The results of the Gas Springs division are included in the Corporate and Other classification. The following table illustrates the historical sales and operating income of our operations for the past three years.

The following unaudited pro forma table illustrates sales and operating income of our operations by segment, on a pro forma basis, as if we had operated in a consistent manner for the past three years. The pro forma results represent the impact of our acquisition of Kaynar Technologies (completed in April 1999), our merger with Banner Aerospace (completed in April 1999), our acquisition of Special-T (effective January 1998), and our dispositions of Dallas Aerospace (December 1999), Solair (December 1998), the hardware group of Banner Aerospace (completed January 1998), and the investment in Nacanco Paketleme (July 1999) and Shared Technologies Fairchild (completed in March 1998), as if these transactions had occurred at the beginning of each period presented. The pro forma information is based on the historical financial statements of these companies, giving effect to the aforementioned transactions. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would actually have occurred if the transactions had been in effect since the beginning of each period, nor are they necessarily indicative of our future results.                                         17                                                                   For the years ended June 30,                                              ---------------------------------------------------------------                                                     2000                   1999                   1998                                              -----------------      -----------------      -----------------         Sales by Segment:    Aerospace Fasteners                                $533,620               $610,200               $630,538    Aerospace Distribution                               79,308                 70,196                 68,335    Corporate and Other                                     739                  6,264                  5,760                                              -----------------      -----------------      -----------------  Total Sales                                          $613,667               $686,660               $704,633                                              =================      =================      =================   Operating Income (Loss) by Segment:    Aerospace Fasteners                                $ 33,909               $ 54,427               $ 68,037    Aerospace Distribution                                5,680                 (1,611)                 3,355    Corporate and Other                                 (18,397)               (24,071)               (12,439)                                              -----------------      -----------------      -----------------  Total Operating Income (Loss) (a)                    $ 21,192               $ 28,745               $ 58,953                                              =================      =================      =================   (a)  Fiscal 2000 results include restructuring charges of $8,578 in the      aerospace fasteners segment.  Fiscal 1999 results include costs relating to      acquisitions of $23,604 and restructuring charges of $5,526 in the      aerospace fasteners segment, $348 in the aerospace distribution segment,      and $500 at corporate.    Net sales of $635.4 million in 2000 increased by $18.0 million, or 2.9%, compared to sales of $617.3 million in 1999. The improvement is attributable primarily to the additional revenues provided by the acquisition of Kaynar Technologies, offset partially by the dispositions of Solair and Dallas Aerospace. Net sales of $617.3 million in 1999 decreased by $123.9 million, or 16.7%, compared to sales of $741.2 million in 1998. The decrease is attributable primarily to the loss of revenues resulting from the disposition of our aerospace distribution segment's hardware group and Solair. On a pro forma basis, net sales decreased 10.6% and 2.6% in 2000 and 1999, respectively, as compared to the previous fiscal periods.    Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 25.7%, 18.2%, and 25.2% in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Included in cost of goods sold for 1999 was a charge of $41.5 million recognized in our aerospace distribution segment from the dispositions of Solair and Dallas Aerospace.  Of this charge, $19.3 million was attributable to Solair's bulk sale of inventory at prices below the carrying amount.  Excluding these charges, gross margin as a percentage of sales was 24.9% in fiscal 1999. The change in margins in 2000 and 1999 periods are attributable to a change in product mix as a result of the acquisitions and dispositions. Partially offsetting the overall lower margins in 1999 was an improvement in margins within our aerospace fasteners segment, resulting from acquisitions, efficiencies associated with production being integrated, and improved skills of the work force.    Selling, general & administrative expense as a percentage of sales was 21.0%, 24.2%, and 19.2%, in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.  Included in selling, general & administrative expense in fiscal 1999 were $23.6 million of one-time costs associated primarily with the acquisition of Kaynar Technologies. Excluding these costs, selling, general & administrative expense as a percentage of sales would have been 20.4% in 1999.    Other income increased $10.5 million in 2000 as compared to 1999, due primarily to $5.1 million of gains recognized on the disposition of real estate and $3.2 million in increased rental income received from new tenants occupying a shopping center we own and are developing in Farmingdale, New York. Other income decreased $2.6 million in 1999 as compared to 1998, due primarily to the fiscal 1998 condemnation of air rights over a portion of the property we own in Farmingdale, New York.    In fiscal 1999, we recorded $6.4 million of restructuring charges. Of this amount, $0.5 million was recorded at our corporate office for severance benefits and $0.3 million was recorded at our aerospace distribution segment for the write-                                         18   off of building improvements from premises vacated. The remainder, $5.5 million was recorded as a result of the costs incurred from the initial integration of Kaynar Technologies into our aerospace fasteners segment, i.e. for severance benefits ($3.9 million), for product integration costs incurred as of June 30, 1999 ($1.3 million), and for the write down of fixed assets ($0.3 million). In fiscal 2000, we recorded $8.6 million of restructuring charges as a result of the continued integration of Kaynar Technologies into our aerospace fasteners segment. All of the charges recorded were a direct result of product and plant integration costs incurred as of June 30, 2000. These costs were classified as restructuring and were the direct result of formal plans to move equipment, close plants and to terminate employees. Such costs are nonrecurring in nature. Other than a reduction in our existing cost structure, none of the restructuring charges resulted in future increases in earnings or represented an accrual of future costs. As of June 30, 2000, significantly all of our integration plans have been executed and our integration process is substantially complete.    Operating income of $23.2 million in fiscal 2000 increased $69.2 million, or 150.6%, compared to an operating loss of $45.9 million in fiscal 1999. We reported an operating loss of $45.9 million in fiscal 1999, which was a decrease from operating income of $45.4 million reported in fiscal 1998. Fiscal 1999 was affected by $71.4 million of expenses recognized for inventory impairment, restructuring costs and other costs related to acquisitions. Fiscal 2000 results also improved because of $5.1 million of gains recognized on the sale of real estate, and $3.2 million in increased rental income received from new tenants occupying a shopping center we own and are developing in Farmingdale, New York.    Net interest expense increased by 45.3% in fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999, as a result of the additional debt we incurred to finance the acquisition of Kaynar Technologies. Net interest expense decreased 29.0% in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998. The improvement in fiscal 1999 was due to a series of transactions occurring in fiscal 1998 that significantly reduced our total debt.    Investment income (loss), net, was $9.9 million, $39.8 million, and $(3.4) million in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Investment income in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, respectively, was due primarily to recognizing realized gains on investments liquidated. We recognized a large gain in 1999 from the liquidation of our position in AlliedSignal to raise funds to acquire Kaynar Technologies.    Nonrecurring income of $28.6 million in fiscal 2000 resulted from a $25.7 million, $2.0 million, and $0.9 million gains recognized on the disposition of our equity investment in Nacanco Paketleme, our Camloc Gas Springs division and a smaller equity investment, respectively. Nonrecurring income of $124.0 million in 1998 resulted from the disposition of Banner Aerospace's hardware group.    We recorded an income tax benefit of $4.4 million in fiscal 2000 on earnings from continuing operations of $17.7 million. A tax benefit was recorded due primarily to a change in the estimate of required tax accruals. We recorded an income tax benefit of $13.2 million in fiscal 1999 representing a 36.3% effective tax rate on pre-tax losses from continuing operations. The tax benefit approximates the statutory rate. The income tax provision of $47.3 million reported in fiscal 1998 represents a 38.3% effective tax rate on pre-tax earnings from continuing operations of $123.4 million. The tax provision was slightly higher than the statutory rate because of goodwill associated with the disposition of Banner Aerospace's hardware group, which is not deductible for tax purposes.    Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $2.1 million in 2000, compared to 1999, and $0.8 million in 1999, compared to 1998. In July 1999, we divested our 31.9% interest in Nacanco and this reduced our equity earnings in fiscal 2000. The decrease in 1999 was attributable primarily to losses recorded by small start-up ventures.    Included in earnings (loss) from discontinued operations are the results of Fairchild Technologies through January 1998, and our equity in earnings of Shared Technologies Fairchild prior to the merger of Shared Technologies Fairchild. (See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).    In 1998, we recorded a $96.0 million gain, net of tax, on disposal of discontinued operations, from the proceeds received from the merger of Shared Technologies Fairchild. This gain was partially offset in connection with the adoption of a formal plan to enhance the opportunities for disposition of Fairchild Technologies. In connection with the adoption of                                         19   such plan, we recorded an after-tax charge of $12.0 million, $31.3 million and $36.2 million in discontinued operations in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Included in the fiscal 1998 charge, was $28.2 million, net of an income tax benefit of $11.8 million, for the net losses of Fairchild Technologies through June 30, 1998, and $8.0 million, net of an income tax benefit of $4.8 million, for the estimated remaining operating losses of Fairchild Technologies. The fiscal 1999 after-tax operating loss from Fairchild Technologies exceeded the June 1998 estimate recorded for expected losses by $28.6 million, net of an income tax benefit of $8.1 million, through June 1999. An additional after-tax charge of $2.8 million, net of an income tax benefit of $2.4 million, was recorded in fiscal 1999, for estimated remaining losses in connection with the disposition of Fairchild Technologies. The fiscal 2000 after-tax loss in connection with the disposition of the remaining operations of Fairchild Technologies exceeded anticipated losses by $20.0 million, net of an income tax benefit of $8.0 million.    In fiscal 1999, we recognized an extraordinary loss of $4.2 million, net of tax, to write-off the remaining deferred loan fees associated with the early extinguishment of our indebtedness pursuant to our acquisition of Kaynar Technologies (See Note 8). In fiscal 1998, we recognized an extraordinary loss of $6.7 million, net of tax, to write-off the remaining deferred loan fees and original issue discounts associated with early extinguishment of our indebtedness pursuant the repayment of all our public debt and refinancing of credit facilities.    Comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized holding changes in the fair market value of available-for-sale investment securities. The fair market value of unrealized holding securities declined by $4.0 million and $16.5 million in fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively. The changes reflect primarily gains realized from the liquidation of investments, including AlliedSignal common stock divested in fiscal 1999. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased by $10.1 million and $2.5 million in fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the French Franc and German Mark.   Segment Results   Aerospace Fasteners Segment    Sales by our aerospace fasteners segment increased by $90.9 million to $533.6 million, up 20.5% in fiscal 2000, compared to fiscal 1999. These improvements reflected growth from acquisitions, offset partially by weakened demand for our products in the commercial aerospace industry. On June 30, 2000, our backlog was $204 million compared to $220 million at June 30, 1999. On a pro forma basis, sales decreased by 12.5% in fiscal 2000, as compared to fiscal 1999. Our operations in the United States were negatively impacted by reduced bookings caused by inventory reduction efforts at Boeing and its ripple effect on prices. Sales in the aerospace fasteners segment increased by $55.5 million to $442.7 million, up 14.3% in fiscal 1999, compared to fiscal 1998, reflecting growth due primarily to the acquisition of Kaynar Technologies. Backlog increased by $38 million in fiscal 1999 to $220 million at June 30, 1999, reflecting the acquisition of Kaynar Technologies. Excluding $90 million of backlog contributed by Kaynar Technologies, our backlog decreased $52 million in fiscal 1999. On a pro forma basis reflecting acquisitions in comparable periods, sales decreased 3.2% in fiscal 1999, compared to fiscal 1998.    Operating income in our aerospace fasteners segment decreased by $5.0 million in fiscal 2000, compared to fiscal 1999. Included in our fiscal 2000 and 1999 results are restructuring charges incurred of $8.6 million and $5.5 million, respectively, due to the integration of Kaynar Technologies into our Aerospace Fasteners business. Excluding restructuring charges, operating income decreased by $2.0 million in fiscal 2000, compared to fiscal 1999, reflecting reduced margins due to pricing pressures offset partially by cost improvement initiatives and acquisitions made during fiscal 1999. Operating expenses at all operations are being strictly controlled as management attempts to reduce operating costs to improve operating results in the short term, without adversely affecting our future performance. Operating income increased by $6.2 million, or 19.1%, in fiscal 1999, compared to fiscal 1998.  Included in our 1999 results are restructuring charges of $5.5 million for integration costs and severance from the integration of our business with the Kaynar Technologies business. Excluding restructuring charges, operating income increased $11.8 million in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998. On a pro forma basis and excluding restructuring charges, operating income decreased by $17.5                                         20   million in fiscal 2000, compared to fiscal 1999, and $8.1 million in fiscal 1999 as compared to fiscal 1998, due to lower sales levels associated with a weakened commercial aerospace industry and its negative effects on operating effectiveness.    We believe the overall demand for aerospace fasteners in fiscal 2001 will improve as the results of Boeing's inventory reduction program diminishes and the announced increase in aircraft build rates favorably affect demand. We believe that the integration savings from the Kaynar merger and production efficiency improvements will partially offset the weakened demand for our products.   Aerospace Distribution Segment    Sales in our aerospace distribution segment decreased by $67.3 million, or 40.0%, in fiscal 2000, compared to the fiscal 1999 period. The decrease was due to the loss of revenues as a result of the disposition of Solair and Dallas Aerospace. Sales decreased by $190.1 million, or 53.0%, in fiscal 1999, compared to the fiscal 1998 period, due primarily to the loss of revenues as a result of the disposition of the hardware group and Solair. On a pro forma basis, sales increased $9.1 million, or 13.0%, in 2000 compared to 1999, and $1.9 million, or 2.7%, in 1999 compared to 1998.    Operating income in our aerospace distribution segment increased by $47.8 million in fiscal 2000, compared to fiscal 1999. Included in the fiscal 1999 period, was a charge of $19.3 million due to the sale of Solair and a $22.1 million charge relating to the potential sale of Dallas Aerospace. Operating income decreased by $60.3 million, in fiscal 1999, as compared to fiscal 1998. A charge of $41.4 million is included in the 1999 results, in connection with the disposition of Solair and the potential disposition of Dallas Aerospace. Excluding these charges, operating income would have decreased $18.9 million in fiscal 1999, compared to fiscal 1998, due primarily to the disposition of Solair and the hardware group. On a pro forma basis, operating income increased by $7.3 million in fiscal 2000, compared to fiscal 1999, reflecting increases in margins and a reduction in corporate overhead.   Corporate and Other    The Corporate and Other segment includes the Gas Springs division prior to its disposition and corporate activities. The group reported an improvement of $26.4 million, or 58.9%, reducing operating losses from $44.9 million in fiscal 1999 to $18.4 million in fiscal 2000. An operating loss of $44.9 million in fiscal 1999 was $37.3 million higher than the operating loss of $7.6 million reported in fiscal 1998. Results from fiscal 2000 included $5.1 million of gains recognized on the disposition of real estate and $3.2 million in increased rental income received from new tenants occupying a shopping center we own and are developing in Farmingdale, New York. Results from fiscal 1999 included $23.6 million of one-time costs associated primarily with the acquisition of Kaynar Technologies, restructuring charges, and increased environmental, legal and travel expenses. Results from fiscal 1998 included other income of $8.6 million, including $4.4 million realized as a result of the condemnation of air rights over a portion of the property we own and are developing in Farmingdale, New York.  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    Total capitalization as of June 30, 2000 and 1999 amounted to $884.4 million and $931.6 million, respectively. The changes in capitalization included a decrease of $41.8 million in debt and a decrease of $5.4 million in equity. The decrease in debt reflected a $81.3 million decrease in term loan borrowing with our primary lenders, as a result of the proceeds received from the divestiture of assets, offset partially by $30.8 million of cash borrowed from a new term loan facility used to support our operations and finance construction costs to complete a shopping center being developed in Farmingdale, New York. The decrease in equity was due primarily to a $14.1 million decrease in cumulative other comprehensive income, offset partially by reported net income of $9.8 million.    We maintain a portfolio of investments classified primarily as available-for- sale securities, which had a fair market value of $19.1 million at June 30, 2000. The market value of the investment portfolio decreased by $4.0 million in 2000 as a result of realized gains from the divestiture of securities. While there is risk associated with market fluctuations inherent in stock investments, and because our portfolio is not diversified, large swings in its value should be expected.                                         21     We have an 88-acre site in Farmingdale, New York, which we are developing and operating as a shopping center. We have invested (cash and capitalized interest) approximately $28.8 million, $40.4 million, and $17.3 million into this project in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. We estimate additional funding of approximately $5.0 million is needed to complete the current phases of this project.    Net cash used for operating activities for fiscal 2000 was $67.1 million. The primary use of cash for operating activities in fiscal 2000 was a $23.2 million increase in inventories, a $12.0 million decrease in accounts payable, and a $25.7 million increase in other current assets.  Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 1999 was $23.3 million. The primary source of cash for operating activities in fiscal 1999 was an increase in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities of $45.9 million, partially offset by our net loss and non-cash adjustments of $16.8 million. Net cash used for operating activities for fiscal 1998 was $85.2 million. The primary use of cash for operating activities in fiscal 1998 was a $54.9 million increase in inventories.    Net cash provided from investing activities for fiscal 2000 was $90.4 million and included $108.8 million in proceeds received from the dispositions of Dallas Aerospace, our Gas Springs division and our investment in Nacanco Paketleme, and $12.0 million proceeds received from the condemnation of property. This was slightly offset by cash used for capital expenditures and real estate investments of $27.3 million and $27.7 million, respectively. Net cash used for investing activities for fiscal 1999 was $99.2 million and included $274.4 million used for acquisitions, partially offset by $189.4 million received from the liquidation of investments. Net cash provided from investing activities for fiscal 1998 was $43.6 million and included proceeds of $168.0 million received from the disposition of discontinued operations, including Shared Technologies Fairchild. This was offset slightly by cash used for the acquisition of subsidiaries and minority interests of $32.8 million and $26.4 million, respectively.    Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2000 was $41.4 million, The primary use of cash for financing activities in fiscal 2000 was $39.4 million used to reduce debt. Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998 was $81.2 million and $74.1 million, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 1999 included the issuance of additional debt of $483.2 million offset partially by $380.0 million of debt repayments and $22.1 million of treasury stock purchased. We increased our debt in fiscal 1999, as a result of the acquisition of Kaynar Technologies. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 1998 included the issuance of $53.8 million of stock from our 1998 equity offering and $275.5 million from the issuance of additional debt partially offset by $258.0 million from the repayment of debt and the repurchase of debentures.    Our principal cash requirements include debt service, capital expenditures, acquisitions, real estate development, and payment of other liabilities. Other liabilities that require the use of cash include postretirement benefits, environmental investigation and remediation obligations, and litigation settlements and related costs.  We expect that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, cash from borrowings and additional financing and asset sales will be adequate to satisfy our cash requirements in fiscal 2001.    We are required under the credit agreement to comply with certain financial and non-financial loan covenants, including maintaining certain interest and fixed charge coverage ratios and maintaining certain indebtedness to EBITDA ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter. Additionally, the credit agreement restricts annual capital expenditures to $40 million during the life of the facility. Except for non-guarantor assets, substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral under the credit agreement. The credit agreement restricts the payment of dividends to our shareholders to an aggregate of the lesser of $0.01 per share or $0.4 million over the life of the agreement. Noncompliance with any of the financial covenants without cure or waiver would constitute an event of default under the credit agreement. An event of default resulting from a breach of a financial covenant can result, at the option of lenders holding a majority of the loans, in an acceleration of the principal and interest outstanding, and a termination of the revolving credit line. At June 30, 2000, we were in full compliance with all the covenants under the credit agreement.                                         22    Discontinued Operations    In 1998, we adopted a formal plan to dispose of Fairchild Technologies. Based on this plan, we have sold the Fairchild Technologies' businesses, including most of its intellectual property, through a series of transactions.  On April 14, 1999, we disposed of Fairchild Technologies photoresist deep-ultraviolet track equipment machines, spare parts and testing equipment to Apex Co., Ltd. in exchange for 1,250,000 shares of Apex stock valued at approximately $5.1 million.  On June 15, 1999, we received from Suess Microtec AG $7.9 million and the right to receive 350,000 shares of Suess Microtec stock, or at least approximately $3.5 million, by September 2000 in exchange for certain inventory, fixed assets, and intellectual property of Fairchild Technologies' semiconductor equipment group.  On May 1, 1999, we sold Fairchild CDI for a nominal amount. In July 1999, we received approximately $7.1 million from Novellus Systems, Inc. in exchange for Fairchild Technologies' Low-K dielectric product line and certain intellectual property. On April 13, 2000, we completed the disposition of Fairchild Technologies' optical disc equipment group by a spinoff of Fairchild (Bermuda), Ltd. to our shareholders.  Year 2000    We did not experience any material problems as a result of the Year 2000 turnover or in connection with the leap year date of February 29, 2000.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS 133 establishes a new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and supersedes and amends a number of existing accounting standards.  It requires that all derivatives be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value.  The corresponding derivative gains or losses are reported based on the hedge relationship that exists, if any. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges or that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria in SFAS 133, are required to be reported in earnings.  Most of the general qualifying criteria for hedge accounting under SFAS 133 were derived from, and are similar to, the existing qualifying criteria in SFAS 80 "Accounting for Futures Contracts." SFAS 133 describes three primary types of hedge relationships: fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, and foreign currency hedge. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 137 to defer the required effective date of implementing SFAS 133 from fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999 to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. We adopted SFAS 133 on July 1, 2001 and recognize a cumulative pre-tax loss of approximately $0.8 million.                                         23   ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK    The table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, which include interest rate swaps. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates.
