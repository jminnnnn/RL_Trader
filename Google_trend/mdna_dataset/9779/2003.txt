ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND  FINANCIAL CONDITION   The Fairchild Corporation was incorporated in October 1969, under the laws of the State of Delaware. Banner Aerospace Holding Company I, Inc. is a 100% owned subsidiary. Fairchild Holding Corp. is our indirect 100% owned subsidiary. Fairchild Holding Corp. is the owner of Fairchild Aerostructures, Inc., and the indirect owner of 100% of Warthog Inc. Our principal operations are conducted through Banner Aerospace Holding Company I, Fairchild Aerostructures, and Warthog. Our consolidated financial statements present the results of our former fastener business, and APS, a small subsidiary being sold, as discontinued operations.   The following discussion and analysis provide information which management believes is relevant to the assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.   GENERAL   Our business consists of three segments: aerospace distribution, aerospace manufacturing, and real estate operations. Our aerospace distribution segment stocks and distributes a wide variety of aircraft parts to commercial airlines and air cargo carriers, fixed-base operators, corporate aircraft operators and other aerospace companies worldwide. Our aerospace manufacturing segment primarily manufactures airframe components. Our real estate operations segment owns and leases a shopping center located in Farmingdale, New York, and owns and rents two improved parcels located in Southern California.   On December 3, 2002, we completed the sale of our fastener business to Alcoa Inc. for approximately $657 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. The cash received from Alcoa is subject to a post-closing adjustment based upon the net working capital of the fastener business on December 3, 2002, compared with its net working capital as of March 31, 2002 (See Item 8, Note 16, for further discussion). We may also receive additional cash proceeds up to $12.5 million per year over the four-year period from 2003 to 2006, if the number of commercial aircraft delivered by Boeing and Airbus exceeds specified annual levels.   We are continuing to investigate how best to redeploy our cash in opportunities which will enable us to build for the long term. Accordingly, we are actively pursuing worldwide acquisition opportunities in diverse business segments.   CAUTIONARY STATEMENT   Certain statements in this financial discussion and analysis by management contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to our financial condition, results of operation and business. These statements relate to analyses and other information, which are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements also relate to our future prospects, developments and business strategies. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as "anticipate," "believe," "could," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "predict," "project," "will" and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including current trend information, projections for deliveries, backlog and other trend estimates that may cause our actual future activities   and results of operations to be materially different from those suggested or described in this financial discussion and analysis by management. These risks include: our ability to find, acquire and successfully operate one or more new businesses; product demand; our dependence on the aerospace industry; customer satisfaction and quality issues; labor disputes; competition; our ability to achieve and execute internal business plans; worldwide political instability and economic growth; military conflicts; reduced airline revenues as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, and their aftermath; reduced airline revenues due to SARS; and the impact of any economic downturns and inflation.   If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materializes, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those expected, estimated or projected. Given these uncertainties, users of the information included in this financial discussion and analysis by management, including investors and prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update the forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report, even if new information, future events or other circumstances have made them incorrect or misleading.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   On December 12, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Release No. 33-8040, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies." Critical accounting policies are those that involve subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates. In response to Release No. 33-8040, we reviewed our accounting policies. The following areas require the use of judgments and estimates: the valuation of long-lived assets, impairment of goodwill, pension and postretirement benefits, income taxes, environmental and litigation accruals and revenue recognition. Estimates in each of these areas are based on historical experience and a variety of assumptions that we believe are appropriate. Actual results may differ from these estimates.   Valuation of Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets for impairment, including property, plant and equipment, and identifiable intangibles with definite lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. To determine recoverability of our long-lived assets, we evaluate the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be greater than the carrying amount of our assets. Impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount of our assets and their estimated fair value.   Impairment of Goodwill: On July 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Since the adoption of SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life are not amortized. Instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist. All of our goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite life and as a result of adopting SFAS No. 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill.   Pension and Postretirement Benefits: We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our employees. Our funding policy is to make the minimum annual contribution required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or local statutory law. The accumulated benefit obligation for pensions and postretirement benefits was determined using a discount rate of 6.0% at June 30, 2003 and 7.125% at June 30, 2002 and a return on plan assets of 8.5% at June 30, 2003 and 9.0% at June 30, 2002. The effect of such change resulted in an increase to the accumulated benefit obligation in 2003. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. For measurement purposes in 2003, we assumed a 10.0% annual rate of increase in the cost per capita of claims covered under health care benefits. Beginning in 2004, the trend rate is assumed to decrease each year by 0.5% to a rate of 5% in 2013 and remain at that level thereafter.  Deferred and Noncurrent Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.   Environmental Matters: Our current and prior operations are subject to stringent government imposed environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of materials into the environment and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. To date, such laws and regulations have not had a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or net cash flows, although we have expended, and can be expected to expend in the future, significant amounts for the investigation of environmental conditions and installation of environmental control facilities, remediation of environmental conditions and other similar matters.   In connection with our plans to dispose of certain real estate, we must investigate environmental conditions and we may be required to take certain corrective action prior or pursuant to any such disposition. In addition, we have identified several areas of potential contamination related to other facilities owned, or previously owned, by us, that may require us either to take corrective action or to contribute to a clean-up. We are also a defendant in several lawsuits and proceedings seeking to require us to pay for investigation or remediation of environmental matters, and we have been alleged to be a potentially responsible party at various "superfund" sites. We believe that we have recorded adequate accruals in our consolidated financial statements to complete such investigation and take any necessary corrective actions or make any necessary contributions. No amounts have been recorded as due from third parties, including insurers, or set off against, any environmental liability, unless   such parties are contractually obligated to contribute and are not disputing such liability.   Legal Matters: We are involved in various other claims and lawsuits incidental to our business. We, either on our own or through our insurance carriers, are contesting these matters. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future results of operations, or net cash flows.   Revenue Recognition: Sales and related costs are recognized upon shipment of products and/or performance of services, when collection is probable. Sales and related cost of sales on long-term contracts are recognized as products are delivered and services performed, as determined by the percentage of completion method. Lease and rental revenue are recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Shipping and handling amounts billed to customers are classified as revenues.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The following summarizes certain business combinations and transactions we completed which significantly affect the comparability of the period to period results presented in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.   Business Transactions   On December 3, 2002, we completed the sale of our fastener business to Alcoa Inc. for approximately $657 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. The cash received from Alcoa is subject to a post-closing adjustment based upon the net working capital of the fastener business on December 3, 2002, compared with its net working capital as of March 31, 2002 (See Item 8, Note 16, for further discussion). We may also receive additional cash proceeds up to $12.5 million per year over the four-year period from 2003 to 2006, if the number of commercial aircraft delivered by Boeing and Airbus exceeds specified annual levels.   In connection with the sale, we have deposited with an escrow agent $25 million to secure indemnification obligations we may have to Alcoa. The escrow period is five years, but funds may be held longer if claims are asserted and unresolved. In addition, for a period of five years after the closing, we are required to maintain our corporate existence, take no action to cause our own liquidation or dissolution, and take no action to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock.   The sale of the fastener business has reduced our dependence upon the aerospace industry. Additionally, the sale has allowed us to eliminate substantially all of our debt. We used a portion of the proceeds from the sale to repay our bank debt and to acquire by tender all of our outstanding $225 million 10.75% senior subordinated notes due in April 2009, leaving us with $6.7 million of debt outstanding on June 30, 2003. We plan to use the remaining proceeds from the sale to fund acquisitions.   Recent Developments   In February 2003, our Board of Directors adopted a formal plan for the sale of APS, a small operation in our aerospace manufacturing segment, which has been unprofitable. Based on our formal plan, APS is available for sale immediately, and we believe that it is probable that we can consummate a sale of APS by December 2003. Accordingly, the results of APS are being reported as a discontinued operation.   The results of the fastener business and APS are recorded as earnings from discontinued operations, the components of which are as follows:       (In thousands)   2003     2002     2001    Earnings from discontinued operations before taxes   $ 3,013      $ 46,935      $ 36,344     Income tax provision    95     (865)     (12,007)    Net earnings from discontinued operations   $ 3,108      $ 46,070      $ 24,337    Consolidated Results   We currently report in three principal business segments: aerospace distribution, aerospace manufacturing and real estate operations. The results of C-Line Automation, Ltd., a small start-up operation acquired in March 2003, is included in the Corporate and Other classification. The following table provides the historical sales and operating income of our operations for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001.               (In thousands)            2003   2002   2001    Revenues by Segment:          Aerospace Distribution Segment    $ 59,608    $ 63,298    $ 85,908     Aerospace Manufacturing Segment    9,187    13,233    8,284     Real Estate Operations Segment   8,699    7,159    7,498     Corporate and Other    25   -   -     Total Revenues   $ 77,519    $ 83,690    $ 101,690              Operating Income (Loss) by Segment:          Aerospace Distribution Segment    $ (4,143)    $ 2,579    $ 2,259     Aerospace Manufacturing Segment    (2,494)   (6,276)   (2,093)    Real Estate Operations Segment   2,735    1,550    307     Corporate and Other    (44,525)   (18,875)   (17,618)    Total Operating Loss (a)   $ (48,427)   $ (21,022)   $ (17,145)      The fiscal 2003 operating results include impairment expenses of $6.6 million to write down goodwill at our aerospace distribution segment and $0.1 million write down of intangible assets of a start-up company in our corporate and other segment. Operating results in fiscal 2002 includes impairment expenses of $3.0 million in the aerospace manufacturing segment and $0.4 million in the real estate operations segment. Operating results in Fiscal 2001 includes impairment charges of $2.4 million in the aerospace distribution segment, and $2.4 million in the real estate operations segment.   Revenues of $77.5 million in 2003 decreased by $6.2 million, or 7.4%, compared to revenues of $83.7 million in 2002. Revenues in 2003 were adversely affected by the overall conditions in the aerospace industry. The aerospace industry is still sluggish following the attacks of September 11, 2001, and weakness in the overall economy. The recent, well publicized, financial difficulties of major commercial airlines, and reduction in travel have affected the demand for products we sell at our remaining aerospace businesses. Revenues of $83.7 million in 2002 decreased by $18.0 million, or 17.7%, as compared to revenues of $101.7 million in 2001. The results for 2001 included revenue of $8.4 million from an operation in our aerospace distribution segment, which was shut down in June 2001. Excluding the results of the shut down operation, net revenues would have decreased by $9.6 million, or 10.3%, in 2002, as compared to 2001. Revenues in 2002 reflected the condition of the aerospace industry in th    e aftermath of September 11, 2001.   Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 20.4%, 20.2% and 23.5% in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The improvement in 2003, reflects a slight increase in gross margin at our aerospace distribution segment, partially offset by declining margins at our remaining aerospace manufacturing locations, due to highly competitive pricing pressures. Gross margins have declined following the aftermath of September 11, 2001.   Gross margin as a percentage of rental revenue at our real estate segment was 34.9 %, 31.3%, and 38.4% in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The improved margin in 2003 reflects a 21.5% increase in rental revenue, as compared to 2002. The change in margin in 2002 reflected a 4.5% decrease in rental revenue, as compared to 2001.   Selling, general and administrative expense for 2003, includes $13.7 million of one-time change of control payments required under contracts with our top four executives as a result of the sale of our fastener business, and $10.4 million of bonuses awarded to our top four executives as a result of the sale of our fasteners business. The top four executives have also relinquished their right to any other future change of control payments. In addition, selling, general and administrative expense for 2003 includes $1.1 million of severance expense. Excluding these items, selling, general & administrative expense as a percentage of revenues were 46.6%, 47.3%, and 39.8% in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.   Other income decreased $1.7 million in 2003, as compared to 2002. This change primarily reflects income recognized in 2002 from the disposition of future royalty revenues to an unaffiliated third party in exchange for $12.8 million of promissory notes, offset partially by $0.8 million of income recognized in 2003 from the sale of non-core property. Other income increased $0.1 million in 2002, as compared to 2001.   Impairment charges of $6.7 million, $3.4 million and $4.8 million were recognized in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The fiscal 2003 impairment charges included $6.6 million to write down goodwill at our aerospace distribution segment and a $0.1 million write down of intangible assets of a start-up company in our corporate and other segment. The fiscal 2002 impairment charges included $3.0 million to write down the long-lived assets of the ongoing operation at our aerospace manufacturing segment and $0.4 million to write-off a former tenant's improvements at our shopping center. The fiscal 2001 impairment charges included $2.4 million due to the closing of a small subsidiary at our aerospace distribution segment, of which $1.7 million represented the write-off of goodwill, and $0.4 million represented severance payments. Additionally, the fiscal 2001 impairment charge also included a write-off of approximately $2.4 million of a former tenant's improvements at our shopping center.   Operating loss for 2003, includes the $13.7 million of one-time change of control payments required under contracts with our top four executives as a result of the sale of the fastener business, and $10.4 million of bonuses awarded to our top four executives as a result of the sale of the fasteners business. The top four executives have also relinquished their right to any other future change of control payments. In addition, the operating loss for 2003 includes the $6.6 million goodwill impairment at our aerospace distribution segment and $1.1 million of severance expense. With the sale of the fasteners business, we have become a much smaller company and are currently seeking acquisition opportunities. Costs at all locations are being strictly monitored, and reduced wherever possible. In January 2003, we announced a staff reduction of 24% at our corporate headquarters. The operating loss of $21.0 million in 2002 was larger by $3.9 million, or 22.6%, compared to the operating loss of $17.1 m    illion in 2001. The 2001 results included goodwill amortization of $1.1 million, prior to the implementation of an accounting pronouncement that eliminates goodwill amortization beginning in 2002.   Net interest expense decreased by $16.9 million, or 37.2%, and cash interest expense decreased by $20.4 million in fiscal 2003, as compared to fiscal 2002. Interest expense was $38.5 million and $49.7 million for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, respectively. The results for 2003 included an expense of $9.9 million to write-off deferred loan fees due to the repayment of all our outstanding senior subordinated notes and our term loan and revolving credit facilities, offset partially by $7.5 million of interest income recognized from the acceleration of principal on the repayment of notes due to us from an unaffiliated third party. As a result of the sale of the fastener business, our debt has been reduced by $485.1 million since June 30, 2002, to $6.7 million at June 30, 2003. As a result of our debt reduction, cash interest expense was significantly lower in 2003. Net interest expense decreased by $8.6 million, or 15.9%, and cash interest expense decreased by $5.3 million in fiscal 2002, as comp    ared to fiscal 2001, due primarily to lower interest rates on our variable rate debt.   We recorded a nominal investment loss in 2003, an investment loss of $1.0 million in 2002, and investment income of $8.4 million in 2001. The investment results of 2003 included $1.2 million of dividend income, $0.6 million of realized gains on investments liquidated, and $0.5 million of fair market value increases to our trading securities, offset by a $2.4 million write down for impaired investments. The investment results in fiscal 2002 included a $2.3 million write down for impaired investments and a $0.8 million loss on investments sold, offset partially by $1.6 million of dividend income and a $0.5 million increase in the fair market value of trading securities. Investment income in 2001 was due primarily to recognition of gains on investments liquidated.   The fair market value adjustment of our position in a ten-year $100 million interest rate contract decreased by $7.7 million in fiscal 2003 and $4.6 million in 2002. The fair market value adjustment of this agreement will generally fluctuate, based on the implied forward interest rate curve for 3-month LIBOR. If the implied forward interest rate curve decreases, the fair market value of the interest rate contract will increase and we will record an additional charge. If the implied forward interest rate curve increases, the fair market value of the interest rate contract will decrease, and we will record income. Declining interest rates have caused the recorded change in fair market value of the contract.   We recorded an income tax provision of $0.4 million in fiscal 2003 on pre-tax losses from continuing operations. A tax provision was recorded due primarily from state income taxes. We recorded an income tax benefit of $16.0 million in fiscal 2002, representing a 22.3% effective tax rate benefit on pre-tax losses from continuing operations. The tax benefit resulted primarily from the reversal of tax accruals no longer required, and was lower than the statutory rate due primarily to federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards, which we had at June 30, 2002. We recorded an income tax benefit of $28.7 million in fiscal 2001, representing a 42.0% effective tax rate on pre-tax losses from continuing operations. The tax benefit was higher than the statutory rate due primarily to the reversal of $3.5 million of tax accruals no longer required.    Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased by $0.9 million in 2003, as compared to 2002 and decreased by $0.2 million in 2002, as compared to 2001. The decrease in 2003 reflected equity investments written down by $0.9 million for impairment. The decrease in 2002 reflected $0.1 million of equity losses in 2002 as compared to equity income of $0.1 million in 2001.   Earnings from discontinued operations include the results of the fasteners business prior to its sale, and APS. The current period reductions in earnings reflect our ownership of the fastener business for only five months in 2003, as compared to the full year in 2002.   In 2003, we recorded a $29.8 million gain on the disposal of discontinued operations, net of $20.5 million of taxes, as a result of the sale of the fastener business.   In 2002, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $144.6 million from the implementation of SFAS No. 142, presented as a cumulative effect of change in accounting, as of the beginning of our fiscal year. Of this amount, $19.3 million relates to our Fairchild Aerostructures operating unit in our aerospace manufacturing segment and $125.3 million relates to our fastener business sold to Alcoa on December 3, 2002. No tax effect was recognized on the change in accounting for goodwill. Instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life, goodwill will be tested for impairment annually, or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist. All of our goodwill has been deemed to have an indefinite life; and as a result of adopting SFAS No. 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill. Included in our operating results was $6.6 million of goodwill impairment at our aerospace distribution segment in 2003 and, prior to the implementation of SFAS No. 142    , we recognized amortization expense for goodwill of $12.5 million in 2001.   Other comprehensive income includes foreign currency translation adjustments, unrecognized actuarial loss on pensions, and unrealized periodic holding changes in the fair market value of available-for-sale investment securities. In 2003, other comprehensive income included a decrease of $60.8 million due to the recognition of an additional minimum pension liability due primarily to unrecognized actuarial losses, offset partially by an increase of $19.6 million in foreign currency translation adjustments which were realized as part of the sale of our fasteners business and a $1.8 million increase in the fair market value of unrealized holding gains on investment securities. The fair market value of available-for-sale securities, on an after-tax basis, declined by $0.6 million and $1.0 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The changes in 2001 reflect primarily gains realized from the liquidation of investments. Foreign currency translation adjustments improved by $21.6 million in 2002, which     reflected the strengthening of the EURO to the U.S. Dollar. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased by $24.5 million in 2001 due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the EURO.   Segment Results   Aerospace Distribution Segment    Our aerospace distribution business is an international supplier to the airlines, corporate aviation, and the military. The business operates from five locations in the United States and specializes in the distribution of avionics, airframe accessories, and other components. Products include: navigation and radar systems, instruments, and communication systems, flat panel technologies and rotables. The company also overhauls and repairs, landing gear, pressurization components, instruments, and avionics. Customers include commuter and regional airlines, corporate aircraft and fixed-base operators, air cargo carriers, general aviation suppliers and the military. Sales in our aerospace distribution segment decreased by $3.7 million, or 5.8%, in 2003, as compared to 2002. Sales in 2003 were adversely affected by the overall conditions in the aerospace industry, resulting primarily from the events of September 11, 2001, and the general weakness in the overall economy. Sales in our aerospace dist    ribution segment decreased by $22.6 million in 2002, compared to 2001. Results in 2001, included revenue of $8.4 million from an operation which was shut down in June 2001. Sales in 2002 were also adversely affected due to the events of September 11, 2001.   The operating loss of $4.1 million in 2003, included $6.6 million of goodwill impairment charges. Excluding the goodwill impairment charges recognized in 2003, operating income decreased by $0.1 million as compared 2002 reflecting the decrease in sales and a 0.5% decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales, offset partially by a 0.6% reduction in selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales. Operating income increased by $0.3 million in 2002, as compared to 2001. The results in 2002 were affected by the reduction in revenue. Operating income in 2001 included asset impairment charges of $3.1 million due to the closing of Banner Aircraft Services, which also reported operating losses of $3.9 million in 2001.   Aerospace Manufacturing Segment    Sales in our aerospace manufacturing segment decreased by $4.0 million in 2003, as compared to 2002. The change reflected a reduction in shipments in the current period due to an overall lower level of demand in the aerospace industry resulting from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the recent financial difficulties of major commercial airlines. Sales in our aerospace manufacturing segment increased by $4.9 million, or 59.7%, in 2002, as compared 2001. The improvement reflected internal growth. However, sales decreased in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2002, due to a reduction in shipments resulting from an overall lower level of demand in the aerospace industry following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.   Operating results improved by $3.8 million in 2003, as compared to 2002. The improvement reflects primarily impairment charges of $3.0 million to write down long-lived assets, and $1.3 million to write down inventory through cost of goods sold recognized in 2002, offset partially by a 2.0% increase in selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales. Operating results in our aerospace manufacturing segment decreased by $4.2 million in 2002, as compared to 2001. The decrease was due primarily to impairment charges of $3.0 million to write down long-lived assets, and $1.3 million to write down inventory through cost of goods sold. Goodwill amortization of $0.5 million was recorded in 2001.   On December 3, 2002, we sold our fastener business for approximately $657 million in cash to Alcoa Inc. Additionally, in February 2003, we adopted a formal plan to sell APS. The company expects to sell APS by December 2003. Accordingly, the results of our fastener business and APS have been restated to report them as discontinued operations.   Real Estate Operations Segment   Our real estate operations segment owns and operates a 451,000 square foot shopping center located in Farmingdale, New York and also owns and leases a 102,000 square foot building in Chatsworth, California and a 208,000 square foot manufacturing facility located in Fullerton, California. We have two tenants that each occupy more than 10% of the rentable space of the shopping center. Rental revenue was $8.7 million in 2003, $7.2 million in 2002, and $7.5 million in 2001. Rental revenue increased by 21.5% in 2003, as compared to 2002, reflecting the lease of the Fullerton property and tenants occupying an additional 66,000 square feet of the shopping center. Rental revenue decreased by 4.5% in 2002, as compared to 2001, due to a decrease in the average per square foot amount charged to tenants in 2002. The weighted average occupancy rate of the shopping center was 87.1%, 76.9% and 74.4% in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The average effective annual rental rate per square foot of the shopp    ing center was $20.27, $19.22, and $20.91 in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. As of June 30, 2003, approximately 91% of the shopping center was leased. We anticipate that rental income will increase during 2004, as a result of a new lease for approximately 30,000 square feet, entered into shortly after the end of 2003. The Chatsworth property is leased through July 2008, and is expected to generate revenues and operating income of approximately $0.5 million per year. The Fullerton property is leased to Alcoa through October 2007, and is expected to generate revenues and operating income in excess of $0.5 million per year.    Operating income increased by $1.2 million to $2.7 million in 2003, as compared to $1.5 million in 2002. In 2003, repairs and maintenance expense and depreciation expense increased by $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively, as a result of an increased weighted-average portion of the shopping center being placed into service in 2003. Operating income increased by $1.2 million to $1.5 million in 2002, as compared to $0.3 million in 2001. In 2002, depreciation expense and real estate taxes increased by $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively, as a result of an increased weighted-average portion of the shopping center being placed into service in 2002. The results for 2001 were adversely affected by a charge of $2.5 million to write-off improvements at the shopping center.   Corporate Segment   The operating results at corporate in 2003 includes $13.7 million of one-time change of control payments required under contracts with our top four executives as a result of the sale of the fastener business, and $10.4 million of bonuses awarded to our top four executives as a result of the sale of the fastener business. The top four executives also have relinquished their right to any other future change of control payments. Other income at corporate decreased by $4.3 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, due primarily to income recognized in 2002 from the disposition of future royalty revenues to an unaffiliated third party in exchange for promissory notes. In January 2003, we reduced our corporate staff by approximately 24%. Severance expense associated with the reduction was $1.1 million in 2003.   The corporate segment operating loss in 2002 decreased by $1.3 million, or 7.1%, as compared to 2001. Results from 2001 included $3.1 million of gains recognized on the disposition of non-core assets. Results in each of 2002 and 2001, included consulting income of $1.5 million from a consulting agreement that expired on June 30, 2002.   FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    Our combined cash and investment balances increased by $100.8 million to $121.9 million on June 30, 2003, as compared to $21.1 million on June 30, 2002. Our debt was reduced by $485.1 million, to $6.7 million on June 30, 2003, as compared to $491.8 million on June 30, 2002. Total capitalization was $144.5 million and $722.0 million as of June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2002, respectively. The change in capitalization included the $485.1 million decrease in debt reflecting repayment with the proceeds received from the sale of the fasteners business, and a decrease in equity of $92.4 million. The change in equity was due primarily to our reported net loss and changes in other comprehensive income, which included a decrease of $60.8 million, due to the recognition of the additional minimum pension liability, offset partially by a $19.6 million reversal of prior decreases in foreign currency translation adjustments, which were realized as part of the sale of our fasteners business.   Net cash used for operating activities for 2003, was $122.5 million. The working capital uses of cash in 2003 included $47.4 million of cash used for investments in trading securities, $7.4 million contributed to fund our pension plan, $13.7 million of one-time change of control payments required under contracts with our top four executives as a result of the sale of the fastener business, $10.4 million of bonuses awarded to our top four executives as a result of the sale of the fasteners business, and $30.4 of non-cash charges and working capital changes provided to discontinued operations. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2002 was $19.4 million. The working capital uses of cash in 2002 included a $5.2 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and a $19.6 million increase in other non-current assets, offset partially by a $4.8 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $7.1 million decrease in other current assets, and a $4.5 million decrease in invento    ry. The working capital uses of cash were offset by $20.0 million of non-cash charges and working capital changes provided from discontinued operations, and $5.3 million of earnings, after deducting non-cash expenses of $5.2 million for depreciation, $2.1 million from the amortization of deferred loan fees, $144.6 million for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for goodwill, $3.4 million loss from impairments, and $4.6 million from the reduction in the fair market value of an interest rate contract. Net cash used for operating activities for fiscal 2001 was $40.2 million. The primary use of cash for operating activities in 2001 was a $104.9 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, offset partially by a $3.2 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $33.5 million increase in other current assets, a $2.7 million increase in inventories, and $32.5 million of non-cash charges and working capital changes provided from discontinued operations.   Net cash provided by investing activities for 2003, was $605.6 million. In 2003, the primary source of cash was $657.1 million of proceeds from the sale of our fastener business, $13.4 million of net cash proceeds received from notes receivable, and $2.5 million cash proceeds received from net assets held for sale. Net cash provided by investing activities was offset partially by $54.7 million of new investments, $9.9 million of capital expenditures, including the purchase of a manufacturing facility located in Fullerton, California, and $2.8 million of investing activities used for discontinued operations. Net cash used for investing activities was $9.6 million in 2002. The primary source of cash in 2002 was $4.0 million provided from the dispositions of non-core real estate and net assets held for sale, offset by $2.5 million of capital expenditures and a $5.8 increase in notes receivable and $6.6 million of investing activities used for discontinued operations. Net cash provided from inve    sting activities for 2001 was $18.2 million, and included $28.0 million in proceeds received from the dispositions of investments, and $1.5 million in proceeds received from the disposition of property, offset by $3.8 million of capital expenditures, and by $9.7 million of investing activities used for discontinued operations.   Net cash used by financing activities was $485.8 million for 2003, which reflected the repayment of essentially all of our debt, except for a $3.4 million margin loan and $3.2 million of debt at Fairchild Aerostructures. Net cash used for financing activities in 2002 included a $9.6 million decrease in debt. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $15.4 million, and included a $14.7 million net issuance of additional debt used to fund operations.   At June 30, 2002, $5.6 million of promissory notes were due to us from an unaffiliated third party, which are included in notes receivable. The promissory notes earn $1.4 million of annual cash interest and were being accreted to a face value of $12.8 million through May 2006. The promissory notes are secured by $12.8 million face value of our outstanding 10.75% senior subordinated debentures due 2009 acquired by the third party. As a result of the sale of the fastener business on December 3, 2002, we redeemed for cash the debentures held by the third party, and the third party then satisfied its obligation under its promissory notes.   Our principal cash requirements include acquisitions, capital expenditures, and the payment of other liabilities including postretirement benefits, environmental investigation and remediation obligations, and litigation settlements and related costs. We expect that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, cash available from borrowings, and proceeds received from dispositions of assets, including investments, will be adequate to satisfy our cash requirements during the next twelve months. In the second quarter of 2004, we may convert a large portion of our investments into cash or cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents, including investments in government securities, currently have much lower yields than the short-term bonds and other items we are currently invested in. We may also buy back up to 10% of our current outstanding Class A common stock, subject to market conditions, during the six months following the filing of this document.   We have entered into discussions with a lender to receive a 10-year, non-recourse, fixed rate, term-loan financing on our shopping center at interest rates currently approximating 6.1%.   Prior to the sale of our fastener business, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation had contacted us to understand the impact of the sale of our fasteners business on our ability to fund our long-term pension obligations. The PBGC expressed concern that our retirement plan would be underfunded by $86 million after the sale of our fasteners business. We provided the PBGC with information, which represented the underfunding to be $42 million, using the PBGC plan termination assumptions. During 2003, we contributed $7.4 million of cash to fund this pension plan. Based upon our actuary's assumptions and projections, we do not expect additional cash contributions to this pension plan to be required until 2008.   At June 30, 2003, we had contractual commitments to repay debt (including capital lease obligations), and to make payments under operating leases. Payments due under these long-term obligations are as follows:         2004    2005    2006    2007    2008    Thereafter    Total     Long-term debt and capital lease obligations    $ 468   $ 219   $ 92   $ 88   $ 83   $ 2,333    $ 3,283    Operating lease commitments    2,338   1,698   1,418   806   384   1,207   7,851    Total contractual cash obligations    $ 2,806   $ 1,917    $ 1,510   $ 894   $ 467   $ 3,540   $ 11,134   We have entered into standby letter of credit arrangements with insurance companies and others, issued primarily to guarantee our future performance of contracts. At June 30, 2003, we had contingent liabilities of $2.3 million on commitments related to outstanding letters of credit.   In addition, we have $13.1 million classified as other long-term liabilities at June 30, 2003, including environmental and other liabilities, which do not have specific payment terms or other similar contractual arrangements.   At June 30, 2003, we have $130.3 million of federal income tax loss carryforwards expiring 2019 through 2022, and $4.9 million of unused alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards that do not expire. These federal income tax loss carryforwards may be reduced by adjustments during the income tax audits of 1995 through 2003, which have not been completed. As the periods of assessment for 1995 to 1998 have expired, additional tax may be collected from us only for 1999 to 2003. Nonetheless, the tax losses of $68.3 million arising in 1995, 1997, and 1998 may still be reduced for determining the proper amount of net operating loss available to be carried forward to years after 1998. The gain we reported between 1995 to 2003, for federal income tax, may be significantly increased if our tax positions are not sustained with respect to the sales of several businesses; and the repayment with property, of debt under a bank credit agreement in which both we and our subsidiaries were liable, is not tre    ated as tax free under Section 361 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If all of these adjustments were made for 1995 to 2003, the federal income tax loss carryforwards would be substantially reduced, and we may be required to pay additional tax and interest of up to $69 million, which has already been provided. The amount of additional tax and interest to be paid by the Company depends on the amount of income tax audit adjustments, which are made and sustained for 1995 to 2003. These adjustments, if any, would be made at a future date, which is presently uncertain, and therefore we cannot predict the timing of cash outflows. To the extent a favorable final determination of the recorded tax liabilities occurs, appropriate adjustments will be made to decrease the recorded tax liability in the year such favorable determination will occur. It is presently uncertain when a final determination will occur since no Internal Revenue Service audits of 1995 to 2002 have been completed.      RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities". This standard requires costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized when they are incurred and applies prospectively to such activities initiated after December 31, 2002. This standard has no impact on our financial statements.   Effective June 30, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivatives and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This standard has no impact on our financial statements.    In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity." This standard requires that certain financial instruments embodying an obligation to transfer assets or to issue equity securities be classified as liabilities. It is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective July 1, 2003. This standard has no impact on our financial statements.    Financial Interpretation 45 "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" was issued in November 2002. FIN 45 was effective for periods ending after December 15, 2002. FIN 45 has no impact on our financial statements.   Financial Interpretation 46 "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" was issued in January 2003. FIN 46 requires that variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003 be consolidated during the first interim period after June 15, 2003. We have determined that, for our first quarter ending on September 30, 2003, we will consolidate our limited partner interest in a landfill development partnership in which we are the source of funds.   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    In fiscal 1998, we entered into a ten-year interest rate swap agreement to reduce our cash flow exposure to increases in interest rates on variable rate debt. The ten-year interest rate swap agreement provides us with interest rate protection on $100 million of variable rate debt, with interest being calculated based on a fixed LIBOR rate of 6.24% to February 17, 2003. On February 17, 2003, the bank, with which we entered into the interest rate swap agreement, did not exercise a one-time option to cancel the agreement, and accordingly the transaction will proceed, based on a fixed LIBOR rate of 6.745% from February 17, 2003 to February 19, 2008.   The interest rate swap agreement was executed to provide an economic hedge against cash flow variability on the floating rate note. When evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 133 on this hedge relationship, we assessed the key characteristics of the interest rate swap agreement and the note. Based on this assessment, we determined that the hedging relationship would not be highly effective. The ineffectiveness is caused by the existence of the embedded written call option in the interest rate swap agreement, and the absence of a mirror option in the hedged item. As such, pursuant to SFAS No. 133, we designated the interest rate swap agreement in the no hedging designation category. Accordingly, we do not use hedge accounting. We have recognized a non-cash decrease in the fair market value of interest rate derivatives, of $7.7 million, $4.6 million and $5.6 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively, as a result of the fair market value adjustment for our interest rate swap agreement.   The fair market value adjustment of these agreements will generally fluctuate based on the implied forward interest rate curve for 3-month LIBOR. If the implied forward interest rate curve decreases, the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will increase and we will record an additional charge. If the implied forward interest rate curve increases, the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will decrease, and we will record income.   The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date.
