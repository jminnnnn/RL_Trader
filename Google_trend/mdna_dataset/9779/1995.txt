ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND  - ------------------------------------------------------------------------          FINANCIAL CONDITION          -------------------       The Fairchild Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in October, 1969.  The Company changed its name from Banner Industries, Inc. to The Fairchild Corporation on November 15, 1990.  RHI Holdings, Inc. ("RHI") is a direct subsidiary of the Company.  RHI is the owner of all of the common stock of Fairchild Industries, Inc. ("FII") which, in turn, is the 100% owner of VSI Corporation ("VSI").  The Company's operations are conducted through VSI and RHI.  The Company also holds  significant equity interests in Banner Aerospace, Inc. ("Banner") and Nacanco Paketleme ("Nacanco").  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The Company currently operates in three principal business segments:  Aerospace Fasteners, Industrial Products and Communications Services.  The following table illustrates the historical sales and operating income of the Company's continuing operations for the past three years.

FISCAL 1995 VERSUS FISCAL 1994  General - -------       Overall sales increased by 23.0% in Fiscal 1995, compared to sales in Fiscal 1994, which reflected stronger sales performances from all three business segments.      Operating income increased $19.5 million in Fiscal 1995, compared to operating losses in Fiscal 1994.  During Fiscal 1995, operating losses decreased significantly in the Aerospace Fasteners segment primarily due to the Fiscal 1994 period having included a restructuring charge of $18.9 million and a $4.0 million charge for earthquake damage and related business interruption.  Operating income in the current year was up in both the Industrial Products segment and the Communications Services segment.  (See discussion below).   Aerospace Fasteners - -------------------       Sales in the Aerospace Fasteners segment increased 7.7% in Fiscal 1995, compared to the Fiscal 1994 period, primarily resulting from aggressive management efforts during the current year to reduce backlog caused by quality problems and earthquake disruption, which have diminished.       Operating losses in the Aerospace Fasteners segment decreased $18.1 million for the Fiscal 1995 period, over the corresponding Fiscal 1994 period; however, this segment continues to be affected by soft demand and severe price erosion and higher quality control costs resulting from customers' requirements.  The Fiscal 1995 loss resulted primarily from excess costs incurred to reduce the past due sales backlog, which included many orders of small quantities at low profit margins.  Certain products have yielded negative margins due to labor inefficiencies and low prices.  Management has taken steps to cancel any such orders remaining in the backlog unless improved pricing can be negotiated.  Significant provisions for excess and slow moving inventories were also recorded in Fiscal 1995, contributing to the operating loss.  Management will also continue to reduce the capacity of the Aerospace Fasteners segment as necessary to bring the breakeven point in line with demand.  These actions may result in further restructuring charges in the future.  A restructuring charge of $18.9 million was recorded in the prior year for nonrecurring costs related to exiting certain aircraft engine bolt lines, and an unusual loss of $4.0 million was recorded in the prior year for earthquake damage (see below).       In January of 1994, the Company's Chatsworth, California Aerospace Fasteners manufacturing facility suffered extensive damage from the Southern California Earthquake.  This disruption caused increased costs and reduced revenues in Fiscal 1994 and has negatively affected Fiscal 1995 as well.  In June of 1995, the Company reached final settlement of its insurance claim and recovered a total of $17.0 million for property damages and business interruption.  (See further discussion in the Fiscal 1994 versus 1993 discussion).  Industrial Products - -------------------       Sales in the Industrial Products segment increased 31.2% in Fiscal 1995, compared to the Fiscal 1994 period.  $15.1 million of the net increase in sales in Fiscal 1995 was at the D-M-E Company ("D-M-E"), which provides tooling to the plastics industry, reflecting customer response to D-M-E's fast delivery programs, new products, and growth of the domestic economy.  Domestic demand for tooling for plastics has been strong while foreign demand has shown signs of improvement as a result of the strengthening European economy.  Expansion into selected new foreign markets is being pursued and appears to have potential.  Also included in the Industrial Products segment were sales from Convac, a semiconductor equipment manufacturing company acquired at the end of Fiscal 1994, another small acquisition made early in Fiscal 1995 and  Fairchild Data Corporation.  The combined sales of these companies was $50.7 million in the Fiscal 1995 period.       Operating income in the Industrial Products segment was flat in Fiscal 1995, compared to Fiscal 1994.  A $4.2 million improvement in operating income at D-M-E in Fiscal 1995 was offset by operating losses from the other operations which incurred significant R&D and start-up costs.  The improved results at D-M-E resulted from a higher sales volume and improved operating margins.  In recent years D-M-E has implemented several cost savings steps, including overhead reduction, plant consolidation and improved inventory management programs, which have contributed to the higher operating margins.  In addition, D-M-E has continued to implement improved manufacturing methods that have reduced cycle time and costs.  Communications Services - -----------------------       Sales in the Communications Services segment increased 46.5% in Fiscal 1995, compared to Fiscal 1994, primarily due to the inclusion of sales from the acquisition of specified assets of JWP Telecom, Inc., ("JWP") made during the Fiscal 1995 second quarter, as well as sales to new customers, the addition of telecommunications franchises in new office buildings, and growth at existing sites.       Operating income in the Communications Services segment increased 12.2% in Fiscal 1995, compared to Fiscal 1994, primarily due to increased sales resulting from the reasons given above and related economies of scale.  Operating income as a percent of sales was 17.0% in Fiscal 1995.  This lower return was anticipated as a result of the JWP acquisition, which has lower gross margins due to the nature of the business.  Other Expenses/Income - ---------------------       Corporate Administrative Expense -  During Fiscal 1995, corporate administrative expense decreased 21.9%.  This decline resulted primarily from cost controls, including a reduction in work force and wage and salary caps that were in effect for most corporate employees and sale of the Company airplane during Fiscal 1994.       Other Corporate Income - Other corporate income decreased $4.4 million in Fiscal 1995, compared to Fiscal 1994, primarily due to increased carrying costs and losses reported on net assets held for sale.  In addition, start up costs related to a corporate sponsored joint venture are included in this category.  Gain on sale of a trademark was recognized in the prior year period.       Net Interest Expense - Net interest expense decreased 2.7% in Fiscal 1995, compared to the prior year period, due primarily to lower borrowings and increased interest income earned on higher cash and cash equivalents average balances during the Fiscal 1995 period.       Investment income, net - Investment Income decreased by 7.5%, primarily as a result of higher dividends realized on participating annuity contracts in the prior year period.       Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $3.3 million in Fiscal 1995, compared to Fiscal 1994.  Earnings from Nacanco, in which the Company holds a 31.9% interest, were down $2.6 million for the year, primarily due to a large tax adjustment taken during the current year.  The Fiscal 1994 period included a $5.7 million loss from Banner Aerospace which included losses on discontinued operations and restructuring charges.       Minority interest expense includes dividend expense on FII's Series C Preferred Stock.       Non-Recurring Income - Non-recurring income in the Fiscal 1994 period includes the net pre-tax gain of $129.1 million on the Company's 43.9% stock interest in Rexnord Corporation, which was sold to BTR Dunlop Holdings, Inc. on December 23, 1993.       Income Taxes - For Fiscal 1995, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $18.0 million at a 34.7% effective tax rate.  Accounting Changes: - -------------------       1) Postretirement Benefits - Using the immediate recognition method, the Fiscal 1994 after-tax charge to earnings for the cumulative effect of this accounting change was $.5 million, which represents the unamortized portion of an overstated liability for discontinued operations, which substantially offset the transition obligation for active employees and retirees of continuing operations. In addition, in Fiscal 1994, a $7.5 million charge, net of the Company's related tax benefit, was recorded for the Company's share of Rexnord Corporation's cumulative charge resulting from this change in accounting.       2) Accounting for Income Taxes - The Company elected the immediate recognition method and recorded, in Fiscal 1994, a $2.4 million charge, representing the cumulative effect on prior years.  This charge represents deferred taxes related primarily to fixed assets, prepaid pension expenses, and inventory differences.  In addition, a $.5 million charge was recorded for the Company's share of Rexnord Corporation's ("Rexnord") cumulative charge resulting from this change in accounting.         Net Earnings (Loss) - The net earnings (loss) decreased $49.6 million in Fiscal 1995, compared to the Fiscal 1994 period, primarily due to the $129.1 million net pre-tax gain on the sale of the Company's interest in Rexnord recognized in the Fiscal 1994 period.  Offsetting the decrease were:  (1) the $19.5 million increase in operating income and the $3.3 million increase in equity earnings in Fiscal 1995, (2) the $11.0 million charge, net of tax, for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, which was recorded in Fiscal 1994, and (3) a decrease in taxes of $43.0 million.   FISCAL 1994 VERSUS FISCAL 1993  General - -------       Overall sales declined by 4.2% for Fiscal 1994, compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily caused by price erosion due to excess capacity in the aerospace fasteners industry, reduced order rates from commercial and military aerospace customers in the Aerospace Fasteners segment and lower revenues due to the disruption caused by the earthquake.  Reduced order rates were principally due to reductions in defense spending and reduced build rates of commercial airplane original equipment manufacturers, due to conditions in the airline industry.  The decline in sales at the Aerospace Fasteners segment was partially offset by significant sales increases at the Industrial Products and Communication Services segments in the Fiscal 1994 period.  The Industrial Products segment included sales in the Fiscal 1994 period by Fairchild Data Corporation which had been classified as a discontinued operation in the Fiscal 1993 period.       Operating income decreased by $13.5 million in Fiscal 1994, compared to Fiscal 1993.  A restructuring charge of $18.9 million was recorded in Fiscal 1994, to further implement the Aerospace Fasteners segment restructuring plan. A $4.0 million charge for earthquake damage and related business interruption also affected this segment in Fiscal 1994.  Operating income was up in the Industrial Products and Communications Services business segments for Fiscal 1994; however, in the Aerospace Fasteners segment operating income declined $16.8 million for Fiscal 1994, compared to Fiscal 1993.  Other corporate income also decreased in Fiscal 1994.  (See discussion below.)  Aerospace Fasteners - -------------------       Sales in the Aerospace Fasteners segment decreased 17.7% in Fiscal 1994, compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to the reduced order rates.       The operating loss in the Aerospace Fasteners segment increased by $16.8 million in Fiscal 1994, compared to the Fiscal 1993 period.  During the Fiscal 1994 period, sustained soft worldwide demand for aircraft and aircraft engines caused a decline in new order rates and in prices for aerospace fasteners.  In response, the Company continued to undertake restructuring actions to further downsize, reduce costs, reduce cycle times and improve margins.  These restructuring efforts included discontinuance of certain aircraft engine bolt and other product lines, increased cellularization of manufacturing processes, relocation of its New Jersey operations to California and re-engineering certain manufacturing processes and methods to meet more stringent customer quality standards.       The Company recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $18.9 million in Fiscal 1994 to cover the cost of the above mentioned restructuring activities, including the write down of goodwill and surplus assets related to certain product lines, severance benefits and the nonrecurring costs associated with the cellularization and reengineering of manufacturing processes and methods.  The Fiscal 1993 period included a restructuring charge of $15.5 million to downsize fastener operations in Europe and the United States.       Operating income in Fiscal 1994 was also affected by (1) reduced demand and price erosion; and (2) higher quality control costs resulting from customer quality requirements.  The segment has implemented  programs to comply with customer quality requirements, which resulted in one time start- up costs and increased recurring quality costs, each of which negatively affected the Fiscal 1994 operating results, and will likely negatively affect the future profit margins of this segment.       On January 17, 1994, the Company's Chatsworth, California Aerospace Fasteners manufacturing facility suffered extensive damage from the Southern California earthquake.  As a result, the Company relocated the Chatsworth manufacturing operations to its other Southern California facilities.  This disruption caused increased costs and reduced revenues in Fiscal 1994.  While the Company carries insurance for both business interruption and property damage caused by earthquakes, the policy has a 5% deductible.  The Company recorded an unusual pretax loss in Fiscal 1994 of $4.0 million to cover the estimated net cost of the damages and business interruption caused by the earthquake.  Industrial Products - -------------------       Sales in the Industrial Products segment increased 12.2% in Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993.  The inclusion of Fairchild Data Corporation sales in Fiscal 1994 accounted for 76.5% of the increased sales in this segment.  Sales increased by $4.2 million at D-M-E Company in Fiscal 1994, reflecting customer response to   D-M-E's fast delivery programs, new products, and growth of the domestic economy.       Operating income in the Industrial Products segment increased 10.2% in Fiscal 1994, compared to Fiscal 1993.  The inclusion of Fairchild Data Corporation operating income in Fiscal 1994 accounted for 48.9% of the increase in operating income in this segment.  The improved results at D-M-E in the Fiscal 1994 period resulted from a higher sales volume and improved operating margins.  In recent years the Industrial Products segment has implemented several cost savings steps, including overhead reduction and improved inventory management programs, which have contributed to the higher operating margins.  The improvements in inventory management and delivery systems resulted in faster deliveries, reduction in inventory, and higher inventory turnover.  In addition, D-M-E has continued to implement improved manufacturing methods that have reduced cycle times and costs.  Communications Services - -----------------------       Sales in the Communications Services segment increased 9.0% in Fiscal 1994, compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to the inclusion of sales from acquisitions, the addition of telecommunications franchises in new office buildings, and growth at existing sites.       Operating income in the Communications Services segment increased 12.2% in Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to increased sales resulting from the reasons given above and related economies of scale.  Operating income as a percent of sales in Fiscal 1994 was slightly higher than in Fiscal 1993.  Other Expenses/Income - ---------------------       Corporate Administrative Expense - Corporate administrative expense decreased by 13.5% in Fiscal 1994, as compared to Fiscal 1993.  This decline resulted primarily from cost controls, including a reduction in work force and wage and salary caps that were in effect for most corporate employees, and the sale of the Company airplane during Fiscal 1994.  Excluding severance payouts, corporate administrative expense declined over 15.9% in Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993.       Other Corporate Income - Other corporate income decreased $3.1 million in Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to the absence of amortization of over accrued retiree health care expense, and the write down of a corporate facility held for sale.       Net Interest Expense - Net interest expense decreased 1.0% in Fiscal 1994, compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily due to higher interest income in the Fiscal 1994 period as a result of higher cash balances.       Investment Income - Investment income was higher by $3.5 million in Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993, primarily as a result of gains realized on the liquidation of investments in Fiscal 1994.  Also included in Fiscal 1994 were $2.8 million of dividends realized on participating pension annuity contracts.       Equity in Earnings of Affiliates - Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $12.1 million in Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993, due to the lower earnings of Banner, after recording nonrecurring charges for discontinued operations, and of Rexnord prior to the Company selling its interest in Rexnord.  Consequently, Fiscal 1994 includes no earnings for Rexnord subsequent to the sale date.       Minority Interest - Minority interest includes dividend expense on FII's Series C Preferred Stock, issued August 22, 1992 by FII.       Non-Recurring Income - Non-recurring income in Fiscal 1994 includes the net pre-tax gain of $129.1 million on the Company's 43.9% stock interest in Rexnord, which was sold to BTR Dunlop Holdings, Inc. for $22.50 per share on December 23, 1993.       Income Taxes - For Fiscal 1994, the Company provided an income tax provision at a rate of 47.4%.  The provision tax rate was higher than the statutory rate, largely due to the write off and amortization of goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes.  Accounting Changes:       1)  Postretirement Benefits - Using the immediate recognition method, the after-tax charge to earnings representing the cumulative effect of the accounting change was $.5 million in Fiscal 1994.  The unamortized portion of an overstated liability of $10.4 million for discontinued operations substantially offset the transition obligation of $10.9 million for active employees and retirees of continuing operations.  In addition, a $7.5 million charge, net of the Company's related tax benefit, was recorded in Fiscal 1994 for the Company's share of Rexnord's cumulative charge resulting from this change in accounting.       2)  Accounting for Income Taxes - The Company elected the immediate recognition method and recorded a $2.4 million charge in Fiscal 1994 representing the cumulative effect on prior years.  This charge represents deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the tax basis and book basis of fixed assets, prepaid pension expense, and inventory.  In addition, a $.5 million charge was recorded in Fiscal 1994 for the Company's share of Rexnord's cumulative charge resulting from this accounting change.       Extraordinary items - net included in Fiscal 1993 is an extraordinary charge of $11.8 million, net of tax, which is 42% of the Rexnord extraordinary charge related to premiums paid to repurchase debt and the write off of deferred loan costs.  In addition, FII recorded a charge of $.8 million, net of tax, for deferred loan fees written off when a portion of the term loan was repaid.       Net Earnings (Loss) - The $71.9 million increase in the Fiscal 1994 net earnings compared to Fiscal 1993 was primarily due to the $129.1 million pre- tax gain on the sale of shares of Rexnord, offset partially by a $13.5 million drop in operating income, decreased equity earnings of $12.0 million, an $11.0 million charge, net of tax, for the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, and increased taxes on the higher level of income.  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Working capital at June 30, 1995 was $112.6 million, which was $33.2 million lower than at June 30, 1994.  The primary reasons for this decrease included a $31.2 million reduction in cash, primarily required to service debt and meet operating cash requirements during the year, and a $26.0 million increase in current debt resulting from long term debt becoming current and an increase in accounts payable of $12.8 million, primarily as a result of acquisitions.  These decreases in working capital were partially offset by a $34.3 million increase in accounts receivable and inventory, reflecting acquisitions, slower customer payments, and inventory build and increased sales to reduce backlog.       The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and borrowings under its credit agreement.  The Company also expects to generate cash from the sale of certain assets and liquidation of investments.  Net assets held for sale at June 30, 1995 had a book value of $51.6 million and included two parcels of real estate in California and an 88 acre parcel of real estate located in Farmingdale, New York, which the Company plans to sell,lease or develop, subject to the resolution of certain  environmental matters and market conditions.  At the end of 1995, it was determined to reclassify to this classification, several investments and properties now being marketed, including two landfills in Pennsylvania, and a real estate joint venture in California.       The Company's principal cash requirements include debt service, capital expenditures, acquisitions, payment of other liabilities and payment of dividends on preferred stock.       The level of the Company's capital expenditures varies from year to year, depending upon the timing of capital spending for new production equipment, periodic plant and facility expansion, acquisition of high growth companies, as well as cost reduction and labor efficiency programs.  For Fiscal 1995, capital expenditures including the cost of acquisitions, were $32.9 million.  Capital expenditures, for Fiscal 1994 and Fiscal 1993 were $18.2 million and $22.9 million, respectively.  The Company anticipates that capital expenditures in Fiscal 1996 will approximate $18.8 million.       Long term investments declined $14.6 million as a result of: (1) recovering proceeds in excess of book value on the Maurice Bidermann litigation, and (2) reclassifying a real estate joint venture to net assets held for sale.       Notes receivable and other assets declined $28.3 million, due primarily to reclassifying noncurrent taxes to the noncurrent tax liability caption on the balance sheet, and reclassifying several properties to net assets held for sale.       Long term debt decreased $12.7 million during Fiscal 1995, as a result of the Company repurchasing some of its senior and intermediate debt, and senior debt due in 1996 being reclassified to current liabilities.       Other liabilities that require the use of cash include post-employment benefits for retirees, environmental investigation and remediation obligations, and litigation settlements and related costs.       The Company expects that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, borrowings, and asset sales, will be adequate to satisfy cash requirements.  Management intends to take appropriate actions to refinance portions of its debt, if necessary to meet cash requirements.       The Company's Credit Agreement, as amended, requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants, including achieving cumulative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, ("EBITDA Covenant"), and maintaining certain coverage ratios.  The Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreement, as amended, as of June 30, 1995.  To comply with the minimum EBITDA Covenant requirements (as amended) the Company's subsidiary, VSI must earn for the cumulative total of the trailing four quarters, EBITDA as follows:  $60.0 million for the first quarter of Fiscal 1996, $65.0 million for the second quarter of Fiscal 1996, $70.0 million for the third quarter of Fiscal 1996, and $80.0 millon for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 1996.  VSI's ability to meet the minimum requirements under the EBITDA covenant in Fiscal 1996 is uncertain, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able in the future to comply with the minimum requirements under the EBITDA Covenant and other financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.  Noncompliance with any of the financial covenants, without cure or waiver, would constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement.  An event of default resulting from a breach of a financial covenant may result, at the option of lenders holding a majority of the loans, in acceleration of the principal and interest outstanding, and termination of the revolving credit line.  However, if necessary, management believes a waiver can be obtained.       The Company's subsidiaries may transfer available cash as dividends to the Company if the purpose of such dividends is to provide the Company with funds necessary to meet its debt service requirements under specified notes and debentures.  However, all other dividends from FII to RHI are subject to certain limitations under the Credit Agreement.  As of June 30, 1995, FII was unable to provide dividends to RHI.  The Credit Agreement also restricts FII from additional borrowings under the Credit Facilities for the payment of any dividends.  IMPACT OF FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES  Accounting For The Impairment Of Long-Lived Assets - -------------------------------------------------- And For Long-Lived Assets To Be Disposed Of - -------------------------------------------       It is the Company's policy to review its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  To determine the recoverability of its long-lived assets, the Company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows, without interest charges will be less than the carrying amount of the assets.  Impairment is measured at fair value.       In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 ("SFAS 121") "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of".  SFAS 121 establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long-lived assets, certain identifiable intangibles, and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used, and for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of.  SFAS 121 is required to be implemented by the Company on, or before, July 1, 1996.  Since the Company's present policy is identical to the policy prescribed by SFAS 121, there will be no effect from implementation.        As noted above, the Company's Aerospace Fasteners segment has suffered dramatic reductions in sales in the past three years resulting from both reduced defense spending and the severe downturn in the build rate of commercial airliners.  These sales reductions have created excess capacity in the industry and have caused price erosion and margin deterioration.  The Company has responded to these market conditions with several restructuring actions, including significant reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses, personnel reductions, plant closings and consolidations, discontinuance of unprofitable product lines and re- engineering of manufacturing processes.       Despite these actions, the Aerospace Fasteners segment lost from operations (excluding restructuring and earthquake charges) $14.1 million in Fiscal 1995, $9.3 million in Fiscal 1994 and was breakeven in Fiscal 1993.  Most of these losses were concentrated in two of the segments operating units while the other five units were predominately profitable during the periods.  As part of restructuring and earthquake charges totaling $38.3 over the past three fiscal years, the Company wrote off $7.0 million of goodwill, related to exiting product lines.       In light of recent industry conditions and the losses suffered in the Aerospace Fasteners segment in the past three fiscal years, the Company has reviewed its long-lived assets for potential impairment.  The Company has concluded, based on the following, that no impairment currently exists.  Projections of future aircraft build rates published by the major airframe manufacturers, show the rates close to doubling in the next few years.  The Company believes the operating units within the Aerospace Fasteners segment which have incurred operating losses are likely to return to profitability.  Therefore, positive cash flow is likely to be generated in the next several years within the Aerospace Fastener segment, enabling it to recover the carrying value of the segment's long-lived assets, including goodwill.  However, if industry conditions do not improve or the Company does not participate in the improvement as it occurs, it may be necessary to further write-down long-lived assets in the Aerospace Fasteners segment in the next few years.  Such write-downs could be significant in amount.   ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
