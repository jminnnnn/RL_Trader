ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION            The Fairchild Corporation was incorporated in October 1969, under the laws of the State of Delaware. We have 100% ownership interests (directly and indirectly) in Fairchild Holding Corp. and Banner Aerospace Holding Company I, Inc. Fairchild Holding Corp. is the owner (directly and indirectly) of Republic Thunderbolt, LLC and effective November 1, 2003 and January 2, 2004, acquired ownership interests in Hein Gericke, PoloExpress, and Intersport Fashions West. Our principal operations are conducted through these entities. Our consolidated financial statements present the results of our former fastener business, and APS, a small business recently sold, as discontinued operations.              The following discussion and analysis provide information which management believes is relevant to the assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.     CAUTIONARY STATEMENT               Certain statements in this filing contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to our financial condition, results of operation and business. These statements relate to analyses and other information, which are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements also relate to our future prospects, developments and business strategies. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, predict, project, will and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including current trend information, projections for deliveries, backlog and other trend estimates that may cause our actual future activities and results of operations to be materially different from those suggested or described in this financial discussion and analysis by management. These risks include: our ability to find, finance, acquire and successfully operate one or more new businesses; product demand; weather conditions in Europe during peak business periods; timely deliveries from vendors; our ability to raise cash to meet seasonal demands; our dependence on the aerospace industry; customer satisfaction and quality issues; labor disputes; competition; our ability to achieve and execute internal business plans; worldwide political instability and economic growth; military conflicts; reduced airline revenues as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, and their aftermath; reduced airline travel due to infectious diseases; and the impact of any economic downturns and inflation.              If one or more of these and other risks or uncertainties materializes, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those expected, estimated or projected. Given these uncertainties, users of the information included in this financial discussion and analysis by management, including investors and prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update the forward-looking statements included in this filing, even if new information, future events or other circumstances have made them incorrect or misleading.     CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES               On December 12, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Release No. 33-8040, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies. Critical accounting policies are those that involve subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates. In response to Release No. 33-8040, we reviewed our accounting policies. The following areas require the use of judgments and estimates: the valuation of long-lived assets, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, pension and postretirement benefits, income taxes, environmental and litigation accruals and revenue recognition. Estimates in each of these areas are based on historical experience and a variety of assumptions that we believe are appropriate. Actual results may differ from these estimates.              Valuation of Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets for impairment, including property, plant and equipment, and identifiable intangibles with definite lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. To determine recoverability of our long-lived assets, we evaluate the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be greater than the carrying amount of our assets. Impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount of our assets and their estimated fair value.              Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets With Indefinite Lives: Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite lives are not amortized. Instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life, these assets are tested for impairment annually, or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist.              Pension and Postretirement Benefits: We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our employees. Our funding policy is to make the minimum annual contribution required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or local statutory law. The accumulated benefit obligation for pensions and postretirement benefits was determined using a discount rate of 6.0% at September 30, 2004 and 2003, and an estimated return on plan assets of 8.5% at September 30, 2004 and 2003. The effect of any change in these assumptions may result in a large change to the accumulated benefit obligation. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. For measurement purposes, in 2004, we assumed a 10.0% annual rate of increase in the cost per capita of claims covered under health care benefits. Beginning in 2005, the trend rate is assumed to decrease each year by 0.5% to a rate of 5% in 2015 and remain at that level thereafter.              Deferred and Noncurrent Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. All of our deferred tax assets were fully reserved at September 30, 2004 and September 30, 2003.              Environmental Matters: Our current and prior operations are subject to stringent government imposed environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of materials into the environment and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. To date, such laws and regulations have not had a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or net cash flows, although we have expended, and can be expected to expend in the future, significant amounts for the investigation of environmental conditions and installation of environmental control facilities, remediation of environmental conditions and other similar matters.              In connection with our plans to dispose of certain real estate, we must investigate environmental conditions and we may be required to take certain corrective action prior or pursuant to any such disposition. In addition, we have identified several areas of potential contamination related to other facilities owned, or previously owned, by us, which may require us either to take corrective action or to contribute to a clean-up. We are also a defendant in several lawsuits and proceedings seeking to require us to pay for investigation or remediation of environmental matters, and for injuries to persons or property allegedly caused thereby, and we have been alleged to be a potentially responsible party at various superfund sites. At least once each calendar quarter, we thoroughly review our environmental matters and adjust our accrual to equal the estimated probable amount that it will cost us in connection with these matters. We believe that we have recorded adequate accruals in our consolidated financial statements to complete such investigation and take any necessary corrective actions or make any necessary contributions or other payments. No amounts have been recorded as due from third parties, including insurers, or set off against, any environmental liability, unless such parties are contractually obligated to contribute and are not disputing such liability.              Legal Matters: We are involved in various other claims and lawsuits incidental to our business. We, either on our own or through our insurance carriers, are contesting these matters. At the end of each calendar quarter, we thoroughly review our legal matters and adjust our accrual to equal the estimated probable amount that it will cost us in connection with these matters. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future results of operations, or net cash flows.              Revenue Recognition: Revenues are recognized immediately upon the sale of merchandise by our retail stores. Sales and related costs are recognized on shipment of products and/or performance of services, when collection is probable. Lease and rental revenue are recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Shipping and handling amounts billed to customers are classified as revenues.     EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW               Our business consists of three segments: sports & leisure, aerospace, and real estate operations. Our sports & leisure segment is engaged in the design and retail sale of protective clothing, helmets and technical accessories for motorcyclists in Europe and the design and distribution of such apparel and helmets in the United States. Our aerospace segment stocks a wide variety of aircraft parts, then distributes them to commercial airlines and air cargo carriers, fixed-base operators, corporate aircraft operators and other aerospace companies worldwide, and also manufactures airframe components. Our real estate operations segment owns and leases a shopping center located in Farmingdale, New York, and owns and rents to Alcoa, an improved parcel located in Southern California.              On November 1, 2003, we acquired substantially all of the worldwide operations of Hein Gericke, PoloExpress, and Intersport Fashions West (IFW), collectively now known as Fairchild Sports. Hein Gericke currently operates 142 retail shops in Austria, Belgium, England, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. PoloExpress (also known as Polo) currently operates 87 retail shops in Germany. IFW, located in Tustin, California, is a designer and distributor of motorcycle apparel, boots and helmets under several labels, including First Gear and Hein Gericke. In addition, IFW designs and produces apparel under private labels for third parties, including Harley-Davidson. IFW also distributes in the United States, products manufactured for other companies, under their own labels. Fairchild Sports is a seasonal business, with a historic trend of a higher volume of sales and profits during the months of March through September.              On December 26, 2003, we obtained a $55 million, ten-year term loan financing of our shopping center on a non-recourse basis.              On January 2, 2004, we acquired all but 7.5% of the remaining interest in PoloExpress.              In January 2004, we obtained a $20.0 million asset based revolving credit facility with CIT. The amount that we can borrow under the facility is based upon the inventory and accounts receivable on-hand at our aerospace segment. Interest on outstanding borrowings is 1.0% over prime and we will pay a non-usage fee of 0.5%.              On May 5, 2004, we obtained financing of 41.0 million at the sports & leisure segment from two German banks and satisfied a 46.5 million note payable which had become due. Interest is based on the three-month Euribor rate.              On August 26, 2004, we obtained a $13.0 million, three-year term loan financing on the real estate we own in Fullerton, California; Huntington Beach, California; and Wichita, Kansas.      During the next several months, we will endeavor to:      Develop Hein Gericke brand recognition through presently targeted customers and market expansion.    Integrate and restructure the components of Fairchild Sports to enhance operational efficiencies, by centralizing worldwide procurement and improving information systems.    Complete Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 internal control compliance efforts on a worldwide basis.    Generate cash from borrowings and sale of non-core assets to support our operations and corporate needs  during the seasonal trough.    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS          Significant Business Transactions             On November 1, 2003, we acquired for $45.5 million (39.0 million) substantially all of the worldwide business of Hein Gericke and the capital stock of Intersport Fashions West (IFW) from the Administrator for Eurobike AG in Germany. Also on November 1, 2003, we acquired for $23.4 million (20.0 million) from the Administrator for Eurobike AG and from two subsidiaries of Eurobike AG all of their respective ownership interests in PoloExpress and receivables owed to them by PoloExpress. We used available cash from investments that were sold to pay the Administrator $14.8 million (12.5 million) on November 1, 2003 and borrowed $54.1 million (46.5 million) from the Administrator at a rate of 8%, per annum. On May 5, 2004 we received financing from two German banks and paid the note due to the Administrator. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $68.9 million (59.0 million), including $15.0 million (12.9 million) of cash acquired.              On January 2, 2004, we acquired for $18.8 million (15.0 million) all but 7.5% of the interest owned by Mr. Klaus Esser in PoloExpress. Mr. Esser will retain a 7.5% ownership interest in PoloExpress, but Fairchild has a right to call this interest at any time from March 2007 to October 2008, for a fixed purchase price of 12.3 million ($15.2 million at September 30, 2004). Mr. Esser has the right to put such interest to us at any time during April of 2008 for 12.0 million ($14.8 million at September 30, 2004). On January 2, 2004, we used available cash to pay Mr. Esser $18.8 million (15.0 million) and provided collateral of $15.0 million (12.0 million) to a German bank to issue a guarantee to Mr. Esser to secure the price for the put Mr. Esser has a right to exercise in April of 2008. The transaction includes an agreement with Mr. Esser under which he agrees with us not to compete with PoloExpress for five years. We also signed an employment agreement with Mr. Esser for two years. As of September 30, 2004, the 12.0 million ($14.5 million) collateralized obligation for the put option was recorded in other long-term liabilities and the restricted cash is invested in a capital protected investment and money market funds and included in long-term investments.              The total purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired by approximately $34.0 million. The excess of the purchase price over tangible assets was allocated to identifiable intangible assets, including brand names Hein Gericke and Polo, and are reflected in goodwill and intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2004. In 2004, we recognized amortization expense of $537 associated with $2.7 million of intangible assets determined to have a definite life. Since their acquisition on November 1, 2003, we have consolidated the results of Hein Gericke, PoloExpress and IFW into our financial statements.              On May 5, 2004, our German subsidiary, Hein Gericke Deutschland GmbH and the German partnership which owns PoloExpress, obtained financing of 41.0 million ($49.5 million) from Stadtsparkasse Düsseldorf and HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt KGaA. The loan agreements require Hein Gericke and PoloExpress to maintain compliance with certain covenants. The most restrictive of the covenants requires Hein Gericke to maintain equity of 44.5 million, as defined in the loan contracts. No dividends may be paid by Hein Gericke unless such covenants are met and dividends may be paid only up to consolidated after tax profits. The proceeds from the financing were used to pay the balance of the purchase price owed to the Administrator for Eurobike AG, and complete our acquisition of Hein Gericke, PoloExpress, and IFW. In addition, Hein Gericke also borrowed 9.0 million ($11.1 million) from our subsidiary, Fairchild Holding Corp., which may be repaid only if the covenants in the loan agreements are met. The loan agreements restrict all other forms of cash flows from these subsidiaries to the parent. At September 30, 2004, we were in compliance with the loan covenants             On December 3, 2002, we completed the sale of our fastener business to Alcoa Inc. for approximately $657 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. The cash received from Alcoa is subject to a post-closing balance sheet adjustment based upon the net working capital of the fastener business on December 3, 2002, compared with its net working capital as of March 31, 2002. During the four-year period from 2003 to 2006, we are entitled to receive additional cash proceeds of $0.4 million for each commercial aircraft delivered by Boeing and Airbus in excess of threshold levels, up to a maximum of $12.5 million per year. The thresholds for aircraft delivery are 505 in 2003; 515 in 2004; 570 in 2005; and 650 in 2006.              Based upon the Greenslet report included in the Airline Monitor issued on February 10, 2004, 579 commercial aircraft were delivered by Boeing and Airbus in calendar 2003. These deliveries exceeded the target threshold for aircraft deliveries of 505 commercial aircraft in 2003. Accordingly, we earned $12.5 million of additional proceeds from Alcoa and we have recognized this amount as a gain on disposal of discontinued operations in 2004. From this amount, we reimbursed Alcoa approximately $1.2 million for taxes Alcoa had paid that were attributable to periods prior to December 3, 2002 (the date of the sale), $2.2 million to settle Alcoas claims with respect to uncollected accounts receivable, and agreed to split equally a $0.7 million claim Alcoa had made with respect to bonus payments of certain foreign employees of the business Alcoa acquired from the Company. The taxes were primarily property taxes and non-income taxes paid after December 3, 2002 in foreign countries for periods prior to the date of sale. There were accounts receivable on the closing date balance sheet at the date of the sale to Alcoa. Alcoa had the right to require us to repurchase any of these accounts receivable which were uncollected by Alcoa as of June 3, 2003 (six months after the date of sale). In 2004, we paid Alcoa $2.2 million to settle its claims arising from these uncollected receivables. Since that time, several of the account debtors have made payments to Alcoa; and in July 2004, Alcoa reimbursed us $1.0 million for these accounts receivable it collected through March 31, 2004. We have also collected an additional $0.5 million of these accounts receivable.              As a result of the aircraft delivery earn-out, offset partially by the settlement for taxes, accounts receivable, former employee bonus payments, and other items, we recorded a $9.5 million gain on disposal of discontinued operations for 2004. Alcoa, without our authorization, held back in escrow $4.0 million, which Alcoa agreed was due to the Company, pending resolution of the post-closing balance sheet adjustment dispute. There is no provision in the agreements between the Company and Alcoa permitting Alcoa to create an escrow for the disputed post-closing balance sheet adjustment. We have notified Alcoa of our dispute of these matters and claims, and expect that resolution will require litigation, arbitration, or alternative dispute resolution methods. At September 30, 2004, we had not recorded an accrual for these disputes with Alcoa.              The sale of the fastener business has reduced our dependence upon the aerospace industry. In fiscal 2003, we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale to repay our bank debt and to acquire by tender all of our outstanding $225 million 10.75% senior subordinated notes due in April 2009. We used a portion of the remaining proceeds to fund the acquisition of Hein Gericke, PoloExpress, and IFW.              In February 2003, our Board of Directors adopted a formal plan for the sale of APS, a small operation in our aerospace manufacturing segment, which has been unprofitable. On January 23, 2004, we consummated a sale of substantially all of the physical assets of APS for a nominal amount. Accordingly, the results of APS were reported as a discontinued operation. A settlement has been signed with Gulfstream, which was a large customer of APS, under which approximately $0.7 million was paid to us.             Consolidated Results             Because of the November 1, 2003 acquisition of Hein Gericke, PoloExpress, and IFW, collectively now known as Fairchild Sports, and the sale of the fasteners business on December 3, 2002, the discussion below can not be relied upon as a trend of our future results. Additionally, Fairchild Sports is a highly seasonal business, with a historic trend of a higher volume of sales and profits during the months of March through September.              We currently report in three principal business segments: sports & leisure, aerospace, and real estate operations. The following table provides the sales and operating income of our segments on a historical and pro forma basis for the year ended September 30, 2004, the three month transition period ended September 30, 2003, and the years ended June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2002, respectively. The pro forma results represent the impact of our acquisition of Hein Gericke, PoloExpress, and IFW, as if this transaction had occurred at the beginning of each of our fiscal periods. The pro forma information is based on the historical financial statements of these companies, giving effect to the aforementioned transactions. The prior period historical results of the operations and entities we acquired are based upon the best information available to us and these financial statements were not audited. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations, that would actually have occurred if the transactions had been in effect since the beginning of each fiscal period, nor are they necessarily indicative of our future results.

The fiscal 2003 operating results include impairment expenses of $6.6 million to write down goodwill at our aerospace segment and a $0.1 million write down of intangible assets of a start-up company in our corporate and other segment. Operating results in fiscal 2002 includes impairment expenses of $3.0 million in the aerospace segment and $0.4 million in the real estate operations segment.                Revenues increased by $260.8 million, or 336%, in fiscal 2004, as compared to fiscal 2003. The increase was due primarily to the acquisition of Hein Gericke, PoloExpress and IFW on November 1, 2003. Revenues in fiscal 2004 also benefited from increased revenues at our aerospace segment and real estate operations segment. Revenues of $77.5 million in 2003, decreased by $6.2 million, or 7.4%, compared to revenues of $83.7 million in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, the aerospace industry was adversely affected following the attacks of September 11, 2001, and weakness in the overall economy. During this period, reduction in travel and financial difficulties of major commercial airlines affected the demand for products we sell at our aerospace businesses.              Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 37.2%, 20.2%, 20.4%, and 20.2% in fiscal 2004, the three month transition period ended September 30, 2003, fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2002, respectively. The improvement in margins reflects the higher gross margins earned from retail sales at the sports & leisure segment, which was acquired on November 1, 2003. Gross margin as a percentage of rental revenue at our real estate segment was 32.4%, 39.8%, 34.9%, and 31.3% in fiscal 2004, the three month transition period ended September 30, 2003, fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2002, respectively.              Selling, general and administrative expense for 2003, includes $13.7 million of one-time change of control payments required under contracts with our top four executives as a result of the sale of our fastener business, and $10.4 million of bonuses awarded to our top four executives as a result of the sale of our fasteners business. The top four executives have also relinquished their right to any other future change of control payments. In addition, selling, general and administrative expense for 2003 includes $1.1 million of severance expense. Excluding these items, selling, general & administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was 42.0%, 52.5%, 46.6%, and 47.3% in fiscal 2004, the three month transition period ended September 30, 2003, fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2002, respectively.              Other income increased $6.9 million in fiscal 2004, as compared to fiscal 2003, due primarily other income recognized at our sports & leisure segment from shop partner reimbursements of costs. Other income decreased $1.7 million in fiscal 2003, as compared to fiscal 2002. This change primarily reflects income recognized in 2002 from the disposition of future royalty revenues to an unaffiliated third party in exchange for $12.8 million of promissory notes, offset partially by $0.8 million of income recognized in 2003 from the sale of non-core property.              Impairment charges of $1.2 million, $6.7 million, and $3.4 million were recognized in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The fiscal 2004 results include impairment expenses of $1.2 million to write down the value of a landfill development partnership, in which we are a limited partner and were required to consolidate in accordance with FASB Interpretation 46R beginning January 1, 2004. The fiscal 2003 impairment charges included $6.6 million to write down goodwill at our aerospace distribution segment and a $0.1 million write down of intangible assets of a start-up company in our corporate and other segment. The fiscal 2002 impairment charges included $3.0 million to write down the long-lived assets of the ongoing operation at our aerospace manufacturing segment and $0.4 million to write-off a former tenants improvements at our shopping center.              Restructuring charges of $0.6 million in 2004 included the costs to close all fifteen of the GoTo Helmstudio retail locations in Germany. All of the charges were the direct result of activities that occurred as of June 30, 2004. The restructuring charges included an accrual of $428 for the remaining lease costs of the closed stores, $124 for the write-off of store fittings and $11 for severance. These costs were classified as restructuring and were the direct result of a formal plan to close the GoTo Helmstudio locations and terminate its employees. Such costs are nonrecurring in nature. Other than a reduction in our existing cost structure, none of the restructuring costs will result in future increases in earnings or represent an accrual of future costs of our ongoing business.              Operating loss for 2004 was $9.2 million, as compared to the operating loss of $48.4 million in 2003. Operating loss for 2003, includes the $13.7 million of one-time change of control payments required under contracts with our top four executives as a result of the sale of the fastener business, and $10.4 million of bonuses awarded to our top four executives as a result of the sale of the fasteners business. In addition, the operating loss for 2003 includes the $6.6 million goodwill impairment at our aerospace distribution segment and $1.1 million of severance expense.              Net interest expense was $19.6 million and $28.5 million in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. The results for 2003 included interest expense, prior to the repayment of all of our then outstanding senior subordinated notes, term loan and revolving credit facilities. These repayments were made from proceeds of the sale of the fastener business on December 3, 2002. We anticipate that interest expense will increase in future quarters, as a result of a $130.0 million net increase in debt incurred during 2004. Net interest expense decreased by $16.9 million, or 37.2%, and cash interest expense decreased by $20.4 million in fiscal 2003, as compared to fiscal 2002. Interest expense was $38.5 million and $49.7 million for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, respectively. The results for 2003 included an expense of $9.9 million to write-off deferred loan fees due to the repayment of all our outstanding senior subordinated notes and our term loan and revolving credit facilities, offset partially by $7.5 million of interest income recognized from the acceleration of principal on the repayment of notes due to us from an unaffiliated third party.              Investment income was $4.5 million in 2004, including $4.7 million of dividends and $0.3 million of gains realized from the sale of investments, partially offset by $0.5 million from the decline in fair market value of trading securities. We recorded a nominal investment loss in 2003. The investment results of 2003 included $1.2 million of dividend income, $0.6 million of realized gains on investments liquidated, and $0.5 million of fair market value increases to our trading securities, offset by a $2.4 million write down for impaired investments. The investment results in fiscal 2002 included a $2.3 million write down for impaired investments and a $0.8 million loss on investments sold, offset partially by $1.6 million of dividend income and a $0.5 million increase in the fair market value of trading securities.              The fair market value adjustment of our position in a ten-year $100 million interest rate contract increased by $4.9 million in fiscal 2004 and $2.7 million in the three month transition period ended September 30, 2003. The fair market value adjustment of our position in this interest rate contract decreased by $7.7 million in fiscal 2003 and $4.6 million in fiscal 2002. The fair market value adjustment of this agreement will generally fluctuate, based on the implied forward interest rate curve for 3-month LIBOR. If the implied forward interest rate curve decreases, the fair market value of the interest rate contract will increase and we will record an additional charge. If the implied forward interest rate curve increases, the fair market value of the interest rate contract will decrease, and we will record income. Increasing interest rates have caused the recent change in fair market value of the contract.              In 2004 we recorded a federal income tax benefit of $26.9 million ($13.5 million in continuing operations and $13.4 million in discontinued operations) which results from two items.  The first is the tax effect from the carryback of net operating losses of $39.4 million arising from the periods July 1, 2003 to September 30, 2003 and October 1, 2003 to September 30, 2004 which reduce the noncurrent income tax liability of $68.5 million at June 30, 2003.  The second is the $13.4 million favorable resolution of the tax audit of Kaynar Technologies, Inc. for its final year ended April 30, 1999 and our tax year ended June 30, 1999.  We recorded an income tax provision of $0.4 million in fiscal 2003 on pre-tax losses from continuing operations. A tax provision was recorded due primarily from state income taxes. We recorded an income tax benefit of $16.0 million in fiscal 2002, representing a 22.3% effective tax rate benefit on pre-tax losses from continuing operations. The tax benefit resulted primarily from the reversal of tax accruals no longer required, and was lower than the statutory rate due primarily to federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards, which we had at June 30, 2002.              Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations includes the results of the fasteners business prior to its sale, APS prior to its sale, and certain legal and environmental expenses associated with our former businesses. The loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2004 consists primarily of an accrual of $7.6 million of environmental liabilities at locations of operations previously sold, and $0.8 million to cover legal expenses associated with a business we sold several years ago. The increase in our environmental accrual is primarily the result of a recent sampling of groundwater from the extraction wells to be used in the remediation system at a site in Farmingdale, New York, indicating contaminant levels at the extraction point that are significantly higher than previous sampling results indicated. As a result, the cost to treat groundwater at that location is now estimated to be significantly higher. The 2003 earnings from discontinued operations reflect our ownership of the fastener business during the first five months of fiscal 2003, prior to its sale on December 3, 2002 as compared to the full year in 2002.              In 2004, we recorded a $9.5 million gain on the disposal of discontinued operations, as a result of additional proceeds earned from the sale of the fastener business. In 2003, we recorded a $29.8 million gain on the disposal of discontinued operations, net of $20.5 million of taxes, as a result of the sale of the fastener business.              In 2004, we recorded a $0.2 million gain from the cumulative effect of change in accounting for an investment in affiliate. In January 2004, our position in a small start-up business was diluted and could no longer be consolidated by us. We were previously required to consolidate the start-up business, and through December 2003, we recognized losses of $0.2 million in excess of our investment. The negative book value was reversed in the current quarter.              In 2002, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $144.6 million from the implementation of SFAS No. 142, presented as a cumulative effect of change in accounting, as of the beginning of our fiscal year. Of this amount, $19.3 million relates to our Fairchild Aerostructures operating unit in our aerospace manufacturing segment, and $125.3 million relates to our fastener business sold to Alcoa on December 3, 2002. No tax effect was recognized on the change in accounting for goodwill. Instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life, goodwill is now tested for impairment annually, or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill at the beginning of 2002. Included in our operating results was $6.6 million of goodwill impairment at our aerospace distribution segment in 2003.             Other comprehensive income includes foreign currency translation adjustments, unrecognized actuarial loss on pensions, and unrealized periodic holding changes in the fair market value of available-for-sale investment securities. In 2004, an $1.8 million increase in the minimum pension liability was offset by a $1.2 million increase in the fair market value of available-for-sale securities and a $0.5 million improvement in unrealized foreign currency translations due the strengthening of the Euro to the U.S. Dollar. In 2003, other comprehensive income included a decrease of $60.8 million due to the recognition of an additional minimum pension liability due primarily to unrecognized actuarial losses, offset partially by an increase of $19.6 million in foreign currency translation adjustments which were realized as part of the sale of our fasteners business and a $1.8 million increase in the fair market value of unrealized holding gains on investment securities. The fair market value of available-for-sale securities, on an after-tax basis, declined by $0.6 million in 2002. Foreign currency translation adjustments improved by $21.6 million in 2002, which reflected the strengthening of the Euro to the U.S. Dollar.         Segment Results        Sports & Leisure Segment             Our sports & leisure segment, which we purchased from the Administrator of Eurobike AG and Mr. Klaus Esser, designs and sells motorcycle apparel, protective clothing, helmets, and technical accessories for motorcyclists. Primary brand names of our products include Polo, Hein Gericke, and First Gear. Hein Gericke currently operates 142 retail shops in Austria, Belgium, England, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Polo currently operates 87 retail shops in Germany. For the most part, the Hein Gericke retail stores sell Hein Gericke brand items, and the Polo retail stores sell Polo brand products. Both the Hein Gericke and Polo retail stores sell products of other manufacturers, the inventory of which is owned by the Company. IFW, located in Tustin, California, is a designer and distributor of motorcycle apparel, boots and helmets under several labels, including First Gear and Hein Gericke. In addition, IFW designs and produces apparel under private labels for third parties, including Harley-Davidson. IFW also distributes in the United States, products manufactured by or for other companies, under their own label. The Fairchild Sports group is a seasonal business, with an historic trend of a higher volume of sales and profits during the months of March through September. On a pro forma basis, sales in our sports & leisure segment decreased by $11.1 million in 2004, as compared to 2003. The decrease in the current year was due primarily to the closing of 19 low performing stores in 2004. On a pro forma basis, operating income in our sports & leisure segment increased by $0.7 million in 2004, as compared to 2003. Operating income improved due primarily to staff efficiencies realized at the acquisition date and reductions in rent expense, offset partially by $0.7 million of severance costs and $0.6 million of restructuring charges recognized in 2004.              Since the November 1, 2003 acquisition, Hein Gericke has initiated steps to advance its retail business in Germany. A new standard contract has been negotiated with each shop partner that operates a German retail shop to ensure each shop partner is sufficiently motivated to increase sales. Hein Gericke is focusing on better advertising and greater marketing to restore brand recognition previously enjoyed by Hein Gericke in Germany. The number of Hein Gerickes German employees was reduced by one-third at no cost to the Company. In early 2005, a new ERP computer system, now operational at Polo, will be expanded to encompass the operations of Hein Gericke. The new ERP computer system will enable the business to operate in a more efficient manner.              Hein Gericke and Polo increased the procurement of goods for delivery in Germany to meet the seasonal increase in sales. We believe relations with the suppliers of Fairchild Sports have improved since our acquisition.              We have initiated a program to focus on optimal store location. This includes closing or relocating low performing stores, and opening new stores in England and elsewhere in Western Europe. Since the acquisition, we have opened seven stores in Germany, five stores in the England, and one store in Italy, and we have closed nineteen low performing stores in Germany. We have also redesigned several stores to better present our products to customers.         Aerospace Segment             Our aerospace segment has six locations in the United States, and is an international supplier to the aerospace industry. Four locations specialize in the distribution of avionics, airframe accessories, and other components, one location provides overhaul and repair capabilities, and one location manufactures airframe components. The products distributed include: navigation and radar systems, instruments, and communication systems, flat panel technologies and rotables. Our location in Titusville, Florida, overhauls and repairs landing gear, pressurization components, instruments, and avionics. Customers include original equipment manufacturers, commuter and regional airlines, corporate aircraft and fixed-base operators, air cargo carriers, general aviation suppliers and the military. Sales in our aerospace segment increased by $16.9 million, or 24.5%, in fiscal 2004, as compared to fiscal 2003. The improvement in sales reflects a large order which was delivered in 2004. Sales in our aerospace segment are not anticipated to sustain a growth rate at these levels in the coming quarters, as demand in the aerospace industry is still adversely affected by the events of September 11, 2001, and the continued financial difficulties of major commercial airlines. Sales in our aerospace segment decreased by $7.7 million, or 10.1%, in 2003, as compared to 2002. Sales in 2003 were adversely affected by the overall conditions in the aerospace industry, resulting primarily from the events of September 11, 2001, and general weakness in the overall economy.              Operating income increased by $9.9 million fiscal 2004, as compared to fiscal 2003. The results for 2003 were adversely affected by a $6.6 million impairment charge to write down goodwill. Excluding the goodwill impairment, operating income increased by $3.3 million in 2004, reflecting the increase in volume of sales and a small increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales. Excluding the goodwill impairment charges recognized in 2003, and $4.3 million of impairments recognized in 2002, operating income in 2003 decreased by $1.0 million as compared 2002 reflecting the decrease in sales.         Real Estate Operations Segment                  Our real estate operations segment owns and operates a 451,000 square foot shopping center located in Farmingdale, New York and also owns and leases a 208,000 square foot manufacturing facility located in Fullerton, California. We have two tenants that each occupy more than 10% of the rentable space in the shopping center. Rental revenue was $9.9 million in 2004, $2.3 million for the three month transition period ended September 30, 2003, $8.7 million in 2003 and $7.2 million in 2002. Rental revenue increased by 14.1% in 2004, as compared to 2003, reflecting tenants occupying an additional 28,000 square feet of the shopping center and we recieved additional rents. Rental revenue increased by 21.5% in 2003, as compared to 2002, reflecting the lease of the Fullerton property and tenants occupying an additional 66,000 square feet of the shopping center. The weighted average occupancy rate of the shopping center was 96.3%, 90.3%, 87.1% and 76.9% in fiscal 2004, the three month transition period ended September 30, 2003, fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2002, respectively. The average effective annual rental rate per square foot of the shopping center was $20.78, $20.23, $20.27, and $19.22 in fiscal 2004, the three month transition period ended September 30, 2003, fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2002, respectively. As of September 30, 2004, approximately 96% of the shopping center was leased. We anticipate that rental income will increase during 2005, as a result of new leases for approximately 12,000 square feet, entered into at the end of 2004. The Fullerton property is leased to Alcoa through October 2007, and is expected to generate revenues and operating income in excess of $0.5 million per year.                   Operating income increased by $0.1 million to $2.8 million in 2004, as compared to $2.7 million in 2003. In 2004, depreciation expense and real estate taxes increased by $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, as a result of leasehold improvements enhancing the value of the portion of the shopping center that was placed into service in 2004.  In 2004, insurance and legal expense increased by $0.3 and $0.2, respectively, as a result of increased insurance premiums and various legal matters the company is involved in.  Operating income increased by $1.2 million to $2.7 million in 2003, as compared to $1.5 million in 2002. In 2003, repairs and maintenance expense and depreciation increased by $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively, as a result of an increased weighted-average portion of the shopping center being placed into service in 2003.        Corporate             The operating results at corporate improved by $22.2 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. The operating results at corporate in 2003 includes $13.7 million of one-time change of control payments required under contracts with our top four executives as a result of the sale of the fastener business, and $10.4 million of bonuses awarded to them as a result of the sale of the fastener business. Other income at corporate decreased by $4.3 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, due primarily to income recognized in 2002 from the disposition of future royalty revenues to an unaffiliated third party in exchange for promissory notes. In January 2003, we reduced our corporate staff by approximately 24%. Severance expense associated with the reduction was $1.1 million in 2003.     FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES               Total capitalization as of September 30, 2004 and September 30, 2003 amounted to $278.2 million and $143.8 million, respectively. The current year change in capitalization included a $130.0 million net increase in debt as a result of our acquisition of Hein Gericke, PoloExpress, and IFW; obtaining financing on our shopping center and real estate; and receiving a revolving credit line based on the assets of our aerospace segment. Equity increased by $4.4 million, due primarily to our reported net earnings. Our combined cash and investment balances totaled $109.4 million on September 30, 2004, as compared to $110.9 million on September 30, 2003, and included restricted investments of $75.0 million and $51.9 million at September 30, 2004 and September 30, 2003, respectively. Our combined cash and investment balances increased by $100.8 million to $121.9 million on June 30, 2003, as compared to $21.1 million on June 30, 2002. Our debt was reduced by $485.1 million, to $6.7 million on June 30, 2003, as compared to $491.8 million on June 30, 2002. Total capitalization was $144.5 million and $722.0 million as of June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2002, respectively. The change in capitalization included the $485.1 million decrease in debt reflecting repayment with the proceeds received from the sale of the fasteners business, and a decrease in equity of $92.4 million. The change in equity was due primarily to our reported net loss and changes in other comprehensive income, which included a decrease of $60.8 million, due to the recognition of the additional minimum pension liability, offset partially by a $19.6 million reversal of prior decreases in foreign currency translation adjustments, which were realized as part of the sale of our fasteners business.              Net cash used for operating activities for fiscal 2004 was $15.6 million. The primary use of cash for operating activities in 2004 was a $17.1 million increase in inventories, a $16.3 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, and a $17.0 million increase in accounts receivable, offset partially by a $32.5 million decrease in trading securities, and our $3.4 million net earnings. Net cash used for operating activities for 2003, was $122.5 million. The working capital uses of cash in 2003 included $47.4 million of cash used for investments in trading securities, $7.4 million contributed to fund our pension plan, $13.7 million of one-time change of control payments, $10.4 million of bonuses, and $30.4 of non-cash charges and working capital changes provided to discontinued operations. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2002 was $19.4 million. The working capital uses of cash in 2002 included a $5.2 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and a $19.6 million increase in other non-current assets, offset partially by a $4.8 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $7.1 million decrease in other current assets, and a $4.5 million decrease in inventory. The working capital uses of cash were offset by $20.0 million of non-cash charges and working capital changes provided from discontinued operations, and $5.3 million of earnings, after deducting non-cash expenses of $5.2 million for depreciation, $2.1 million from the amortization of deferred loan fees, $144.6 million for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for goodwill, $3.4 million loss from impairments, and $4.6 million from the reduction in the fair market value of an interest rate contract.              Net cash used for investing activities was $94.8 million in 2004 and included our acquisition funding of $73.0 million, net of $15.0 million cash acquired. Net cash provided by investing activities for 2003, was $605.6 million. In 2003, the primary source of cash was $657.1 million of proceeds from the sale of our fastener business, $13.4 million of net cash proceeds received from notes receivable, and $2.5 million cash proceeds received from net assets held for sale. Net cash provided by investing activities was offset partially by $54.7 million of new investments, $9.9 million of capital expenditures, including the purchase of a manufacturing facility located in Fullerton, California, and $2.8 million of investing activities used for discontinued operations. Net cash used for investing activities was $9.6 million in 2002. The primary source of cash in 2002 was $4.0 million provided from the dispositions of non-core real estate and net assets held for sale, offset by $2.5 million of capital expenditures and a $5.8 million increase in notes receivable and $6.6 million of investing activities used for discontinued operations.              Net cash provided by financing activities was $116.6 million for 2004, which reflected $55.0 million borrowed to finance our shopping center, the long-term financing of $43.4 million for our acquisition of Hein Gericke, PoloExpress, and IFW, $13.0 million borrowed to finance property, and $9.0 million borrowed from a revolving credit facility at our aerospace segment. Net cash used by financing activities was $485.8 million for 2003, which reflected the repayment of essentially all of our debt, except for a $3.4 million margin loan and $3.2 million of debt at Fairchild Aerostructures. Net cash used for financing activities in 2002 included a $9.6 million decrease in debt.              Our principal cash requirements include supporting our current operations and general administrative structure, capital expenditures, and the payment of other liabilities including postretirement benefits, environmental investigation and remediation obligations, and litigation settlements and related costs. We expect that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, cash available from borrowings, and proceeds received from dispositions of assets, including investments, will be adequate to satisfy our cash requirements during the next twelve months. On September 30, 2004, our foreign operations had cash of $7.2 million. However, debt agreements in place at our foreign locations restrict the amount of cash that can be transferred to our other subsidiaries. We may consider raising cash to meet the needs of our operations by issuing additional stock or debt, entering into partnership arrangements, liquidating non essential assets or other means.              We have had discussions with a lender to receive a 7.0 million seasonal line of credit for our sports & leisure segment, at interest rates currently approximating 5.6%. If we are unable to raise additional cash through the seasonal line of credit, which we are negotiating, we may not have sufficient liquidity during the seasonal trough to support both our operations and our corporate needs. If this were to occur during the seasonal trough, we believe we could generate sufficient additional cash through the sale of non-core assets, including investments, to satisfy our cash requirements, recognizing, however, that there are impediments to the timely disposition of non-core assets, which could adversely affect realization of their fair values. Because of the seasonal trough, we may also be required to reduce corporate expenses; however, such reductions may affect our efficiency.              Since December 30, 2003, we have been restricted from raising additional capital though the public markets, and prohibited from granting stock options, due to our inability to provide one year of audited financial statements of the companies we acquired on November 1, 2003, collectively now known as Fairchild Sports (see Item 9B, Other Information, for additional detail). Immediately after the filing of this annual report, we will ask the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider accepting our audited financial statements, which includes eleven months of results from the acquired businesses, to satisfy our requirement under Item 305, of Regulation S-X. If our request is approved we will then again be able to grant stock options and make public offerings.              The costs of being a small to mid-sized public company have increased substantially with the introduction of Sarbanes Oxley Act. Audit fees and audit related fees have doubled in fiscal 2004. The increased costs include the effects of acquisitions and additional costs related to compliance with various financing agreements. We expect the costs to comply with Sarbanes Oxley Section 404 alone will double the audit and audit related costs again. We estimate that we will incur expenses of $1.9 million in relation to audit fees in fiscal 2005, excluding the internal cost and diversion of focus away from operating the business. Our audit fee in 2002 was approximately $0.4 million. This is a significant increase for a company of our size to bear. We may consider opportunities to take our company private in the coming year.     Off Balance Sheet Items                On September 30, 2004, approximately $6.1 million of bank loans received by retail shop partners in the sports & leisure segment were guaranteed by our subsidiaries and are not reflected on our balance sheet because these loans have not been assumed by us.     Contractual Obligations               At September 30, 2004, we had contractual commitments to repay debt (including capital lease obligations), and to make payments under operating leases. Payments due under these long-term obligations are as follows:       2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  Thereafter  Total          Long-term debt and capital lease obligations        $  15,210     $  10,398     $  26,131     $  22,165     $  5,415     $  51,385     $  130,704      Operating lease commitments           20,444        16,383        13,538        11,165        7,809        26,818        96,157             Total contractual cash obligations        $  35,654     $  26,781     $  39,669     $  33,330     $  13,224     $  78,203     $  226,861                         We have entered into standby letter of credit arrangements with insurance companies and others, issued primarily to guarantee our future performance of contracts. At September 30, 2004, we had contingent liabilities of $2.3 million on commitments related to outstanding letters of credit.              On September 30, 2004, we have reflected a $11.1 million obligation due under a ten-year $100 million interest rate swap agreement which expires on February 19, 2008. Interest on the swap agreement is settled quarterly.              Prior to the sale of our fastener business, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation had contacted us to understand the impact of the sale of our fasteners business on our ability to fund our long-term pension obligations. The PBGC expressed concern that our retirement plan would be underfunded by $86 million after the sale of our fasteners business. We provided the PBGC with information, which represented the underfunding to be $42 million, using the PBGC plan termination assumptions. During 2003, we contributed $7.4 million of cash to fund this pension plan. Based upon our actuarys recent assumptions and projections, we do not expect additional cash contributions to this pension plan to be required until 2008.              In addition, we have $25.4 million classified as other long-term liabilities at September 30, 2003, including $15.3 million due to purchase the remaining 7.5% interest in PoloExpress in April 2008. The remaining $10.1 million of other long-term liabilities include environmental and other liabilities, which do not have specific payment terms or other similar contractual arrangements.              At September 30, 2004, we have $179.2 million of federal income tax loss carryforwards expiring 2018 through 2024, and $4.5 million of unused alternative minimum tax credit carryforward that does not expire. These federal income tax loss carryforwards may be reduced by adjustments during the income tax audits of 1995 to 1998 or 2000 to 2004, which have not been completed. As the periods of assessment for 1995 to 2000 have expired, additional tax may be collected from us only for 2001 to 2004. Nonetheless, the tax losses of $185.2 million arising in 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 may still be reduced for determining the proper amount of net operating loss available to be carried forward to years after 2000. The gain we reported between 1995 to 2004, for federal income tax, may be significantly increased if our tax positions are not sustained with respect to the sales of several businesses; and the repayment with property, of debt under a bank credit agreement in which both we and our subsidiaries were liable, is not treated as tax free under Section 361 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If all of these adjustments were made for 1995 to 2004, the federal income tax loss carryforwards would be substantially reduced, and we may be required to pay additional tax and interest of up to $41.5 million, which has already been provided. The amount of additional tax and interest to be paid by the Company depends on the amount of income tax audit adjustments, which are made and sustained for 1995 to 2004. These adjustments, if any, would be made at a future date, which is presently uncertain, and therefore we cannot predict the timing of cash outflows. To the extent a favorable final determination of the recorded tax liabilities occurs, appropriate adjustments will be made to decrease the recorded tax liability in the year such favorable determination will occur. We recorded a federal income tax benefit of $27.0 million in 2004 which results from two items. The first is the carryback of net operating losses arising from July 1, 2003 to September 30, 2003 and October 1, 2003 to September 30, 2004 which reduce the noncurrent income tax liability of $68.5 million at June 30, 2003. The second is the favorable resolution of the tax audit of Kaynar Technologies, Inc. for its final year ended April 30, 1999 and for our year ended June 30, 1999. We have a $41.4 million non-current income tax liability at September 30, 2004, which includes the tax effects of net operating loss carryforwards, temporary differences, and permanent differences. It is presently uncertain when a final determination will occur since no Internal Revenue Service audits of 1995 to 1998 or 2000 to 2003 have been completed. Should any of these liabilities become immediately due, we would be obligated to obtain financing, raise capital, and/or liquidate assets to satisfy our obligations.     RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS               On March 31, 2004, we adopted FASB Interpretation 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FASB Interpretation 46, as revised, requires that variable interest entities created before December 31, 2003 be consolidated during the first interim period beginning after December 15, 2003. Accordingly, we consolidated our interest in a landfill development partnership, of which we are a limited partner. The consolidation of the landfill development partnership had an effect of increasing fixed assets by $2.8 million after we recognized an impairment expense of $1.2 million in 2004.              In January, 2004 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 (revised 2003) Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106. The Statement revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The statement retains the disclosure requirements contained in FASB Statement No. 132, which it replaces, and requires additional annual disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. Statement No. 132R requires us to provide disclosures in interim periods for pensions and other postretirement benefits. We adopted Statement No. 132R in the quarter ended March 31, 2004.              In May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a staff position, FSP 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003". FSP 106-2 provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement Act of 2003 for employers that sponsor postretirement healthcare plans that provide prescription drug benefits. We adopted FSP 106-2 in our fourth quarter beginning on July 1, 2004. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement Act of 2003 should result in improved financial results for employers that provide prescription drug benefits for their Medicare-eligible retirees. The Prescription Drug bill reduced our expense for postretirement liabilities by $140 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK            In fiscal 1998, we entered into a ten-year interest rate swap agreement to reduce our cash flow exposure to increases in interest rates on variable rate debt. The ten-year interest rate swap agreement provided us with interest rate protection on $100 million of variable rate debt, with interest being calculated based on a fixed LIBOR rate of 6.24% to February 17, 2003. The variable rate debt that was fixed by the interest rate swap was repaid by us on December 3, 2002. On February 17, 2003, the bank, with which we entered into the interest rate swap agreement, did not exercise a one-time option to cancel the agreement, and accordingly the transaction proceeds, based on a fixed LIBOR rate of 6.745% from February 17, 2003 to February 19, 2008.              We have recognized a $4.9 million non-cash increase in the fair market value of the interest rate contract in fiscal 2004 as a result of the fair market value adjustment for our interest rate swap agreement.              The fair market value adjustment of these agreements will generally fluctuate based on the implied forward interest rate curve for 3-month LIBOR. If the implied forward interest rate curve decreases, the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will increase and we will record an additional charge. If the implied forward interest rate curve increases, the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will decrease, and we will record income.              In May 2004, we issued a floating rate note with a principal amount of 25.0 million. Embedded within the promissory note agreement is an interest rate cap protecting one half of the 25.0 million borrowed. The embedded interest rate cap limits to 6%, the 3-month EURIBOR interest rate that we must pay on the promissory note. We paid approximately $0.1 million to purchase the interest rate cap. In accordance with SFAS 133, the embedded interest rate cap is considered to be clearly and closely related to the debt of the host contract and is not required to be separated and accounted for separately from the host contract. We are accounting for the hybrid contract, comprised of the variable rate note and the embedded interest rate cap, as a single debt instrument.              The table below provides information about our financial instruments that is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract.
