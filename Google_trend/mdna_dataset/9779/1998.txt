Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis  of  Results  of Operations and Financial Condition".  Financial Information about Business Segments        The Company's business segment information is incorporated herein  by reference  from Note 20 of the Company's consolidated financial  statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data".  Narrative Description of Business Segments  Aerospace Fasteners        The  Company, through its Aerospace Fasteners segment, is  a  leading worldwide  manufacturer  and  supplier of fastening  systems  used  in  the construction  and  maintenance of commercial and  military  aircraft.   The Aerospace Fasteners segment accounted for 50.9% of total sales for the year ended June 30, 1998.    Products        In  general, aerospace fasteners produced by the Company are used  to join  materials  in  applications that are not of  themselves  critical  to flight.  Products  range from standard aerospace screws,  to  more  complex systems  that  fasten  airframe structures, and sophisticated  latching  or quick  disconnect mechanisms that allow efficient access to internal  parts which  require  regular servicing or monitoring.  The  Aerospace  Fasteners segment  also  manufactures and supplies fastening  systems  used  in  non- aerospace  industrial  and  electronic niche applications.   The  Aerospace Fasteners segment produces and sells products under various trade names and trademarks   including  Voi-Shan  (fasteners  for  aerospace   structures), Screwcorp    (standard   externally   threaded   products   for   aerospace applications), RAM (custom designed mechanisms for aerospace applications), Camloc (components for the industrial, electronic, automotive and aerospace markets),  and  Tridair and Rosan (fastening systems for  highly-engineered aerospace, military and industrial applications).       Principal product lines of the Aerospace Fasteners segment include:        Standard  Aerospace Airframe Fasteners - These fasteners  consist  of standard  externally  threaded  fasteners  used  in  non-critical  airframe applications  on a wide variety of aircraft.  These fasteners  include  Hi- Torque Speed Drive, Tri-Wing, Torq-Set, Phillips and Hex Heads.       Commercial Aerospace Structural and Engine Fasteners - These fasteners consist  of  more highly engineered, permanent or semi-permanent  fasteners used   in   non-critical  but  more  sophisticated  airframe   and   engine applications,  which could involve joining more than two materials.   These fasteners  are  generally engineered to specific customer  requirements  or manufactured  to specific customer specifications for special applications, often  involving exacting standards.  These fasteners include Hi-Lok, Veri- Lite, Eddie-Bolt2 and customer proprietary engine nuts.        Proprietary  Products  and  Fastening Systems  -  These  very  highly engineered, proprietary fasteners are designed by the Company for  specific customer  applications and include high performance structural latches  and hold  down  mechanisms.  These fasteners are usually proprietary in  nature and   are  used  primarily  in  either  commercial  aerospace  or  military applications.  These  fasteners include Visu-Lok, Composi-Lok,  Keen-serts, Mark IV, Flatbeam and Ringlock.        Highly  Engineered  Fastening Systems for Industrial  Applications  - These  highly engineered fasteners are designed by the Company for specific niche  applications in the electronic, automotive and durable goods markets and are sold under the Camloc trade name.    Sales and Markets        The products of the Aerospace Fasteners segment are sold primarily to domestic  and  foreign  OEMs of airframes, subcontracors  to  OEMs,  engine assemblies,  and to the maintenance and repair market through distributors. Sixty-six percent of its sales are domestic.  Major customers include  OEMs such  as Boeing, Airbus, and Aerospatiale and their subcontractors, as well as  major  distributors such as AlliedSignal, Tri-Star Aerospace and  Wesco Aircraft  Hardware.   Recently,  OEMs have  significantly  increased  their production levels.  In addition, OEMs have implemented programs  to  reduce inventories  and pursue just-in-time relationships. This has allowed  parts distributors to significantly expand their business due to their ability to better  meet  OEM  objectives.  In response, the  Company,  which  formerly supplied  the OEMs directly, is expanding efforts to provide parts  through its  subsidiaries, which are distributors, such as Special-T  Fasteners  in the Unites States and AS+C GmbH in Europe.  No single customer accounts for more than 10% of the Company's consolidated sales.        Products  are marketed by a direct sales force team and  distribution companies in the United States and Europe.  The direct sales force team  is organized by customer and region. The internal sales force is organized  by facility  and  product range and is focused on servicing  customers  needs, identifying  new  product applications, and obtaining the approval  of  new products.   All  the  Company's products are marketed  through  centralized advertising and promotional activities.       Revenues in the Aerospace Fasteners segment bear a strong relationship to  aircraft  production.  As OEMs searched for cost cutting  opportunities during the aerospace industry recession, parts manufacturers, including the Company,  accepted  lower-priced orders and/or smaller quantity  orders  to maintain  market  share, at lower profit margins.  However,  during  recent years, this situation has improved as build rates in the aerospace industry have increased and resulted in capacity constraints.  All though lead times have  increased,  the Company has been able to provide its major  customers with  favorable  pricing,  while  maintaining  or  increasing  margins   by negotiating  for  larger  minimum  lot sizes  that  are  more  economic  to manufacture.   In  addition,  the Company has eliminated  "make  and  hold" contracts  under which large volume buyers would require current production of  parts  for  long-term unspecified dates of delivery. Overall,  existing backlog  is anticipated to result in higher margins due to larger and  more efficient  lot  sizes, combined with the utilization of  recently  acquired customized production capacity and training programs for all employees.       Fasteners also have applications in the automotive/industrial markets, where  numerous special fasteners are required (such as engine bolts, wheel bolts  and turbo charger tension bolts).  The Company is actively targeting the  automotive  market as a hedge against any potential  downturn  in  the aerospace industry.    Manufacturing and Production       The  Aerospace  Fasteners  segment  has  eight  primary  manufacturing facilities,  of which three are located in the United States and  five  are located  in  Europe.   Each  facility  has  virtually  complete  production capability,  and  subcontracts  only those production  steps  which  exceed capacity.  Each plant is designed to produce a specified product  or  group of   products,   determined  by  the  production   process   involved   and certification requirements. The Company's largest customers have recognized its  quality and operational controls by conferring ISO D1-9000A status  at all  of  its U.S. facilities, and ISO D1-9000 status at all of its European facilities.  All  of  its  facilities are "preferred  suppliers"  and  have received all SPC and NADCAP approvals from OEMs.  The Company is the  first and   only  aerospace  fastener  manufacturing  company  with  all  of  its facilities holding ISO-9000 approval.        The Company has a fully operational modern information system at  all of  its  U.S.  facilities,  which was expanded  to  most  of  its  European operations in Fiscal 1998.  The Company will expand this information system to  the  remaining  European operations in Fiscal  1999.   The  new  system performs  detailed and timely cost analysis of production  by  product  and facility.  Updated MIS systems also help the Company to better service  its customers. OEMs require each product to be produced in an OEM-qualified/OEM- approved facility.    Competition        Despite intense competition in the industry, the Company remains  the dominant  manufacturer  of aerospace fasteners.   The  worldwide  aerospace fastener  market  is  estimated  to  be $1.7  billion  (before  distributor resales).   The Company holds approximately 23% of the market and  competes with  SPS Technologies, Hi-Shear, and Huck, which the Company believes hold approximately 13%, 11% and 10% of the market, respectively.  In Europe, its largest competitors are Blanc Aero and Southco Fasteners.        The  Company  competes  primarily in the highly-engineered  "systems" segment where its broad product range allow it to more fully serve each OEM and  distributor.   The  Company's product  array  is  diverse  and  offers customers  a  large  selection  to address  various  production  needs.  In addition, roughly 45% of the Company's output is unique or is in  a  market where the Company has a small number of competitors.  The Company seeks  to maintain  its  technological  edge  and  competitive  advantage  over   its competitors,  and  has  historically  demonstrated  innovative   production methods and new products to meet customer demands at fair price levels.  Aerospace Distribution        The  Company,  through  Banner (its Aerospace Distribution  segment), distributes a wide variety of aircraft parts, which it has purchased on the open  market or acquired from OEMs as an authorized distributor.  No single distributor  arrangement is material to the Company's financial  condition. The  Aerospace Distribution segment accounted for 48.3% of total  sales  in Fiscal 1998.    Products        An  extensive  inventory of products and a quick  response  time  are essential  in  providing service to its customers.  Another key  factor  in selling  to  its customers is Banner's ability to maintain  a  system  that traces a part back to the manufacturer.        Products of the Aerospace Distribution segment are divided  into  two groups:  rotables  and  engines.  Rotables include flight  data  recorders, radar  and navigation systems, instruments, landing gear and hydraulic  and electrical  components.  Engines include jet engines and engine  parts  for use on both narrow and wide body aircraft and smaller engines for corporate and  commuter  aircraft.  Banner provides a  number  of  services  such  as immediate  shipment of parts in aircraft-on-ground situations. Banner  also buys and sells commercial aircraft from time to time.        Rotable parts are sometimes purchased as new parts, but are generally purchased  in the aftermarket which are then overhauled for the Company  by outside  contractors, including OEMs and FAA-licensed facilities.  Rotables are  sold  in  a variety of conditions such as new, overhauled, serviceable and  "as is".  Rotables may also be exchanged instead of sold.  An exchange occurs when an aircraft part in inventory is exchanged for a part from  the customer  and the customer is charged an exchange fee plus the actual  cost to  overhaul  the part.  Engines and engine components are  sold  "as  is", overhauled or disassembled for resale as parts.    Sales and Markets       Subsidiaries of the Aerospace Distribution segment sell their products in  the United States and abroad to most of the world's commercial airlines and  to  air  cargo  carriers,  as well as other  distributors,  fixed-base operators,  corporate  aircraft operators and  other  aerospace  companies. Approximately 70.7% of its sales are to domestic purchasers, some  of  whom may represent offshore users.        The Aerospace Distribution segment conducts marketing efforts through its  direct  sales  force, outside representatives and,  for  some  product lines, overseas sales offices.  Sales in the aviation aftermarket depend on price,   service,  quality  and  reputation.   The  Aerospace  Distribution segment's  business  does not experience significant seasonal  fluctuations nor depend on a single customer.  No single customer accounts for more than 10% of the Company's consolidated revenue.    Competition        The  rotables  group  competes with AAR Corp., Air  Ground  Equipment Services  ("AGES"),  Aviation Sales Company, The Memphis  Group  and  other large  and  small  companies  in  a very fragmented  industry.   The  major competitors  for  Banner's engine group are OEMs such as  General  Electric Company and Pratt and Whitney, as well as the engine parts division of  AAR Corp., AGES, and many smaller companies.  Other Operations       Other operations include: Nacanco, real estate holdings, and a company operating  under  the  trade name of Fairchild Gas Springs  Division  ("Gas Springs").    Nacanco Paketleme        Established in 1987, Nacanco is the largest manufacturer of  aluminum cans for soft drinks and beer in Turkey with an estimated 80% market share. Nacanco  generated EBITDA of approximately $38 million on annual  sales  of $101 million for its fiscal year ended December 31, 1997.  The Company owns 31.9%  of  Nacanco's common stock with Pechiney International  SA  and  its subsidiaries  holding  substantially all of the balance.  The  Company  has received cash dividends of $5.7 million and $4.8 million in the years ended June 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively.    Real Estate        The  Company has significant real estate holdings having a book value of  approximately  $67  million as of June 30, 1998.   The  Company's  real estate  holdings consist of (i) approximately 80 acres on Long Island,  New York  which are currently being developed into retail centers; (ii) various industrial  buildings from which the Company receives  rental  income;  and (iii)  property to be used as landfills upon receipt of necessary  licenses and government approvals.    Gas Springs Division        A  Fiscal 1995 start-up operation, Gas Springs manufactures gas  load springs  and  other devices used in raising, lowering or  moving  of  heavy loads.  Its  products  have numerous consumer and industrial  applications, including  in  fitness  equipment,  sunbeds,  furniture,  automotive,   and agricultural  and  construction equipment. Annual sales were  $5.8  million from Gas Springs in Fiscal 1998.    Technology Products        Acquired  by the Company in June 1994, Fairchild Technologies  ("FT") manufactures, markets and services capital equipment for recordable compact disc  ("CD-R") and advanced semiconductor manufacturing. FT's products  are used  worldwide  to produce CD-Rs, CDs and CD-ROMs, as well  as  integrated circuits   for   the   data  processing,  communications,   transportation, automotive and consumer electronic industries, as well as for the military.
