ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND                 FINANCIAL CONDITION        The Fairchild Corporation was incorporated in October 1969, under the laws of the State of Delaware, under the name of Banner Industries, Inc.  On November 15,  1990,  we  changed our name from Banner Industries, Inc. to  The  Fairchild Corporation.   We  are  the  owner  of 100% of RHI  Holdings,  Inc.  and  Banner Aerospace,  Inc.  RHI  is  the  owner of 100% of Fairchild  Holding  Corp.   Our principal operations are conducted through FHC and Banner Aerospace. During  the periods presented, we held significant equity interests in Nacanco Paketleme and Shared Technologies Fairchild Inc.        The following discussion and analysis provide information which management believes is relevant to assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of  operations  and  financial  condition. The  discussion  should  be  read  in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  GENERAL        We  are a leading worldwide aerospace and industrial fastener manufacturer and   distribution   logistics  manager  and,  through  Banner   Aerospace,   an international supplier to airlines and general aviation businesses, distributing a  wide  range of aircraft parts and related support services. Through  internal growth  and strategic acquisitions, we have become one of the leading  suppliers of  fasteners  to  aircraft  OEMs,  such as Boeing,  Lockheed  Martin,  Northrop Grumman,  and  the  Airbus consortium, including, Aerospatiale,  DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, British Aerospace and CASA.        Our  aerospace business consists of two segments: aerospace fasteners  and aerospace distribution. The aerospace fasteners segment manufactures and markets high  performance fastening systems used in the manufacture and  maintenance  of commercial and military aircraft. The aerospace distribution segment stocks  and distributes  a  wide variety of aircraft parts to commercial  airlines  and  air cargo  carriers,  fixed-base operators, corporate aircraft operators  and  other aerospace companies.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Business Transactions        The following summarizes certain business combinations and transactions we completed  which significantly affect the comparability of the period to  period results  presented in this Management's Discussion and Analysis  of  Results  of Operations and Financial Condition.     Fiscal 1999 Transactions        On  December  31, 1998, Banner consummated the sale of Solair,  Inc.,  its largest  subsidiary in the rotables group of the aerospace distribution segment, to  Kellstrom Industries, Inc., in exchange for approximately $60.4  million  in cash  and a warrant to purchase 300,000 shares of common stock of Kellstrom.  In December  1998, Banner recorded a $19.3 million pre-tax loss from  the  sale  of Solair.  This  loss  was  included in cost of goods sold  as  it  was  primarily attributable  to the bulk sale of inventory at prices below the carrying  amount of inventory.        On February 22, 1999, we used available cash to acquire 77.3% of SNEP S.A. By  June 30, 1999, we had purchased significantly all of the remaining shares of SNEP.  The  total  amount  paid was approximately $8.0 million,  including  $1.1 million  of debt assumed, in a business combination accounted for as a purchase. The  total cost of the acquisition exceeded the fair value of the net assets  of SNEP  by  approximately $4.3 million, which is preliminarily being allocated  as goodwill, and amortized using the straight-line method over 40 years.  SNEP is a French manufacturer of precision machined self-locking nuts and special threaded fasteners serving the European industrial, aerospace and automotive markets.        On  April 8, 1999, we acquired the remaining 15% of the outstanding common and  preferred stock of Banner Aerospace, Inc. not already owned by us,  through the merger of Banner with one of our subsidiaries. Under the terms of the merger with  Banner, we issued 2,981,412 shares of our Class A common stock to  acquire all  of  Banner's common and preferred stock (other than those already owned  by us). Banner is now our wholly-owned subsidiary.       On April 20, 1999, we completed the acquisition of all the capital stock of Kaynar   Technologies   Inc.  for  approximately  $222   million   and   assumed approximately $103 million of Kaynar Technologies's existing debt, the  majority of  which  was  refinanced at closing. In addition, we paid $28  million  for  a covenant   not   to   compete  from  Kaynar  Technologies's  largest   preferred shareholder.  The total cost of the acquisition exceeded the fair value  of  the net  assets  of  Kaynar Technologies by approximately $269.7 million,  which  is preliminarily being allocated as goodwill, and amortized using the straight-line method over 40 years. The acquisition was financed with existing cash, the  sale of  $225 million of 10 3/4% senior subordinated notes due 2009 and proceeds from a new bank credit facility.        On  June  18,  1999,  we completed the acquisition of  Technico  S.A.  for approximately $4.1 million and assumed approximately $2.2 million of  Technico's existing debt. The total cost of the acquisition exceeded the fair value of  the net  assets  of  Technico by approximately $2.9 million, which is  preliminarily being  allocated as goodwill, and amortized using the straight-line method  over 40  years.  The  acquisition was financed with additional  borrowings  from  our credit facility.     Fiscal 1998 Transactions        On  March  11,  1998,  Shared  Technologies  Fairchild  Inc.  merged  into Intermedia Communications Inc. Under the terms of the merger, holders of  Shared Technologies  Fairchild  common stock received $15.00  per  share  in  cash.  We received  approximately $178.0 million in cash (before tax and selling expenses) in  exchange for the common and preferred stock of Shared Technologies Fairchild we  owned.   In fiscal 1998, we recorded a $96.0 million gain, net  of  tax,  on disposal of discontinued operations, from the proceeds received from the  merger of  Shared  Technologies  Fairchild  with  Intermedia.  The  results  of  Shared Technologies Fairchild have been accounted for as discontinued operations.        On  November 28, 1997, we acquired AS+C GmbH, Aviation Supply + Consulting in  a  business combination accounted for as a purchase. The total cost  of  the acquisition was $14.0 million, which exceeded the fair value of the  net  assets of  AS+C  by  approximately  $8.1 million, which is allocated  as  goodwill  and amortized  using the straight-line method over 40 years. We purchased AS+C  with cash borrowings. AS+C is an aerospace parts, logistics, and distribution company primarily servicing the European OEM market.        On  December  19,  1997,  we  completed a  secondary  offering  of  public securities.   The offering consisted of an issuance of 3,000,000 shares  of  our Class  A  common stock at $20.00 per share, which generated $57 million  of  net proceeds.  On  December  19,  1997,  immediately  following  the  Offering,   we restructured our FHC and RHI credit agreements by entering into a new six-and-a- half-year  credit  facility  to provide us with a $300  million  senior  secured credit facility consisting of (i) a $75 million revolving loan with a letter  of credit  sub-facility of $30 million and a $10 million swing  loan  sub-facility, and (ii) a $225 million term loan.        On  January  13,  1998,  Banner  Aerospace completed  the  disposition  of substantially  all  of  the assets and certain liabilities  of  certain  of  its subsidiaries to two wholly-owned subsidiaries of AlliedSignal Inc., in  exchange for shares of AlliedSignal common stock with an aggregate value of $369 million. The assets transferred to AlliedSignal consisted primarily of Banner Aerospace's hardware  group,  which  included the distribution  of  bearings,  nuts,  bolts, screws, rivets and other types of fasteners, and its PacAero unit. Approximately $196  million of the common stock received from AlliedSignal Inc.  was  used  to repay  outstanding  term loans of Banner Aerospace's subsidiaries,  and  related fees.        On  February 3, 1998, with the proceeds of the equity offering, term  loan borrowings under the credit facility, and a portion of the after tax proceeds we received from the Shared Technologies Fairchild, we refinanced substantially all of   our  then  existing  indebtedness  (other  than  indebtedness  of  Banner), consisting  of (i) $63.0 million to redeem 11 7/8% Senior Debentures  due  1999; (ii)  $117.6 million to redeem 12% Intermediate Debentures due 2001; (iii) $35.9 million  to redeem 13 1/8% Subordinated Debentures due 2006; (iv) $25.1  million to redeem 13% Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2007; and (vi) accrued interest of $10.6 million.        On  March  2,  1998, we acquired Edwards and Lock Management  Corporation, doing  business as Special-T Fasteners, in a business combination accounted  for as  a purchase. The cost of the acquisition was approximately $50.0 million,  of which 50.1% of the contractual purchase price was paid in shares of our Class  A common  stock  and  49.9% was paid in cash. The total cost  of  the  acquisition exceeded  the  fair value of the net assets of Special-T by approximately  $23.3 million, which is being allocated as goodwill, and amortized using the straight- line  method  over  40  years.   Special-T manages the  logistics  of  worldwide distribution  of  Company-manufactured precision fasteners to customers  in  the aerospace industry, government agencies, OEMs, and other distributors.        On  May  11,  1998, we commenced an offer to exchange, for  each  properly tendered  share  of common stock of Banner, a number of shares of  our  Class  A common stock, par value $0.10 per share, equal to the quotient of $12.50 divided by  $20.675  up  to  a maximum of 4,000,000 shares of Banner Aerospace's  common stock. The exchange offer expired on June 9, 1998 and 3,659,364 shares of Banner Aerospace's  common  stock  were validly tendered for  exchange  and  we  issued 2,212,361 shares Class A common stock to the tendering shareholders.  Fiscal 1997 Transactions        In February 1997, we completed a transaction pursuant to which we acquired common  shares and convertible debt representing an 84.2% interest, on  a  fully diluted basis, of Simmonds S.A. We then initiated a tender offer to purchase the remaining shares and convertible debt held by the public.  By June 30, 1997,  we had  purchased,  or  placed  sufficient cash in  escrow  to  purchase,  all  the remaining shares and convertible debt of Simmonds. The total purchase  price  of Simmonds,  including  the assumption of debt, was approximately  $62.0  million, which  we  funded with available cash and borrowings. We recorded  approximately $20.5  million  in  goodwill  as a result of this acquisition,  which  is  being amortized  using  the straight-line method over 40 years.  Simmonds  is  one  of Europe's  leading  manufacturers and distributors of  aerospace  and  automotive fasteners.        On  June  30,  1997,  we  sold all the patents of  Fairchild  Scandinavian Bellyloading Company to Teleflex Incorporated for $5.0 million, and  immediately thereafter sold all the stock of Fairchild Scandinavian Bellyloading Company  to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Teleflex for $2.0 million.    Consolidated Results       We currently report in two principal business segments: aerospace fasteners and  aerospace  distribution.   The results of  the  Gas  Springs  division  are included  in  the  Corporate  and  Other  classification.  The  following  table illustrates the historical sales and operating income of our operations for  the past three years.    (In thousands)                 For the years ended June 30,                                 1999     1998       1997         Sales by Segment:    Aerospace Fasteners        $442,722  $387,236  $269,026    Aerospace Distribution      168,336   358,431   411,765    Corporate and Other           6,264     5,760    15,185    Eliminations (a)                  -   (10,251)  (15,213)  Total Sales                  $617,322  $741,176  $680,763   Operating Income (Loss) by Segment:    Aerospace Fasteners          38,956    32,722    17,390    Aerospace Distribution      (40,003)   20,330    30,891    Corporate and Other         (44,864)   (7,609)  (14,782)  Total Operating Income (Loss) (b)                    $(45,911)  $45,443   $33,499  (a)  Represents intersegment sales from our aerospace fasteners segment  to  our      aerospace distribution segment. (b)  Fiscal  1999 results include an inventory impairment charges of $41,465  in      the aerospace distribution segment, costs relating to acquisitions of      $23,604 and restructuring charges of $5,526 in the aerospace fasteners      segment, $348 in the aerospace distribution segment, and $500 at corporate.         The  following unaudited pro forma table illustrates sales  and  operating income of our operations by segment, on a pro forma basis, as if we had operated in a consistent manner for the past three years. The pro forma results represent the impact of our merger with Kaynar Technologies (completed in April 1999), our merger  with  Banner  Aerospace (completed in April 1999),  our  acquisition  of Special-T  (effective  January 1998), our disposition of  Solair  (completed  in December  1998),  our disposition of the hardware group (completed  January  13, 1998),  the  disposition of Shared Technologies Fairchild  (completed  in  March 1998),  and  our  disposition  of  Fairchild Scandinavian  Bellyloading  Company (completed  June  30,  1997),  as  if these transactions  had  occurred  at  the beginning  of each period presented. The pro forma information is based  on  the historical  financial  statements  of these  companies,  giving  effect  to  the aforementioned  transactions.  The  pro forma  information  is  not  necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would actually have occurred if the transactions had been in effect since the beginning of each period, nor are they necessarily indicative of our future results.                                   For the years ended June 30,                                 1999     1998       1997         Sales by Segment:    Aerospace Fasteners        $610,200  $630,538  $468,082    Aerospace Distribution      140,017   148,339   117,781    Corporate and Other           6,264     5,760     5,118  Total Sales                  $756,481  $784,637  $590,981   Operating Income (Loss) by Segment:    Aerospace Fasteners          54,426    68,037    32,992    Aerospace Distribution      (20,836)    9,382     8,235    Corporate and Other         (24,396)  (12,439)  (16,385)  Total Operating Income (Loss) (a)                    $  9,194  $ 64,980  $ 24,842  (a)  Fiscal  1999 results include an inventory impairment charge of  $22,145  in      the aerospace distribution segment, costs relating to acquisitions of      $23,604 and restructuring charges of $5,526 in the aerospace fasteners      segment, $348 in the aerospace distribution segment, and $500 at corporate.         Net sales of $617.3 million in 1999 decreased by $123.9 million, or 16.7%, compared  to  sales  of  $741.2 million in 1998. The  decrease  is  attributable primarily  to  the  loss  of revenues resulting from the disposition  of  Banner Aerospace's hardware group and Solair. Approximately 7.3% of the current  year's sales  growth  came  from  acquisitions  in  the  aerospace  fasteners  segment. Divestitures decreased our growth by approximately 21.0% and our internal growth was  down  6.2%. Net sales of $741.2 million in 1998 increased by $60.4 million, or  8.9%,  compared  to  sales  of $680.8 million  in  1997.  Sales  growth  was stimulated   by  the  resurgent  commercial  aerospace  industry  and   business acquisitions,  partially  offset by the loss of revenues  as  a  result  of  the disposition  of Banner Aerospace's hardware group. Approximately  15.8%  of  the 1998 sales growth was stimulated by the resurgent commercial aerospace industry. On  a pro forma basis, net sales decreased 3.6% and increased 32.8% in 1999  and 1998, respectively, as compared to the previous fiscal periods.        Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 18.2%, 25.2% and 26.6% in  1999, 1998,  and  1997, respectively. Included in cost of goods sold for  1999  was  a charge  of  $41.5 million recognized in our aerospace distribution segment  from the disposition of Solair and the potential disposition of Dallas Aerospace.  Of this  charge, $19.3 million was attributable to Solair's bulk sale of  inventory at  prices below this carrying amount.  Excluding these charges, gross margin as a  percentage of sales was 24.9% in fiscal 1999. The lower margins in the fiscal 1999  period  are  attributable  to a change in product  mix  in  our  aerospace distribution  segment as a result of the dispositions. Partially offsetting  the overall  lower  margins  was  an  improvement in margins  within  our  aerospace fasteners  segment  resulting  from acquisitions, efficiencies  associated  with increased  production, improved skills of the work force, and reduction  in  the payment  of  overtime.  Decreased  margins  in  the  fiscal  1998  period   were attributable to a change in product mix in the aerospace distribution segment as a result of the disposition of Banner' Aerospace's hardware group.        Selling,  general & administrative expense as a percentage  of  sales  was 24.2%,  19.1%, and 21.0% in fiscal 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.  Included in  selling, general & administrative expense in fiscal 1999 were $23.6  million of   one-time  costs  associated  primarily  with  the  acquisition  of   Kaynar Technologies.  Excluding these costs, selling, general & administrative  expense as a percentage of sales would have been 20.4% in 1999. This increase in 1999 is attributable to increased environmental expenses. The improvement in fiscal 1998 was  attributable primarily to administrative efficiencies allowed by  increased sales.        Other  income  decreased $2.6 million in 1999 as  compared  to  1998,  and increased  $6.5  million  in 1998 as compared to 1997.  These  changes  are  due primarily  to the fiscal 1998 sale of air rights over a portion of the  property we own and are developing in Farmingdale, New York.        In fiscal 1999, we recorded $6.4 million of restructuring charges. Of this amount, $0.5 million was recorded at our corporate office for severance benefits and  $0.3  million was recorded at our aerospace distribution  segment  for  the write-off  of  building improvements from premises vacated. The  remaining  $5.5 million  was  recorded as a result of the Kaynar Technologies merger integration process  at  our  aerospace  fasteners segment for severance  benefits,  product integration  expenses  incurred as of June 30,  1999,  and  the  write  down  of redundant  fixed  assets. As of June 30, 1999, approximately  one-third  of  the integration   process  has  been  executed.  We  expect  to   incur   additional restructuring  charges  for product integration costs  during  the  next  twelve months  at  our aerospace fasteners segment. We anticipate that our  integration process will be substantially completed by the second quarter of fiscal 2000.       We  reported an operating loss of $45.9 million in fiscal 1999 which was  a decrease  from  operating income of $45.4 million reported in fiscal  1998.  The current  year was affected by $71.4 million of expenses recognized for inventory impairment, restructuring and costs related to acquisitions. Operating income of $45.4  million  in  fiscal 1998 increased $11.9 million, or 35.7%,  compared  to operating  income  of  $33.5 million in fiscal 1997. The increase  in  operating income  was  due  primarily to the improved results in our  aerospace  fasteners segment.       Net interest expense decreased 29.0% in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998 and  decreased 10.4% in fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1997. The decreases  were due  to  a  series  of transactions occurring in fiscal 1998 that  significantly reduced our total debt. We expect interest expense to increase significantly  in the  next  year  as  a  result of additional debt we  incurred  to  finance  the acquisition of Kaynar Technologies.        Investment income (loss), net, was $39.8 million, $(3.4) million, and $6.7 million  in  1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. We recognized a large  gain  in 1999  from  the  liquidation of our position in AlliedSignal to raise  funds  to acquire  Kaynar Technologies.  The $10.1 decrease in 1998 was due to recognition of  unrealized  losses on the fair market adjustments of investments  previously classified  as  trading securities in the fiscal 1998 periods,  while  recording unrealized  gains from trading securities in the fiscal 1997 periods. Unrealized holding  gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments are marked  to  market value   through  stockholders'  equity  and  reported  separately  as  part   of comprehensive income.       Nonrecurring income of $124.0 million in 1998 resulted from the disposition of  Banner Aerospace's hardware group. Nonrecurring income in 1997 included  the $2.5 million gain from the sale of Scandinavian Bellyloading Company.        We  recorded  an  income  tax  benefit of $13.2  million  in  fiscal  1999 representing  a  36.3%  effective  tax rate on pre-tax  losses  from  continuing operations.  The  tax benefit approximates the statutory rate.  The  income  tax provision  of $47.3 million reported in fiscal 1998 represents a 38.3% effective tax  rate  on pre-tax earnings from continuing operations (excluding  equity  in earnings  of  affiliates  and  minority interest) of  $123.4  million.  The  tax provision  was  slightly  higher than the statutory  rate  because  of  goodwill associated with the disposition of Banner Aerospace's hardware group,  which  is not  deductible  for  tax purposes. Income taxes included  a  $7.3  million  tax benefit  in  Fiscal  1997  on  a pre-tax loss of $5.0  million  from  continuing operations.        Equity  in earnings of affiliates decreased $0.8 million in 1999, compared to 1998, and $0.4 million in 1998, compared to 1997. The decreases are primarily attributable  to losses recorded by small start-up ventures. In  July  1999,  we divested  our  31.9%  interest in Nacanco. This will likely  reduce  our  future equity earnings.       Minority interest decreased by $24.2 million in 1999 and increased by $22.8 million  in  1998  as a result of the $124.0 million nonrecurring  pre-tax  gain recognized in 1998 from the disposition of Banner Aerospace's hardware group. On April  8,  1999,  we  completed  a  merger with  Banner  Aerospace,  which  will effectively reduce our future minority interest effects to immaterial amounts.       Included in earnings (loss) from discontinued operations are the results of Fairchild  Technologies  through January 1998, and our  equity  in  earnings  of Shared  Technologies  Fairchild  prior to  the  merger  of  Shared  Technologies Fairchild.  Losses  increased in fiscal 1998 as a  result  of  increased  losses recorded  at  Fairchild  Technologies and lower equity earnings  contributed  by Shared  Technologies  Fairchild.  (See Note  4  to  our  Consolidated  Financial Statements).        In  1998,  we  recorded a $96.0 million gain, net of tax, on  disposal  of discontinued  operations, from the proceeds received from the merger  of  Shared Technologies  Fairchild. This gain was partially offset in connection  with  the adoption  of  a  formal  plan to enhance the opportunities  for  disposition  of Fairchild Technologies. Under this plan we recorded an after-tax charge of $31.3 million and $36.2 million on disposal of discontinued operations in fiscal  1999 and  1998,  respectively. Included in the fiscal 1998 charge, was $28.2  million (net  of an income tax benefit of $11.8 million) for the net losses of Fairchild Technologies  through  June 30, 1998 and $8.0 million  (net  of  an  income  tax benefit  of  $4.8  million)  for  the estimated operating  losses  of  Fairchild Technologies.   The  fiscal  1999  after-tax  operating  loss   from   Fairchild Technologies  exceeded the June 1998 estimate recorded for  expected  losses  by $28.6  million (net of an income tax benefit of $8.1 million) through June 1999. An  additional after-tax charge of $2.8 million (net of an income tax benefit of $2.4  million) was recorded in fiscal 1999, based on a current estimate  of  the remaining  losses in connection with the disposition of Fairchild  Technologies. While  we  believe  that $2.8 million is a reasonable charge for  the  remaining losses  to  be  incurred from Fairchild Technologies, there can be no  assurance that this estimate is adequate.       In fiscal 1999, we recognized an extraordinary loss of $4.2 million, net of tax,  to  write-off the remaining deferred loan fees associated with  the  early extinguishment  of  our  indebtedness pursuant  to  our  acquisition  of  Kaynar Technologies (See Note 8). In fiscal 1998 we recognized an extraordinary loss of $6.7  million,  net of tax, to write-off the remaining deferred  loan  fees  and original   issue   discounts  associated  with  early  extinguishment   of   our indebtedness  pursuant the repayment of all our public debt and  refinancing  of credit facilities.         Comprehensive   income  (loss)  includes  foreign  currency   translation adjustments and unrealized holding changes in the fair market value of available-for-sale  investment  securities. The fair market value  of unrealized  holding securities  declined  by  $16.5 million in fiscal 1999 and increased  by  $20.6 million  in  1998.  The 1999 changes reflect primarily gains realized  from  the liquidation  of  investments,  primarily AlliedSignal common  stock.  The  1998 increase  was  primarily the result of an increase in the value of  AlliedSignal common  stock  which  we  received from the disposition  of  Banner  Aerospace's hardware  group.  Foreign  currency translation adjustments  decreased  by  $2.5 million and $5.1 million in fiscal 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Segment Results  Aerospace Fasteners Segment        Sales  in  the aerospace fasteners segment increased by $55.5  million  to $442.7  million,  up 14.3% in fiscal 1999, compared to fiscal  1998,  reflecting growth  due  primarily  to  the acquisition of Kaynar Technologies.  New  orders stabilized  in  1999 reflecting a plateau  during fiscal 1999 and  ultimately  a slight  downturn in the commercial aerospace industry in the fourth  quarter  of fiscal 1999. Backlog increased by $38 million in fiscal 1999 to $215 million  at June 30, 1999, reflecting the acquisition of Kaynar Technologies. Excluding  $90 million of backlog contributed by Kaynar Technologies, our backlog decreased $52 million. Sales in the aerospace fasteners segment increased by $118.2 million to $387.2  million,  up 43.9% in fiscal 1998, compared to fiscal  1997,  reflecting growth  in  the  commercial  aerospace industry  combined  with  the  effect  of acquisitions.  On  a  pro  forma  basis reflecting  acquisitions  in  comparable periods,  sales  decreased 3.2% in fiscal 1999, compared  to  fiscal  1998,  and increased 34.7% in fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1997        Operating  income  increased by $6.2 million, or 19.1%,  in  fiscal  1999, compared to fiscal 1998.  Included in our 1999 results are restructuring charges of  $5.5 million for integration costs and severance from the integration of our business with the Kaynar Technologies business. Excluding restructuring charges, operating income increased $11.7 million in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998. Excluding  restructuring charges, internal growth was 7.9%  in  fiscal  1999  at operations  we  owned entirely during the period, compared to  the  fiscal  1998 results of these same operations on a pro forma basis. Operating income improved by   $15.3  million,  or  88.2%,  in  fiscal  1998,  compared  to  fiscal  1997. Acquisitions and marketing changes were contributing factors to the fiscal  1998 improvement.  We  anticipate that cost savings resulting from the  manufacturing integration  of  the  Kaynar Technologies business with our  own  business  will further  improve  operating  results in fiscal  2000.  On  a  pro  forma  basis, operating  income decreased $13.6 million in fiscal 1999, as compared to  fiscal 1998 and increased $35.0 million in fiscal 1998, as compared to fiscal 1997.        We  believe the demand for aerospace fasteners in fiscal 2000 will  remain relatively  high in Europe, and expect sluggish demand in the United States.  We anticipate that order rates may start increasing again during the ladder part of fiscal 2000. In the meantime, we believe production volume on a worldwide  basis will  remain at reasonable levels. We expect that our merger integration savings and production efficiency improvements will allow us to generate an increase  in margin.  Aerospace Distribution Segment       Sales in our aerospace distribution segment decreased by $190.1 million, or 53.0%, in fiscal 1999, compared to the fiscal 1998 period, due primarily to  the loss  of  revenues  as  a result of the disposition of the  hardware  group  and Solair.  Sales decreased by $53.3 million, or 13.0% in fiscal 1998, compared  to fiscal  1997. The exclusion of six months' revenues as a result of the  hardware group  disposition was responsible primarily for the decrease in 1998, in  which sales  otherwise  reflected a robust aerospace industry. On a  twelve-month  pro forma  basis, sales decreased $8.3 million, or 5.6%, in 1999 compared  to  1998, and increased $30.6 million, or 25.9%, in 1998 compared to 1997.       Operating income decreased by $60.3 million, in fiscal 1999, as compared to fiscal  1998. A charge of $41.4 million is included in the current year results, in  connection  with  the  sale  of Solair and  the  potential  sale  of  Dallas Aerospace. Excluding these charges, operating income would have decreased  $18.9 million  in  fiscal  1999, compared to the same period of the  prior  year,  due primarily to the disposition of Solair and the hardware group. Operating  income decreased  $10.6  million in fiscal 1998, compared to fiscal 1997,  due  to  the hardware group disposition. On a twelve-month pro forma basis, operating  income decreased $30.2 million in fiscal 1999, compared to fiscal 1998, and was  stable in fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1997.  Corporate and Other        The  Corporate and Other classification includes the Gas Springs  division and  corporate activities. The group reported an 8.8% improvement  in  sales  in fiscal  1999,  compared to fiscal 1998. An operating loss of  $44.9  million  in fiscal  1999  was $37.3 million higher than the operating loss of  $7.6  million reported  in  fiscal 1998. The current year includes $23.6 million  of  one-time costs   associated  primarily  with  the  acquisition  of  Kaynar  Technologies, restructuring  charges, and increased environmental, legal and travel  expenses. Also,  the  prior  year  included other income of $8.6 million,  including  $4.4 million realized as a result of the condemnation of air rights over a portion of the property we own and are developing in Farmingdale, New York.        The  group  reported  a decrease in sales of $9.4  million,  in  1998,  as compared  to  1997, due to the exclusion of Fairchild Scandinavian  Bellyloading results  in fiscal 1998. The operating loss decreased by $7.2 million  in  1998, compared  to  fiscal  1997, as a result of an increase in  other  income  and  a decrease in legal expenses. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES        Total  capitalization  as of June 30, 1999 and  1998  amounted  to  $931.6 million and $789.6 million, respectively. The changes in capitalization included an increase of $208.1 million in debt and a decrease of $66.1 million in equity. The increase in debt was a result of the acquisition of Kaynar Technologies. The decrease  in  equity was due primarily to a $22.1 million purchase  of  treasury stock, the $59.0 million reported loss, and a $19.0 million change in cumulative other comprehensive income, offset partially by the issuance of $22.2 million of our Class A common stock resulting from the merger with Banner Aerospace.        We  maintain a portfolio of investments classified primarily as available- for-sale securities, which had a fair market value of $28.9 million at June  30, 1999. The market value of these investments decreased $16.5 million in 1999  due primarily to the liquidation of investments in which investment income of  $39.8 million  was  realized. While there is risk associated with market  fluctuations inherent  in  stock investments, and because our portfolio it  not  diversified, large   swings  in  its  value  should  be  expected.  In  1999,  we  liquidated substantially all of our AlliedSignal common stock, using the proceeds therefrom in  connection with the acquisition of Kaynar Technologies. In fiscal  1999,  we sold approximately 4.9 million shares of AlliedSignal common stock for aggregate proceeds of approximately $219.9 million.        We  have  an  88-acre  site in Farmingdale, New  York,  of  which  we  are developing  as  a  shopping  center. We have invested  (cash  and  interest)  of approximately $40.4 million, $17.3 million and $6.7 million into this project in 1999,  1998  and 1997, respectively. We estimate funding of approximately  $20.0 million is needed to complete this project.        Net  cash  provided  by  operating activities for fiscal  1999  was  $23.3 million. The primary use of cash for operating activities in fiscal 1999 was  an increase   in   accounts  payable,  accrued  liabilities  and  other   long-term liabilities  of  $45.9 million, partially offset by our net  loss  and  non-cash adjustments of $16.8 million. Net cash used for operating activities for  fiscal 1998  was  $85.2  million. The primary use of cash for operating  activities  in fiscal 1998 was a $54.9 million increase in inventories.        Net  cash used for investing activities for fiscal 1999 was $99.2  million and  included $274.4 million used for acquisitions, partially offset  by  $189.4 million  received  from the liquidation of investments. Net cash  provided  from investing  activities  for fiscal 1998 was $43.6 million and  included  proceeds received  from  the  disposition of discontinued  operations,  including  Shared Technologies Fairchild, of $168.0 million. This was slightly offset by cash used for  the acquisition of subsidiaries and minority interests of $32.8 million and $26.4 million, respectively.       Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 1999 and 1998 was $81.2 million  and $74.1 million, respectively. Cash provided by financing  activities in fiscal 1999 included the issuance of additional debt of $483.2 million offset partially  by  $380.0 million of debt repayments and $22.1 million  of  treasury stock  purchased.  We increased our debt in fiscal 1999,  as  a  result  of  the acquistion  of  Kaynar  Technologies. Cash provided by financing  activities  in fiscal  1998  included the issuance $53.8 million of stock from our 1998  equity offering  and  $275.5  million from the issuance of  additional  debt  partially offset  by  the  repayment of debt and the repurchase of  debentures  of  $258.0 million.          Our   principal   cash  requirements  include  debt   service,   capital expenditures, acquisitions, and payment of other liabilities. Other  liabilities that  require  the  use  of cash include postretirement benefits,  environmental investigation   and  remediation  obligations,  real  estate  development,   and litigation  settlements and related costs.  We expect that cash  on  hand,  cash generated  from  operations, and cash from borrowings and asset  sales  will  be adequate to satisfy our cash requirements in fiscal 2000.  Discontinued Operations        In  fiscal  1999,  1998,  and  1997, Fairchild  Technologies  had  pre-tax operating  losses  of  approximately $49.5  million,  $48.7  million,  and  $3.6 million,  respectively. In addition, as a result of the downturn  in  the  Asian markets, Fairchild Technologies experienced delivery deferrals, reduction in new orders,  lower margins and increased price competition. In response, in February 1998,  we  adopted a formal plan for the disposition of Fairchild  Technologies. The  plan  called  for  a  reduction in production  capacity  and  headcount  at Fairchild  Technologies  and the pursuit of potential  vertical  and  horizontal integration  with  peers  and competitors of the two divisions  that  constitute Fairchild Technologies.         During  the  fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, we liquidated  a  significant portion  of  Fairchild  Technologies  mostly  consisting  of  our  semiconductor equipment group through several transactions.  On April 14, 1999, we disposed of our  photoresist  deep  ultraviolet track equipment machines,  spare  parts  and testing  equipment to Apex Co., Ltd. in exchange for 1,250,000  shares  of  Apex stock  valued at approximately $5.1 million. On June 15, 1999, we received  $7.9 million from Suess Microtec AG and the right to receive 350,000 shares of  Suess Microtec stock (or approximately $3.5 million) by June 2000 in exchange for  all of the fixed assets and inventory of Fairchild Technologies SEG GmbH and certain intellectual  property.  On May 1, 1999, we sold Fairchild  CDI  for  a  nominal amount. Subsequent to June 30, 1999, we received approximately $7.1 million from Novellus  in  exchange  for  our  Low-K  dielectric  product  line  and  certain intellectual  property.  We are also exploring several alternative  transactions regarding the Fairchild Technologies optical disc equipment group business,  but we have not made any definitive arrangement for its ultimate disposition.  Uncertainty of the Spin-Off        In  order to focus our operations on the aerospace industry, we have  been considering for some time distributing to our stockholders certain of our assets via  distribution of all of the stock of a new entity, which may own  all  or  a substantial part of our non-aerospace operations. We are still in the process of deciding  the exact composition of the assets and liabilities to be included  in the  spin-off,  but such assets would be likely to include certain  real  estate interests. Our ability to consummate the spin-off, if we should choose to do so, would  be contingent, among other things, on attaining certain milestones  under our  credit  facility,  or waivers thereof, and all necessary  governmental  and third party approvals. There is no assurance that we will be able to reach  such milestones or obtain the necessary waivers from our lenders. In addition, we may encounter  unexpected  delays in effecting the spin-off,  and  we  can  make  no assurance  as  to  the timing thereof, or as to whether the spin-off  will  ever occur.       Depending on the ultimate structure and timing of the spin-off, it may be a taxable  transaction  to our stockholders and could result  in  a  material  tax liability  to  us as well as our stockholders. The amount of the tax  to  us  is uncertain, and if the tax is material to us, we may elect not to consummate  the spin-off.  Because  circumstances may change  and  provisions  of  the  Internal Revenue  Code of 1986, as amended, may be further amended from time to time,  we may,  depending on various factors, restructure or delay the timing of the spin- off to minimize the tax consequences to us and our stockholders, or elect not to consummate the spin-off.  Under the spin-off, it is expected that that the newly created  entity  may  assume  certain of our liabilities,  including  contingent liabilities, and may indemnify us for such liabilities. In the event this entity is  unable  to satisfy the liabilities, which it will assume in connection  with the spin-off, we may have to satisfy such liabilities.  Year 2000        As  the end of the century nears, there is a widespread concern that  many existing data processing devices that use only the last two digits to refer to a year  will  not  properly recognize a year that begins with  the  digits  ''20'' instead of ''19.'' If not properly modified, these data processing devices could fail,  create erroneous results, or cause unanticipated systems failures,  among other  problems. In response, we have developed a worldwide Year 2000  readiness plan that is divided into a number of interrelated and overlapping phases. These phases   include   corporate  awareness  and  planning,  readiness   assessment, evaluation  and  prioritization  of solutions,  implementation  of  remediation, validation testing, and contingency planning. Each is discussed below.       Awareness.  In the corporate awareness and planning phase, we formed a Year 2000  project group under the direction of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Information Officer, identified and designated key personnel within the  company to  coordinate  our  Year  2000 efforts, and retained the  services  of  outside technical  review  and modification consultants. The project group  prepared  an overall  schedule and working budget for our Year 2000 plan. We  have  completed this  phase  of  our  Year  2000 plan. We evaluate  our  information  technology applications  regularly, and based on such evaluation revise  the  schedule  and budget  to  reflect the progress of our Year 2000 readiness efforts.  The  Chief Financial  Officer  and  Chief  Information  Officer  regularly  report  to  our management and to our audit committee on the status of the Year 2000 project.        Assessment.   In the readiness assessment phase, we, in coordination  with our   technical  review  consultants,  have  been  evaluating  our   Year   2000 preparedness  in  a  number  of  areas,  including  our  information  technology infrastructure,  external resources, physical plant and  production  facilities, equipment and machinery, products and inventory. We have completed this phase of our  Year  2000  Plan.  Pending the completion of  all  validation  testing,  we continue to review on a regular basis all aspects of our Year 2000 preparedness. In this respect, we have designated officers at each of our business segments to provide  regular assessment updates to our Chief Information Officer and outside consultants,  who  have assimilated a range of alternative methods  to  complete each phase of our Year 2000 plan and are reporting regularly their findings  and conclusions to our management.        Evaluation.  In the evaluation and prioritization of solutions  phase,  we seek  to develop potential solutions to the Year 2000 issues identified  in  our readiness  assessment  phase, consider those solutions in  light  of  our  other information   technology  and  business  priorities,  prioritize   the   various remediation tasks, and develop an implementation schedule. This phase is largely complete.  However, we will continue to evaluate our Year 2000 readiness  status through  November  15, 1999, when all validation testing is  anticipated  to  be complete.  However, identified problems will be corrected as soon as practicable after  identification.  To date, we have not identified  any  major  information technology system or non-information technology system that must be replaced  in its  entirety for Year 2000 reasons. We have also determined that  most  of  the Year   2000   issues  identified  in  the  assessment  phase  can  be  addressed satisfactorily  through system modifications, component  upgrades  and  software patches.  Thus,  we do not presently anticipate incurring any  material  systems replacement costs relating to the Year 2000 issues.        Implementation.  In the implementation of remediation phase, we, with  the assistance  of  our  technical  review and modification  consultants,  began  to implement  the  proposed  solutions  to any identified  Year  2000  issues.  The solutions  include  equipment  and  component  upgrades,  systems  and  software patches,   reprogramming  and  resetting  machines,  and  other   modifications. Substantially  all  of the material systems within the aerospace  fasteners  and aerospace  distribution segments of our business are currently Year 2000  ready. However, we are continuing to evaluate and implement Year 2000 modifications  to embedded data processing technology in certain manufacturing equipment  used  in our aerospace fasteners segment.        Testing.  In the validation testing phase, we seek to evaluate and confirm the  results of our Year 2000 remediation efforts. In conducting our  validation testing,  we  are  using,  among  other things,  proprietary  testing  protocols developed  internally and by our technical review and modification  consultants, as well as testing tools such as Greenwich Mean Time's Check 2000 and SEMATECH's Year  2000 Readiness Testing Scenarios Version 2.0. The Greenwich tools identify potential  Year  2000-related  software and  data  problems,  and  the  SEMATECH protocols validate the ability of data processing systems to rollover  and  hold transition  dates.  Testing  for both the aerospace fasteners  segment  and  the aerospace distribution segment is approximately 90 percent complete.   To  date, the  results of our validation testing have not revealed any new and significant Year  2000  issues or any ineffective remediation. We have completed testing  of our most critical information technology and related systems.       Contingency Planning.  In the contingency planning phase, we, together with our  technical review consultants, are assessing the Year 2000 readiness of  our key  suppliers,  distributors,  customers and  service  providers.  Toward  that objective,  we  have sent letters, questionnaires and surveys  to  our  business partners,  inquiring about their Year 2000 readiness arrangements.  The  average response  rate has been approximately 55 percent, including our most significant business  partners  have  responded to our inquiries. In  this  phase,  we  have evaluated  the risks that our failure or the failure of others to be  Year  2000 ready  would cause a material disruption to, or have a material effect  on,  our financial condition, business or operations. So far, we have identified only our aerospace fasteners MRP system as being both mission critical and potentially at risk.  In  mitigation  of this concern, we have engaged a  consultant  to  test, evaluate  and  implement the manufacturer-designed Year  2000  patches  for  the system.   We are also developing and evaluating contingency plans to  deal  with events  arising from significant Year 2000 issues outside of our infrastructure. In   this  regard,  we  are  considering  the  advisability  of  augmenting  our inventories of certain raw materials and finished products, securing  additional sources for certain supplies and services, arranging for back-up utilities,  and exploring alternate distribution and sales channels, among other things.       The following chart summarizes our progress, by phase and business segment, in completing the Year 2000 plan:                           Percentage of Year 2000 Plan Completed                          (By Phase and Business Segment)                                      Quarter Ended                  Sept.Dec.

To date,  the  costs associated  with our Year 2000 efforts have not had a material  effect  on,  and have caused no delays with respect to, our other information technology programs or projects.        We anticipate that we will complete our Year 2000 preparations by November 15, 1999. Although our Year2000 implementation, testing and contingency planning phases  are not yet complete, we do not currently believe that Year 2000  issues will  materially  affect  our  business,  results  of  operations  or  financial condition. However, in some international markets in which we conduct  business, the  level of awareness and remediation efforts by third parties, utilities  and infrastructure  managers relating to the Year 2000 issue may  be  less  advanced than  in  the United States, which could, despite our efforts, have  an  adverse effect on us. If our mission critical systems are not Year 2000 ready, we  could be  subject  to  significant business interruptions,  and  could  be  liable  to customers  and other third parties for breach of contract, breach  of  warranty, misrepresentation, unlawful trade practices and other claims.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS        In  June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS 133 establishes  a  new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging  activities and  supersedes  and  amends  a  number of existing  accounting  standards.   It requires  that  all derivatives be recognized as assets and liabilities  on  the balance sheet and measured at fair value.  The corresponding derivative gains or losses  are  reported  based  on the hedge relationship  that  exists,  if  any. Changes  in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated  as hedges  or  that  do not meet the hedge accounting criteria  in  SFAS  133,  are required  to  be reported in earnings.  Most of the general qualifying  criteria for  hedge accounting under SFAS 133 were derived from, and are similar to,  the existing  qualifying  criteria in SFAS 80 "Accounting  for  Futures  Contracts." SFAS 133 describes three primary types of hedge relationships: fair value hedge, cash  flow  hedge,  and foreign currency hedge. In June 1999,  the  FASB  issued Statement  of  Financial  Accounting Standards No. 137  to  defer  the  required effective  date of implementing SFAS 133 from fiscal years beginning after  June 15,  1999 to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. We will adopt SFAS  133 in fiscal 2001 and we are currently evaluating the financial statement impact.  ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK        The  table  below  provides  information about  our  derivative  financial instruments  and other financial instruments that are sensitive  to  changes  in interest rates, which include interest rate swaps. For interest rate swaps,  the table  presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual)  maturity  dates.  Notional amounts  are  used  to  calculate  the contractual  payments  to  be  exchanged under the  contract.  Weighted  average variable  rates  are based on implied forward rates in the yield  curve  at  the reporting date.
