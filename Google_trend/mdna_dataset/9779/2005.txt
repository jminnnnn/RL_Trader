ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION               The Fairchild Corporation was incorporated in October 1969, under the laws of the State of Delaware. We have 100% ownership interests (directly and indirectly) in Fairchild Holding Corp. and Banner Aerospace Holding Company I, Inc. Fairchild Holding Corp. is the owner (directly and indirectly) of Republic Thunderbolt, LLC and effective November 1, 2003 and January 2, 2004, acquired ownership interests in Hein Gericke, PoloExpress, and IFW. Our principal operations are conducted through these entities. Our consolidated financial statements present the results of our former fastener business, Fairchild Aerostructures, and APS, as discontinued operations.              The following discussion and analysis provide information which management believes is relevant to the assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.     CAUTIONARY STATEMENT               Certain statements in this filing contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to our financial condition, results of operation and business. These statements relate to analyses and other information, which are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements also relate to our future prospects, developments and business strategies. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, predict, project, will and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including current trend information, projections for deliveries, backlog and other trend estimates that may cause our actual future activities and results of operations to be materially different from those suggested or described in this financial discussion and analysis by management. These risks include: our ability to finance and successfully operate our retail businesses; our ability to accurately predict demand for our products; our ability to receive timely deliveries from vendors; our ability to raise cash to meet seasonal demands; our dependence on the retail and aerospace industries; our ability to maintain customer satisfaction and deliver products of quality; our ability to properly assess our competition; our ability to improve our operations to profitability status; our ability to liquidate non-core assets to meet cash needs; our ability to attract and retain highly qualified executive management; our ability to achieve and execute internal business plans; weather conditions in Europe during peak business season and on weekends; labor disputes; competition; worldwide political instability and economic growth; military conflicts, including terrorist activities; infectious diseases; and the impact of any economic downturns and inflation.              If one or more of these and other risks or uncertainties materializes, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those expected, estimated or projected. Given these uncertainties, users of the information included in this financial discussion and analysis by management, including investors and prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update the forward-looking statements included in this filing, even if new information, future events or other circumstances have made them incorrect or misleading.     CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES               On December 12, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Release No. 33-8040, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies. Critical accounting policies are those that involve subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates. In response to Release No. 33-8040, we reviewed our accounting policies. The following areas require the use of judgments and estimates: the valuation of long-lived assets, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, pension and postretirement benefits, income taxes, environmental and litigation accruals and revenue recognition. Estimates in each of these areas are based on historical experience and a variety of assumptions that we believe are appropriate. Actual results may differ from these estimates.               Valuation of Long-Lived Assets:  We review our long-lived assets for impairment, including property, plant and equipment, and identifiable intangibles with definite lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. To determine recoverability of our long-lived assets, we evaluate the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be greater than the carrying amount of our assets. Impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount of our assets and their estimated fair value.               Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets With Indefinite Lives:  Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite lives are not amortized. Instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life, these assets are tested for impairment annually, or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist.               Pension and Postretirement Benefits:  We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our employees. Our funding policy is to make the minimum annual contribution required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or local statutory law. The accumulated benefit obligation for pensions and postretirement benefits was determined using a discount rate of 5.625% and 6.0% at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and an estimated return on plan assets of 8.5% at September 30, 2005 and 2004. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. For measurement purposes, in 2005, we assumed a 10.0% annual rate of increase in the cost per capita of claims covered under health care benefits. Beginning in 2006, the trend rate is assumed to decrease each year by 0.5% to a rate of 5% in 2016 and remain at that level thereafter. The effect of any change in these assumptions may result in a large change to the accumulated benefit obligation.               Deferred and Noncurrent Income Taxes:  Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. All of our deferred tax assets were fully reserved at September 30, 2005 and September 30, 2004.               Environmental Matters:  Our current and prior operations are subject to stringent government imposed environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of materials into the environment and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. To date, such laws and regulations have had a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or net cash flows, and we have expended, and can be expected to expend in the future, significant amounts for the investigation of environmental conditions and installation of environmental control facilities, remediation of environmental conditions and other similar matters.              In connection with our plans to dispose of certain real estate, we must investigate environmental conditions and we may be required to take certain corrective action prior or pursuant to any such disposition. In addition, we have identified several areas of potential contamination related to other facilities owned, or previously owned, by us, which may require us either to take corrective action or to contribute to a clean-up. We are also a defendant in several lawsuits and proceedings seeking to require us to pay for investigation or remediation of environmental matters, and for injuries to persons or property allegedly caused thereby, and we have been alleged to be a potentially responsible party at various superfund sites. At least once each calendar quarter, we thoroughly review our environmental matters and adjust our accrual to equal the estimated probable amount that it will cost us in connection with these matters. We believe that we have recorded adequate accruals in our consolidated financial statements to complete such investigation and take any necessary corrective actions or make any necessary contributions or other payments. No amounts have been recorded as due from third parties, including insurers, or set off against, any environmental liability, unless such parties are contractually obligated to contribute and are not disputing such liability.               Legal Matters:  We are involved in various other claims and lawsuits incidental to our business. We, either on our own or through our insurance carriers, are contesting these matters. At the end of each calendar quarter, we thoroughly review our legal matters and adjust our accrual to equal the estimated probable amount that it will cost us in connection with these matters. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future results of operations, or net cash flows.               Revenue Recognition:  Revenues are recognized immediately upon the sale of merchandise by our retail stores. Sales and related costs are recognized on shipment of products and/or performance of services, when collection is probable. Lease and rental revenue are recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Shipping and handling amounts billed to customers are classified as revenues.      EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW               Our business consists of three segments: sports & leisure, aerospace, and real estate operations. Our sports & leisure segment is engaged in the design and retail sale of protective clothing, helmets and technical accessories for motorcyclists in Europe and the design and distribution of such apparel and helmets in the United States. Our aerospace segment stocks a wide variety of aircraft parts, then distributes them to commercial airlines and air cargo carriers, fixed-base operators, corporate aircraft operators and other aerospace companies worldwide. Our real estate operations segment owns and leases a shopping center located in Farmingdale, New York, and owns and rents two improved parcels located in Southern California.              For the year ended September 30, 2005, we reported a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $30.6 million, as compared to a loss of $18.0 million in 2004. The increased loss resulted primarily from poor operating results by Hein Gericke and IFW in our sports and leisure segment. Our loss in fiscal 2005 contributed significantly to our $14.0 million use of cash in our operating activities. As of September 30, 2005, we have unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $23.3 million, and available borrowing under lines of credit of $9.9 million. In addition, we expect to receive net cash of $12.5 million from Alcoa in February 2006, under the terms of our 2002 sale agreement and $3.0 million in January 2006, related to the settlement of our stockholders derivative litigation.              We have undertaken a number of actions, which we believe will improve the results of Hein Gericke in 2006 and beyond including:      Management changes, with emphasis on enhancing logistics.   Implementation of a new computer system which provides improved sales and inventory management information and enhances operational efficiencies.  Implementation of an online sales shop.            In addition, we plan to:     Improve our operational efficiency by reducing back office overhead expenses, and in particular limit the reliance upon outside consultants and outside service providers.   Promote our online internet shop.   Identify strategic markets outside of Germany and the United Kingdom for possible expansion.           We expect that cash on hand, cash proceeds due to us from Alcoa and the stockholder derivative litigation, cash available from lines of credit, and proceeds received from dispositions of short-term investments, will be adequate to satisfy our cash requirements during the next twelve months.              In order to improve our liquidity, on December 21, 2005, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our Farmingdale, New York, power shopping center, Airport Plaza, to KRC Acquisition Corp., acting on behalf of a joint venture comprised of Kimco Realty Corporation and a fund managed by a major investment bank, for approximately $95 million. The purchaser has agreed to deposit into escrow $4.75 million to ensure its obligations and to seek the approval of our mortgage lender to assume our existing mortgage loan of approximately $53.8 million, or to defease the loan. The closing will take place following purchasers obtaining consent of the mortgage lender to its loan assumption, which could occur as early as February 2006. If the loan is defeased, the transaction may not close until as late as July 2006. The sale does not include several other undeveloped parcels of real estate that we own in the Town, the largest of which is under contract of sale to the market chain, Stew Leonards. We decided to sell the shopping center to enhance our financial flexibility, allowing us to invest in existing operations or pursue other opportunities.              Our cash needs are generally the highest during the second and third quarters of our fiscal year, when our sports and leisure segment purchases inventory in advance of the spring and summer selling seasons.              During fiscal 2005, we had an 7.0 million (approximately $8.4 million) seasonal facility to help fund these cash needs. That facility was repaid and has expired. In December 2005, the Guaranty Committee of the German State of North Rhine Westphalia recommended approval for an 80% guaranteed seasonal financing facility, up to 11.0 million. One German bank has committed to provide funding for 5.5 million (approximately $6.6 million) of the seasonal facility and we anticipate completion of approval, loan agreements, and funding in January 2006. We are holding ongoing discussions with a second German bank, to receive a commitment for the remaining 5.5 million of the seasonal facility, but we have not received a positive indication that it will be approved. If we are unable to obtain a commitment from a second bank, we believe that our cash resources will be sufficient to meet our seasonal needs.          In December 2005, we entered into discussions with an investment bank concerning our capital requirements. On December 26, 2005, we engaged the investment bank to provide us, among other things, with a commitment to place a short-term loan to us of $20 million, against our agreement to sell our shopping center to KRC Acquisition Corp. The investment bank has indicated to us that it is highly confident that it can consummate the loan, if needed, during the period of our seasonal trough.             In the event that our cash needs are substantially higher than projected, particularly during our seasonal trough, we will take additional actions to generate the required cash. These actions may include one or any combination of the following:     Liquidating investments and other non-core assets.   Obtaining and utilizing borrowings available to us under a bridge financing agreement collateralized by the expected proceeds to be received from the sale of our shopping center.    Eliminating, reducing, or delaying all non-essential services provided by outside parties, including consultants.   Significantly reducing our corporate overhead expenses.   Settling our $100 million interest rate swap agreement, which we have $2.5 million of restricted funds in excess of our remaining liability.   Delaying purchases of inventory.            However, if we need to implement one or more of  these actions, there nevertheless remains some uncertainty that we will actually receive a sufficient amount of cash in time to meet all of our needs during the seasonal trough.  Even if sufficient cash is realized, any  or all of these actions may have adverse affects on our operating results and/or businesses.      During the next several months, we plan to:     Consummate the closing of our shopping center sale.   Generate additional cash from borrowings and/or the sale of other non-core assets to support our operations and corporate needs.   Implement the terms of a settlement of the stockholders derivative litigation.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS               Significant Business Transactions             On November 1, 2003, we acquired for $45.5 million (39.0 million) substantially all of the worldwide business of Hein Gericke and the capital stock of Intersport Fashions West (IFW) from the Administrator for Eurobike AG in Germany. Also on November 1, 2003, we acquired for $23.4 million (20.0 million) from the Administrator for Eurobike AG and from two subsidiaries of Eurobike AG all of their respective ownership interests in PoloExpress and receivables owed to them by PoloExpress. We used available cash from investments that were sold to pay the Administrator $14.8 million (12.5 million) on November 1, 2003, and borrowed $54.1 million (46.5 million) from the Administrator at a rate of 8%, per annum. On May 5, 2004 we received financing from two German banks and paid the note due to the Administrator. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $68.9 million (59.0 million), including $15.0 million (12.9 million) of cash acquired.              On January 2, 2004, we acquired for $18.8 million (15.0 million) all but 7.5% of the interest owned by Mr. Klaus Esser in PoloExpress. Mr. Esser retained a 7.5% ownership interest in PoloExpress, but Fairchild has the right to call this interest at any time from March 2007 to October 2008, for a fixed purchase price of 12.3 million ($14.8 million at September 30, 2005). Mr. Esser has the right to put such interest to us at any time during April of 2008 for 12.0 million ($14.5 million at September 30, 2005). On January 2, 2004, we used available cash to pay Mr. Esser $18.8 million (15.0 million) and provided collateral of $15.0 million (12.0 million) to a German bank to issue a guarantee to Mr. Esser to secure the price for the put Mr. Esser has a right to exercise in April of 2008. The transaction includes an agreement with Mr. Esser under which he agrees with us not to compete with PoloExpress for two years. On October 18, 2005, we reached an agreement with Mr. Esser, regarding his continued employment, and entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Esser through December 31, 2008. Through September 30, 2005, in addition to his base salary, Mr. Esser received a profit distribution of approximately 0.6 million, which reduces, on a Euro for Euro basis, the call or put option price we must pay for his interest. As of September 30, 2005, the 11.4 million ($13.8 million) collateralized obligation for the put option, net of distributions, was included in other long-term liabilities. The 11.4 million ($13.8 million) restricted cash is invested in a capital protected investment and money market funds, and is included in long-term investments.              The total purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired by approximately $34.0 million. The excess of the purchase price over net tangible assets was all allocated to identifiable intangible assets, including brand names Hein Gericke and Polo, and reflected in goodwill and intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2005. Since their acquisition on November 1, 2003, we have consolidated the results of Hein Gericke, PoloExpress and IFW into our financial statements.              Hein Gericke, PoloExpress and IFW are included in our segment known as sports & leisure. Our sports & leisure segment is a highly seasonal business, with an historic trend for higher volumes of sales and profits during March through September, when the weather in Europe is more favorable for individuals to use their motorcycles than during October to February. We acquired these companies because we believe they have potential growth, and may provide a platform for other entrees into related leisure businesses. The acquired companies are European leaders of this industry, and opportunities for expansion are significant in Europe and the United States. Hein Gericke currently operates 145 retail shops in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. PoloExpress currently operates 87 retail shops in Germany and one shop in Switzerland. IFW, located in Tustin, California, is a designer and distributor of motorcycle accessories, protective and other apparel, and helmets, under several labels, including Hein Gericke. In addition, IFW designs and produces apparel under private labels for third parties. IFW also distributes in the United States, products manufactured by or for other companies, under their own label. The acquisition has lessened our dependence on the aerospace industry.              On June 24, 2005, we completed the sale of our Fairchild Aerostructures business for $6.0 million to PCA Aerospace. The cash received from PCA Aerospace is subject to a post-closing adjustment based upon the net working capital of the business on January 1, 2005, compared with its net working capital as of June 24, 2005, which we have estimated to be approximately $1.5 million, and is included in accounts receivable at September 30, 2005. PCA Aerospace disputes the working capital post-closing adjustment, and also alleges that we owe PCA Aerospace $4.4 million. We have notified PCA Aerospace of our dispute of these claims. In connection with the sale, we have deposited with an escrow agent approximately $0.4 million to secure indemnification obligations we may have to PCA Aerospace. The escrow period is eighteen months. We decided to sell Fairchild Aerostructures, which was included in our aerospace segment, because we believe we received adequate fair value for a business whose performance was below our expectations and because its business was unrelated to other businesses we own. We used $0.9 million of the proceeds from the sale to repay a portion of our CIT revolving credit facility and we plan to use the remaining proceeds from the sale to reinvest in our existing operations. In 2005, we recorded a $1.1 million gain on the disposal of discontinued operations, as a result of the sale of Fairchild Aerostructures.              On December 3, 2002, we completed the sale of our fastener business to Alcoa Inc. for approximately $657 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. During the four-year period from 2003 to 2006, we are entitled to receive additional cash proceeds of $0.4 million for each commercial aircraft delivered by Boeing and Airbus in excess of stated threshold levels, up to a maximum of $12.5 million per year. Deliveries exceeded the threshold aircraft delivery level needed for us to earn the full $12.5 million contingent payment for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accordingly, we recognized a $12.5 million gain on disposal of discontinued operations in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004.The remaining threshold aircraft delivery levels are 570 in 2005; and 650 in 2006. On December 3, 2002, we deposited with an escrow agent $25 million to secure indemnification obligations we may have to Alcoa. The escrow period remains in effect to December 3, 2007, but funds may be held longer if claims are timely asserted and remain unresolved. The escrow is classified in long-term investments on our balance sheet. In addition, for a period ending on December 3, 2007, we are required to maintain our corporate existence, take no action to cause our own liquidation or dissolution, and take no action to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock.            Consolidated Results             Because of the November 1, 2003 acquisition of Hein Gericke, PoloExpress, and IFW, collectively now known as Fairchild Sports, and the sale of the fasteners business on December 3, 2002, the discussion below cannot be relied upon as a trend of our future results. Additionally, Fairchild Sports is a highly seasonal business, with a historic trend of a higher volume of sales and profits during the months of March through September.              We currently report in three principal business segments: sports & leisure, aerospace, and real estate operations. The following table provides the revenues and operating income (loss) of our segments on a historical and pro forma basis for the years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, the three month transition period ended September 30, 2003, and the year ended June 30, 2003, respectively. The pro forma results represent the impact of our acquisition of Hein Gericke, PoloExpress, and IFW, as if this transaction had occurred at the beginning of each of our fiscal periods. The pro forma information is based on the historical financial statements of these companies, giving effect to the aforementioned transactions. The prior period historical results of the operations and entities we acquired are based upon the best information available to us and these financial statements were not audited. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations, that would actually have occurred if the transactions had been in effect since the beginning of each fiscal period, nor are they necessarily indicative of our future results.

The fiscal 2003 operating results include impairment expenses of $6.6 million to write down goodwill at our aerospace segment and a $0.1 million write down of intangible assets of a start-up company in our corporate and other segment.                 Revenues increased by $24.4 million, or 7.4%, in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004. The increase in fiscal 2005 was due to the prior period only including eleven months of activity from our acquisition of Hein Gericke, PoloExpress and IFW on November 1, 2003, our foreign sales benefiting from a stronger Euro as compared to the U.S. dollar, and increased sales at our aerospace segment. Revenues increased by $259.7 million in fiscal 2004, as compared to fiscal 2003. The increase was due primarily to the acquisition of Hein Gericke, PoloExpress and IFW on November 1, 2003. Revenues in fiscal 2004 also benefited from increased revenues at our aerospace segment and real estate operations segment. In fiscal 2003, the aerospace industry was adversely affected by the attacks of September 11, 2001, and weakness in the overall economy. During this period, reduction in travel and financial difficulties of major commercial airlines affected the demand for products we sell at our aerospace businesses.              Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 38.1%, 38.3%, 24.7%, and 25.7%, in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004, the three month transition period ended September 30, 2003, and fiscal 2003, respectively. The current year change in margins reflects a slight reduction in margins at our sports & leisure segment. The improvement in margins in the other periods reflects the higher gross margins earned from retail sales at the sports & leisure segment, which was acquired on November 1, 2003. Gross margin as a percentage of rental revenue at our real estate segment was 36.3%, 32.0%, 39.8%, and 34.9%, in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004, the three month transition period ended September 30, 2003, and fiscal 2003, respectively.              Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $19.0 million in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004, due primarily to us owning our sports & leisure segment for 11 months in fiscal 2004, and $5.0 million of the increase due to a stronger Euro as compared to the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2005. Selling, general and administrative expense for fiscal 2003, includes $1.1 million of severance expense, $13.7 million of one-time change of control payments required under contracts with our top four executives as a result of the sale of our fastener business, and $10.4 million of bonuses awarded to our top four executives as a result of the sale of our fasteners business. The top four executives have also relinquished their right to any other future change of control payments. Excluding these items, selling, general & administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was 44.7%, 42.2%, 56.0%, and 59.7%, in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004, the three month transition period ended September 30, 2003, and fiscal 2003, respectively.             Pension and postretirement expense primarily includes inactive and retired employees of businesses that we sold and retained the pension and postretirement liability. At September 30, 2005, only approximately fifty of our current employees are active participants in these plans. Pension and postretirement expense increased by $0.2 million in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004.             Other income decreased by $3.6 million in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004, due primarily to $1.6 million of proceeds received from a title insurance claim settlement recognized in fiscal 2004 and $1.0 million of foreign currency gains recognized in fiscal 2004, as compared to foreign currency losses of $0.2 million in fiscal 2005. Other income increased $0.4 million in fiscal 2004, as compared to fiscal 2003, due primarily other income recognized at our sports & leisure segment from shop partner reimbursements of costs, offsetting income recognized in 2003 from the sale of non-core assets.              Impairment charges of $2.9 million, $1.2 million, $6.7 million, were recognized in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The fiscal 2005 and 2004 results represent primarily impairment expenses to write down the value of a landfill development partnership, in which we are a limited partner and were required to consolidate in accordance with FASB Interpretation 46R beginning January 1, 2004. A recent decision by us to no longer provide funds to the landfill development partnership caused the additional impairment recognition in fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2003 impairment charges included $6.6 million to write down goodwill at our aerospace segment and a $0.1 million write down of intangible assets of a start-up company in our corporate and other segment.              Restructuring charges of $0.6 million in 2004 included the costs to close all fifteen of the GoTo Helmstudio retail locations in Germany. All of the charges were the direct result of activities that occurred as of June 30, 2004. The restructuring charges included an accrual for the remaining lease costs of the closed stores, the write-off of store fittings, and for severance. These costs were classified as restructuring and were the direct result of a formal plan to close the GoTo Helmstudio locations and terminate its employees. Such costs are nonrecurring in nature. Other than a reduction in our existing cost structure, none of the restructuring costs will result in future increases in earnings or represent an accrual of future costs of our ongoing business.              Operating loss for 2005, 2004, and 2003 was $27.6 million, $13.0million, and $48.9 million, respectively. The $14.6 million increase in operating loss in 2005, as compared to 2004, was due primarily to a $12.7 million decrease in operating income at our sports and leisure segment (see segment discussion below). Operating loss for 2003, includes the $13.7 million of one-time change of control payments required under contracts with our top four executives as a result of the sale of the fastener business, and $10.4 million of bonuses awarded to our top four executives as a result of the sale of the fasteners business. In addition, the operating loss for 2003 includes the $6.6 million goodwill impairment at our aerospace segment and $1.1 million of severance expense.              Net interest expense increased by 9.9%, or $1.3 million, in fiscal 2005 to $15.0 million, as compared to fiscal 2004, due primarily to a $0.6 million increase in non-cash interest,  from an increase in deferred loan fees expensed in the current period and a higher average outstanding debt obtained in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004.  Net interest expense was $13.6 million and $24.2 million in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. The results for 2003 included interest expense, prior to the repayment in December 2002, of all of our then outstanding senior subordinated notes, term loan and revolving credit facilities. These repayments were made from proceeds of the sale of the fastener business on December 3, 2002.              Investment income was $6.0 million for fiscal 2005, and included $5.3 million of stock and dividends received from the demutalization of an insurance company, $0.5 million in other dividend income, $0.2 million of realized gains from the sale of investments, and a $0.8 million increase in the fair market value of investments classified as trading securities, offset partially by a $0.8 million investment impairment. Investment income was $3.7 million in 2004, including $2.8 million of stock and dividends received from the demutalization of an insurance company, $1.1 million in other dividend income and $0.3 million of gains realized from the sale of investments, partially offset by $0.5 million from the decline in fair market value of trading securities. We recorded a nominal investment loss in 2003. The investment results of 2003 included $0.3 million of dividend income, $0.6 million of realized gains on investments liquidated, and $0.5 million of fair market value increases to our trading securities, offset by a $2.4 million write down for impaired investments.              The fair market value adjustment of our position in a ten-year $100 million interest rate contract improved by $5.9 million in fiscal 2005, $4.9 million in fiscal 2004 and $2.7 million in the three month transition period ended September 30, 2003. The fair market value adjustment of our position in this interest rate contract decreased by $7.7 million in fiscal 2003. The fair market value adjustment of this agreement will generally fluctuate, based on the implied forward interest rate curve for 3-month LIBOR. If the implied forward interest rate curve decreases, the fair market value of the interest rate contract will increase, and we will record an additional charge. If the implied forward interest rate curve increases, the fair market value of the interest rate contract will decrease, and we will record income. Increasing interest rates have caused the favorable movement in fair market value of the contract in the three most recent periods.              The overall tax provision for fiscal 2005 was $0.9 million, representing $2.1 million of foreign taxes and $0.3 million of state taxes in continuing operations, offset partially by a $1.4 million tax benefit in discontinued operations, which consists primarily of the tax effect from the carryback of environmental payments in the periods October 1, 2003 to September 30, 2004, and October 1, 2004 to September 30, 2005, which reduced the noncurrent income tax liability of $41.5 million at September 30, 2004. No federal tax expense was accrued in 2005 due to a domestic tax loss. In 2004, we recorded a federal income tax benefit of $24.2 million ($10.8 million in continuing operations and $13.4 million in discontinued operations) which resulted from the tax effect from the carryback of net operating losses of $39.4 million, arising from the periods July 1, 2003 to September 30, 2003 and October 1, 2003 to September 30, 2004, which reduced the noncurrent income tax liability of $68.5 million at June 30, 2003 and a $13.4 million favorable resolution of the tax audit of Kaynar Technologies, Inc. for its final year ended April 30, 1999, and our tax year ended June 30, 1999. We recorded an income tax provision of $0.4 million in fiscal 2003 on pre-tax losses from continuing operations. A tax provision was recorded due primarily from state income taxes.              Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations includes the results of the fasteners business prior to its sale, Fairchild Aerostructures, prior to its sale, APS prior to its sale, and certain legal and environmental expenses associated with our former businesses. The loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2005 consists primarily of an accrual of $2.0 million of environmental liabilities at locations of operations previously sold, and $2.5 million to cover legal expenses associated with businesses we sold several years ago, offset partially by $1.9 million of collections of old accounts receivable from businesses we previously sold. The loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2004 consists primarily of an accrual of $7.6 million of environmental liabilities at locations of operations previously sold, and $0.8 million to cover legal expenses associated with a business we sold several years ago.  The 2003 earnings from discontinued operations reflect our ownership of the fastener business during the first five months of fiscal 2003, prior to its sale on December 3, 2002.              In 2005, we recognized a $13.6 million gain on the disposal of discontinued operations, as a result of $12.5 million additional proceeds earned from the sale of the fastener business and the $1.1 million gain recognized on the sale of Fairchild Aerostructures. In 2004, we recorded a $9.5 million gain on the disposal of discontinued operations, as a result of additional proceeds earned from the sale of the fastener business. In 2003, we recorded a $29.8 million gain on the disposal of discontinued operations, net of $20.5 million of taxes, as a result of the sale of the fastener business.              Other comprehensive income includes foreign currency translation adjustments, unrecognized actuarial loss on pensions, and unrealized periodic holding changes in the fair market value of available-for-sale investment securities. In 2005, other comprehensive income included a $7.5 million decrease in the minimum pension liability $0.2 million decrease in the fair market value of available-for-sale securities and a $1.4 million decrease in unrealized foreign currency translations due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro. In 2004, a $1.8 million decrease in the minimum pension liability was offset by a $1.2 million increase in the fair market value of available-for-sale securities, and a $0.5 million improvement in unrealized foreign currency translations due to the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar. In 2003, other comprehensive income included a decrease of $60.8 million due to the recognition of an additional minimum pension liability due primarily to unrecognized actuarial losses, offset partially by an increase of $19.6 million in foreign currency translation adjustments which were realized as part of the sale of our fasteners business, and a $1.8 million increase in the fair market value of unrealized holding gains on investment securities.               Segment Results              Sports & Leisure Segment             Our sports & leisure segment, which we purchased from the Administrator of Eurobike AG and Mr. Klaus Esser, designs and sells motorcycle apparel, protective clothing, helmets, and technical accessories for motorcyclists. Primary brand names of our products include Hein Gericke and Polo. Hein Gericke currently operates 145 retail shops in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Polo currently operates 87 retail shops in Germany and one shop in Switzerland. For the most part, the Hein Gericke retail stores sell Hein Gericke brand items, and the Polo retail stores sell Polo brand products. Both the Hein Gericke and Polo retail stores sell products of other manufacturers, the inventory of which is owned by the Company. IFW, located in Tustin, California, is a designer and distributor of motorcycle apparel, boots and helmets under several labels, including Hein Gericke. In addition, IFW designs and produces apparel under private labels for third parties. The sports and leisure segment is a seasonal business, with an historic trend of a higher volume of sales and profits during March through September. Unfavorable weather conditions in Europe during March 2005 and April 2005 adversely effected the 2005 season.              On a pro forma basis, sales in our sports & leisure segment increased by $3.3 million, or 1.3%, in 2005, as compared 2004. The increase is due primarily to the weighted average strengthening of the Euro and British pound as compared to the United States dollar during 2005, as compared to 2004. Same store sales increased by 0.7% in 2005, while sales at IFW decreased by 21%, due primarily to a reduction in sales to Harley-Davidson. Additionally, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected the translation of European sales into U.S. dollars, by an aggregate of $9.4 million in 2005. Average retail sales per square foot was approximately $0.190 million in 2005, as compared to $0.198 million in 2004. Our Hein Gericke operations in the United Kingdom have been adversely affected by a sharp decline, which has recently occurred in the retail marketplace within the United Kingdom. On a pro forma basis, the operating results in our sports & leisure segment decreased by $12.0 million during 2005, as compared to 2004. The operating loss in 2005 was adversely affected by difficult trading conditions in Germany and the United Kingdom, which led to $2.8 million of higher promotional costs in an effort to preserve sales. Lower sales volume in Germany and the United States reduced our profitability, costing us $4.6 million of margin contribution. Sales were impacted at all Hein Gericke locations as the implementation of a new ERP system interrupted stock replenishment at all stores for one to two months at the beginning of the busy season in 2005. New shops in the United Kingdom increased our overhead by $1.9 million, and the development of a new global web shop cost us $0.9 million. On a pro forma basis, sales in our sports & leisure segment decreased by $0.5 million in 2004, as compared to 2003. The decrease in 2004 was due primarily to the closing of 19 low performing stores in 2004. On a pro forma basis, operating income in our sports & leisure segment increased by $3.9 million in 2004, as compared to 2003. Operating income improved due primarily to staff efficiencies realized at the acquisition date and reductions in rent expense, offset partially by $0.7 million of severance costs and $0.6 million of restructuring charges recognized in 2004.              Since the November 1, 2003 acquisition, Hein Gericke has initiated steps to advance its retail business in Germany. Hein Gericke is focusing on more efficient advertising and marketing to restore brand recognition and increase customer traffic previously enjoyed by Hein Gericke in Germany. A new ERP computer system operational at Polo, was expanded to encompass the operations of Hein Gericke. The new ERP computer system enables the business to operate in a more efficient manner. We believe relations with the suppliers of Fairchild Sports have improved since our acquisition. We have initiated a program to focus on optimal store location. This includes closing or relocating low performing stores, and opening new stores in England and elsewhere in Western Europe. We have also redesigned several stores to better present our products to customers.               Aerospace Segment             Our aerospace segment has five locations in the United States, and is an international supplier to the aerospace industry. Four locations specialize in the distribution of avionics, airframe accessories, and other components, and one location provides overhaul and repair capabilities. The products distributed include: navigation and radar systems, instruments, and communication systems, flat panel technologies and rotables. Our location in Titusville, Florida, overhauls and repairs landing gear, pressurization components, instruments, and avionics. Customers include original equipment manufacturers, commuter and regional airlines, corporate aircraft and fixed-base operators, air cargo carriers, general aviation suppliers and the military. Sales in our aerospace segment increased by $9.1 million, or 12.1%, in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004. Sales in our aerospace segment increased by $15.8 million, or 26.5%, in fiscal 2004, as compared to fiscal 2003. The improvement in sales reflects a large order which was delivered in 2004 and 2005. Sales in our aerospace segment are not anticipated to sustain a growth rate at these levels in the coming quarters, as demand in the aerospace industry for our products is still adversely affected by the continued financial difficulties of major commercial airlines.              Operating income increased by $2.1 million, or 51.2%, in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004, reflecting the increase in volume of sales and a 1.8% increase in gross margin. Operating income increased by $8.2 million in fiscal 2004, as compared to fiscal 2003. The results for 2003 were adversely affected by a $6.6 million impairment charge to write down goodwill. Excluding the goodwill impairment, operating income increased by $3.3 million in 2004, reflecting the increase in volume of sales and a small increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales.               Real Estate Operations Segment             Our real estate operations segment owns and operates a 451,000 square foot shopping center located in Farmingdale, New York, owns and leases to Alcoa a 208,000 square foot manufacturing facility located in Fullerton, California, and also owns and leases to PCA Aerospace a 58,000 square foot manufacturing facility located in Huntington Beach, California. We have two tenants that each occupy more than 10% of the rentable space in the shopping center. Rental revenue was $11.2 million in 2005, $9.9 million in 2004, $2.3 million for the three month transition period ended September 30, 2003, and $8.7 million in 2003. Rental revenue increased by $1.3 million, or 12.9%, in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004, reflecting a $0.7 million lease settlement with a defaulting office tenant, tenants paying higher average rents, offset partially by the July 2004 sale of a property located in Chatsworth, California that generated rental revenue of $0.4 million in 2004. Rental revenue increased by 14.1% in 2004, as compared to 2003, reflecting tenants occupying an additional 28,000 square feet of the shopping center. The weighted average occupancy rate of the shopping center was 97.2%, 96.3%, 90.3%, and 87.1% in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004, the three month transition period ended September 30, 2003, and fiscal 2003, respectively. The average effective annual rental rate per square foot of the shopping center was $23.38, $20.78, $20.23, and $20.27, in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004, the three month transition period ended September 30, 2003, and fiscal 2003, respectively. As of September 30, 2005, 100% of the retail space and approximately 98% of all leasable space at the shopping center was leased.              Operating income increased by $1.1 million to $3.9 million in 2005, as compared to $2.8 million in 2004. In 2005, depreciation expense and real estate taxes increased by $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, as a result of leasehold improvements enhancing the value of the portion of the shopping center that was placed into service in 2005. In 2005, legal and bad debt expense decreased by $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Operating income increased by $0.1 million to $2.8 million in 2004, as compared to $2.7 million in 2003. In 2004, depreciation expense and real estate taxes increased by $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, as a result of leasehold improvements enhancing the value of the portion of the shopping center that was placed into service in 2004. In 2004, insurance and legal expense increased by $0.3 and $0.2, respectively, as a result of increased insurance premiums and various legal matters.             In April 2005, we engaged Eastdil Realty Company, LLC, to explore opportunities for the sale of our shopping center. In October 2005, our Board of Directors authorized management to sell the shopping center. on December 21, 2005, we signed a definitive agreement to sell its Farmingdale, New York, power shopping center, Airport Plaza, to KRC Acquisition Corp., acting on behalf of a joint venture comprised of Kimco Realty Corporation and a fund managed by a major investment bank, for approximately $95 million. The purchaser has agreed to deposit into escrow $4.75 million to ensure its obligations and to seek the approval of our mortgage lender to assume our existing mortgage loan of approximately $53.8 million, or to defease the loan. The closing will take place following purchasers obtaining consent of the mortgage lender to its loan assumption, which could occur as early as February 2006. If the loan is defeased, the transaction may not close until as late as July 2006.              The Fullerton property is leased to Alcoa through October 2007, and is expected to generate revenues and operating income in excess of $0.5 million per year. The Huntington Beach property is leased to PCA Aerospace through October 2007, and is expected to generate revenues and operating income of $0.4 million per year. We can cause PCA Aerospace to purchase the Huntington Beach property at the greater of fair market value or $6.0 million under a put option we hold which can be exercised upon the earlier of the time when a mortgage loan, which encumbers the property, is paid off (currently due in October 2007, but with extension options) or January 31, 2012. PCA Aerospace also holds a similar purchase option. At September 30, 2005, the book value of the Huntington Beach property was $3.0 million and we believe the current fair market value is approximately $5.5 million.            Corporate             The operating loss at corporate increased by $5.0 million in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004, due primarily to the costs of complying with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and impairment expenses to write down the value of a landfill development partnership, in which we are a limited partner and were required to consolidate in accordance with FASB Interpretation 46R beginning January 1, 2004. We recently decided to no longer provide funds to the landfill development partnership, resulting in $2.9 million impairment recognition in fiscal 2005, in addition the $1.2 million impairment recognized in fiscal 2004. The operating results at corporate improved by $20.4 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. The operating results at corporate in 2003 included $13.7 million of one-time change of control payments required under contracts with our top four executives as a result of the sale of the fastener business, and $10.4 million of bonuses awarded to them as a result of the sale of the fastener business.              Two actions, styled  Noto v. Steiner, et al.,  and  Barbonel v. Steiner, et al.,  were commenced on November 18, 2004, and November 23, 2004, respectively, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for Newcastle County, Delaware. The plaintiffs allege that each is, or was, a shareholder of The Fairchild Corporation and purported to bring actions derivatively on behalf of the Company, claiming, among other things, that Fairchild executive officers received excessive pay and perquisites and that the Companys directors approved such excessive pay and perquisites in violation of fiduciary duties to the Company. The complaints name, as defendants, all of the Companys directors, its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, its President and Chief Operating Officer, its former Chief Financial Officer, and its General Counsel. While the Company and its Officers and Directors believe it and they have meritorious defenses to these suits, and deny liability or wrongdoing with respect to any and all claims alleged in the suits, it and its Officers and Directors elected to settle to avoid onerous costs of defense, inconvenience and distraction. On April 1, 2005, we mailed to our shareholders a Notice of Hearing and Proposed Settlement of The Fairchild Corporation Stockholder Derivative Litigation. On May 18, 2005, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County declined to approve that proposed settlement of the actions. On October 24, 2005, we mailed to our shareholders a Notice of Hearing and Proposed Supplemental Settlement of The Fairchild Corporation Stockholder Derivative Litigation. On November 23, 2005, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County approved the proposed settlement of these actions. The Courts order became final on December 23, 2005. At September 30, 2005, we have estimated the remaining legal fees due to be $1.8 million. We will seek reimbursement from our insurance carries for legal costs incurred in connection with this matter.     FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES               Total capitalization as of September 30, 2005 and September 30, 2004 was $232.8 million and $277.6 million, respectively. The fiscal 2005 change in capitalization included a net decrease of $15.3 million in debt resulting from approximately $10.0 million of repayments net of additional borrowings, and a $1.0 million decrease due to the foreign currency effect on debt denominated in euros. Stockholders equity decreased by $29.5 million, due primarily to our $21.9 million reported net loss and other comprehensive loss, offset partially by $1.0 million received on the repayment of shareholder loans. Our combined cash and investment balances totaled $98.2 million on September 30, 2005, as compared to $109.4 million on September 30, 2004, and included restricted investments of $64.6 million and $75.0 million at September 30, 2005 and September 30, 2004, respectively. Total capitalization as of September 30, 2004 and September 30, 2003 amounted to $277.6 million and $143.8 million, respectively. The change in capitalization included a $130.0 million net increase in debt as a result of our acquisition of Hein Gericke, PoloExpress, and IFW; obtaining financing on our shopping center and real estate; and receiving a revolving credit line based on the assets of our aerospace segment. Equity increased by $3.9 million, due primarily to our reported net earnings. Our combined cash and investment balances totaled $109.4 million on September 30, 2004, as compared to $110.9 million on September 30, 2003.              Net cash used for operating activities for 2005 was $14.0 million. The working capital uses of cash in 2005 included a $10.0 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $7.6 million increase in other non-current assets, and a $4.5 million decrease in inventory, offset partially by a $10.2 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, and a $0.4 million increase in other current assets. The working capital sources of cash were offset by $14.2 million of non-cash charges and working capital changes provided from discontinued operations, and our $12.5 million net cash loss, after deducting non-cash expenses of $11.0 million for depreciation, $1.4 million from the amortization of deferred loan fees, $2.9 million loss from impairments, offset partially by the $5.9 million from the reduction in the fair market value of an interest rate contract. Net cash used for operating activities for fiscal 2004 was $15.6 million. The primary use of cash for operating activities in 2004 was a $16.5 million increase in inventories, a $16.2 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, and a $16.8 million increase in accounts receivable, offset partially by a $32.5 million decrease in trading securities, and our $3.4 million net earnings. Net cash used for operating activities for 2003, was $122.5 million. The working capital uses of cash in 2003 included $47.4 million of cash used for investments in trading securities, $7.4 million contributed to fund our pension plan, $13.7 million of one-time change of control payments, $10.4 million of bonuses, and $30.4 of non-cash charges and working capital changes provided to discontinued operations.              Net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2005 was $27.7 million, and included $12.5 million received from Alcoa as additional earn-out proceeds from our December 2002 sale of our fastener business, $9.5 million of proceeds received from investment securities, $10.5 million of net proceeds received from the sale of non-core property, and $6.0 million received from the sale of Fairchild Aerostructures in June 2005, offset by $12.1 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used for investing activities was $94.8 million in 2004 and included our acquisition funding of $73.0 million, net of $15.0 million of cash included in the businesses we acquired. Net cash provided by investing activities for 2003, was $605.5 million. In 2003, the primary source of cash was $657.1 million of proceeds from the sale of our fastener business, $13.4 million of net cash proceeds received from notes receivable, and $2.5 million cash proceeds received from net assets held for sale. Net cash provided by investing activities was offset partially by $54.7 million of new investments, $9.8 million of capital expenditures, including the purchase of a manufacturing facility located in Fullerton, California, and $2.9 million of investing activities used for discontinued operations.              Net cash used for financing activities was $13.8 million for fiscal 2005, which reflects $14.1 million of debt repayments, net, offset partially by $1.0 million received on repayment of shareholder loans. Net cash provided by financing activities was $116.6 million for 2004, which reflected $55.0 million borrowed to finance our shopping center, the long-term financing of $43.4 million for our acquisition of Hein Gericke, PoloExpress, and IFW, $13.0 million borrowed to finance property, and $9.0 million borrowed from a revolving credit facility at our aerospace segment. Net cash used by financing activities was $485.8 million for 2003, which reflected the repayment of essentially all of our debt, except for a $3.4 million margin loan and $3.2 million of debt at Fairchild Aerostructures.              Our principal cash requirements include supporting our current operations, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, and the payment of other liabilities including postretirement benefits, environmental investigation and remediation costs, litigation settlements and related costs. We expect that cash on hand, cash generated from the earnout due to us from Alcoa and proceeds due to us from the stockholder derivative litigation, cash available from lines of credit, and proceeds received from dispositions of short-term investments, will be adequate to satisfy our cash requirements during the next twelve months.              In order to improve our liquidity, on December 21, 2005, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our Farmingdale, New York, power shopping center, Airport Plaza, to KRC Acquisition Corp., acting on behalf of a joint venture comprised of Kimco Realty Corporation and a fund managed by a major investment bank, for approximately $95 million. The purchaser has agreed to deposit into escrow $4.75 million to ensure its obligations and to seek the approval of our mortgage lender to assume our existing mortgage loan of approximately $53.8 million, or to defease the loan. The closing will take place following purchasers obtaining consent of the mortgage lender to its loan assumption, which could occur as early as February 2006. If the loan is defeased, the transaction may not close until as late as July 2006. The sale does not include several other undeveloped parcels of real estate that we own in the Town, the largest of which is under contract of sale to the market chain, Stew Leonards. We decided to sell the shopping center to enhance our financial flexibility, allowing us to invest in existing operations or pursue other opportunities.              Our cash needs are generally the highest during the second and third quarters of our fiscal year, when our sports and leisure segment purchases inventory in advance of the spring and summer selling seasons.              During fiscal 2005, we had an 7.0 million (approximately $8.4 million) seasonal facility to help fund these cash needs. That facility was repaid and has expired. In December 2005, the Guaranty Committee of the German State of North Rhine Westphalia  recommended approval for an 80% guaranteed seasonal financing facility, up to 11.0 million. One German bank has committed to provide funding for 5.5 million (approximately $6.6 million) of the seasonal facility and we anticipate completion of approval, loan agreements, and funding in January 2006. We are holding ongoing discussions with a second German bank, to receive a commitment for the remaining 5.5 million of the seasonal facility, but we have not received a positive indication that it will be approved. If we are unable to obtain a commitment from a second bank, we believe that our cash resources will be sufficient to meet our seasonal needs.           In December 2005, we entered into discussions with an investment bank concerning our capital requirements. On December 26, 2005, we engaged the investment bank to provide us, among other things, with a commitment to place a short-term loan to us of $20 million, against our agreement to sell our shopping center to KRC Acquisition Corp. The investment bank has indicated to us that it is highly confident that it can consummate the loan, if needed, during the period of our seasonal trough.                  In the event that our cash needs are substantially higher than projected, particularly during our seasonal trough, we will take additional actions to generate the required cash. These actions may include one or any combination of the following:     Liquidating investments and other non-core assets.   Obtaining and utilizing borrowings available to us under a bridge financing agreement collateralized by the expected proceeds to be received from the sale of our shopping center.   Eliminating, reducing, or delaying all non-essential services provided by outside parties, including consultants.   Significantly reducing our corporate overhead expenses.   Settling our $100 million interest rate swap agreement, which we have $2.5 million of restricted funds in excess of our remaining liability.   Delaying purchases of inventory.            However, if we need to implement one or more of these actions, there nevertheless remains some uncertainity that we will actually receive a sufficient amount of cash in time to meet all of our needs during the seasonal trough. Even if sufficient cash is realized, any or all of these actions may have adverse affects on our operating results and/or businesses..                        We may also consider raising cash to meet subsequent needs of our operations by issuing additional stock or debt, entering into partnership arrangements, liquidating assets or other means. Should the sale of our shopping center be delayed or not occur, we may be forced to liquidate other non essential assets, and significantly reduce overhead expenses.              In December 2005, we obtained an additional amendment of a covenant on our loan agreement with two German banks. The amendment provides a permanent waiver of specified inventory and accounts receivables that must be maintained by Hein Gericke Deutschland. The agreement requires Hein Gericke Deuschland to maintain a 1.5 ratio of current assets to net financial liabilities.             In December 2005, we received German Government approval for an 80% guaranteed seasonal financing facility, up to 11.0 million. One German bank has committed to provide funding for 5.5 million of the seasonal facility and we anticipate these funds will be available in early January. We are holding ongoing discussions with a second German bank, to receive a commitment for the remaining 5.5 million of the seasonal facility. If we are unable to finalize the full seasonal line of credit, which we are negotiating, we may not have sufficient liquidity during the fiscal 2006 seasonal trough to support both our operations and our corporate needs. If this were to occur during the seasonal trough, we believe we could generate sufficient additional cash through the sale of non-core assets, including investments, to satisfy our cash requirements, recognizing, however, that there are impediments to the timely disposition of non-core assets, which could adversely affect realization of their fair values. Because of the seasonal trough, we may also be required to reduce corporate expenses; however, such reductions may affect our efficiency, or result in the loss of personnel necessary for our business.              The costs of being a small to mid-sized public company have increased substantially with the introduction and implementation of controls and procedures mandated by the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Audit fees and audit related fees have significantly increased over the past two years. Our increased costs also include the effects of acquisitions and additional costs related to compliance with various financing agreements. We expect the costs to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 alone substantially increased our audit and related costs. We estimate that we will incur expenses of approximately $2.9 million in relation to audit and related fees in fiscal 2005, as compared to only $0.8 million in fiscal 2004. These increases are significant for a company of our size. We are considering all options for reducing costs, including opportunities to take our company private in the coming year.              In February 2005, we announced our intention to purchase up to 500,000 shares of our outstanding Class A Common Stock. Through September 30, 2005, we acquired 61,800 shares at an average price of $3.12 per share, and have not purchased any shares since May 11, 2005.     Off Balance Sheet Items               On September 30, 2005, approximately $4.7 million of bank loans received by retail shop partners in the sports & leisure segment were guaranteed by our subsidiaries and are not reflected on our balance sheet because these loans have not been assumed by us. These guarantees were assumed by us when we acquired the sports & leisure business. We have guaranteed loans to shop partners for the purchase store fittings in certain locations where well sell our products. The loans are secured by the store fittings purchased to outfit our retail stores.     Contractual Obligations               At September 30, 2005, we had contractual commitments to repay debt (including capital lease obligations), and to make payments under operating leases. Principal payments due under these long-term obligations (excluding pension obligations) are as follows:       2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  Thereafter  Total          Long-term debt and capital lease obligations        $  21,571     $  23,020     $  9,034     $  17,224     $  1,836     $  50,097     $  122,782      Operating lease commitments           20,528        16,355        13,219        9,455        6,399        26,195        92,151             Total contractual cash obligations        $  42,099     $  39,375     $  22,253     $  26,679     $  8,235     $  76,292     $  214,933                         We have entered into standby letter of credit arrangements with insurance companies and others, issued primarily to guarantee our payments of workers compensation. At September 30, 2005, we had contingent liabilities of $2.0 million on commitments related to outstanding letters of credit. .              On September 30, 2005, we reflected a $5.1 million obligation due under a ten-year $100 million interest rate swap agreement which expires on February 19, 2008. Interest on the swap agreement is settled quarterly.             Our operations enter into purchase commitments in the normal course of business.             Prior to the sale of our fastener business, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation had contacted us to understand the impact of the sale of our fasteners business on our ability to fund our long-term pension obligations. The PBGC expressed concern that our retirement plan would be underfunded by $86 million after the sale of our fasteners business. We provided the PBGC with information, which represented the underfunding to be $42 million, using the PBGC plan termination assumptions. During 2003, we contributed $7.4 million of cash to fund this pension plan. Based upon our actuarys recent assumptions and projections, we do not expect additional cash contributions to this pension plan to be required until 2009. Current actuarial projections indicate contribution requirements of $1,180 in 2009, $1,970 in 2010 and a total of $11,420 in 2011 through 2015.  We are required to make annual cash contributions of approximately $0.3 million to fund a small pension plan.              In addition, we have $27.5 million classified as other long-term liabilities at September 30, 2005, including $13.8 million due to purchase the remaining 7.5% interest in PoloExpress in April 2008. The remaining $13.4 million of other long-term liabilities include environmental and other liabilities, which do not have specific payment terms or other similar contractual arrangements.              At September 30, 2005, we have $198.3 million of federal income tax loss carryforwards expiring 2018 through 2025, and $4.5 million of unused alternative minimum tax credit carryforward that does not expire. These federal income tax loss carryforwards may be reduced by adjustments during the income tax audits of 1995 to 1998 or 2000 to 2005, which have not been completed. As the periods of assessment for 1995 to 2001 have expired, additional tax may be collected from us only for 2002 to 2005. Nonetheless, the tax losses of $236.5 million arising in 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 may still be reduced for determining the proper amount of net operating loss available to be carried forward to years after 2001. The gains on the disposal of discontinued operations that we reported between 1995 to 2005, for federal income tax, may be significantly increased if our tax positions are not sustained with respect to the sales of several businesses; and the repayment with property, of debt under a bank credit agreement in which both we and our subsidiaries were liable, is not treated as tax free under Section 361 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If all of these adjustments were made for 1995 to 2005, the federal income tax loss carryforwards would be substantially reduced, and we may be required to pay additional tax and interest of up to $42.2 million, which has already been provided. The amount of additional tax and interest to be paid by the Company depends on the amount of income tax audit adjustments, which are made and sustained for 1995 to 2005. These adjustments, if any, would be made at a future date, which is presently uncertain, and therefore we cannot predict the timing of cash outflows. To the extent a favorable final determination of the recorded tax liabilities occurs, appropriate adjustments will be made to decrease the recorded tax liability in the year such favorable determination occurs. We recorded a federal income tax benefit of $1.4 million in 2005 which results primarily from the carryback of net operating losses under the 10 year carryback rules in Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, arising from October 1, 2004 to September 30, 2005 and the favorable resolution of tax audits of Intersports Fashions West Inc. for year ended September 30, 2003 and of a subsidiary in France for years ended June 30 of 1999 to 2002. We recorded a federal income tax benefit of $27.0 million in 2004 which results primarily from the carryback of net operating losses arising from July 1, 2003 to September 30, 2003 and October 1, 2003 to September 30, 2004, and the favorable resolution of the tax audit of Kaynar Technologies, Inc. for its final year ended April 30, 1999 and for our year ended June 30, 1999. We have a $42.2 million non-current income tax liability at September 30, 2005, which includes the tax effects of net operating loss carryforwards, temporary differences, and permanent differences. It is presently uncertain when a final determination will occur since no Internal Revenue Service audits of 1995 to 1998 or 2000 to 2004 have been completed. Should any of these liabilities become immediately due, we would be obligated to obtain financing, raise capital, and/or liquidate assets to satisfy our obligations.     RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS               In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment. Statement 123R amends certain aspects of Statement 123 and now requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost will be required to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. Statement 123R provides some flexibility in allowing entities to determine the valuation model to use in calculating fair value, and whether to implement Statement 123R on a prospective basis, a modified prospective basis or retroactively. The statement becomes effective for us at the beginning of our next fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the effects of Statement 123R. Such effect is not likely to be materially different from amounts we have previously disclosed in our filings since adopting Statement 123.              In March 2005, The Financial Accounting Standards Board published FASB Interpretation No. 47,  Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligation , to clarify that an entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 also defines when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 is intended to provide a more consistent recognition of liabilities relating to asset retirement obligations, additional information about expected future cash outflows associated with those obligations, and additional information about investments in long-lived assets, because it recognizes additional asset retirement costs as part of the assets carrying amounts. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of our fiscal year ending September 30, 2006. We are currently assessing the possible impact, if any, of implementing this standard.              In June 2005, The Financial Accounting Standards Board has published Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154,  Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , which requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of every voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable. The Statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and FASB Statement No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, although it carries forward some of their provisions. The FASB believes that the Statements requirements will enhance the consistency of financial information between periods and is the result of the FASBs efforts to improve the comparability of cross-border financial reporting by working with the International Accounting Standards Board toward development of a single set of high-quality accounting standards. Statement 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not anticipate any impact from adopting this new standard.     ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK                    We are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations, including risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities. We may use; derivative financial instruments on a limited basis as additional risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes.            Interest Rate Risk:   In fiscal 1998, we entered into a ten-year interest rate swap agreement to reduce our cash flow exposure to increases in interest rates on variable rate debt. The ten-year interest rate swap agreement provided us with interest rate protection on $100 million of variable rate debt, with interest being calculated based on a fixed LIBOR rate of 6.24% to February 17, 2003. The variable rate debt that was fixed by the interest rate swap was repaid by us on December 3, 2002. On February 17, 2003, the bank, with which we entered into the interest rate swap agreement, did not exercise a one-time option to cancel the agreement, and accordingly the transaction proceeds, based on a fixed LIBOR rate of 6.745% from February 17, 2003 to February 19, 2008.              In fiscal 2005, we have recognized $5.9 million of non-cash income as a result of the reduction in the fair market value for our interest rate swap liability from $11.1 million, at September 30, 2004, to $5.1 million at September 30, 2005.              The fair market value adjustment of these agreements will generally fluctuate based on the implied forward interest rate curve for 3-month LIBOR. If the implied forward interest rate curve decreases, the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will increase and we will record an additional charge. If the implied forward interest rate curve increases, the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will decrease, and we will record income.              In May 2004, we issued a floating rate note with a principal amount of 25.0 million. Embedded within the promissory note agreement is an interest rate cap protecting one half of the 25.0 million borrowed. The embedded interest rate cap limits to 6%, the 3-month EURIBOR interest rate that we must pay on the promissory note. We paid approximately $0.1 million to purchase the interest rate cap. In accordance with SFAS 133, the embedded interest rate cap is considered to be clearly and closely related to the debt of the host contract and is not required to be separated and accounted for separately from the host contract. We are accounting for the hybrid contract, comprised of the variable rate note and the embedded interest rate cap, as a single debt instrument.              The table below provides information about our financial instruments that is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date.

These risks include the translation of local currency balances of our foreign subsidiaries, intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through our normal operating activities and, if we determine appropriate, we may consider utilizing foreign currency forward contracts in the future. For the year ended September 30, 2005, approximately 75% of our total revenues were derived from customers outside of the United States, with approximately 65% of our total revenues denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar. We estimate that revenue and operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2005 were higher by $9.4 million and $9.9 million, respectively, as a result of changes in exchange rates as compared to the year ended September 30, 2004. At September 30, 2005 we had $40.9 million of working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) denominated in foreign currencies. At September30, 2005, we had no outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. The following table shows the approximate split of these foreign currency exposures by principal currency at September 30, 2005:      Euro  UK Pound  Swiss Franc    Total Exposure                  Revenues         83%      16%      1%      100%    Expenses           82%      17%      1%      100%    Working Capital           74%      24%      2%      100%            A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the dollar during 2005 versus the foreign currencies in which we have exposure would have reduced revenue by approximately $20.7 million and reduced operating expenses by approximately $21.0 million, resulting in an operating loss of $0.3 million less than actually reported. Working capital at September 30, 2005, would have been approximately $3.7 million lower than actually reported, if we had used this hypothetical stronger dollar. These numbers were estimated using the different hypothetical rate for the entire year and applying it evenly to all non United States dollar transactions.          Inflation:  We believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2005. However, we cannot assure you that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.      ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
