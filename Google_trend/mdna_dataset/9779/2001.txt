ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND                 FINANCIAL CONDITION       The Fairchild  Corporation was incorporated in October 1969, under the laws of the State of Delaware, under the name of Banner Industries, Inc. On November 15, 1990, we changed our name from Banner Industries, Inc. to The Fairchild Corporation.  We own 100% of RHI Holdings, Inc. and Banner Aerospace, Inc. RHI is the owner of 100% of Fairchild Holding Corp.  Our principal operations are conducted through Fairchild Holding Corp. and Banner Aerospace.       The following discussion and analysis provide information which management believes is relevant to the assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  GENERAL       We are a leading worldwide aerospace and industrial fastener manufacturer and distribution supply chain services provider and, through Banner Aerospace, an international supplier to airlines and general aviation businesses, distributing a wide range of aircraft parts and related support services. Through internal growth and strategic acquisitions, we have become one of the leading suppliers of fasteners to aircraft OEMs, such as Boeing, European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, General Electric, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman.       Our business consists of three segments: aerospace fasteners, aerospace distribution and real estate operations. The aerospace fasteners segment manufactures and markets high performance fastening systems used in the manufacture and maintenance of commercial and military aircraft. Our aerospace distribution segment stocks and distributes a wide variety of aircraft parts to commercial airlines and air cargo carriers, fixed-base operators, corporate aircraft operators and other aerospace companies. Our real estate operations segment owns and operates a shopping center located in Farmingdale, New York.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Business Transactions       The following summarizes certain business combinations and transactions we completed which significantly affect the comparability of the period to period results presented in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.     Fiscal 2000 Transactions       On July 29, 1999, we sold our 31.9% interest in Nacanco Paketleme to American National Can Group, Inc. for approximately $48.2 million. Our investment in Nacanco began in November 1987, and throughout the years we invested approximately $6.2 million in Nacanco. Since the inception of our investment, we recorded equity earnings of $25.7 million and received cash dividends of $12.5 million from Nacanco. We recognized a $25.7 million nonrecurring gain from this divestiture in the nine months ended April 2, 2000. We also agreed to provide consulting services over a three-year period, at an annual fee of approximately $1.5 million. We used the net proceeds from the disposition to reduce our indebtedness. As a result of this disposition, our interest expense was reduced. However, our equity earnings and dividend proceeds also significantly decreased. In accordance with our plan to dispose of non-core assets, the opportunity to dispose of our interest in Nacanco Paketleme presented us with an excellent opportunity to realize a substantial return on our investment and allowed us to reduce our then outstanding indebtedness by approximately 8.6%.       On September 3, 1999, we completed the disposal of our Camloc Gas Springs division to a subsidiary of Arvin Industries Inc. for approximately $2.7 million. In addition, we received $2.4 million from Arvin Industries for a covenant not to compete. We recognized a $2.3 million nonrecurring pre-tax gain from this disposition. We decided to dispose of the Camloc Gas Springs division in order to concentrate our focus on our operations in the aerospace industry.       On December 1, 1999, we disposed of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of our Dallas Aerospace subsidiary to United Technologies Inc. for approximately $57.0 million. No gain or loss was recognized from this transaction, as the proceeds received approximated the net carrying value of these assets. Approximately $37.0 million of the proceeds from this disposition were used to reduce our term indebtedness and our interest expense. As a result of this transaction, we reported a reduction in revenues of $21.7 million and operating income of $2.1 million for the nine months ended April 1, 2001, as compared to the nine months ended April 2, 2000. We estimated that the market base for the older-type of engines that we were selling was shrinking, and that we would be required to invest a substantial amount of cash to purchase newer-type of engines to maintain market share. The opportunity to exit this business presented us with an opportunity to improve cash flows by reducing our indebtedness by $37.0 million, and by preserving our cash, which would otherwise have had to have been invested to upgrade our inventory.       On April 13, 2000, we completed a spin-off to our stockholders of the shares of Fairchild (Bermuda) Ltd. On April 14, 2000, Fairchild (Bermuda) sold to Convac Technologies Ltd. the Optical Disc Equipment Group business formerly owned by Fairchild Technologies. Subsequently, on April 14, 2000, Fairchild (Bermuda), renamed Global Sources Ltd., completed an exchange of approximately 95% of its shares for 100% of the shares of Trade Media Holdings Limited, an Asian based, business-to-business online and traditional marketplace services provider. Immediately after the share exchange, our stockholders owned 1,183,081 shares of the 26,152,308 issued shares of Global Sources. Global Sources shares are listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol "GSOL". This transaction allowed us to complete our formal plan to dispose of Fairchild Technologies and provided our shareholders with a unique opportunity to participate in a new public entity.     Fiscal 1999 Transactions       On December 31, 1998, Banner consummated the sale of Solair, Inc., its largest subsidiary in the rotables group of the aerospace distribution segment, to Kellstrom Industries, Inc., in exchange for approximately $60.4 million in cash and a warrant to purchase 300,000 shares of common stock of Kellstrom. In December 1998, Banner recorded a $19.3 million pre-tax loss from the sale of Solair. This loss was included in cost of goods sold as it was primarily attributable to the bulk sale of inventory at prices below the carrying amount of inventory. The opportunity to exit this business presented us with an opportunity to improve cash flows by reducing our indebtedness by $60.4 million, and by preserving our cash, which would otherwise have had to have been required to be invested to upgrade our inventory.       On February 22, 1999, we used available cash to acquire 77.3% of SNEP S.A. By June 30, 1999, we had purchased significantly all of the remaining shares of SNEP. The total amount paid was approximately $8.0 million, including $1.1 million of debt assumed, in a business combination accounted for as a purchase. The total cost of the acquisition exceeded the fair value of the net assets of SNEP by approximately $4.3 million, which is being allocated as goodwill, and amortized using the straight-line method over 40 years. SNEP is a French manufacturer of precision-machined self-locking nuts and special threaded fasteners serving the European industrial, aerospace and automotive markets. We acquired SNEP to compliment our existing product group and expand our European customer base.       On April 8, 1999, we acquired the remaining 15% of the outstanding common and preferred stock of Banner Aerospace, Inc. not already owned by us, through the merger of Banner with one of our subsidiaries. Under the terms of the merger with Banner, we issued 2,981,412 shares of our Class A common stock to acquire all of Banner's common and preferred stock, other than those shares already owned by us. Banner is now our wholly-owned subsidiary.       On April 20, 1999, we completed the acquisition of all the capital stock of Kaynar Technologies Inc. for approximately $222 million and assumed approximately $103 million of existing debt, the majority of which was refinanced at closing. In addition, we paid $28 million for a covenant not to compete from Kaynar Technologies' largest preferred shareholder. The total cost of the acquisition exceeded the fair value of the net assets of Kaynar Technologies by approximately $282 million, which is being allocated as goodwill, and amortized using the straight-line method over 40 years. The acquisition was financed with existing cash, the sale of $225 million of 10 3/4% senior subordinated notes due 2009 and proceeds from a new bank credit facility. We acquired Kaynar Technologies primarily to increase our existing product base, expand our customer base, and create the opportunity to generate significant synergistic cash savings. The acquisition also ensured that we would remain the world's largest manufacturer of aerospace fasteners.       On June 18, 1999, we completed the acquisition of Technico S.A. for approximately $4.1 million and assumed approximately $2.2 million of Technico's existing debt. The total cost of the acquisition exceeded the fair value of the net assets of Technico by approximately $3.4 million, which is being allocated as goodwill, and amortized using the straight-line method over 40 years. The acquisition was financed with additional borrowings from our credit facility. We acquired Technico to expand our European customer base.    Consolidated Results       We currently report in three principal business segments: aerospace fasteners, aerospace distribution and real estate operations. The results of Camloc Gas Springs division, prior to its disposition, were included in the Corporate and Other classification. The following table provides the historical sales and operating income of our operations for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999. The following table also illustrates sales and operating income of our operations by segment, on an unaudited pro forma basis, for fiscal 2000 and 1999, as if we had operated in a consistent manner in each of the reported periods. The pro forma results represent the impact of our dispositions of Dallas Aerospace in December 1999 and Camloc Gas Springs in September 1999, as if these transactions had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively. The fiscal 1999 pro forma results also represent the impact of our disposition of Solair in December 1998, our acquisition of Kaynar Technologies in April 1999, and our merger with Banner Aerospace in April 1999, as if these transactions had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 1999. The pro forma information is based on the historical financial statements of these companies, giving effect to the aforementioned transactions. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations, that would actually have occurred if these transactions had been in effect since the beginning of fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, nor is it necessarily indicative of our future results.

(b)      Fiscal 2000 results include restructuring charges of $8.6 million in          the aerospace fasteners segment. Fiscal 1999 results include inventory          impairment charges of $41.5 million in the aerospace distribution          segment, costs relating to acquisitions of $23.6 million and          restructuring charges of $5.5 million in the aerospace fasteners          segment, $0.3 million in the aerospace distribution segment, and $0.5          million at corporate. (c)      Fiscal 2001 results includes one-time impairment charges of $1.1          million in the aerospace fasteners segment, $2.4 million in the          aerospace distribution segment, and $2.5 million in the real estate          segment.         Net Sales of $622.8 million in 2001 decreased by $12.6 million, or 2.0%, compared to sales of $635.4 million in 2000. The results for 2000, included revenue of $22.4 million from Dallas Aerospace and the Camloc Gas Springs division prior to their respective dispositions. Additionally, sales in 2001 were adversely affected by approximately $24.4 million, due to the foreign currency impact on our European operations. On a pro forma basis and excluding the period-to-period foreign currency effect, net sales increased by $34.3 million for 2001, as compared to 2000. Net sales of $635.4 million in 2000 increased by $18.0 million, or 2.9%, compared to sales of $617.3 million in 1999. The improvement is attributable primarily to the additional revenues provided by the acquisition of Kaynar Technologies, offset partially by the dispositions of Solair and Dallas Aerospace. On a pro forma basis, net sales decreased 9.9% in 2000, as compared to 1999, due primarily to reduced bookings caused by Boeing's inventory reduction program.      Rental revenue was $7.0 million in 2001, $3.6 million in 2000 and $0.4 million in 1999. Rental revenue was higher in the 2001 and 2000 periods due to an increase in the amount of space leased to tenants.       Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 25.1%, 25.7%, and 18.2%, in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Included in cost of goods sold for 1999 was a charge of $41.5 million recognized in our aerospace distribution segment from the dispositions of Solair and Dallas Aerospace. Of this charge, $19.3 million was attributable to Solair's bulk sale of inventory at prices below the carrying amount. Excluding these charges, gross margin as a percentage of sales was 24.9% in fiscal 1999. The change in margins in 2001, 2000 and 1999 periods are attributable to a change in product mix as a result of the acquisitions and dispositions.       Selling, general & administrative expense as a percentage of sales was 20.1%, 20.6%, and 24.1%, in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Included in selling, general & administrative expense in fiscal 1999 were $23.6 million of one-time costs associated primarily with the acquisition of Kaynar Technologies. Excluding these costs, selling, general & administrative expense as a percentage of sales would have been 20.3% in 1999.      Other income decreased $4.9 million in 2001, compared to 2000. The decrease was due primarily to $5.1 million of income recognized from the disposition of non-core property in 2000, and a $0.7 million loss recognized from the disposition of non-core property during 2001. Other income increased $7.3 million in 2000 as compared to 1999, due primarily to $5.1 million of gains recognized on the disposition of real estate.       An impairment charge of $5.9 million was recorded in 2001. The impairment charge included $2.4 million due to the closing of a small subsidiary at our aerospace distribution segment, of which $1.7 million represented the write-off of goodwill, and $0.4 million represented severance payments. The impairment charge also included a write-off of approximately $2.3 million of improvements at our shopping center, and $1.1 million for the write-off of leasehold improvements from the relocation of our domestic distribution facility in our aerospace fasteners segment.       In fiscal 1999, we recorded $6.4 million of restructuring charges. Of this amount, $0.5 million was recorded at our corporate office for severance benefits, and $0.3 million was recorded at our aerospace distribution segment for the write-off of building improvements from premises vacated. The remaining $5.6 million was recorded as a result of the costs incurred from the initial integration of Kaynar Technologies into our aerospace fasteners segment, i.e. for severance benefits ($3.9 million), for product integration costs incurred as of June 30, 1999 ($1.3 million), and for the write down of fixed assets ($0.3 million). In fiscal 2000, we recorded $8.6 million of restructuring charges as a result of the continued integration of Kaynar Technologies into our aerospace fasteners segment. All of the charges recorded were a direct result of product and plant integration costs incurred as of June 30, 2000. These costs were classified as restructuring and were the direct result of formal plans to move equipment, close plants and to terminate employees. Such costs are nonrecurring in nature. Other than a reduction in our existing cost structure, none of the restructuring charges resulted in future increases in earnings or represented an accrual of future costs.       Operating income of $21.3 million in 2001 decreased by $1.9 million as compared to operating income of $23.2 million in 2000. The results in fiscal 2000 included $2.1 million of operating income from Dallas Aerospace, prior to its disposition and $5.1 million of income recognized from the disposition of non-core property, offset partially by restructuring charges of $7.5 million. Operating income in fiscal 2001 was adversely affected by approximately $3.2 million due to the foreign currency impact on our European operations, and by the impairment charge of $5.9 million. Operating income of $23.2 million in fiscal 2000 increased $69.2 million, or 150.6%, compared to an operating loss of $45.9 million in fiscal 1999. Fiscal 1999 was affected by $71.4 million of expenses recognized for inventory impairment, restructuring costs and other costs related to acquisitions. Fiscal 2000 results also improved due to $5.1 million of gains recognized on the sale of real estate, and $3.2 million in increased rental revenue.       Net interest expense increased $11.6 million in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. However, cash interest expense of $50.5 million in 2001 actually decreased by $4.1 million, as compared to cash interest expense of $54.5 million in 2000. We recognized interest expense of $3.5 million in 2001, as compared to $1.0 million in 2000, resulting from $30.8 million borrowed in March 2000, and we capitalized $5.8 million of interest expense in fiscal 2000 from real estate development activities at our shopping center in Farmingdale, New York. Interest expense from the accretion of discount on long-term liabilities was $7.9 million in 2001, as compared to $0.1 million in 2000, and reflects primarily a 3/4% decline in discount rate from our postretirement benefit obligations. Net interest expense increased by 45.3% in fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999, as a result of the additional debt we incurred to finance the acquisition of Kaynar Technologies.       Investment income (loss), net, was $8.4 million, $9.9 million, and $39.8 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Investment income in these periods was due primarily to recognizing realized gains on investments liquidated. We recognized a large gain in 1999 from the liquidation of our position in AlliedSignal to raise funds to acquire Kaynar Technologies.       The fair market value adjustment of a ten-year $100 million interest rate contract decreased by $5.6 million in fiscal 2001.      Nonrecurring income of $28.6 million in fiscal 2000 resulted from $25.7 million, $2.0 million, and $0.9 million gains recognized on the disposition of our equity investment in Nacanco Paketleme, our Camloc Gas Springs division and a smaller equity investment, respectively.       We recorded an income tax benefit of $16.5 million in fiscal 2001, representing a 52.3% effective tax rate on pre-tax losses from continuing operations. The tax benefit was higher than the statutory rate due primarily to the reversal of $3.5 million of tax accruals no longer required. We recorded an income tax benefit of $4.4 million in fiscal 2000 on earnings from continuing operations of $17.7 million. A tax benefit was recorded due primarily to a change in the estimate of required tax accruals. We recorded an income tax benefit of $13.2 million in fiscal 1999 representing a 36.3% effective tax rate on pre-tax losses from continuing operations. The tax benefit approximates the statutory rate.       Equity in earnings of affiliates improved by $0.5 million in 2001 compared to 2000, and decreased by $2.1 million in 2000, compared to 1999. The decrease in 2001 was attributable primarily to $0.1 million of income in 2001, as compared to $0.3 million of losses from small start-up ventures in 2000. In July 1999, we divested our 31.9% interest in Nacanco and this reduced our equity earnings in fiscal 2000.  In 1998, we adopted a formal plan to discontinue Fairchild Technologies. In connection with the adoption of such plan, we recorded an after-tax charge of $12.0 million and $31.3 million, in discontinued operations, in fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively. The fiscal 1999 after-tax operating loss from Fairchild Technologies exceeded the June 1998 estimate recorded for expected losses by $28.6 million, net of an income tax benefit of $8.1 million, through June 1999. An additional after-tax charge of $2.8 million, net of an income tax benefit of $2.4 million, was recorded in fiscal 1999, for estimated remaining losses in connection with the disposition of Fairchild Technologies. The fiscal 2000 after-tax loss in connection with the final disposition of the remaining operations of Fairchild Technologies exceeded anticipated losses by $20.0 million, net of an income tax benefit of $8.0 million.       In fiscal 1999, we recognized an extraordinary loss of $4.2 million, net of tax, to write-off the remaining deferred loan fees associated with the early extinguishment of our indebtedness pursuant to our acquisition of Kaynar Technologies.       Comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized holding changes in the fair market value of available-for-sale investment securities. The fair market value of unrealized holding securities declined by $1.0 million, $4.0 million and $16.5 million in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The changes reflect primarily gains realized from the liquidation of investments, including AlliedSignal common stock divested in fiscal 1999. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased by $24.5 million, $10.1 million and $2.5 million in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the French Franc and German Mark.       We adopted SFAS 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" on July 1, 2000. At adoption, we recorded within other comprehensive income, a decrease of $0.5 million in the fair market value of our $100 million interest rate swap agreement. The $0.5 million decrease will be amortized over the remaining life of the interest rate swap agreement using the effective interest method. The offsetting interest rate swap liability is separately being reported as a "fair market value of interest rate contract" within other long-term liabilities. In the statement of earnings we have recorded the net swap interest accrual as part of interest expense. Unrealized changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded net of the current interest accrual on a separate line entitled "decrease in fair market value of interest rate derivatives."     Segment Results    Aerospace Fasteners Segment       Sales in our Aerospace Fasteners segment increased by $3.3 million, or 0.6%, in fiscal 2001, as compared to fiscal 2000. Sales by our European operations were adversely effected by approximately $24.4 million in 2001, compared to 2000, due to the foreign currency impact from the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Euro. However, our book-to-bill ratio improved to approximately 106% in 2001, as compared to 99% in 2000, which we believe indicates an improving market place as compared to the sluggish conditions we have experienced over the past twelve months. This favorable trend has led to a $15.8 million increase in backlog to $220.0 million at June 30, 2001, compared to $204.2 million at June 30, 2000. Sales by our aerospace fasteners segment increased by $90.9 million to $533.6 million, up 20.5% in fiscal 2000, compared to fiscal 1999. These improvements reflected growth from acquisitions, offset partially by weakened demand for our products in the commercial aerospace industry. On a pro forma basis, sales decreased by 12.5% in fiscal 2000, as compared to fiscal 1999. In fiscal 2000, our operations in the United States were negatively impacted by reduced bookings caused by inventory reduction efforts at Boeing and its ripple effect on prices.       Operating income increased by $3.1 million in fiscal 2001, compared to fiscal 2000. The increase was due primarily to productivity improvements from cost reduction efforts, offset partially by reduced gross margins resulting from pricing pressures. Operating income in fiscal 2001 was adversely affected by approximately $3.2 million due to the foreign currency impact on our European operations. Operating expenses at all operations are being strictly controlled as management attempts to reduce operating costs to improve operating results in the short-term, without adversely affecting our future long-term performance. Operating income in our aerospace fasteners segment decreased by $5.0 million in fiscal 2000, compared to fiscal 1999. Included in our fiscal 2000 and 1999 results are restructuring charges of $8.6 million and $5.5 million, respectively, incurred due to the integration of Kaynar Technologies into our Aerospace Fasteners business. Excluding restructuring charges, operating income decreased by $2.0 million in fiscal 2000, compared to fiscal 1999, reflecting reduced margins due to pricing pressures, offset partially by cost improvement initiatives and acquisitions made during fiscal 1999. On a pro forma basis and excluding restructuring charges, operating income decreased by $17.5 million in fiscal 2000, compared to fiscal 1999, due to lower sales levels associated with a weakened commercial aerospace industry and its negative effects on operating effectiveness.       Our Aerospace Fasteners segment has several manufacturing facilities located in California. From time-to-time these operations have been affected by an electric power shortage. We are cautiously optimistic that the electric power shortage in California will be resolved without any major business interruption, however, unless current tariffs are revised or their continued implementation stayed, our manufacturing costs may be materially higher. We are pursuing both long term and short term alternatives to our current electric power purchasing commitments. We anticipate that the overall demand for aerospace fasteners in fiscal 2002 will continue to improve as the announced increase in aircraft build rates favorably affect the demand for our products. However, aircraft build rates could be adversely affected by decreased worldwide demand for travel following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that temporarily halted domestic and hampered worldwide travel. The heinous terrorists' attacks of September 11, 2001, continue to have a significant effect on the commercial aviation industry, raising concerns about our strong order backlog and projected levels of new orders. A significant amount of cancellations of orders for aircraft from Boeing and Airbus could adversely impact our future results. We are monitoring events closely and any significant decline in future bookings will cause us to implement further cost reduction measures to protect our businesses.     Aerospace Distribution Segment       Sales in our aerospace distribution segment decreased by $15.1 million, or 14.9%, in fiscal 2001, compared to fiscal 2000. Results from fiscal 2000 included revenue of $21.7 million from Dallas Aerospace, prior to its disposition. Sales in our aerospace distribution segment decreased by $67.3 million, or 40.0%, in fiscal 2000, compared to the fiscal 1999 period. The decrease was due to the loss of revenues as a result of the disposition of Solair and Dallas Aerospace. On a pro forma basis, sales increased $6.6 million, or 8.3%, in 2001 compared to 2000, and $9.1 million, or 13.0%, in 2000 compared to 1999, reflecting an overall improvement in demand for our products.       Operating income in our aerospace distribution segment decreased by $5.3 million in 2001, compared to 2000. Operating income in 2001 included asset impairment charges of $3.1 million due to the closing of Banner Aircraft Services, which had operating losses of $3.9 million in 2001. The results for 2000, included operating income of $2.1 million from Dallas Aerospace, prior to its disposition. Operating income increased by $47.8 million in 2000, compared to 1999, which included a charge of $19.3 million due to the sale of Solair, and a $22.1 million charge relating to Dallas Aerospace, which was sold in November 1999. A charge of $41.4 million is included in the 1999 results, in connection with the disposition of Solair and the potential disposition of Dallas Aerospace. On a pro forma basis and excluding impairment charges, operating income was flat in 2001, as compared to 2000, and increased by $7.3 million in 2000, as compared to 1999, reflecting increases in margins and a reduction in corporate overhead.  Demand for our aerospace products could be adversely affected by decreased worldwide demand for travel following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that temporarily halted domestic and hampered worldwide travel.  Real Estate Operations Segment       Our real estate operations segment owns and operates a shopping center located in Farmingdale, New York. Included in operating income was rental revenue of $7.0 million, $3.6 million and $0.4 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Rental revenue was higher in the fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 periods due to an increase in the amount of space leased to tenants. As of June 30, 2001, approximately 74% of the developed shopping center was leased.       We reported an operating loss of $0.1 million for fiscal 2001 compared to operating income of $1.0 million in fiscal 2000. We recorded a one-time charge of $2.3 million to write-off improvements at our shopping center. The results of 2001 were also affected by an increase in administrative and depreciation expenses as a result of the increase in rental revenue.    Corporate Segment        The corporate segment includes the Gas Springs division prior to its disposition. The corporate segment reported a decrease in sales as a result of the disposition of the Camloc Gas Springs division in September 1999. The corporate segment reported that operating results improved by $1.4 million, or 7.1% in 2001, as compared to 2000. In fiscal 2000, operating results improved by $25.4 million, or 56.6%, reducing operating losses from $44.9 million in 1999 to $19.5 million in 2000. Results from fiscal 2001 and 2000 included $3.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively, of gains recognized on the disposition of non-core property. Results from fiscal 1999 included $23.6 million of one-time costs associated primarily with the acquisition of Kaynar Technologies, restructuring charges, and increased environmental, legal and travel expenses.  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Total capitalization as of June 30, 2001 and 2000 amounted to $858.9 million and $884.4 million, respectively. The changes in capitalization included an increase of $14.7 million in debt and a decrease of $40.3 million in equity. The increase in debt reflected an $18.1 million net increase in borrowings with our primary lenders, as a result of cash borrowed to support our operations. The decrease in equity was due primarily to our reported net loss of $15.0 million, and a $26.0 million decrease in cumulative other comprehensive income, which was due primarily to $24.5 million in unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments.       We maintain a portfolio of investments classified primarily as available-for-sale securities, which had a fair market value of $10.9 million at June 30, 2001. The market value of the investment portfolio decreased by $8.3 million in 2001 as a result of realized gains from the divestiture of securities. There is risk associated with market fluctuations inherent in stock investments, and because our portfolio is not diversified, large swings in its value may occur.       Net cash used for operating activities for fiscal 2001 was $39.5 million. The primary use of cash for operating activities in fiscal 2001 was a $9.1 million increase in inventories, a $71.4 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, and a $16.7 million increase in other current assets, offset partially by a $5.5 million decrease in accounts receivable. Net cash used for operating activities for fiscal 2000 was $67.1 million. The primary use of cash for operating activities in fiscal 2000 was a $23.2 million increase in inventories, a $12.0 million decrease in accounts payable, and a $25.7 million increase in other current assets. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 1999 was $23.3 million. The primary source of cash for operating activities in fiscal 1999 was an increase in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities of $45.9 million, partially offset by our net loss and non-cash adjustments of $16.8 million.       Net cash provided from investing activities for fiscal 2001 was $4.1 million, and included $16.4 million in proceeds received from the dispositions of investments, and $4.6 million in proceeds received from the disposition of property, offset by capital expenditures of $16.4 million. Net cash provided from investing activities for fiscal 2000 was $90.4 million, and included $108.8 million in proceeds received from the dispositions of Dallas Aerospace, our Gas Springs division and our investment in Nacanco Paketleme, and $12.0 million in proceeds received from the condemnation of property. This was slightly offset by cash of $27.3 million used for capital expenditures and $27.7 million for real estate investments. Net cash used for investing activities for fiscal 1999 was $99.2 million, and included $274.4 million used for acquisitions, partially offset by $189.4 million received from the liquidation of investments.       Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2001 was $15.4 million, and included a $14.7 million net issuance of additional debt used to fund operations. Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2000 was $41.4 million. The primary use of cash for financing activities in fiscal 2000 was $39.4 million used to reduce debt. Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 1999 was $81.2 million. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 1999 included the issuance of additional debt of $483.2 million, offset partially by $380.0 million of debt repayments, and $22.1 million of treasury stock purchased. We increased our debt in fiscal 1999, as a result of the acquisition of Kaynar Technologies.       Our working capital requirement has increased in fiscal 2001, as our aerospace fasteners segment engaged in a new inventory supply program with a customer, requiring a significant investment in inventory. Under this program, we must maintain a certain level of inventory to fulfill the customer's monthly requirements. Sales under the program are expected to increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2002.       Our principal cash requirements include debt service, capital expenditures, real estate development, and payment of other liabilities. Other liabilities that require the use of cash include postretirement benefits, environmental investigation and remediation obligations, and litigation settlements and related costs. We expect that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, cash available from borrowings and additional financing and asset sales will be adequate to satisfy our cash requirements during the next twelve months.       We are required under the credit agreement to comply with certain financial and non-financial loan covenants, including maintaining certain interest and fixed charge coverage ratios and maintaining certain indebtedness to EBITDA ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter. Our most restrictive covenant is the interest coverage ratio, which represents the ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement. At June 30, 2001, the interest coverage ratio was 2.05, which exceeded the minimum requirement of 2.0. Additionally, the credit agreement restricts annual capital expenditures to $40 million during the life of the facility. Except for non-guarantor assets, substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral under the credit agreement. The credit agreement restricts the payment of dividends to our shareholders to an aggregate of the lesser of $0.01 per share or $0.4 million over the life of the agreement. Noncompliance with any of the financial covenants without cure or waiver would constitute an event of default under the credit agreement. An event of default resulting from a breach of a financial covenant may result, at the option of lenders holding a majority of the loans, in an acceleration of the principal and interest outstanding, and a termination of the revolving credit line. At June 30, 2001, we were in full compliance with all the covenants under the credit agreement.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS       In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Accounting for Business Combinations." This statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. We will follow the requirements of this statement for business acquisitions made after June 30, 2001.       In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." This statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life not be amortized. Instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life, the statement requires a test for impairment to be performed annually, or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist. The amortization period of intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and permits early adoption for fiscal years beginning after March 15, 2001. We will adopt SFAS No. 142 on July 1, 2001. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 142, we will stop amortizing goodwill of approximately $12.5 million per year. Due to the fair value measurement requirement, rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach, we may have to record a material impairment from the implementation of SFAS No. 142. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting this standard.       In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations". This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and associated asset retirement costs. It applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development, and normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain lease obligations. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.       ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK        In fiscal 1998, we entered into a ten-year interest rate swap agreement to reduce our cash flow exposure to increases in interest rates on variable rate debt. The ten-year interest rate swap agreement provides us with interest rate protection on $100 million of variable rate debt, with interest being calculated based on a fixed LIBOR rate of 6.24% to February 17, 2003. On February 17, 2003, the bank, that we entered into the interest rate swap agreement, will have a one-time option to elect to cancel the agreement or to do nothing and proceed with the transaction, using a fixed LIBOR rate of 6.715% for the period February 17, 2003 to February 19, 2008.       We did not elect to pursue hedge accounting for the interest rate swap agreement, which was executed to provide an economic hedge against cash flow variability on the floating rate note. When evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 133 on this hedge relationship, we assessed the key characteristics of the interest rate swap agreement and the note. Based on this assessment, we determined that the hedging relationship would not be highly effective. The ineffectiveness is caused by the existence of the embedded written call option in the interest rate swap agreement, and the absence of a mirror option in the hedged item. As such, pursuant to SFAS No. 133, we designated the interest rate swap agreement in the no hedging designation category. Accordingly, we have recognized a non-cash decrease in fair market value of interest rate derivatives of $5.6 million in fiscal 2001 as a result of the fair market value adjustment for our interest rate swap agreement.       The fair market value adjustment of these agreements will generally fluctuate based on the implied forward interest rate curve for 3-month LIBOR. If the implied forward interest rate curve decreases, the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will increase and we will record an additional charge. If the implied forward interest rate curve increases, the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will decrease, and we will record income.       In March 2000, the Company issued a floating rate note with a principal amount of $30,750,000. Embedded within the promissory note agreement is an interest rate cap. The embedded interest rate cap limits the 1-month LIBOR interest rate that we must pay on the note to 8.125%. At execution of the promissory note, the strike rate of the embedded interest rate cap of 8.125% was above the 1-month LIBOR rate of 6.61%. Under SFAS 133, the embedded interest rate cap is considered to be clearly and closely related to the debt of the host contract and is not required to be separated and accounted for separately from the host contract. In fiscal 2001, we accounted for the hybrid contract, comprised of the variable rate note and the embedded interest rate cap, as a single debt instrument.       The table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, which include interest rate swaps. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date.
