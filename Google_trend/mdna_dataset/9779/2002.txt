ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND                 FINANCIAL CONDITION       The  Fairchild  Corporation  was  incorporated  in October  1969,  under the laws of the State of Delaware.  We own 100% of RHI Holdings,  Inc.  and Banner  Aerospace,  Inc. RHI is the owner of 100% of Fairchild  Holding  Corp. Our  principal  operations  are conducted through Fairchild Holding Corp. and Banner Aerospace.       The following discussion and analysis provide information which management believes is relevant to the assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  GENERAL       We are a leading worldwide aerospace and industrial fastener manufacturer and distribution supply chain services provider and, through Banner Aerospace, an international supplier to airlines and general aviation businesses, distributing a wide range of aircraft parts and related support services. Through internal growth and strategic acquisitions, we have become one of the leading suppliers of fasteners to aircraft OEMs, such as Boeing, European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, General Electric, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman.       Our business consists of three segments: aerospace fasteners, aerospace distribution and real estate operations. The aerospace fasteners segment manufactures and markets high performance fastening systems used in the manufacture and maintenance of commercial and military aircraft. Our aerospace distribution segment stocks and distributes a wide variety of aircraft parts to commercial airlines and air cargo carriers, fixed-base operators, corporate aircraft operators and other aerospace companies. Our real estate operations segment owns and operates a shopping center located in Farmingdale, New York.  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT       Certain statements in this financial discussion and analysis by management contain certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to our financial condition, results of operation and business. These statements relate to analyses and other information, which are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements also relate to our future prospects, developments and business strategies. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as "anticipate," "believe," "could," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "predict," "project," "will" and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including current trend information, projections for deliveries, backlog and other trend estimates, that may cause our actual future activities and results of operations to be materially different from those suggested or described in this financial discussion and analysis by management. These risks include: product demand; our dependence on the aerospace industry; reliance on Boeing and European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company; customer satisfaction and quality issues; labor disputes; competition, including recent intense price competition; our ability to achieve and execute internal business plans; worldwide political instability and economic growth; reduced passenger miles flown as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States; the cost and availability of electric power to operate our plants; and the impact of any economic downturns and inflation.       If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materializes, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those expected, estimated or projected. Given these uncertainties, users of the information included in this financial discussion and analysis by management, including investors and prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update the forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report, even if new information, future events or other circumstances have made them incorrect or misleading.       CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES       On December 12, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Release No. 33-8040, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies." Critical accounting policies are those that involve subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates. In response to Release No. 33-8040, we reviewed our accounting policies. The following areas require the use of judgments and estimates: the valuation of long-lived assets, pension and postretirement benefits, deferred income taxes, environmental and litigation accruals and revenue recognition. Estimates in each of these areas are based on historical experience and a variety of assumptions that we believe are appropriate. Actual results may differ from these estimates.       Valuation of Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets for impairment, including property, plant and equipment, and identifiable intangibles with definite lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. To determine recoverability of our long-lived assets, we evaluate the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be greater than the carrying amount of our assets. Impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount of our assets and their estimated fair value.       Pension and Postretirement Benefits: We have defined benefit pension plans covering most of our employees. Employees in our foreign subsidiaries may participate in local pension plans, for which our liability is in the aggregate insignificant. Our funding policy is to make the minimum annual contribution required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or local statutory law. The accumulated benefit obligation for pensions and postretirement benefits was determined using a discount rate of 7.125% at June 30, 2002 and 7.25% at June 30, 2001. The effect of such change resulted in an increase to the accumulated benefit obligation in 2002. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. For measurement purposes, we assumed a 10.0% annual rate of increase in the per capita claims cost of covered health care benefits for 2002. The rate was assumed to decrease to 5.0% in 2003 and remain at that level thereafter.       Deferred Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.       Environmental Matters: Our operations are subject to stringent government imposed environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of materials into the environment and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. To date, such laws and regulations have not had a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or net cash flows, although we have expended, and can be expected to expend in the future, significant amounts for the investigation of environmental conditions and installation of environmental control facilities, remediation of environmental conditions and other similar matters, particularly in our aerospace fasteners segment.       In connection with our plans to dispose of certain real estate, we must investigate environmental conditions and we may be required to take certain corrective action prior or pursuant to any such disposition. In addition, we have identified several areas of potential contamination related to other facilities owned, or previously owned, by us, that may require us either to take corrective action or to contribute to a clean-up. We are also a defendant in certain lawsuits and proceedings seeking to require us to pay for investigation or remediation of environmental matters, and we have been alleged to be a potentially responsible party at various "superfund" sites. We believe that we have recorded adequate reserves in our financial statements to complete such investigation and take any necessary corrective actions or make any necessary contributions. No amounts have been recorded as due from third parties, including insurers, or set off against, any environmental liability, unless such parties are contractually obligated to contribute and are not disputing such liability.       Legal Matters: We are involved in various other claims and lawsuits incidental to our business. We, either on our own or through our insurance carriers, are contesting these matters. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future results of operations, or net cash flows.       Revenue Recognition: Sales and related costs are recognized upon shipment of products and/or performance of services, when collection is probable. Sales and related cost of sales on long-term contracts are recognized as products are delivered and services performed, as determined by the percentage of completion method. Lease and rental revenue are recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Shipping and handling amounts billed to customers are classified as revenues.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Business Transactions       The following summarizes certain business combinations and transactions we completed which significantly affect the comparability of the period to period results presented in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.     Fiscal 2000 Transactions       On July 29, 1999, we sold our 31.9% interest in Nacanco Paketleme to American National Can Group, Inc. for approximately $48.2 million. Our investment in Nacanco began in November 1987, and throughout the years we invested approximately $6.2 million in Nacanco. Since the inception of our investment, we recorded equity earnings of $25.7 million and received cash dividends of $12.5 million from Nacanco. We recognized a $25.7 million nonrecurring gain from this divestiture in the nine months ended April 2, 2000. We also agreed to provide consulting services over a three-year period, at an annual fee of approximately $1.5 million. We used the net proceeds from the disposition to reduce our indebtedness. As a result of this disposition, our interest expense was reduced. However, our equity earnings and dividend proceeds also significantly decreased. In accordance with our plan to dispose of non-core assets, the opportunity to dispose of our interest in Nacanco Paketleme presented us with an excellent opportunity to realize a substantial return on our investment and allowed us to reduce our then outstanding indebtedness by approximately 8.6%.       On September 3, 1999, we completed the disposal of our Camloc Gas Springs division to a subsidiary of Arvin Industries Inc. for approximately $2.7 million. In addition, we received $2.4 million from Arvin Industries for a covenant not to compete. We recognized a $2.0 million nonrecurring pre-tax gain from this disposition. We decided to dispose of the Camloc Gas Springs division in order to concentrate our focus on our operations in the aerospace industry.       On December 1, 1999, we disposed of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of our Dallas Aerospace subsidiary to United Technologies Inc. for approximately $57.0 million. No gain or loss was recognized from this transaction, as the proceeds received approximated the net carrying value of these assets. Approximately $37.0 million of the proceeds from this disposition were used to reduce our bank term indebtedness and our interest expense. As a result of this transaction, we reported a reduction in revenues of $21.7 million and operating income of $2.1 million for the nine months ended April 1, 2001, as compared to the nine months ended April 2, 2000. We estimated that the market base for the older-type of engines that we were selling was shrinking, and that we would be required to invest a substantial amount of cash to purchase newer-type of engines to maintain market share. The opportunity to exit this business presented us with an opportunity to improve cash flows by reducing our indebtedness by $37.0 million, and by preserving our cash, which would otherwise have had to have been invested to upgrade our inventory.       On April 13, 2000, we completed a spin-off to our stockholders of the shares of Fairchild (Bermuda) Ltd. On April 14, 2000, Fairchild (Bermuda) sold to Convac Technologies Ltd. the Optical Disc Equipment Group business formerly owned by Fairchild Technologies. Subsequently, on April 14, 2000, Fairchild (Bermuda), renamed Global Sources Ltd., completed an exchange of approximately 95% of its shares for 100% of the shares of Trade Media Holdings Limited, an Asian based, business-to-business online and traditional marketplace services provider. Immediately after the share exchange, our stockholders owned 1,183,081 shares of the 26,152,308 issued shares of Global Sources. Global Sources shares are listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol "GSOL". This transaction allowed us to complete our formal plan to dispose of Fairchild Technologies and provided our shareholders with a unique opportunity to participate in a new public entity.    Consolidated Results       We currently report in three principal business segments: aerospace fasteners, aerospace distribution and real estate operations. The results of Camloc Gas Springs division, prior to its disposition, were included in the Corporate and Other classification. The following table provides the historical sales and operating income of our operations for fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000. The following table also illustrates sales and operating income of our operations by segment, on an unaudited pro forma basis, for fiscal 2000, as if we had operated in a consistent manner in each of the reported periods. The pro forma results represent the impact of our dispositions of Dallas Aerospace in December 1999 and Camloc Gas Springs in September 1999, as if these transactions had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2000. The pro forma information is based on the historical financial statements of these companies, giving effect to the aforementioned transactions. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations, that would actually have occurred if these transactions had been in effect since the beginning of fiscal 2000, nor is it necessarily indicative of our future results.

(b) Fiscal 2000 results include restructuring charges of $8.6 million in the aerospace fasteners segment (c) Fiscal 2002 results include one-time impairment expenses of $3.0 million in the aerospace fasteners segment and $0.4          million in the real estate operations segment. Fiscal 2001 results          includes one-time impairment charges of $1.1 million in the aerospace          fasteners segment, $2.4 million in the aerospace distribution segment,          and $2.5 million in the real estate operations segment.         Net sales of $624.1 million in 2002 increased by $1.3 million, or 0.2%, compared to sales of $622.8 million in 2001. Results for the 2001 included revenue of $8.4 million from an operation in our aerospace distribution segment, which was shut down in June 2001. Excluding the results of the shut down operation, net sales would have increased by $9.7 million, or 1.6%, in 2002, as compared to 2001. Sales in 2002 reflected growth at our aerospace fasteners segment due to strong order activity prior to September 11, 2001. Net sales of $622.8 million in 2001 decreased by $12.6 million, or 2.0%, compared to sales of $635.4 million in 2000. The results for 2000, included revenue of $22.4 million from Dallas Aerospace and the Camloc Gas Springs division prior to their respective dispositions. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for the 2000 dispositions, net sales increased by $9.9 million for 2001, as compared to 2000.      Rental revenue was $6.7 million in 2002, $7.0 million in 2001, and $3.6 million in 2000. Rental revenue decreased slightly in 2002, due to a decrease in the amount of space leased to tenants during the year. Rental revenue was higher in the 2001 and 2000 periods due to an increase in the amount of space leased to tenants.       Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 24.3%, 25.1%, and 25.7% in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The changes in gross margin in 2002 are attributable primarily to a higher volume of sales of lower margin products. The changes in gross margin in 2001 are attributable to a change in product mix as a result of dispositions.       Selling, general & administrative expense as a percentage of sales was 20.6%, 20.1%, and 20.6%, in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.       Other income decreased $0.9 million in 2002, as compared to 2001, and was offset partially by income recognized from the disposition of future royalty revenues to an unaffiliated third party in exchange for promissory notes secured by $12.8 million face value of our outstanding 10 3/4% senior subordinated debentures due 2009 acquired by the third party. Other income decreased $4.9 million in 2001, as compared to 2000. The decrease in 2001 was due primarily to $5.1 million of income recognized from the disposition of non-core property in 2000, and a $0.7 million loss recognized from the disposition of non-core property during 2001.       An impairment charge of $3.4 million and $5.9 million was recorded in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The fiscal 2002 impairment charge included $3.0 million to write down the long-lived assets of a small airframe component manufacturing operation at our aerospace fasteners segment that we are attempting to sell and $0.4 million to write-off of former tenant improvements at our shopping center. The fiscal 2001 impairment charge included $2.4 million due to the closing of a small subsidiary at our aerospace distribution segment, of which $1.7 million represented the write-off of goodwill, and $0.4 million represented severance payments. Additionally, the fiscal 2001 impairment charge also included a write-off of approximately $2.4 million of improvements at our shopping center, and a $1.1 million for the write-off of leasehold improvements from the relocation of our domestic distribution facility in our aerospace fasteners segment.       In fiscal 2000, we recorded $8.6 million of restructuring charges as a result of the integration of Kaynar Technologies, acquired in April 1999, into our aerospace fasteners segment. All of the charges recorded were a direct result of product and plant integration costs incurred as of June 30, 2000. These costs were classified as restructuring and were the direct result of formal plans to move equipment, close plants and to terminate employees. Such costs are nonrecurring in nature. Other than a reduction in our existing cost structure, none of the restructuring charges resulted in future increases in earnings or represented an accrual of future costs.       Operating income of $26.8 million in 2002 increased $5.5 million, or 26.0%, compared to operating income of $21.3 million in 2001. The 2001 results included goodwill amortization of $12.5 million, prior to the implementation of a new accounting pronouncement that eliminates goodwill amortization in the 2002 period. Operating income of $21.3 million in 2001 decreased by $1.9 million as compared to operating income of $23.2 million in 2000. The results in fiscal 2000 included $2.1 million of operating income from Dallas Aerospace, prior to its disposition and $5.1 million of income recognized from the disposition of non-core property, offset partially by restructuring charges of $7.5 million. Operating income in fiscal 2001 was adversely affected by the impairment charge of $5.9 million.       Net interest expense decreased by $9.0 million, or 16.1%, and cash interest expense decreased by $5.8 million in fiscal 2002, as compared to fiscal 2001, due primarily to lower interest rates on our variable rate debt. Net interest expense increased $11.6 million in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. However, cash interest expense of $50.5 million in 2001 actually decreased by $4.1 million, as compared to cash interest expense of $54.5 million in 2000. We recognized interest expense of $3.5 million in 2001, as compared to $1.0 million in 2000, resulting from $30.8 million borrowed in March 2000, and we capitalized $5.8 million of interest expense in fiscal 2000 from real estate development activities at our shopping center in Farmingdale, New York.       We recorded a net investment loss of $1.0 million in 2002, and investment income of $8.4 million in 2001 and $9.9 million in 2000. The investment results in fiscal 2002 included a $2.3 million write down for impaired investments and a $0.8 million loss on investments sold, offset partially by $1.6 million of dividend income and a $0.5 million increase in the fair market value of trading securities. Investment income in 2001 and 2000 was due primarily to recognition of gains on investments liquidated.       The fair market value adjustment of our position in a ten-year $100 million interest rate contract decreased by $4.6 million in fiscal 2002 and $5.6 million in 2001. The fair market value adjustment of this agreement will generally fluctuate, based on the implied forward interest rate curve for 3-month LIBOR. If the implied forward interest rate curve decreases, the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will increase and we will record an additional charge. If the implied forward interest rate curve increases, the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will decrease, and we will record income.      Nonrecurring income of $28.6 million in fiscal 2000 resulted from $25.7 million, $2.0 million, and $0.9 million gains recognized on the disposition of our equity investment in Nacanco Paketleme, our Camloc Gas Springs division and a smaller equity investment, respectively.       We recorded an income tax benefit of $15.4 million in fiscal 2002, representing a 60.3% effective tax rate benefit on pre-tax losses from continuing operations. The tax benefit was higher than the statutory rate due primarily to the reversal of $14.0 million of tax accruals no longer required. We recorded an income tax benefit of $16.5 million in fiscal 2001, representing a 52.3% effective tax rate on pre-tax losses from continuing operations. The tax benefit was higher than the statutory rate due primarily to the reversal of $3.5 million of tax accruals no longer required. We recorded an income tax benefit of $4.4 million in fiscal 2000 on earnings from continuing operations of $17.7 million. A tax benefit was recorded due primarily to a change in the estimate of required tax accruals.       Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased by $0.2 million in 2002, compared to 2001 and improved by $0.5 million in 2001 compared to 2000. The decrease in 2002 reflected $0.1 million of equity losses in 2002 as compared to equity income of $0.1 million in 2001. The improvement in 2001 was attributable primarily to $0.1 million of income in 2001, as compared to $0.3 million of losses from small start-up ventures in 2000.       In 1998, we adopted a formal plan to discontinue Fairchild Technologies. In connection with the adoption of such plan, we recorded an after-tax charge of $12.0 million and $31.3 million, in discontinued operations, in fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively. The fiscal 1999 after-tax operating loss from Fairchild Technologies exceeded the June 1998 estimate recorded for expected losses by $28.6 million, net of an income tax benefit of $8.1 million, through June 1999. An additional after-tax charge of $2.8 million, net of an income tax benefit of $2.4 million, was recorded in fiscal 1999, for estimated remaining losses in connection with the disposition of Fairchild Technologies. The fiscal 2000 after-tax loss in connection with the final disposition of the remaining operations of Fairchild Technologies exceeded anticipated losses by $20.0 million, net of an income tax benefit of $8.0 million.       In 2002, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $144.6 million from the implementation of SFAS No. 142, presented as a cumulative effect of change in accounting, as of the beginning of our fiscal year. All of the impairment charge relates to the three operating units within our aerospace fasteners segment. No tax effect was recognized on the change in accounting for goodwill. Instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life, goodwill will be tested for impairment annually, or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist. All of our goodwill has been deemed to have an indefinite life, and as a result of adopting SFAS No. 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill. Prior to the implementation of SFAS No. 142, we recognized amortization expense for goodwill of $12.5 million and $12.6 million, in 2001 and 2000, respectively.       Comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized holding changes in the fair market value of available-for-sale investment securities. The fair market value of available-for-sale securities, on an after-tax basis, declined by $0.6 million, $1.0 million, and $4.0 million, in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The changes in 2001 and 2000 reflect primarily gains realized from the liquidation of investments. Foreign currency translation adjustments improved by $21.6 million in 2002, which reflected the strengthening of the EURO to the U.S. Dollar. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased by $24.5 million, and $10.1 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the EURO.       We are currently evaluating a change in our method of accounting for our inventory costing at two of our domestic aerospace fasteners manufacturing operations from the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method, to the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. Inventories accounted for using the LIFO method represented only 15.6% of our total inventory. If we were to implement this change in method of inventory costing we will be required to retroactively restate our financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2000 and June 30, 2001, which were audited by Arthur Andersen LLP. Since Arthur Andersen is no longer issuing audit opinions, our current auditors would be required to reaudit our financial statements for the periods ended June 30, 2000 and June 30, 2001.       We adopted SFAS 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" on July 1, 2000. At adoption, we recorded within other comprehensive income, a decrease of $0.5 million in the fair market value of our $100 million interest rate swap agreement. The $0.5 million decrease will be amortized over the remaining life of the interest rate swap agreement using the effective interest method. The offsetting interest rate swap liability is separately being reported as a "fair market value of interest rate contract" within other long-term liabilities. In the statement of earnings we have recorded the net swap interest accrual as part of interest expense. Unrealized changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded net of the current interest accrual on a separate line entitled "decrease in fair market value of interest rate derivatives."     Segment Results    Aerospace Fasteners Segment       Sales in our Aerospace Fasteners segment increased by $23.9 million, or 4.4%, in 2002, as compared 2001. The improvement reflected internal growth, which was partially offset by a reduction in deliveries in the third and fourth quarters due to retrenchment in the aerospace industry following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Our backlog decreased by $42.1 million in 2002, to $177.9 million at June 30, 2002. Our book-to-bill ratio was 91.6% in fiscal 2002, reflecting the softening of new orders following September 11, 2001. Sales in our Aerospace Fasteners segment increased by $3.3 million, or 0.6%, in 2001, as compared to 2000. Sales by our European operations were adversely affected by approximately $24.4 million in 2001, compared to 2000, due to the foreign currency impact from the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Euro.       Operating income increased by $4.6 million, or 12.4%, in 2002, as compared to 2001. The improvement in 2002 was due primarily to the increase in sales and related economies of scale and the adoption, as of July 1, 2001, of a new accounting pronouncement that does not require us to amortize goodwill. Goodwill amortization of $11.3 million was recorded in 2001. We also recorded an impairment charge of $3.0 million to write down the long-lived assets of a small airframe manufacturing operation at our aerospace fasteners segment, that we are attempting to sell. Operating income increased by $3.1 million in 2001, compared to 2000. The increase was due primarily to productivity improvements from cost reduction efforts, offset partially by reduced gross margins resulting from pricing pressures. Operating income in 2001 was adversely affected by approximately $3.2 million due to the foreign currency impact on our European operations.       Announcements by our major customers have reinforced our view that projected aircraft build rates will be adversely affected by decreased worldwide demand for travel following September 11, 2001. Accordingly, we believe overall demand for aerospace fasteners will decrease during the remainder of calendar 2002, and our business will be affected by this decreased demand. Nevertheless, we also believe the impact on our business will be partially offset by the supply chain service programs we entered into during the past several years and by the decrease in fastener inventory available to OEMs and distributors.       We have decided to sell our Fairchild Fasteners business for approximately $657 million in cash to Alcoa Inc. The sale, which is expected to close before November 30, 2002, is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approvals, the tendering of over 50% of our 10 3/4% senior subordinated debentures due April 2009, and the approval of our shareholders (See Item 8, Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).       Aerospace Distribution Segment       Sales in our aerospace distribution segment decreased by $22.6 million in 2002, compared to 2001. Results in 2001, included revenue of $8.4 million from an operation which was shut down in June 2001. Sales in 2002 were also adversely affected due to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Sales in our aerospace distribution segment decreased by $15.1 million, or 14.9%, in fiscal 2001, compared to fiscal 2000. Results from fiscal 2000 included revenue of $21.7 million from Dallas Aerospace, prior to its disposition. On a pro forma basis, sales increased $6.6 million, or 8.3%, in 2001 compared to 2000, which reflected an overall improvement in demand for our products prior to September 11, 2001.       Operating income increased by $0.1 million in 2002, as compared to 2001. The results in 2002 were affected by the reduction in revenue. Operating income in 2001 included asset impairment charges of $3.1 million due to the closing of Banner Aircraft Services, which also had operating losses of $3.9 million in 2001. Operating income in our aerospace distribution segment decreased by $5.3 million in 2001, compared to 2000. The results for 2000, included operating income of $2.1 million from Dallas Aerospace, prior to its disposition.  Real Estate Operations Segment       Our real estate operations segment owns and operates a 456,000 square foot shopping center located in Farmingdale, New York. We have two tenants that each occupy more than 10% of the rentable space of the shopping center. Rental revenue was $6.7 million in 2002, $7.0 million in 2001, and $3.6 million in 2000. Rental revenue decreased slightly in 2002, due to a decrease in the average per square foot amount charged to tenants, as compared to 2001. Rental revenue was higher in the 2001, as compared to 2000, due to an increase in the amount of space leased to tenants. The weighted average occupancy rate of the shopping center was 76.9%, 74.4% and 48.9% in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The average effective annual rental rate per square foot was $19.22, $20.91, and $16.23 in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. As of June 30, 2002, approximately 92% of the shopping center was leased. We anticipate that rental income will increase during 2003, as a result of us entering to new agreements, to lease approximately 54,000 square feet, shortly before the end of 2002.        Operating income increased by $1.2 million in 2002, as compared to 2001. In 2002, depreciation expense and real estate taxes increased by $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively, as a result of an increased weighted-average portion of the shopping center being placed into service in 2002. The results for 2001 were adversely affected by one-time charge of $2.5 million to write-off improvements at our shopping center. We reported an operating loss of $0.1 million for 2001, compared to operating income of $1.0 million in 2000. The results of 2001 were also affected by an increase in administrative and depreciation expenses as a result of the increase in rental revenue as compared to 2000.    Corporate Segment       The corporate segment reported that operating results decreased by $0.3 million, or 1.9%, in 2002, as compared to 2001 and improved by $1.4 million, or 7.1% in 2001, as compared to 2000. Results from 2001 and 2000 included $3.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively, of gains recognized on the disposition of non-core assets. Results in each of the three years ended June 30, 2002, included consulting income of $1.5 million. The consulting agreement expired on June 30, 2002 and no additional proceeds from this agreement will be received in future years. The corporate segment included sales from the Gas Springs division prior to its disposition in September 1999.  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Total capitalization as of June 30, 2002 and 2001 amounted to $719.8 million and $858.9 million, respectively. The changes in capitalization in 2002 included a decrease of $5.3 million in debt and $133.8 million in equity. The decrease in debt reflected a $6.4 million decrease in short-term borrowings and other debt, partially offset by a $1.2 million net increase in borrowings with our primary lenders. The decrease in equity reflects the $144.6 million cumulative effect of change in accounting for goodwill, and a $10.2 million loss from continuing operations, offset partially by a $21.1 million increase in cumulative other comprehensive income, which was due primarily to a $21.6 million favorable effect in foreign currency fluctuations.       We maintain a portfolio of investments classified primarily as available-for-sale securities, which had a fair market value of $5.9 million at June 30, 2002. The market value of these investments decreased by $0.6 million in 2002. There is risk associated with market fluctuations inherent in stock investments, and because our portfolio is not diversified, changes in its value may occur.       Net cash provided by operating activities for 2002 was $18.8 million. The working capital uses of cash in 2002 included a $29.4 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and a $10.4 million increase in other non-current assets, offset partially by a $10.6 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $10.6 million decrease in other current assets and a $5.1 million decrease in inventory. The working capital uses of cash were offset by $30.4 million of earnings after deducting non-cash expenses of $30.5 million for depreciation, $2.1 million from the amortization of deferred loan fees, $144.6 million for the cumulative effect of change in accounting for goodwill, $3.4 million loss from impairments, and $4.6 million from the reduction in the fair market value of an interest rate contract. Net cash used for operating activities for fiscal 2001 was $39.5 million. The primary use of cash for operating activities in 2001 was a $9.1 million increase in inventories, a $117.7 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, offset partially by a $5.5 million decrease in accounts receivable and a $31.6 million increase in other current assets,. Net cash used for operating activities for 2000 was $67.1 million. In 2000, the primary use of cash for operating activities was a $23.2 million increase in inventories, a $12.0 million decrease in accounts payable, and a $25.2 million increase in other current assets.       Net cash used for investing activities was $9.8 million in 2002. The primary source of cash in 2002 was $8.0 million provided from the dispositions of non-core real estate and net assets held for sale, offset by $11.9 million of capital expenditures and a $5.6 increase in notes receivable. Net cash provided from investing activities for 2001 was $4.1 million, and included $16.4 million in proceeds received from the dispositions of investments, and $4.6 million in proceeds received from the disposition of property, offset by capital expenditures of $16.4 million. Net cash provided from investing activities for 2000 was $90.4 million, and included $108.8 million in proceeds received from the dispositions of Dallas Aerospace, our Gas Springs division and our investment in Nacanco Paketleme, and $12.0 million in proceeds received from the condemnation of property. This was slightly offset by cash of $27.3 million used for capital expenditures and $27.7 million for real estate investments.       Net cash used for financing activities in 2002 included a $9.6 million decrease in debt. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $15.4 million, and included a $14.7 million net issuance of additional debt used to fund operations. Net cash used for financing activities in 2000 was $41.4 million. The primary use of cash for financing activities in 2000 was $39.4 million used to reduce debt.       At June 30, 2002, $5.6 million of promissory notes were due to us from an unaffiliated third party, which are included in notes receivable. The promissory notes earn $1.4 million of annual cash interest and are being accreted to a face value of $12.8 million through May 2006. The promissory notes are secured by $12.8 million face value of our outstanding 10.75% senior subordinated debentures due 2009 acquired by the third party. The third party may sell these debentures for cash provided that it satisfies its obligation under its promissory notes.       Our principal cash requirements include debt service, capital expenditures, and the payment of other liabilities including postretirement benefits, environmental investigation and remediation obligations, and litigation settlements and related costs. We expect that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, cash available from borrowings and additional financing, and proceeds received from dispositions of assets will be adequate to satisfy our cash requirements during the next twelve months.       We are required under the credit agreement with our senior lenders, to comply with certain financial and non-financial loan covenants, including maintaining certain interest and fixed charge coverage ratios and maintaining certain indebtedness to EBITDA ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter. One restrictive covenant is the interest coverage ratio, which represents the ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement. At June 30, 2002, the interest coverage ratio was 2.32, which exceeded the minimum requirement of 2.0. Our interest rates vary based upon the consolidated indebtedness to EBITDA covenant, which represents the ratio of total debt to EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement. On March 31, 2002 our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio exceeded 5.0, and resulted in a 1/4% increase in our interest rates under the credit agreement during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. On June 30, 2002 our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was 5.62, which was below the maximum permitted ratio of 5.7. Additionally, the credit agreement restricts annual capital expenditures to $40 million during the life of the facility. For the year ended June 30, 2002, capital expenditures were $11.9 million. Except for assets of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the credit agreement, substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral under the credit agreement. The credit agreement restricts the payment of dividends to our shareholders to an aggregate of the lesser of $0.01 per share or $0.4 million over the life of the agreement. Noncompliance with any of the financial covenants without cure or waiver would constitute an event of default under the credit agreement. An event of default resulting from a breach of a financial covenant may result, at the option of lenders holding a majority of the loans, in an acceleration of the principal and interest outstanding, and a termination of the revolving credit line. At June 30, 2002, we were in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement.       At June 30, 2002, we had contractual commitments to repay debt (including capital lease obligations), and to make payments under operating leases. Our long-term debt obligations are restricted by certain covenants that limit our ability to encumber our assets. Payments due under these long-term obligations are as follows:                                                                       2003       2004      2005       2006      2007     Thereafter    Total                                                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Long-term debt and capital lease obligations       34,905      3,130    71,544    134,255     1,354      227,634    472,822  Operating lease commitments                         9,383      7,801     6,424      4,420     2,764        2,727     33,519                                                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Total contractual cash obligations                 44,288     10,931    77,968    138,675     4,118      230,361    506,341                                                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------        We have entered into standby letter of credit arrangements with insurance companies and others, primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. At June 30, 2002, we had contingent liabilities of $18.0 million on commitments related to outstanding letters of credit.  Recent Developments       On July 16, 2002 we announced that we signed a definitive agreement to sell our aerospace fasteners business to Alcoa Inc., for approximately $657 million in cash. The actual cash to be received from Alcoa is dependent upon a post-closing adjustment based on the difference in net working capital between March 31, 2002 and the closing date. We may also receive additional cash proceeds up to $12.5 million per year, in an earnout formula based on the number of Boeing and Airbus commercial aircraft deliveries during each of the calendar years 2003-2006, inclusive. The sale, which is expected to close before November 30, 2002, is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approvals and the approval of our shareholders. We will use a portion of the proceeds from the sale to repay our bank debt and commence a tender offer at par to acquire all of our outstanding $225 million, 10.75% senior subordinated notes, due in April, 2009. This tender offer will close concurrently with the closing of the sale to Alcoa. The remaining proceeds from the sale will provide funds for new acquisitions.       RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS       In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations". This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and associated asset retirement costs. It applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development, and normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of leases. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002.       In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets," which supersedes SFAS No. 121. Though it retains the basic requirements of SFAS 121 regarding when and how to measure an impairment loss, SFAS 144 provides additional implementation guidance. SFAS 144 applies to long-lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of, including assets under capital leases of lessees; assets subject to operating leases of lessors; and prepaid assets. SFAS 144 also expands the scope of a discontinued operation to include a component of an entity, and eliminates the current exemption to consolidation when control over a subsidiary is likely to be temporary. This statement is effective for our fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2002. Accordingly, we will account for the sale of the fastener business as a discontinued operation in fiscal 2003.       In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities". This standard requires costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized when they are incurred and applies prospectively to such activities initiated after December 31, 2002.      ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK        In fiscal 1998, we entered into a ten-year interest rate swap agreement to reduce our cash flow exposure to increases in interest rates on variable rate debt. The ten-year interest rate swap agreement provides us with interest rate protection on $100 million of variable rate debt, with interest being calculated based on a fixed LIBOR rate of 6.24% to February 17, 2003. On February 17, 2003, the bank, with which we entered into the interest rate swap agreement, will have a one-time option to elect to cancel the agreement or to do nothing and proceed with the transaction, using a fixed LIBOR rate of 6.715% from February 17, 2003 to February 19, 2008.       We did not elect to pursue hedge accounting for the interest rate swap agreement, which was executed to provide an economic hedge against cash flow variability on the floating rate note. When evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 133 on this hedge relationship, we assessed the key characteristics of the interest rate swap agreement and the note. Based on this assessment, we determined that the hedging relationship would not be highly effective. The ineffectiveness is caused by the existence of the embedded written call option in the interest rate swap agreement, and the absence of a mirror option in the hedged item. As such, pursuant to SFAS No. 133, we designated the interest rate swap agreement in the no hedging designation category. Accordingly, we have recognized a non-cash decrease in fair market value of interest rate derivatives of $4.6 million and $5.6 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, as a result of the fair market value adjustment for our interest rate swap agreement.       The fair market value adjustment of these agreements will generally fluctuate based on the implied forward interest rate curve for 3-month LIBOR. If the implied forward interest rate curve decreases, the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will increase and we will record an additional charge. If the implied forward interest rate curve increases, the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will decrease, and we will record income.       In March 2000, the Company issued a floating rate note with a principal amount of $30,750,000. Embedded within the promissory note agreement is an interest rate cap. The embedded interest rate cap limits to 8.125%, the 1-month LIBOR interest rate that we must pay on the note. At execution of the promissory note, the strike rate of the embedded interest rate cap of 8.125% was above the 1-month LIBOR rate of 6.61%. Under SFAS 133, the embedded interest rate cap is considered to be clearly and closely related to the debt of the host contract and is not required to be separated and accounted for separately from the host contract. In fiscal 2001, we accounted for the hybrid contract, comprised of the variable rate note and the embedded interest rate cap, as a single debt instrument.       The table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, which include interest rate swaps. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date.
