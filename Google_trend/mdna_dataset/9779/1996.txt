ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND  - ------------------------------------------------------------------------          FINANCIAL CONDITION          -------------------       The Fairchild Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated in October, 1969, under the laws of the State of Delaware.  On November, 15, 1990, the Company changed its name from Banner Industries, Inc. to The Fairchild Corporation.  RHI Holdings, Inc. ("RHI") is a direct subsidiary of the Company.  RHI is the 100% owner of Fairchild Holding Corporation ("FHC") and the majority owner of Banner Aerospace, Inc. ("Banner").  The Company's principal operations are conducted through RHI and FHC.  The Company also holds significant equity interests in Shared Technologies Fairchild, Inc. ("STFI") and Nacanco Paketleme ("Nacanco").  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS       The Company, RHI and Fairchild Industries, Inc. ("FII," the company's former subsidiary), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of November 9, 1995 (as amended, the "Merger Agreement") with Shared Technologies Inc. ("STI").  On March 13, 1996, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, STI succeeded to the telecommunications systems and services business operated by the Company's Fairchild Communications Services Company ("FCSC").       The transaction was effected by a Merger of FII with and into  STI (the "Merger") with the surviving company renamed STFI.  Prior to the Merger, FII transferred all of its assets to, and all of its liabilities were assumed by FHC, except for the assets and liabilities of FCSC, and $223.5 million of the FII's existing debt and preferred stock consisting of (i) the $40.0 million liquidation value of the outstanding Series A and Series C Preferred Stock of FII, (ii) the $125.0 million principal amount outstanding of FII 12 1/4% Senior Notes due 1999 (the "Senior Notes"), and (iii) an amount of bank and other indebtedness of approximately $58.5 million (the "Assumed Indebtedness").  The stock of FHC was then distributed to RHI.  No taxabale gain or loss was recognized, in the Company's view, on the transfer of the FII assets and liabilities to FHC, and the distribution of FHC stock to RHI.  As part of the Merger Agreement, FII made a cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding Senior Notes and obtained such holders consent to amend the indenture under which the Senior Notes were issued to remove all covenants which could be amended or deleted by majority vote (the "Tender Offer").  Pursuant to the Merger, an amount sufficient to redeem the Series A and Series C Preferred Stock at their liquidation value ($45.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends) was placed with Chemical Mellon Shareholder Services as Escrow Agent.  Also as part of the Merger, STFI (i) purchased the $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer and (ii) repaid in full the Assumed Indebtedness.       As a result of the Merger, the Company received (i) 6,000,000  shares of Common Stock of STFI (representing approximately 41% of the outstanding shares after giving effect to such issuance), (ii) shares of 6% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock of STFI having an aggregate liquidation preference of $25.0 million (subject to upward adjustment) and which are convertible into Common Stock of STFI at a conversion price of $6.375 per share (which, if converted, would represent, together with the other Common Stock issued to the Company, approximately 42% of the Common Stock of STFI on a fully diluted basis), and (iii) shares of a Special Preferred Stock having an initial liquidation preference of $20.0 million (which could accrue up to a maximum of $30.0 million over a ten-year period, if not redeemed earlier).  In connection with its stock ownership, the Company has the right to elect four of the eleven members of the Board of Directors of STFI and have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to sell any of STFI's shares for a two- year period.       The Merger was structured as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  In Fiscal 1996, the Company recorded a $163.1 million non-recurring gain from this transaction.       On February 22, 1996, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated January 26, 1996 (the "closing date"), the Company, through its subsidiaries, completed the sale of certain assets,  liabilities and the business of the  D-M-E Company ("DME") to Cincinnati Milacron Inc. ("CMI") for a sales price of approximately $244.3 million, as adjusted.  The sales price consists of $74.0 million in cash, and two 8% promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $170.3 million (together, the "8% CMI Notes").  The promissory notes were due to mature one year following the closing date; provided that the Company had the right to require prepayment of, and CMI had the right to prepay the 8% CMI Notes after the six-month anniversary of the closing date.  On July 29, 1996, CMI paid in full the 8% CMI Notes.       As a result of the sale of DME, the Company recorded an after-tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations of approximately $54.0 million in Fiscal 1996.       On January 27, 1996, FII completed the sale of Fairchild Data Corporation ("Data") to SSE Telecom, Inc. ("SSE") for book value of approximately $4.4 million and 100,000 shares of SSE's common stock valued at $9.0625 per share, or $.9 million, at January 26, 1996, and warrants to purchase an additional 50,000 shares of SSE's common stock at $11.09 per share.  In addition, the Company has an opportunity to earn an additional 100,000 shares based on the future performance of SSE during the twelve months following the date of sale.  There was no material gain or loss from this transaction.       DME and Data have been accounted for as discontinued operations and the prior periods financial statements have been restated to reflect the discontinuance of these companies.  The  combined net sales of DME and Data totaled $108.1 million (through January 26, 1996), $180.8 million and $166.5 million for Fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  Net earnings from discontinued operations was $9.2 million (through January 26, 1996), $14.0 million and $4.9 million for Fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.       Effective February 25, 1996, the Company completed a transfer of Harco to Banner in exchange for 5,386,477 shares of Banner common stock.  The exchange has increased the Company's ownership of Banner common stock from approximately 47.2% to 59.3%, resulting in the Company becoming the majority shareholder of Banner.  Accordingly, the Company consolidated Banner on February 25, 1996.  Banner is a leading international supplier to the aerospace industry as a distributor, providing a wide range of aircraft parts and related support services.  Harco is a distributor of precision fasteners to the aerospace industry.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       During Fiscal 1996, the Company operated in four principal business segments:  Aerospace Fasteners, Aerospace Distribution, Industrial Products and Communications Services.  The following table illustrates the historical sales and operating income of the Company's continuing operations for the past three years.

(c)  The Company became the majority shareholder of Banner Aerospace, Inc. on February 25, 1996 and, accordingly, began consolidating their results as of then.  FISCAL 1996 VERSUS FISCAL 1995  General - -------       Overall sales increased by 37.0% in Fiscal 1996, compared to sales in Fiscal 1995, which reflected strong sales performances from the Aerospace Fasteners, Aerospace Distribution and Industrial Products business segments.      Operating income increased $18.9 million in Fiscal 1996, compared to operating losses in Fiscal 1995.  During Fiscal 1996, operating losses decreased significantly in the Aerospace Fasteners segment, primarily due to the cost of management changes, consolidation of plants, eliminating unprofitable product lines, pricing adjustments, substantial work force downsizing and new productivity programs, quality and marketing programs put in place.  Operating income in the current year was up in the Industrial Products segment.  The Communications Services segment contributed operating income of $14.6 million through March 13, 1996 when it was deconsolidated and merged with STFI.  (See discussion below).  Aerospace Fasteners - -------------------       Sales in the Aerospace Fasteners segment increased 1.3% in Fiscal 1996, compared to the Fiscal 1995 period, reflecting moderate growth in this industry.  New orders have been strong in recent months.  The Harco division was transferred to the Aerospace Distribution segment on February 25, 1996.  Excluding Harco's sales in both periods, sales increased 3.6% in Fiscal 1996.       Operating income was positive in the Aerospace Fasteners segment, which was a $11.6 million improvement in the Fiscal 1996 period over the corresponding Fiscal 1995 period.  Management will continue to implement productivity improvements and reduce costs.  A restructuring charge of $2.3 million was recorded in Fiscal 1996, primarily for severance pay to employees terminated as a result of further downsizing.  Aerospace Distribution - ----------------------       As a result of the transfer of Harco to Banner effective February 25, 1996, the Company recorded four months of sales and operating income of Banner, including Harco, for four months, as part of the Aerospace Distribution segment.  This segment reported $130.0 million in sales and $5.6 million in operating income for this four month period ended June 30, 1996.  The first eight months of Harco's sales and operating income are included in the Aerospace Fasteners Segment.   Industrial Products - -------------------       Sales in the Industrial Products segment, which included two start up operations in Fiscal 1995, increased 62.3% in Fiscal 1996, compared to the Fiscal 1995 period.  $24.3 million of the sales increase is attributable to the performance of Fairchild Technologies which includes Fairchild Convac, a semiconductor equipment manufacturer which had a strong Fiscal 1996 performance resulting from the shipment of orders included in the prior year end backlog.  This was compared to a very slow Fiscal 1995, which was the first period following the acquisition of Fairchild Convac.  Also included in this segment is the Gas Spring division, which reported sales of $4.8 million in Fiscal 1996, and the Fairchild Scandinavian Bellyloading Company "SBC" which reported sales of $2.2 million.       Operating income in the Industrial Products segment became positive in Fiscal 1996 and increased $5.9 million in Fiscal 1996, compared to Fiscal 1995.  $3.8 million of this net increase was contributed by Fairchild Technologies, primarily the result of its increase in sales and $2.5 million by the Gas Spring start-up which decreased its losses to breakeven.  Communications Services - -----------------------       Sales of $91.3 million were reported for the Communications Services segment in Fiscal 1996 for 8 1/2 months compared to a full 12 months of operating results in Fiscal 1995 as a result of the March 13, 1996 merger of the Communications Services segment with STI.  Operating income of $14.6 million was reported for the Communications Services segment in Fiscal 1996 for 8 1/2 months prior to the Merger.  Other Expenses/Income - ---------------------       Corporate Administrative Expense -  During Fiscal 1996, corporate administrative expense increased 10.1%.  This increase resulted from additional corporate expenses required to complete the Merger and sale of discontinued operations.  The Fiscal 1995 expense was lower partially due to the reversal of several accruals not required.       Other corporate expense decreased $1.0 million in Fiscal 1996, compared to Fiscal 1995, primarily due to a favorable settlement of a bankruptcy case.       Net interest expense decreased 12.8% in Fiscal 1996, compared to the prior year period, due primarily to lower borrowings as a result of the sale of DME and the Merger, and higher interest income earned on the 8% CMI Notes.       Investment income, net, decreased by 19.9%, primarily as a result of losses realized on the write-off of two foreign investments.       Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $3.3 million in Fiscal 1996, compared to Fiscal 1995.  Earnings from Nacanco, in which the Company holds a 31.9% interest, increased $2.6 million for the year, primarily due to a 25.2% increase in net sales in the current year.       Minority interest expense includes dividend expense on FII's Series C Preferred Stock until it was redeemed on March 13, 1996, and approximately 40.7% of Banner's earnings since the consolidation of Banner on February 25, 1996.       Non-Recurring income includes a $163.1 million nontaxable gain resulting from the Merger.  Expenses related to other transactions are netted against the above gain.       Income Taxes - For Fiscal 1996, the tax benefit from the continuing operations loss, excluding the nontaxable non-recurring gain, was $22.1 million.       Earnings from discontinued operations, net, include the earnings, net of tax from DME and Data for all periods presented.       Gain (loss) on disposal of discontinued operations resulted primarily from the sale of DME to CMI.       Extraordinary items, net, resulted from premiums paid, redemption costs and consent fees associated with the retirement of the Senior Notes and the write off of deferred loan fees, primarily related to Senior Notes and bank debt extinguished early.  This totaled $10.4 million, net of a tax benefit, in Fiscal 1996.       The net earnings increased $223.5 million in Fiscal 1996, compared to Fiscal 1995, primarily due to:  (i) the $18.9 million increase in operating income, (ii) the $163.1 million non-recurring pre-tax gain recorded from the Merger, and (iii) the $53.6 million gain, net of tax, from the disposal of discontinued operations.  Partially offsetting these increases was a $10.4 million extraordinary loss from the early extinguishment of debt.  FISCAL 1995 VERSUS FISCAL 1994  General - -------       Overall sales increased by 31.7% in Fiscal 1995, compared to sales in Fiscal 1994, which reflected stronger sales performances from all three business segments.      Operating income increased $16.9 million in Fiscal 1995, compared to operating losses in Fiscal 1994.  During Fiscal 1995, operating losses decreased significantly in the Aerospace Fasteners segment, primarily due to the Fiscal 1994 period having included a restructuring charge of $18.9 million and a $4.0 million charge for earthquake damage and related business interruption.  Operating income in Fiscal 1995 was up 12.2% in the Communications Services segment.  (See discussion below).  Aerospace Fasteners - -------------------       Sales in the Aerospace Fasteners segment increased 5.9% in Fiscal 1995, compared to the Fiscal 1994 period, primarily resulting from aggressive management efforts during Fiscal 1995 to reduce backlog caused by quality problems and earthquake disruption, which have diminished.       Operating losses in the Aerospace Fasteners segment decreased $20.7 million for the Fiscal 1995 period, over the corresponding Fiscal 1994 period; however, this segment continued to be affected by soft demand and severe price erosion and higher quality control costs resulting from customers' requirements.  The Fiscal 1995 loss resulted primarily from excess costs incurred to reduce the past due sales backlog, which included many orders of small quantities at low profit margins.  Certain products have yielded negative margins due to labor inefficiencies and low prices.  Management has taken steps to cancel any such orders remaining in the backlog unless improved pricing can be negotiated.  Significant provisions for excess and slow moving inventories were also recorded in Fiscal 1995, contributing to the operating loss.  Management will continue to reduce the capacity of the Aerospace Fasteners segment as necessary to bring the breakeven point in line with demand.  These actions may result in further restructuring charges in the future.  A restructuring charge of $18.9 million was recorded in the prior year for nonrecurring costs related to exiting certain aircraft engine bolt lines, and an unusual loss of $4.0 million was recorded in the prior year for earthquake damage (see below).       In January of 1994, the Company's Chatsworth, California Aerospace Fasteners manufacturing facility suffered extensive damage from the Southern California Earthquake. This disruption caused increased costs and reduced revenues in Fiscal 1994 and has negatively affected Fiscal 1995 as well.  In June of 1995, the Company reached final settlement of its insurance claim and recovered a total of $17.0 million for property damages and business interruption.  Industrial Products - -------------------       Included in the Industrial Products segment were sales from Fairchild Technologies (which evolved from Convac GmbH, a semiconductor equipment manufacturing company acquired at the end of Fiscal 1994), FSB, another small acquisition, made early in Fiscal 1995 and the Gas Spring Division, a Fiscal 1995 start-up company.  The combined sales of these companies was $41.5 million in the Fiscal 1995 period.        Operating losses were incurred from operations which incurred significant organization and start-up costs.  Communications Services - -----------------------       Sales in the Communications Services segment increased 46.5% in Fiscal 1995, compared to Fiscal 1994, primarily due to the inclusion of sales from the acquisition of specified assets of JWP Telecom, Inc., ("JWP") made during the Fiscal 1995 second quarter, as well as sales to new customers, the addition of telecommunications franchises in new office buildings, and growth at existing sites.       Operating income in the Communications Services segment increased 12.2% in Fiscal 1995, compared to Fiscal 1994, primarily due to increased sales resulting from the reasons given above and related economies of scale.  Operating income as a percent of sales was 17.0% in Fiscal 1995.  This lower return was anticipated as a result of the JWP acquisition, which has lower gross margins due to the nature of the business.  Other Expenses/Income - ---------------------       Corporate Administrative Expense -  During Fiscal 1995, corporate administrative expense decreased 21.9%.  This decline resulted primarily from cost controls, including a reduction in work force and wage and salary caps that were in effect for most corporate employees, and sale of the Company airplane during Fiscal 1994.       Other Corporate Income - Other corporate income decreased $4.4 million in Fiscal 1995, compared to Fiscal 1994, primarily due to increased carrying costs and losses reported on net assets held for sale.  In addition, start up costs related to a corporate sponsored joint venture are included in this category.  Gain on sale of a trademark was recognized in the prior year period.       Net Interest Expense - Net interest expense decreased 2.8% in Fiscal 1995, compared to the prior year period, due primarily to lower borrowings and increased interest income earned on higher balances of cash and cash equivalents during the Fiscal 1995 period.       Investment income, net - Investment Income decreased by 7.5%, primarily as a result of higher dividends realized on participating annuity contracts in the prior year period.       Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $3.0 million in Fiscal 1995, compared to Fiscal 1994.  Earnings from Nacanco, in which the Company holds a 31.9% interest, were down $2.6 million for the year, primarily due to a large tax adjustment taken during the current year.  The Fiscal 1994 period included a $5.7 million loss from Banner Aerospace which included losses on discontinued operations and restructuring charges.       Minority interest expense includes dividend expense on FII's Series C Preferred Stock.       Non-Recurring Income - Non-recurring income in the Fiscal 1994 period includes the net pre-tax gain of $129.1 million on the Company's 43.9% stock interest in Rexnord Corporation, which was sold to BTR Dunlop Holdings, Inc. on December 23, 1993.       Income Taxes - For Fiscal 1995, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $28.2 million at a 37.1% effective tax rate.       Earnings from discontinued operations, net, include the earnings from DME and Data, net of tax  for all periods presented.  Accounting Changes: - -------------------       1) Postretirement Benefits - Using the immediate recognition method, the Fiscal 1994 after-tax benefit to earnings for the cumulative effect of this accounting change was $4.3 million, which represented the unamortized portion of an overstated liability for discontinued operations, partially offset by the transition obligation for active employees and retirees of continuing operations. Included in Fiscal 1994 earnings from discontinued operations is a net charge of $4.8 million, which represents the portion allocated to DME and Data for the implementation of SFAS 106.  In addition, in Fiscal 1994, a $7.5 million charge, net of the Company's related tax benefit, was recorded for the Company's share of Rexnord Corporation's cumulative charge resulting from this change in accounting.       2) Accounting for Income Taxes - The Company elected the immediate recognition method and recorded, in Fiscal 1994, a $2.0 million benefit, representing the cumulative effect on prior years.  Included in Fiscal 1994 earnings from discontinued operations, is a net charge of $4.4 million representing DME's share of the SFAS 109 implementation, resulting from deferred taxes related primarily to fixed assets, prepaid pension expenses, and inventory differences.  In addition, a $.5 million charge was recorded for the Company's share of Rexnord Corporation's ("Rexnord") cumulative charge resulting from this change in accounting.         Net Earnings (Loss) - The net earnings (loss) decreased $49.6 million in Fiscal 1995, compared to the Fiscal 1994 period, primarily due to the $129.1 million net pre-tax gain on the sale of the Company's interest in Rexnord recognized in the Fiscal 1994 period.  Offsetting the decrease were:  (1) the $16.9 million increase in operating income and the $3.0 million increase in equity earnings in Fiscal 1995, (2) the $2.0 million decrease in net interest expense, (3) the $1.7 million charge, net of tax, for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, which was recorded in Fiscal 1994, and (4) a decrease in taxes of $45.9 million.  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Working capital at June 30, 1996, was $352.9 million, which was $240.3 million higher than at June 30, 1995.  The principal reasons for this increase included a $170.4 million receivable reflecting the 8% CMI Notes. In addition, due primarily to the consolidation of Banner and the deconsolidation of FCSC, there was a net increase in accounts receivable of $33.2 million, and increase in inventory of $192.9 million (the FCSC business, a telecommunication services business had virtually no inventory).  Offsetting this increase in working capital were net increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $30.4 million reflecting the reconsolidation of Banner and the deconsolidation of FCSC.  The Company's current bank debt borrowings increased $43.9 million reflecting the current debt on the new interim credit agreement at FHC discussed below.  Net current assets of discontinued operations decreased $34.6 million reflecting the sale of DME and Data.       The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and borrowings under its credit agreement.  The Company also expects to generate cash from the sale of certain assets and liquidation of investments.  Net assets held for sale at June 30, 1996, had a book value of $45.4 million and included two parcels of real estate in California, a 68 acre parcel of real estate located in Farmingdale, New York, two landfills in Pennsylvania, a real estate joint venture in California, and several other parcels elsewhere, which the Company plans to sell, lease or develop, subject to market conditions or, with respect to certain of the parcels, the resolution of environmental matters.  Net assets held for sale decreased $6.2 million primarily resulting from the sale of 20 acres of a larger parcel of real estate, owned by the Company, in Farmingdale, New York.  The proceeds were applied against the carrying value of this property.       The Company's principal cash requirements include debt service, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and payment of other liabilities.       Property, plant and equipment ("PP&E") decreased $45.0 million from June 30, 1995, as a result of deconsolidating FCSC and consolidating Banner.  At March 13, 1996 FCSC had PP&E of $51.1 million which was deconsolidated, and Banner had $12.9 million which was consolidated.       Investments and advances in affiliated companies decreased $15.9 million.  Changes in investments and advances in affiliates included a $54.0 million decrease resulting from the consolidation of Banner, offset partially by recording a $29.0 million investment from the Merger, in which the Company retained a 41% interest in STFI, and recording equity earnings of $4.9 million (primarily Nacanco) during the year.       Other liabilities that require the use of cash include post-employment benefits for retirees, environmental investigation and remediation obligations, litigation settlements and related costs.       The Company maintains credit agreements (the "Credit Agreements") with a consortium of banks, which provides revolving credit facilities to RHI, FHC and Banner and term loans to FHC and Banner (collectively the "Credit Facilities").       On March 13, 1996, in connection with the Merger, the Company replaced the credit agreement of its former subsidiary, VSI Corporation, (the "Prior Credit Agreement") with an interim credit agreement (the "Interim Credit Agreement") at FHC.  The Interim Credit Agreement provided FHC with a $50.0 million revolving credit facility and a $30.0 million term loan, both of which generally had an interest rate of 1/2% over the prime rate, or 1 1/2% over the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR")and required a commitment fee of 1/2% on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The Prior Credit Agreement generally bore interest at 2 3/4% to 3 3/4% over LIBOR and required a commitment fee of 1%.       The Interim Credit Agreement required compliance with certain financial loan covenants, including achieving a minimum of cumulative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization  ("EBITDA Covenant") at March 31, 1996, and maintaining a certain interest ratio coverage at specified periods.  Additionally, the Interim Credit Agreement restricted FHC's capital expenditures during the term of the Interim Credit Agreement to $6.0 million, in the aggregate.  The Company was in compliance with these covenants throughout the life of the Interim Credit Agreement.       The Interim Credit Agreement matured on July 29, 1996, at which time the Company repaid in full the loans made under the Interim Credit Agreement.  On July 26, 1996, the Company amended and restated the terms and provisions of the Interim Credit Agreement in their entirety (the "Restated Credit Agreement").  The Restated Credit Agreement extends to July 28, 2000, the maturity of FHC's revolving credit termination date, and provides FHC with a revolving credit facility (the "FHC Revolver") that has a borrowing base of up to $52.0 million. The borrowing base is determined monthly based upon specified percentages of FHC's accounts receivable, inventories and the appraised value of equipment and real property.   The FHC Revolver consists of up to $40.0 million available for domestic operations and $12.0 million available for  European operations.   The FHC Revolver generally bears interest at a base rate of 1 1/2% over the greater of (i) Citibank New York's base rate, or (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2% for domestic borrowings and at 2 1/2% over Citibank London's base rate for foreign borrowings.  FHC's Revolver is subject to a non-use commitment fee of 1/2% on the average unused availability; and outstanding letters of credit are subject to fees of 2 3/4% per annum.       The Restated Credit Agreement requires FHC to comply with certain financial loan covenants, including maintaining a minimum net worth of $150.0 million and maintaining certain interest and fixed charge coverage ratios at the end of each Fiscal Quarter.  Additionally, the Restated Credit Agreement restricts the FHC's annual capital expenditures to $12.0 million.  Substantially all of FHC's assets are pledged as collateral under the Restated Credit Agreement.       FHC may transfer available cash as dividends to the Company.       The Credit Agreements provide RHI with a $4.3 million revolving credit facility (the "RHI Credit Agreement") which generally bears a base interest of 1/2% over the prime rate, requires  a commitment fee of 1/2%, and matures on May 26, 1998.  RHI's Credit Agreement requires RHI to comply with specified covenants and maintain a consolidated net worth of $175.0 million.  Additionally, RHI's capital expenditures are restricted, except for certain leasehold improvements, to $2.0 million per annum  plus the selling price of fixed assets for such Fiscal Year.  At June 30, 1996, the Company was in compliance with all the covenants under RHI's Credit Agreement.       Banner has a credit agreement (the "Banner Credit Agreement") which provides Banner and its subsidiaries with funds for working capital and potential acquisitions. On June 30, 1996, The Banner Credit Agreement consisted of a $55.0 million term loan and a $71.5 million revolving credit facility, both of which initially bear interest at prime plus 1 1/4% or LIBOR plus 2 1/2%.  Interest rates on Banner's borrowings whether computed at the prime rate or LIBOR may increase by 1/4% or decrease by up to 1% based upon certain performance criteria.  On June 30, 1995, Banner's performance level resulted in borrowings  under the Banner Credit Agreement being at the initial interest rates for the quarter ending September 30, 1996.  The Banner Credit Agreement was amended on July 1, 1996, to provide additional financing with a $30.0 million seven-year term loan ("Tranche B Loan") and requires that loans made to Banner do not exceed a defined borrowing base, which is based upon a percentage of inventories and accounts receivable.  The Tranche B Loan bears interest at Prime plus 1 3/4% or LIBOR plus 3%. Banner's term loans require certain semiannual loan payments. Banner's revolving credit facility is subject to a non-use fee of 1/2% of the unused availability. Substantially all of Banner's assets are pledged as collateral under the Banner Credit Agreement.  The Banner Credit Agreement matures August 2001.       The Banner Credit Agreement requires quarterly compliance with  various financial and non-financial loan covenants, including maintaining a minimum net worth, and minimum ratios of interest coverage, fixed charge coverage, and debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Banner also has certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt.  As of  June 30, 1996, Banner was in compliance with all covenants under the Banner Credit Agreement.       Banner has several interest rate hedge agreements ("Hedge Agreements") to manage its exposure to increases in interest rates on its variable rate debt.  The Hedge Agreements provide interest rate protection on $60.0 million of debt through September 2000, by providing a cap of 7% if the 90-day LIBOR rate exceeds 7%.  If the 90-day LIBOR rate drops below 5%, Banner will be required to pay a floor rate of approximately 6%.   IMPACT OF FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES  Accounting For The Impairment Of Long-Lived Assets - -------------------------------------------------- And For Long-Lived Assets To Be Disposed Of - -------------------------------------------       In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 ("SFAS 121") "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of".  SFAS 121 establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long-lived assets, certain identifiable intangibles, and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used, and for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of.  SFAS 121 is required to be implemented by the Company on, or before, July 1, 1996.  The Company's present policy is identical to the policy prescribed by SFAS 121; therefore there will be no effect from implementation.       In October 1995, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 ("SFAS 123"), Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.  SFAS 123 establishes financial accounting standards for stock-based employee compensation plans and to transactions in which an entity issues equity instruments to acquire goods or services from non-employees.  As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company plans to continue to use the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25 for its stock-based employee compensation plans.  The Company is required to adopt SFAS 123 and will make all the necessary fair market disclosures for Fiscal 1997.   ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
