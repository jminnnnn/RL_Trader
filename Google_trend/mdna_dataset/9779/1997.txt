Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition".  (b)  Financial Information about Business Segments       The Company's business segment information is incorporated herein by reference from Note 21 of the Company's consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data".  (c)  Narrative Description of Business Segments  Aerospace Fasteners - -------------------       The Company, through its Aerospace Fasteners segment, is a leading worldwide manufacturer and supplier of fastening systems used in the construction and maintenance of commercial and military aircraft.  The Aerospace Fasteners segment accounted for 36.4% of total Company sales for the year ended June 30, 1997.       Products      --------       In general, aerospace fasteners produced by the Company are used to join materials in applications that are not of themselves critical to flight. Products range from standard aerospace screws, to more complex systems that fasten airframe structures, and sophisticated latching or quick disconnect mechanisms that allow efficient access to internal parts which require regular servicing or monitoring.  The Aerospace Fasteners segment also manufactures and supplies fastening systems used in non-aerospace industrial and electronic niche applications.  The Aerospace Fasteners segment produces and sells products under various trade names and trademarks including Voi- Shan7 (fasteners for aerospace structures), Screwcorp7 (standard externally threaded products for aerospace applications), RAM7 (custom designed mechanisms for aerospace applications), Camloc7 (components for the industrial, electronic, automotive and aerospace markets), and Tridair7 and Rosan7 (fastening systems for highly-engineered aerospace, military and industrial applications).       Principal product lines of the Aerospace Fasteners segment include:       Standard Aerospace Airframe Fasteners - These fasteners consist of standard externally threaded fasteners used in non-critical airframe applications on a wide variety of aircraft.  These fasteners include Hi- Torque Speed Drive7, Tri-Wing7, Torq-Set7, Phillips7 and Hex Heads7.       Commercial Aerospace Structural and Engine Fasteners - These fasteners consist of more highly engineered, permanent or semi-permanent fasteners used in non-critical but more sophisticated airframe and engine applications, which could involve joining more than two materials.  These fasteners are generally engineered to specific customer requirements or manufactured to specific customer specifications for special applications, often involving exacting standards.  These fasteners include Hi-Lok7, Veri-Lite7, Eddie- Bolt72 and customer proprietary engine nuts.       Proprietary Products and Fastening Systems - These very highly engineered, proprietary fasteners are designed by the Company for specific customer applications and include high performance structural latches and hold down mechanisms.  These fasteners are usually proprietary in nature and are used primarily in either commercial aerospace or military applications. These fasteners include Visu-Lok7, Composi-Lok7, Keen-serts7, Mark IVJ, FlatbeamJ and RinglockJ.       Highly Engineered Fastening Systems for Industrial Applications - These highly engineered fasteners are designed by the Company for specific niche applications in the electronic, automotive and durable goods markets and are sold under the Camloc7 trade name.       Sales and Markets      -----------------       The products of the Aerospace Fasteners segment are sold primarily to domestic and foreign original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), and to the maintenance and repair market through distributors.  Sixty-six percent of its sales are domestic.  Major customers include original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") such as Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus, and their subcontractors, as well as major distributors such as Burbank Aircraft Supply, Special-T and Wesco.  Recently, OEMs have significantly increased their production levels.  In addition, OEMs have implemented programs to reduce inventories and pursue just-in-time relationships.  This has allowed parts distributors to significantly expand their business due to their ability to better meet OEM objectives.  In response, the Company, which formerly supplied the OEMs directly, is expanding efforts to provide parts through distributors, by establishing master distributorship agreements, with Special-T, Wesco and others.  No single customer accounts for more than 10% of the Company's consolidated sales.       Products are marketed by a direct sales force team, which coordinates efforts with an internal technical sales force team.  The direct sales force team is organized by customer and region. The internal sales force is organized by facility and product range and is focused on servicing customers needs, identifying new product applications, and obtaining the approval of new products.  All the Company's products are marketed through centralized advertising and promotional activities.       Revenues in the Aerospace Fasteners segment bear a strong relationship to aircraft production.  As OEMs searched for cost cutting opportunities during the aerospace industry recession, parts manufacturers, including the Company, accepted lower-priced and/or smaller orders to maintain market share, at lower profit margins.  However, during the last two years, this situation has improved as build rates in the aerospace industry have increased and resulted in capacity constraints.  As lead times have increased, the Company has been able to negotiate contracts with its major customers at more favorable pricing as well as larger minimum lot sizes that are more economic to manufacture. In addition, the Company has eliminated "make and hold" contracts under which large volume buyers would require current production of parts for long-term unspecified dates of delivery. Overall, existing backlog is anticipated to result in higher margins due to larger and more efficient lot sizes.       Fasteners also have applications in the automotive/industrial markets, where numerous special fasteners are required (such as engine bolts, wheel bolts and turbo charger tension bolts).  The Company is actively targeting the automotive market as a hedge against any potential downturn in the aerospace industry.       Manufacturing and Production      ----------------------------      The Aerospace Fasteners segment has seven primary manufacturing facilities, of which three are located in the United States and four are located in Europe.  Each facility has virtually complete production capability, and subcontracts only those orders which exceed capacity.  Each plant is designed to produce a specified product or group of products, determined by production process involved and certification requirements. The Company's largest customers have recognized its quality and operational controls by conferring D1-9000A status at all of its U.S. facilities, and D1- 9000 status at all of its European facilities. All of its facilities are "preferred suppliers" and have received all SPC and NADCAP approvals from OEMs.  The Company is the first and only aerospace fastener manufacturing company with all facilities holding ISO-9000 approval.       The Company has a fully operational modern information system at all of its U.S. facilities and will expand this information system to all its European operations in Fiscal 1998.  The new system performs detailed and timely cost analysis of production by product and facility. Updated MIS systems also help the Company to better service its customers. OEMs require each product to be produced in a OEM-qualified/OEM-approved facility.       Competition      -----------       Despite intense competition in the industry, the Company remains the dominant manufacturer of aerospace fasteners.  The worldwide aerospace fastener market is estimated to be $1.3 billion (before distributor resales).  The Company holds approximately 20% of the market and competes with SPS Technologies, Hi-Shear, and Huck, which the company believes hold approximately 13%, 11% and 10% of the market, respectively.  In Europe, its largest competitors are Blanc Aero and Southco Fasteners.       The Company competes primarily in the highly-engineered "systems" segment where its broad product range allow it to more fully serve each OEM and distributor.  The Company's product array is diverse and offers customers a large selection to address various production needs. In addition, roughly 45% of the Company's output is unique or is in a market where the Company has a small number of competitors.  The Company seeks to maintain its technological edge and competitive advantage over its competitors, and has historically demonstrated its innovative production methods and new products to meet customer demands at fair price levels.  Aerospace Distribution - ----------------------       The Company increased its ownership of Banner to a majority interest level in February 1996.  The Company, through Banner (its Aerospace Distribution segment), distributes a wide variety of aircraft parts, which it carries in inventory.  In addition to selling products that it has purchased on the open market, Banner also acts as a non-exclusive, authorized distributor of many different aerospace related product lines. No single distributor arrangement is material to the Company's financial condition. Through Banner, the Aerospace Distribution segment accounted for 55.8% of total Company sales in Fiscal 1997.       Products      --------       Banner believes it is the world's largest independent stocking distributor of aircraft hardware, including bearings, nuts, bolts, screws, rivets and other types of fasteners that are used on aircraft. Banner purchases its inventory of hardware principally from manufacturers.  An extensive inventory of products and a quick response time are essential in providing service to its customers.  Another key factor in selling to its customers is Banner's ability to maintain a system that provides traceable parts back to the manufacturer.       Products of the Aerospace Distribution segment are divided into three groups: hardware, rotables and engines.  Hardware includes bearings, nuts, bolts, screws, rivets and other types of fasteners.  Rotables include flight data recorders, radar and navigation systems, instruments, landing gear and hydraulic and electrical components.  Engines include jet engines and engine parts for use on both narrow and wide body aircraft and smaller engines for corporate and commuter aircraft.  Banner provides a number of services such as immediate shipment of parts in aircraft-on-ground situations. The Aerospace Distribution segment also provides products to OEMs in the aerospace industry under just-in-time and inventory management programs.  Banner also buys and sells commercial aircraft from time to time.        Hardware is purchased new from manufacturers, but may also be purchased from other distributors.  Hardware is sold only in new condition.  Rotable parts are sometimes purchased as new parts, but are generally purchased as used parts which are then overhauled for the Company by outside contractors, including the original manufacturers and FAA-licensed facilities.  Rotables are sold in a variety of conditions such as new, overhauled, serviceable and "as is".  Rotables may also be exchanged instead of sold.  An exchange occurs when an overhauled aircraft part in inventory is exchanged for a used part from the customer and the customer is charged an exchange fee plus the actual cost to overhaul the part.  Engines and engine components are sold "as is", overhauled or disassembled for resale as parts.       Sales and Markets      -----------------       Subsidiaries of the Aerospace Distributions segment sell their products in the United States and abroad to most of the world's commercial airlines and to air cargo carriers, as well as many OEMs, other distributors, fixed- base operators, corporate aircraft operators and other aerospace and non- aerospace companies.  Approximately 70.7% of its sales are to domestic purchasers, some of whom may represent offshore users.       The Aerospace Distributions segment markets its products and services through direct sales forces, outside representatives and, for some product lines, overseas sales offices.  Sales in the aviation aftermarket depend on price, service, quality and reputation.  The Aerospace Distribution segment's business does not experience significant seasonal fluctuations nor depend on a single customer.  No single customer accounts for more than 10% of the Company's consolidated revenue.       Competition      -----------       The hardware product group competes with OEMs such as Boeing, which supports the fleet of Boeing-produced aircraft; fastener manufacturers, as well as independent distributors such as Wesco Aircraft Hardware Corp., M&M Aerospace Hardware, Tri-Star Aerospace, Inc. and many other large and small companies.  Banner believes it generally has a price advantage over manufacturers in the smaller quantities that it usually deals, and can generally provide more expeditious service.  In the rotable group, the major competitors are AAR Corp., Air Ground Equipment Services ("AGES"), Aviation Sales Company, The Memphis Group and other large and small companies in a very fragmented industry.  The major competitors for Banner's engine group are OEMs such as General Electric Company and Pratt and Whitney, as well as the engine parts division of AAR Corp., AGES, and many smaller companies.  Technology Products - -------------------       Acquired by the Company in June 1994, Fairchild Technologies ("FT") is a global organization that manufactures, markets and services capital equipment for recordable compact disc ("CD-R") and advanced semiconductor manufacturing. FT's products are used worldwide to produce CD-Rs, CDs and CD- ROMs, as well as integrated circuits for the data processing, communications, transportation, automotive and consumer electronic industries, as well as for the military.

Competition      -----------       The wafer product line compete with Tokyo Electron, Dai Nippon Screen and the Silicon Valley Group.  Competitors in the CD product line consist of Robi Systems, Leybold and Marubeni.  Competition in the photomask product line is provided by Mitsubishi Toyo, Tasmo and Solid State Equipment.  Communication Services - ----------------------       On March 13, 1996, the Company's Fairchild Communications Services Company ("FCSC") was merged with STI.  As a result of the Merger, the Company is accounting for its investment in STFI using the equity method.  Prior to March 13, 1996, the Company consolidated the results of FCSC.  Other Operations - ----------------       Other operations consists primarily of two distinct companies operating under the trade names Fairchild Gas Springs Division ("Gas Springs") and Fairchild Scandinavian Bellyloading Company ("SBC").       A Fiscal 1995 start-up operation, Gas Springs manufactures gas load springs and other devices used in raising, lowering or moving of heavy loads. Its products have numerous consumer and industrial applications, including in fitness equipment, sunbeds, furniture, automotive, and agricultural and construction equipment.       SBC produces a sliding carpet loading system for installation in the cargo area of commercial aircraft.  SBC was recently sold (see Note 2 in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data").  Foreign Operations - ------------------      The Company's operations are located primarily in the United States and Europe.  Inter-area sales are not significant to the total revenue of any geographic area.  Export sales are made by U.S. subsidiaries and divisions to customers in non-U.S. countries, whereas foreign sales are made by the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries.  For the Company's sales results by geographic area and export sales, see Note 22 of the Company's consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  Major Customers - ---------------       No single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in any of the Company's business segments for the year ended June 30, 1997.  Backlog of Orders - -----------------      Backlog is significant to all the Company's operations, due to long-term production requirements of its customers.  The Company's backlog of orders as of June 30, 1997 in the Aerospace Fasteners segment, Aerospace Distribution segment, and Fairchild Technologies amounted to $195.7 million, $90.9 million, and $63.1 million, respectively, with a "Book-to-Bill" ratio of 1.3, 1.1, and 1.8, respectively. The Company anticipates that approximately 94.8% of the aggregate backlog at June 30, 1997 will be delivered by June 30, 1998.
