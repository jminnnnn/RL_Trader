ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The  following  discussion  and  analysis should be read in conjunction with our Selected  Financial  Data section, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the information  described  in  the Business - Important Factors That May Affect Our Business,  Our  Operating Results and Our Stock Price section included elsewhere in  this  report.  DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY       We  provide enterprises with scalable data analysis solutions consisting of software  and  services  designed  to  facilitate  decision-making  by revealing patterns,  trends  and  relationships.  We  are a supplier of these software and services for the statistical analysis, data mining and knowledge access industry segments  enabling customers to gain intelligence from numerical data and text.       Our  products  include S-PLUS(R), StatServer(R), S-PLUS Analytic Server(R), Insightful  Miner,  and  InFact(R) . Our consulting services provide specialized expertise  and  proven  processes  for the design, development and deployment of analytical  solutions.       We  have  been delivering data analysis solutions for 17 years to companies in  financial  services,  pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, telecommunications and manufacturing  as  well  as  government  and  research  institutions.       Headquartered  in  Seattle, Washington, we also have North American offices in New York and North Carolina. Our international offices are located in France, Switzerland,  and  the  United  Kingdom,  with  distributors  around  the world.  BUSINESS OUTLOOK       We  provide  our customers with useful and innovative software and services to  derive  intelligence  from  the data they collect. Several converging trends point  to  a  significant  long-term  potential  for  the data analysis software market.  First,  organizations  currently collect far more data, in a variety of formats,  than  they  actually analyze. Second, increasing amounts of additional information  are  being  collected  by  organizations.  Third, organizations are seeking  to  apply  new  and  increasingly  complex analytic techniques to their ever-increasing  collection of data in order to gain significant improvements in the  quality  and  efficacy  of  products  built,  marketed,  and  sold  and  to improvements in the efficiency of business processes. Overall, the confluence of these  trends should result in significant long-term potential for data analysis software  companies  such  as  Insightful.       Our  product  direction  for  the  S-PLUS Product Family mirrors these data analysis industry trends.  Our focus has been, and will continue to be, to build on  S-PLUS'  position  as  a  leader  for statistical model prototyping and data visualization  used extensively by individual statisticians building statistical models.  Our  vision  is  to  continually  enhance  the S-PLUS product family to provide  a  seamless  environment  where sophisticated business analytics can be developed  on  the  desktop  and then deployed to production on servers handling many  gigabytes  of  data  and deployed to hundreds and even thousands of users, without  the  need for expensive re-implementation.  We will increasingly enable S-PLUS  programmers  and other IT professionals to use the S-PLUS product family to deploy analytic applications to mission critical production environments.       Our  direction  also  involves tailoring our solutions to meet the needs of certain  market  segments.  Throughout our history, we have, to varying degrees, tailored  our  data analysis solutions to the needs of the following industries: securities  and  banking,  life  sciences,  manufacturing,  telecommunications, environmental,  and  defense/intelligence.  Our  largest efforts have focused on life  sciences  and  financial  services.  We also serve the academic community, though  our  objective  there  is not to drive short-term increased revenues but rather  seed  for  future  commercial  sales.  Since  we  are seeing more of our customers  explore  and adopt open-source data analysis technologies, instead of purchasing  commercial  software  products, our direction involves extending our products to provide increasing value add in the form of scaling to large amounts of  data  as  well as tailored to specific vertical markets. We are focusing our resources  on  higher-value  initiatives  in the three industries that currently account  for the majority of our revenues: life sciences, securities and banking for  data  analysis,  and  defense/intelligence.       We  will  continue to invest in both our existing and new products, as well as  in  expanding our sales and marketing efforts. We anticipate that our growth will  primarily be driven by software license revenues and that our professional services  revenue  will  remain  flat  or  even decline somewhat. Growth for our software  license  and  maintenance  revenues  will  be  driven primarily by our high-end products, Insightful Miner, S-PLUS Server, and our vertical application modules such as S+Finmetrics and S+Array Analyzer.                                          15  REVIEW  OF  ACCOUNTING  PRACTICES       On, March 31, 2004, we filed a Form 12b-25 notification of late filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the filing of this annual report,  and  disclosed  that  during  the  audit  process,  management made our independent auditors aware of specific allegations made by a former employee who was  terminated  in  the  first  quarter  of  2002,  and who filed a lawsuit for wrongful  termination  against us in December 2002. In an April 2003 deposition, the  former  employee alleged, among other things, that we improperly recognized services revenues in 2001 and 2002. While we had performed an internal review of the  specific  allegations  made in the deposition in April and May of 2003, our independent  auditors  recommended  further review of the projects identified in the  deposition  and  recommended that management perform additional analysis to satisfy  itself  that the consolidated financial statements are fairly presented for  the  entire audit period. Accordingly, we delayed the filing of this annual report  in  order  to allow time to complete an independent investigation of the projects  identified  in the deposition. The investigation efforts were directed by  the  audit  committee  of our board, and carried out by our outside law firm with  our  full cooperation. Based on the investigation, our audit committee has determined, with the advice of management, that our financial statements for the 2001  and  2002 years, and for the quarters included therein, present fairly, in all  material  respects,  the  consolidated  financial  position,  results  of operations,  and  cash  flows  of  the  Company  in  conformity  with accounting principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  AND  ESTIMATES       We  have  based  our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results  of  operations  upon  our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues  and  expenses,  and  related  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and  estimates,  including  those  related  to  revenue  recognition, bad debts, intangible  assets,  restructuring,  asset  impairment,  and  contingencies  and litigation.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under the circumstances, the results  of  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of  assets  and  liabilities  that  are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual  results  may  differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  We  believe  the  following critical accounting policies affect the more  significant  judgments  and  estimates  used  in  the  preparation  of our consolidated financial statements.    Revenue Recognition       Our  revenue  recognition  policy is significant because our revenues are a key component of our results of operations. We follow very specific and detailed guidelines,  discussed  in  Note  2  of  the  financial statements, in measuring revenues.       We  derive  our  revenues  primarily  from three sources: license revenues, which consist of software license fees, maintenance revenues, consisting of fees for  maintenance  and  support,  and  professional  services revenues, which are comprised of fees for consulting and training. The revenue recognition rules for software  companies  are complex and require our management to exercise judgment and  make  a  number  of  estimates.  For example, many of our contracts contain multiple  element  arrangements,  which  require  us  to  make  assumptions  and judgments  in  order  to  allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver, to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each element, to determine if undelivered elements are deemed essential, and to  determine whether and when each element has been delivered. We also evaluate whether  there  is any material risk of customer non-payment or product returns. If  we  were  to  change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material  increase  or  decrease  in  the  amount of revenue that we report in a particular  period.  Revenue  that we cannot recognize in a particular period is reflected  on  our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized over time as the  applicable  revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. These estimates are made  based  upon  all  of the information available to us at the time. Material differences  may  result  in  the amount and timing of our revenue for any given period  if  different  judgments  are  made  or  different  estimates  are used.    Sales  Returns       We  provide an estimated reserve for return rights at the time of sale.  We offer  our customers a 30-day return policy on all of our products.  Refunds are provided  to  customers  upon  return  to  us  of  the complete product package, including  all  original  materials,  CD-ROM  or other media.  Our provision for sales  returns  is  estimated  based  on  historical  returns experience and our judgment  of  future  return  risk.    Bad  Debts                                          16       A  considerable  amount of judgment is required when we assess the ultimate realization  of  receivables.  It  is  a  significant  estimate and is regularly evaluated  taking  into  consideration  past  experience,  current  economic conditions,  aging  of  the  amounts,  and the current credit-worthiness of each customer.  Customer  credit  worthiness  is subject to many business and finance risks  facing  each  customer  and  is  subject  to  sudden  changes.    Impairment  of  Goodwill  and  Other  Long  Lived  Assets       At least annually we evaluate goodwill arising from acquired businesses for potential  impairment  indicators.  Our  judgments  regarding  the  existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions and expected future  operational  performance of our acquired businesses. In 2002 we recorded an  $800,000  impairment  of  goodwill  and  in  2003  we recorded an additional $462,000 impairment based upon our estimates of the discounted future cash flows of  our  acquired  businesses.  Future  events  could  cause us to conclude that additional  impairment  indicators  exist  and that goodwill associated with our acquired  business  is  impaired.       Impairment  losses  will be charged to earnings in the period in which they are identified. We will continue to evaluate goodwill for impairment and, should an  impairment  be  indicated,  the  corresponding  charge will be taken in that period.  Separable  intangible  assets  that  do  not  have indefinite lives are amortized  over  their  useful  lives.    Contingencies       We are engaged in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these  matters  as well as potential ranges of possible losses.  A determination of  the  amount  of  reserves required, if any, for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual matter.  The required reserves if any, may  change  in  the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach,  such  as  a  change  in settlement strategy for a particular matter.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS       On  January  23,  2001,  we  sold  the  operations  of  our Engineering and Education  Products Division, or EEPD, for cash proceeds of $7,000,000 resulting in  a gain of $3,849,000 recorded in 2001, and a $427,000 gain recorded in 2002.       Components of the net aggregate gain are included in the table below. As of December  31,  2001,  other  accrued liabilities included approximately $360,000 related  to  a  contingency  resulting from the disposition. The contingency was resolved  favorably during 2002 reducing other accrued liabilities from $585,000 to  $258,000  and  income  taxes from $140,000 to $40,000 resulting in a gain of $427,000.

The  loss  recorded  in 2003 related to previously unidentified third party contractual commitments of EEPD. The amounts were not material to the periods in which they applied, primarily 1999 and 2000. We  believe  that  all  significant  contingencies  relating to the discontinued operations have now been resolved.  ACQUISITIONS       In  July  2001,  we completed the acquisition of a data analysis consulting business  from  Waratah  Corporation. This acquisition provides us with expanded resources  and  expertise  in  the  pharmaceutical and healthcare markets, while establishing  an  East  Coast consulting office. The aggregate purchase price of $303,000  consisted  of  $150,000 cash, common stock valued at $99,000, a common stock  warrant  valued  at  $41,000 and direct transaction costs of $13,000. The value  of  the  34,530 shares of common stock issued was determined based on the average  market  price  of  our  common stock over a three-day period before and after  the date of acquisition. The warrant (to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock,  at an exercise price of $2.90, and expiring on July 13, 2006) was valued using  the  Black-Scholes  model.  We recorded an intangible asset for the value allocated  to  non-compete  agreements  of  $44,000,  which  was  amortized on a straight-line  basis  over  a two-year period, representing the expected life of the non-compete agreements that we acquired. The difference between the purchase price  and  the  fair value of the assets acquired in the amount of $240,000 has been  recorded  as  goodwill.       In  July  2001,  we also completed the formation of a French subsidiary and acquired the data analysis operations of Sigma-Plus, our longtime distributor in France. The formation of a French subsidiary provided us with an expanded direct sales  channel  and  local  consulting expertise in both Paris and Toulouse. The aggregate  purchase  price  of  $255,000  consisted  of $212,000 cash and direct transaction  costs  of  $43,000.  We  recorded an intangible asset for the value allocated  to  non-compete  agreements  of  $51,000,  which  were amortized on a straight-line  basis  over  a two-year period, representing the expected life of the non-compete agreements that we acquired. The difference between the purchase price  and  the  fair value of the assets acquired in the amount of $203,000 was recorded  as  goodwill.  In  the  fourth  quarter of 2003, when we performed our annual  impairment  analysis,  we  determined  that  a  loss  from impairment of goodwill  of  $203,000 was indicated based on our updated assumptions for future cash  flows. This analysis resulted in the write-down of all goodwill originally recorded  in  this  transaction.       In  September  2001,  we completed the acquisition of Predict AG (Predict). This  acquisition  provided  us  with a multi-lingual professional services team consisting of a multi-lingual team of business and technical experts in analytic CRM,  business intelligence, data mining, data warehousing, predictive modeling, and statistical analysis. The organization has also formed the core team for our central European office, which focuses primarily on Switzerland and Germany. The aggregate  consideration  paid  was  $2,214,000  consisting  of $1,466,000 cash, common  stock  valued  at $691,000, and direct transaction costs of $57,000. The value  of  the 300,000 shares of common stock issued was determined based on the average  market  price  of  our  common stock over a three-day period before and after  the  date  of  acquisition.  We  recorded intangible assets for the value allocated  to  non-compete  agreements  and  customer  relationships  totaling $215,000,  which were amortized on a straight-line basis over a two-year period, representing  the  expected life of the non-compete agreements that we acquired. We  recorded  $426,000  for  the  value  allocated  to  deferred  stock-based compensation  in  connection with restrictions on 185,010 shares of common stock otherwise  issuable as part of the acquisition, which was being amortized over a three-year vesting period using a graded vesting approach. However, in the first quarter  of  2003, our European General Manager resigned prior to the expiration of  the  restriction on his shares.  Consequently, these shares were returned to us  and  related stock-based compensation expense recognized in previous periods was reversed resulting in a reduction in sales and marketing expense of $139,000 in  2003.  As of December 31, 2003, all employees in receipt of restricted stock had terminated. The difference between the purchase price for Predict AG and the fair  value  of  the assets acquired in the amount of $1,374,000 was recorded as goodwill.       During  2002  the  continued  decline  in  the  market  for IT software and services prompted a re-assessment of all key assumptions underlying our goodwill valuation  judgments,  including  those  related to short and longer term growth rates. In the fourth quarter of 2002, using an October 1, 2002 measurement date, we  performed  our  annual  impairment  analysis and determined that a loss from impairment  of goodwill of $800,000 was required. This resulted primarily from a decline  in  the  service revenues for our Swiss operations due to weak economic conditions,  which caused the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be less than the book value of Predict. In the fourth quarter of 2003, when we next performed our  annual  impairment  analysis,  we  determined  that  an  additional loss of $259,000  was  indicated based on our updated assumptions for future cash flows, which  reflected  reduced  growth  rates  based on our economic outlook for that region. Due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and  product  portfolio,  it  is  possible  that  forecasts  used to support our intangible  assets  may  change  in the future, which could result in additional non-cash  charges  that  would  adversely  affect  our results of operations and financial condition.                                          18       In  January  2002,  we  acquired  the  data  analysis  operations  of  GraS Graphische  Systeme  GmbH,  or  GraS,  our  longtime distributor in Germany. The transaction  provided  us  with  an  expanded  direct  sales channel in Germany. Consideration  for  the  acquisition  was  cash  of  $157,000.  We  recorded  an intangible  asset  for the value allocated to customer relationships of $31,000, which  was  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  a  two-year  period, representing  the  expected life of the customer relationships that we acquired. The  difference  between  the  purchase  price  and the fair value of the assets acquired  in  the  amount of $126,000 was recorded as goodwill. In July 2003, we combined our German operations with our Swiss subsidiary headquartered in Basel, Switzerland and closed the German office. At that time we evaluated the goodwill acquired  in  the  acquisition of our German and Swiss businesses for impairment and  determined  that  none  had  occurred.       The  remaining  goodwill  recorded in connection with these acquisitions is not  subject  to  amortization,  but  is  subject  to  periodic  evaluation  for impairment.       The  results of GraS, Predict, Waratah and Sigma Plus have been included in our  operating  results  since  their  respective  acquisition  dates.                                          19    RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS       As  an  aid  to  understanding  our operating results, the table below indicates the percentage relationships of revenue and expense items included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, and the percentage  changes  in  those  items  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2003,  2002,  and  2001.

Total  revenues decreased from $17,426,000 in 2001  to  $16,394,000 in 2002, a decrease of 6%, and increased to $17,217,000 in 2003,  an  increase  of  5%  from  2002.       Software  license  revenues,  consisting  of  software  licenses  and subscriptions,  accounted for 39% of total revenues in 2001, 38% in 2002 and 44% in  2003.  Software  license  revenues  decreased  from  $6,753,000  in  2001 to $6,151,000  in  2002,  a decrease of 9%, and increased to $7,645,000 in 2003, an increase  of  24%. The 2002 decrease was primarily due to dampened demand caused by  the  economic  slowdown,  which  adversely  affected  corporate  spending on information technology in many of the industries we serve. The 2003 increase was primarily  due  to increased European license revenues, primarily as a result of positive  fluctuations  in  foreign exchange rates,  and an increase in revenues from  InFact,  for  which  we  first recognized revenue in the fourth quarter of 2002.       Software  maintenance revenues accounted for 29% of total revenues in 2001, 36%  in  2002  and  39%  in  2003.  Software maintenance revenues increased from $5,139,000  in 2001 to $5,955,000 in 2002, an increase of 16%, and to $6,641,000 in  2003,  an  increase  of  12%. These increases were due to an increase in our installed  base  and  ongoing  maintenance  renewals.       Professional  services  revenues  generated  from  consulting  and training activities  decreased  from $5,534,000 in 2001 to $4,288,000 in 2002, a decrease of  23%,  and  to  2,931,000  in 2003, a decrease of 32% from 2002.  In 2002 the revenue  decrease  in  professional services was primarily due to generally weak economic  conditions,  resulting  in  fewer  available projects at which time we reduced  our consulting headcount, particularly in our Swiss office. In 2003 the revenue  decrease  was primarily due to fewer consulting projects in Switzerland and  North  America  and  we further reduced our consulting headcount. We expect professional  services  revenues  to continue to decrease in 2004 as we focus on aligning  our  services  with  software  license  sale  opportunities.       Revenues  from  international  operations,  which  include  Europe and Asia Pacific, increased from $3,963,000 in 2001 to $5,169,000 in 2002, an increase of 30%,  to  $5,488,000 in 2003, an increase of 6%. The 2002 increase resulted from our international expansion through acquisition, resulting in the formation of a French  subsidiary  in  July  2001,  a  Swiss subsidiary in September 2001 and a German  subsidiary  in  January  2002.  The  purpose of the company's aggressive expansion  in  Europe was to enhance growth and reduce our exposure to the North American  economy.  The  2003  increase  was  primarily  the result of increased software  license  revenue  partially  offset  by  lower  professional  service revenues,  particularly  in  Switzerland.  Most of the increase in revenues from international  operations  was  attributable to positive fluctuations in foreign exchange  rates.       We  expect our license and maintenance revenues to grow in 2004, subject to the successful launch of new products and continued worldwide economic recovery, as  we  continue  to  increase  our  sales  and  marketing  resources.  COST  OF  REVENUES       Total  cost  of revenues decreased from $6,192,000 in 2001 to $5,365,000 in 2002,  a decrease of 13%, and decreased to $4,490,000 in 2003, a decrease of 16% from  2002.  The  2002 and 2003 decrease in total cost of revenues was primarily due  to  decreases  in  professional service costs offset somewhat in 2003 by an increase  in  the  cost  of  software-related  revenue.       The  cost  of  software-related  revenue,  which  consists of royalties for third-party  software,  product media, product duplication, manuals and costs of maintenance,  decreased  as a percentage of total software-related revenues from 19% in 2001, to 15% in 2002, and to 14% in 2003. The 2002 decrease was primarily due  to  decreased  sales of products with royalty costs while the 2003 decrease was  primarily  due  to revenue growth exceeding the growth in costs of software licenses.  Until  January  2004,  we  were  a  worldwide  licensee  of  the  "S" programming language from Lucent Technologies Inc. Under the license, we had the right to use, sublicense and support the "S" language in exchange for royalties, which are included in the cost of software licenses. In January 2004 we acquired the  copyrights to the software code underlying the "S" Programming language for $2.0  million  resulting  in  a  cessation  of future royalty payments to Lucent Technologies.  We  expect  that the cost of software-related revenue will decrease primarily as the  result  of  a  decrease  in  royalty  costs  due to the January 2004 Lucent Technologies  agreement,  offset  somewhat  by  the  amortization  cost  of  the copyright  intangible  asset  which is being amortized over a three year period.                                          21        The cost of professional services consists primarily of salaries, and other operating  costs  of  employees  who  provide  consulting  services  and product training.  The  cost  of  professional  services as a percentage of professional services revenues increased from 70% in 2001, to 82% in 2002 and to 87% in 2003. The  2002  and  2003  increases  were primarily due to decreases in professional services  revenue  partially  offset  by  the reduction of professional services expenses,  which  lagged  the  related  revenue  decrease. We expect the cost of professional  services to fluctuate with changes in service revenues and for our services  margin to gradually improve as utilization of existing resources grow. We  expect  that  the  reductions  in  professional  services  personnel that we implemented  during  our  restructuring  in  mid-2003  will  help us improve our service  margins.  OPERATING  EXPENSES       Sales  and  marketing  expenses  consist  primarily  of  salaries,  travel, facilities  costs for sales and marketing personnel, promotional activities, and costs  of  advertising  and  trade  shows.  Sales  and  marketing increased from $5,759,000  in  2001 to $7,002,000 in 2002, an increase of 22% from 2001, and to $6,919,000  in  2003, a decrease of 1%. As a percentage of total revenues, sales and  marketing  expenses increased from 33% in 2001 to 43% in 2002 and decreased to 40% in 2003. The increase in 2002 over 2001 was primarily due to the addition of  our  French,  Swiss  and  German  subsidiaries.  The  decrease  in  2003 was primarily  due to the closing of our German office in July 2003 and reduction in workforce  in our Swiss office.  In 2004, we expect sales and marketing expenses to  increase as we allocate more resources to that area, but to remain flat as a percentage  of  total  revenues.       Net  research  and  development  expenses consist primarily of salaries and related  benefits,  equipment  for  software  developers,  facility  costs,  and payments  to  outside  contractors,  less  funded  research.  Net  research  and development expenses increased from $2,747,000 in 2001 to $3,244,000 in 2002, an 18%  increase,  and  decreased  to  $2,162,000  in  2003, a decrease of 33%. Net research and development increased as a percentage of total revenues from 16% in 2001  to  20%  in  2002,  and  decreased  to  13%  in  2003.  Gross research and development  expenses increased from $7,574,000 in 2001 to $7,918,000 in 2002, a 5%  increase,  and  decreased  18%  to  $6,469,000 in 2003. In 2002 the increase research  and  development costs was primarily due to an increased investment in new product offerings, such as Insightful Miner and InFact, and to a decrease in funded  research.  In 2003, the decrease was primarily attributable to workforce reductions  implemented  in  July  2002  and  July  2003. Funded research, which consists  primarily  of  government grants for research projects, decreased from $4,827,000  in  2001  to  $4,674,000 in 2002, a decrease of 3%, and decreased to $4,307,000  in  2003,  a  decrease  of  8%.  The  change  in  funded research is attributable  to  the  number  of awarded contracts as well as to a more focused approach  of aligning research funding with our core products. We expect our net research  and development expenses to increase due to both a reduction in funded research  as  well  as  through  additional  hiring  of  development  personnel.       General  and  administrative  expenses  consist  primarily  of salaries and related  costs  associated  with  finance, accounting, investor relations, human resources,  administration and facilities activities. General and administrative expenses increased from $3,063,000 in 2001 to $3,074,000 in 2002, an increase of less  than  1%,  and  increased  to $3,559,000 in 2003, an increase of 16%. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses increased from 18%  in  2001  to  19%  in  2002  and  to  21%  in  2003.  The 2003 increase was attributable  to  continuing increases in insurance, legal, compliance and audit expenses.  We  expect  future  increases  in general and administrative expenses relating  to  continuing  increases  in  legal,  compliance  and audit expenses.       In  late  2003 we uncovered a theft by an employee and launched an internal investigation  to  determine  the  extent  of  the  loss.  As  a  result  of our investigation,  we  determined  that  the  theft  had  occurred over a period of several  years.  We ultimately concluded that while there was no material impact on earnings in any period, approximately $100,000 of expense in each of 2003 and 2002  needed  to  be  reclassified  to  general  and administrative expense from several  other  cost  and  expense  categories. As part of our internal controls review, we have implemented controls to reduce the risk of this type of incident reoccurring.       Amortization  of  stock-based  compensation  expense  consists  of  amounts related  to  common  stock  issued  in  acquisitions,  which  were  subject  to cancellation  in  the  event  of  employee termination. Amortization of deferred stock-based  compensation  was  $44,000 in 2001, $220,000 in 2002 and $34,000 in 2003.  In  addition, in 2003, our European General Manager resigned prior to the expiration of the restriction on his shares.  Consequently, in 2003 these shares were  returned  to us and related stock-based compensation expense recognized in previous  periods  was reversed resulting in a reversal of previously recognized deferred  stock-based  compensation  expense  of  $139,000  and  a  reduction of deferred stock-based compensation of $128,000. In 2001, stock-based compensation expense  was included in the functional operating expense categories as follows: $28,000  for  sales  and  marketing,  $9,000  for  cost of professional services revenues,  and  $7,000  for  research  and  development.  In  2002,  stock-based compensation expense of $111,000 was included in sales and marketing, $79,000 in cost of professional services revenues, and $30,000 in research and development. In  2003,  the  net  stock-based  compensation  expense  credit  of $105,000 was included  in  sales  and  marketing.  The  credit  is  the result of $139,000 in deferred  stock compensation expense previously recognized being reversed due to the  return of restricted shares issued in the acquisition of Predict AG, offset by  deferred  stock  compensation  expense  of  $34,000.                                          22       In  2002,  we  recorded a loss from impairment of $800,000 resulting from a write-down  of  the  carrying value of goodwill for Predict AG as computed under FAS  142.  In  2003  we  recorded an additional loss from impairment of $462,000 consisting  of  a  $259,000  write-down  of  the  carrying value of goodwill for Predict AG and a $203,000 write-down of the carrying value of goodwill for Sigma Plus.  The 2002 impairment was due to the continued decline in the market for IT software and services from the September 2001 date of acquisition of Predict and to  our July 2002 restructuring, which resulted in the termination of nearly 50% of  the  headcount  in our Swiss office. The 2003 impairment was the result of a decrease  in  the  discounted  future  cash  flows  from  our  French  and Swiss subsidiaries  as  computed  under  FAS  142 caused by a reduction in our revenue growth  expectations  based  on  our  economic  outlook  for  that  region.  RESTRUCTURING-RELATED  CHARGES       In  November  2001,  July  2002  and  July  2003  we  implemented workforce reductions  in  order  to  better  align  our  costs with our revenues. The 2001 restructuring  expense  totaled  $455,000  and  resulted  from  the reduction of approximately  24 employees, or 13% of our employee base at the time. All of the restructuring  charge related our Domestic Data Analysis segment. As of December 31,  2003,  all  severance  and  termination  benefits related to this workforce reduction  were  paid.       The  2002  restructuring  expense  totaled  $501,000  and  resulted  from a workforce reduction of 31 employees, or 18% of our employee base at the time. Of the  $501,000  restructuring  charge, $170,000 related to our International Data Analysis  segment  and  the  remaining $331,000 was attributable to our Domestic Data Analysis segment. All of the 2002 restructuring charges related to employee severance  and  termination  benefits.  As of December 31, 2002, $418,000 of the severance and termination benefits had been paid and $83,000 remained accrued on that  date,  with  the  remaining  benefits  paid  in  January  2003.       The  2003  restructuring  expense totaled $911,000 and included a workforce reduction  of  23  employees,  or  18%  of our employee base at the time. Of the $911,000  restructuring  charge,  $288,000  related  to  our  International Data Analysis  segment  and  the  remaining $623,000 was attributable to our Domestic Data  Analysis  segment. As part of this restructuring, the Company combined its German operations with its Swiss subsidiary headquartered in Basel, Switzerland. On  September  30,  2003,  Shawn  Javid,  President  and  CEO, resigned from the company.  The  2003 restructuring charges, including charges associated with the resignation  of  Shawn  Javid,  consisted  primarily  of  employee severance and termination payments and lease termination costs, as well as a $176,000 non-cash compensation  charge related to a modification of stock options upon termination of  Mr. Javid. As of December 31, 2003 $321,000 in termination benefits remained to  be paid, of which $257,000 will be paid in 2004 and the remaining $64,000 in 2005.  INTEREST  INCOME  AND  EXPENSE       Interest  and  other  income decreased from $341,000 in 2001 to $128,000 in 2002,  and  increased  to  $189,000  in  2003. The decrease in 2002 was due to a decrease  in  prevailing  interest  rates.  The  increase  in 2003 was primarily attributable  to  an  exchange  gain  of  $136,000  related  to foreign currency transactions.       Interest  expense  increased  from  $27,000 in 2001 to $33,000 in 2002, and decreased  to  $21,000 in 2003. The higher expense in 2002 was due to borrowings of  $450,  000  under  an  equipment  term  loan  with Silicon Valley Bank.  The decrease  in  2003  was  due to the $128,000 principal pay down of the equipment loan.  INCOME  TAXES       As  of  December 31, 2003, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of  approximately  $22,464,000 and research and development and other tax credit carryforwards  of  approximately  $2,210,000.  Utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  may  be  subject  to certain limitations under Section 382 of the Internal  Revenue  Code.  Deferred  tax assets, which have arisen primarily as a result  of  these  net  operating  losses and other tax credits also reflect the effect  of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the corresponding financial statement amounts. Due to the uncertainty of our ability  to  utilize  its  deferred  tax  assets, a valuation allowance has been established  for  financial  reporting  purposes  equal to the amount of the net deferred  tax  assets.       Income  tax  expense of $115,000 in 2001 reflects the provision for foreign income  taxes  associated  with  our  international  operations.  The income tax benefit  in  2002  of  $201,000  primarily relates to a reversal of income taxes payable  and  a  tax  refund  on  completion  of  a  tax  audit  at  one  of our international  operations.  Income  tax  expense  of  $106,000  in 2003 reflects provision for foreign income taxes associated with our international operations.  DISCONTINUED  OPERATIONS       On  January  23,  2001  we  sold  the  assets  of EEPD for cash proceeds of $7,000,000.  As a result of this transaction, we recorded the operations of EEPD as  discontinued operations. We recorded a net gain of $3,849,000 on the sale in 2001  after  taking  into account net assets transferred and certain liabilities arising  from  the  transaction  including  severance and transaction costs. The liabilities  arising  from  the  sale  included  accruals  related  to  certain contingencies  resulting from the disposition. In                                          23  2002,  these  contingencies  were  favorably resolved resulting in a net gain of $427,000  also  recorded  as  a  gain  on  disposal  of discontinued operations.       In  2001  EEPD's  operating  loss  totaled  $737,000, representing revenues earned of $74,000 offset by costs and expenses of $811,000 for the 23-day period ending  January  23,  2001.  During  2003  we  recorded a loss from discontinued operations  of $137,000 related to previously unidentified potential third party contractual commitments of EEPD. The amounts were not material to the periods in which  they  applied,  primarily  1999  and  2000.  NET  OPERATING  RESULTS       Net  loss from continuing operations in 2001 was $698,000 compared to a net loss  from  continuing operations of  $3,508,000 in 2002 and $1,436,000 in 2003. The  2001  loss  from  continuing  operations resulted from slower than expected revenue growth in the second half of the year due to a slowing economy, a change in  the revenue mix to a higher proportion of services revenues with lower gross profit,  and  to  acquisition  related  amortization  and  deferred compensation charges.  We  incurred  a  loss  from continuing operations of $1,338,000 in the fourth  quarter  of  2001.  This  loss  was  also the result of higher operating expenses  in 2001, including a $455,000 restructuring charge related to employee severance  and  termination  benefits,  the  operating costs associated with the three  acquisitions completed in the third quarter of 2001, and amortization and deferred  compensation  charges  related  to  our  acquisition  of Predict AG in Switzerland.  The 2002 loss from continuing operations resulted from lower total revenues,  higher  sales  and  marketing  costs  resulting  from  international expansion,  higher  net  research  and  development  expense  resulting  from an increase  in  our  product  line,  the $800,000 loss from impairment of goodwill related  to  our  Swiss  subsidiary,  and  the $501,000 restructuring charge. We incurred  a  loss from continuing operations of $1,127,000 in the fourth quarter of  2002  as compared to a $1,338,000 loss in the prior year comparable quarter. The  fourth quarter 2002 loss included a loss from impairment of goodwill charge of  $800,000  and  a  $297,000 increase in expense, offset in part by a $508,000 improvement in gross profit due to a higher mix of software revenues as compared to  services.   The 2003 loss from continuing operations primarily resulted from the $911,000 restructuring charge and $462,000 loss from impairment of goodwill. The  fourth  quarter  of  2003  resulted in income from continuing operations of $209,000.  This  income  was  the  result  of  higher  revenues than in previous quarters  coupled  with expense saving measures taken earlier in the year offset somewhat  by  the  impairment  of  goodwill  charge  of  $462,000.       Net  income  in 2001 was $2,414,000 compared to a net loss of $3,081,000 in 2002  and  a  net loss of $1,573,000 in 2003.  The 2001 net income reflected our loss  from  continuing operations offset by the net gain on the sale of EEPD and the  EEPD  operating  loss.  The  2002  net  loss  reflected  our  net loss from continuing operations offset slightly by the remaining gain on the sale of EEPD. The  2003  net  loss reflected our loss from continuing operations and loss from discontinued  operations  of  $137,000  related  to  EEPD.  CONTINGENCIES       On  December  13,  2002,  Wajih Alaiyan, a former employee of ours, filed a complaint  against  us  in  the  Superior Court for King County, Washington. Mr. Alaiyan  was formerly employed by the Company and he alleged that his employment was  wrongfully  terminated. On December 5, 2003, a judge for the Superior Court for King County, Washington granted summary judgment in our favor and dismissed. Mr.  Alayian has appealed the decision.  . An evaluation of the likelihood of an adverse  outcome  cannot be expressed with sufficient certainty at this time. An unfavorable  outcome  could  have  a  material effect on our operating position, results  of  operations,  and  cash  flows.  LIQUIDITY  AND  CAPITAL  RESOURCES       Cash  and  cash equivalents increased to $7,139,000 at the end of 2003 from $6,819,000 at the end of 2002 and $6,278,000 at December 31, 2001.  We generated $815,000  in  cash  from  operations  in  2003  compared to $768,000 in 2002 and $198,000  in  2001.  Operating  cash inflows in 2003 and 2002 were primarily the result  of losses from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash depreciation, amortization  and  goodwill  impairment,  and  benefiting  from  a  decrease  in receivables  in  2002  and  an  increase  in  deferred  revenue  in  both years.       Investing  activities  resulted  in  the  net  use  of  $256,000  in  2003, $1,285,000 in 2002 and $3,303,000 in 2001. In 2003 and 2002 investing activities resulted  primarily  from  the purchases of capital equipment. In 2001 investing activities  consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $1,400,000 related to continuing  operations  and  $1,744,000  for  acquisitions.       Financing activities used cash of $39,000 in 2003 and provided cash inflows $1,197,000  in  2002  and  $542,000  in  2001. In 2001 financing activities cash inflows  resulted primarily from proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock  issued  through  the  employee  stock  purchase  plan,  offset in part by payments  made  on  debt.  In 2002 financing cash inflows included $450,000 from equipment  financings. $380,000 from subscription receivable from a director and $451,000  from  proceeds  via  the                                          24  exercise  of  stock options and stock issued through the employee stock purchase plan.  In 2003, payments made on equipment financings exceeded the proceeds from the  exercise  of  stock  options  and  stock  issued through the employee stock purchase  plan.       In  March 2003, we renewed a $3.5 million working capital revolving line of credit and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, which expired in March 2004. This facility is secured by our accounts receivable and allows us to borrow up to the lesser of (a) 75% of our eligible accounts receivable (advances against  U.S.  Government  accounts  will  be  permitted up to 20% of the amount outstanding  under the line of credit) or (b) $3.5 million and bears interest at the  prime  rate,  which was 4.0% as of December 31, 2003, plus 1%.  At December 31,  2003,  no amounts had been borrowed and $1,445,000 was available for future borrowings  under  the  line  of  credit  facility.       In  March  2003,  we  also  renewed  an  equipment  term  loan and security agreement with SVB which expired in March 2004., This facility allows us to take advances  on the cost of eligible equipment less than 90 days old and is secured by  the  underlying  equipment. We borrowed $450,000 under this facility in 2002 and  the  remaining outstanding balance was $290,000 at December 31, 2003. These term  loan  advances  bear  interest  at  the  prime  rate, which was 4.0% as of December  31,  2003, plus 1%.  Advances are repaid over a 36-month period.    At December  31,  2003,  $375,000  was  available  under  this  facility for future equipment  borrowings.       These  credit  facilities  contain  covenants that limit our net losses and restrict  the  amount of capital expenditures not financed through the equipment term  loan.  In  addition,  we  are prohibited from paying dividends. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2003. These credit facilities may  be  utilized  to  finance  future capital investments, including technology necessary  to  support our new product lines. These credit facilities expand our liquid  resources  and  ability to maintain an adequate balance of cash-on-hand. Advances  taken  on the equipment term loan totaled $450,000 in 2002 and none in 2003.  There  were  no advances outstanding under the line of credit at December 31,  2003.       In  2001  net  cash  proceeds from the sale of EEPD amounted to $5,084,000, including  proceeds  on  the sale of $7,000,000 offset by $1,916,000 in employee severance and termination benefits, professional fees and vendor commitments. In 2002  cash  outflows  for discontinued operations relating to employee severance and  termination  benefits  amounted  to  $169,000.  In  2003  cash outflows for discontinued  operations relating to contractual commitments of EEPD amounted to $137,000.       At  December  31, 2003, our principal unused sources of liquidity consisted of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  of $7,139,000 and our bank line of credit. Our liquidity  needs  are  principally for financing of accounts receivable, capital assets, strategic investments, product development, and flexibility in a dynamic and  competitive  operating  environment.       The  following  are  our contractual commitments (as of December 31, 2003):                                        YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31,                                     ------------------------                           2004      2005       2006      2007     2008    THEREAFTER     TOTAL                         --------  ---------  --------  --------  -------  -----------  ----------                Commitments:   Equipment financings  $129,000  $ 129,000  $ 32,000  $      -  $     -  $         -  $  290,000   Operating leases       773,000    167,000   130,000   110,000   47,000       63,000   1,290,000                         --------  ---------  --------  --------  -------  -----------  ----------     Total commitments   $902,000  $ 296,000  $162,000  $110,000  $47,000  $    63,000  $1,580,000                         ========  =========  ========  ========  =======  ===========  ==========                                           25       We  believe  that  our  existing cash and cash equivalents, investments and available  bank  borrowings  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for  at least the next 12 months. However, if during that time market conditions worsen,  or  if  other  unforeseen  events should occur, we would likely deem it necessary to seek additional funds through public or private equity financing or from  other  sources  in  order  to  fund  our  operations and pursue our growth strategy.  We have no commitment for additional financing, and we may experience difficulty  in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all. Any financing we obtain  may  contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or  may  require  us  to  issue  securities  that  have  rights,  preferences or privileges  senior to our common stock and may dilute your ownership interest in Insightful.  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET  ARRANGEMENTS       We  provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against  claims  of  intellectual  property  infringement  made by third parties arising  from  the  use  of  our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications  under  SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN  45. We consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome  and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have  not  accrued  any  liabilities  related  to  such  indemnifications in our financial  statements.  RECENT  ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS       In  December  2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, "Revenue  Recognition"  (SAB  No.  104),  which  codifies,  revises and rescinds certain  sections  of  SAB No. 101, "Revenue Recognition", in order to make this interpretive  guidance  consistent  with  current  authoritative  accounting and auditing guidance and SEC rules and regulations. SAB 104's primary purpose is to rescind  accounting  guidance  contained  in SAB 101 related to multiple element revenue  arrangements,  superseded  as  a  result  of the issuance of EITF 00-21 Accounting  for  Revenue  Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Additionally, SAB  104  rescinds  the  SEC's  Revenue  Recognition  in  Financial  Statements Frequently  Asked  Questions  and Answers (the FAQ) issued with SAB 101 that had been codified in SEC Topic 13, Revenue Recognition. Selected portions of the FAQ have been incorporated into SAB 104. While the wording of SAB 104 has changed to reflect  the  issuance  of EITF 00-21, the revenue recognition principles of SAB 101  remain  largely  unchanged  by  the  issuance  of SAB 104. Adoption of this standard  had no material impact on the company's financial position, results of operations  or  cash  flows.                                          26  ITEM  7A.    QUANTITATIVE  AND  QUALITATIVE  DISCLOSURES  ABOUT  MARKET  RISK.       We  develop  products  in  the  United States and sell them worldwide. As a result,  our  financial  results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign  currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. We  operate  in  the  United  Kingdom, Germany, France and Switzerland and incur expenses  and  generate billings denominated in those local currencies. Interest income  and  expense  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  the general level of U.S. interest  rates,  particularly  since  our  investments  are  in  short-term instruments.  Based  on  the  short-term  nature  and  current  levels  of  our investments  and  debt,  however,  we  do not believe that there is any material market  risk  or  exposure.       Our  general  investing  policy  is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure  the  safety  of  invested  funds  by limiting credit and market risk. We currently  invest  in  highly  liquid  money  market accounts. All highly liquid investments  with  original maturities of three months or less are considered to be  cash  equivalents.                                          27    ITEM  8.
