=============  ==============  =============  ==============  (1)  The  Company  changed  its  fiscal  year  from  June  30  to  December  31.      The Transition Period represents the six month period from  July  1, 1997 -      December  31,  1997.                                           18  Twelve  Months  Ended  December  31,  1999  Compared  to the Twelve Months Ended December  31,  1998  Total  revenues  increased  17.0% , from $24,447,000 for the twelve months ended December  31, 1998 to $28,603,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999. The  increase  in  total  revenues  was  primarily attributable to worldwide new license  and  service revenue generated by the Company's S-PLUS product line, as well as new license and upgrade revenue generated from the Mathcad product line.  Worldwide  S-PLUS  license  and service revenue increased 38.1%, from $8,841,000 for  the  twelve  months  ended  December 31, 1998 to $12,212,000 for the twelve months  ended December 31, 1999, and increased as a percentage of total revenues from  36.2% to 42.7%, respectively.  The increase in S-PLUS product line revenue was  primarily  attributable  to an increase in service revenues, which includes maintenance, training, and consulting. S-PLUS license revenue was $5,165,000 and $6,505,000  for  the  twelve  months  ended  1998 and 1999, respectively. S-PLUS service  revenue  was $3,676,000 and $5,707,000 for the twelve months ended 1998 and  1999,  respectively.  The increase in both service and license revenues was directly  attributable to the June 1999 release of S-PLUS 2000 as well as to the product  line's  stability,  quality,  maturing  sales  and  marketing  model.  Worldwide Mathcad product line revenues increased 5.0%, from $15,606,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998 to $16,391,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999, but decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 63.8% to 57.3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998 and 1999, respectively.  The increase  in  Mathcad  product  line revenue was due primarily to the release of StudyWorks  3  (released  in  April  1999)  and  Mathcad  Add-ons such as Axum 6 (released  in  March  1999).  These  increases  were  offset  significantly by a decrease  in  upgrades as the company changed its method of distribution from an indirect  model  to  a  direct  model.  Total  international  revenues,  attributable  to  all  product lines, increased 11.9%,  from  $6,897,000  in  1998  to  $7,716,000  in  1999, and decreased as a percentage  of  total  revenues  from  28.2%  to  26.7%,  respectively.  Total  cost  of  revenues increased 26.0%, from $4,246,000 for the twelve months ended  December  31, 1998 to $5,351,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999,  and  increased  as  a  percentage  of total revenues from 17.4% to 18.7%, respectively.  The  increase  in total cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues  was  primarily attributable to a product mix shift toward lower margin products,  namely  the  SPLUS  product  line  due  to  its service component and StudyWorks.  Sales  and  marketing  expenses  increased  23.5%,  from  $10,364,000  for  the twelve-months ended December 31, 1998 to $12,797,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999, and increased as a percentage of total revenues from 42.4% to 44.8%,  respectively.  The  increase  in  sales  and  marketing  expenses  was attributable  to  an  increase  in variable marketing expenditures and headcount additions to the marketing department and sales force. Recruiting and consulting fees  associated  with FreeScholarships.com also contributed to higher expenses. FreeScholarships.com  sales  and  marketing expenses totaled $1,095,000 in 1999.  Net  research  and  development expenses increased 8.0%, from $4,964,000 for the twelve  months ended December 31, 1998 to $5,360,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999, and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 20.3% to 18.7%,  respectively.  The  overall  increase  in  net  research and development expenses  was  primarily  attributable  to  FreeScholarships.com  and  increased investments in the Mathcad and S-Plus product lines, and offset partially by the increase  in research funding. Funded research increased 61.3%,  from $2,831,000 for  the  twelve  months  ended  December  31, 1998 to $4,567,000 for the twelve months  ended December 31, 1999. The increase in funded research is attributable to  an  increase  in  awarded contracts and the related increase in personnel to fulfill  those contracts. The Company's Data Analysis Products Division research department's headcount increased from 32 to 46 as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, respectively.  FreeScholarships.com  research  and  development expenses totaled $521,000  in  1999.                                          19  General  and  administrative  expenses  increased 30.0%, from $2,713,000 for the twelve  months ended December 31, 1998 to $3,526,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999, and increased as a percentage of total revenues from 11.1% to 12.3%, respectively. The increase in overall general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased compensation costs, legal and consulting fees  associated  with  Freescholarships.com,  higher  facilities  costs,  and increases  in  other  miscellaneous  expenses.  FreeScholarships.com general and administrative  expenses  totaled  $280,000  in  1999.  Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999 was $1,453,000 compared to  $2,220,000  for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998.  Fiscal Year 1999 reflected solid profit growth in the Company's core products partially offset by the  significant  investment  in  the  Company's  new  internet  venture, FreeScholarships.com's  net  loss  totaled  $1,842,000  in  1999.  Twelve  Months  Ended  December  31,  1998  Compared  to the Twelve Months Ended December  31,  1997  (unaudited)  Total  revenues  increased  15.2% , from $21,224,000 for the twelve months ended December  31, 1997 to $24,447,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998. The  increase  in  total  revenues  was  primarily attributable to worldwide new license  and upgrade revenue generated by the Company's Mathcad product line, as well  as new license and service revenue generated from the S-PLUS product line.  Worldwide Mathcad product line revenues increased 11.9%, from $13,947,000 in the twelve months ended December 31, 1997 to $15,606,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998, but decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 65.7% to 63.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively.  The increase  in  Mathcad  product  line revenue was due primarily to the release of Mathcad  8  (released  in September 1998) and Mathcad 7 (released in June 1997). To  a  lesser extent, this increase was also due to the release of StudyWorks II in  March  1998.  Worldwide  S-PLUS license and service revenue increased 21.5%, from  $7,277,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1997 to $8,841,000 for the  twelve  months  ended  December  31, 1998, and increased as a percentage of total  revenues  from  34.3%  to  36.2%,  respectively.  The  increase in S-PLUS product  line  revenue  was  primarily attributable to the release of S-PLUS 4.5 (released  in  May  1998)  and  S-PLUS  4.0  (released  in  September  1997).  Total  international revenues, attributable to all product lines, increased 3.2% from  $6,682,000 in 1997 to $6,897,000 in 1998, and decreased as a percentage of total  revenues  from  31.5%  to  28.2%,  respectively.  Total  cost  of  revenues  decreased 5.3%, from $4,482,000 for the twelve months ended  December  31, 1997 to $4,246,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998,  and  decreased  as  a  percentage  of total revenues from 21.1% to 17.4%, respectively.  The  decrease  in total cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues  was primarily attributable to switching from disk to CD media with the release  of Mathcad 7 for Windows, thereby decreasing direct material costs on a per  unit  basis.  Sales  and marketing expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 1997 were $10,413,000  and  remained  relatively consistent as compared to $10,364,000 for the  fiscal year ended December 31, 1998, and decreased as a percentage of total revenues  from  49.1%  to  42.4%,  respectively.  Net  research  and development expenses decreased 11.1%, from $5,581,000 for the twelve  months  ended  December  31, 1997 to $4,964,000 during the twelve months ended  December  31,  1998, and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 26.3%  to  20.3%,  respectively.  The  decrease  in net research and development expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in consulting costs associated with  development  initiatives  in the Company's Data Analysis Products Division and  offset  partially  by  an  increase  in  research  funding. Funded research increased  46.3%,  from $1,935,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1997 to  $2,831,000  for  the  twelve months ended December 31, 1998. The increase in funded  research  is  attributable  to  an increase in awarded contracts and the related  increase  in  personnel  to fulfill those contracts. The Company's Data Analysis  Products Division research department's headcount increased from 24 to 32  as  of  December  31,  1997  and  1998,  respectively.                                          20  General  and  administrative  expenses  decreased  6.7%, from $2,909,000 for the twelve  months  ended  December  31, 1997 to $2,713,000 during the twelve months ended  December  31,  1998, and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 13.7%  to  11.1%,  respectively.  The  decrease  in  overall  general  and administrative  expenses  was  primarily  attributable  to  decreases in foreign currency  transaction  losses.  Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998 was $2,220,000 compared to  a  net  loss  of  $2,129,000  for the twelve months ended December 31, 1997. Improved  performance  from  the  recently  refreshed Mathcad and S-PLUS product lines,  coupled  with  margin  improvements  and management control of operating expenses  contributed  to  this  improvement  in  profit.  Twelve  Months  Ended December 31, 1998 Compared to Twelve Months Ended June 30, 1997  Total  revenues  increased  38.3%,  from $17,678,000 for the twelve months ended June  30,  1997  to  $24,447,000  for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998. This  increase  in  total  revenues  was primarily attributable to worldwide new license and upgrade revenue generated by the Mathcad product line as well as new license  and  service  revenue  generated  from  the  S-PLUS  product  line.  Worldwide  Mathcad  product  line sales increased 31.7%, from $11,850,000 in the twelve  months ended June 30, 1997 to $15,606,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 1998, but decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 67.0% to 63.8%,  respectively.  The  twelve  months ended December 31, 1998 had increased revenue  associated  with  Mathcad  8 (released in September 1998) and Mathcad 7 (released in June 1997).  Worldwide S-PLUS product line revenue increased 51.7%, from  $5,828,000  in  the twelve months ended June 30, 1997 to $8,841,000 during the  twelve  months  ended  December  31, 1998, and increased as a percentage of total  revenues  from  33.0%  to  36.2%,  respectively.  S-PLUS product line had increased  license  and  services  revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998  due  to  the  release  of S-PLUS 4.5 (released in May 1998) and S-PLUS 4.0 (released  in  September  1997).  Total international revenues, attributable to all product lines, increased 14.6% ,  from  $6,017,000 in 1997 to $6,897,000 in 1998, and decreased as a percentage of  total  revenues  from  34.0%  to  28.2%,  respectively.  Total  cost  of  revenues  increased 7.6%, from $3,946,000 for the twelve months ended  June  30,  1997  to  $4,246,000 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998,  and  decreased  as  a  percentage  of total revenues from 22.3% to 17.4%, respectively.  The  decrease  in total cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues  was primarily attributable to switching from disk to CD media with the release  of Mathcad 7 for Windows, thereby decreasing direct material costs on a per  unit  basis.  Sales  and  marketing  expenses  for  the twelve-months ended June 30, 1997 were $10,251,000  and  remained relatively consistent compared to $10,364,000 for the fiscal  year  ended  December  31,  1998, but decreased as a percentage of total revenues  from  58.0%  to  42.4%,  respectively.  Net  research  and  development expenses decreased 3.5%, from $5,143,000 for the twelve  months  ended  June  30, 1997 to $4,964,000 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998, and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 29.1% to 20.3%.  The  decrease  in  net  research  and development expenses was primarily attributable  to  a  decrease  in  consulting  costs associated with development initiatives  in the Company's Data Analysis Products Division and an increase in funded research. Funded research increased 47.8%, from $1,915,000 for the twelve months  ended  June  30, 1997 to $2,831,000 for the twelve months ended December 31,  1998.  The  increase  in  funded research is attributable to an increase in awarded  contracts  and  the  related  increase  in  personnel  to fulfill those contracts.  The  Company's Data Analysis Products Division research department's headcount  increased  from  23  to 32 as of June 30, 1997 and December 31, 1998, respectively.                                          21  General and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997 were $2,732,000  and remained consistent at $2,713,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 1998, and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 15.5% to 11.1%,  respectively.  The  consistency  in  expenditures  and  reduction  as  a percentage  of  total  revenues  was due to management efforts to control costs.  Net  income  for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 was $2,220,000 compared to  net  loss of $4,300,000 for the twelve months ended June 30, 1997.  Improved performance from the recently refreshed Mathcad and S-PLUS product lines coupled with  margin  improvements  contributed  to  this  increase  in  profit.  Transition Period Ended December 31, 1997 Compared to the Six-Month Period Ended December  31,  1996  (unaudited)  Total  revenues  increased  37.4%,  from  $9,478,000  for  the  six months ended December 31, 1996 to $13,024,000 during the Transition Period.  This increase in total  revenues  was  primarily attributable to upgrade revenue generated by the release  of  Mathcad  7  for Windows in June 1997, new license revenue generated from  S-PLUS  4.0  released  in  September  1997, and to a lesser extent, S-PLUS service  revenue.  Mathcad  for Windows generated upgrade revenue of $680,000 during the six months ended  December  31,  1996  compared to upgrade revenue of $2,677,000 during the Transition  Period,  an  increase as a percentage of total revenues from 7.2% to 20.6%,  respectively.  Prior  to  the  release  of Mathcad 7 for Windows in June 1997,  the  Company's  last  significant  upgrade,  Mathcad 6.0 for Windows, was released  approximately  twenty-three  months earlier in July 1995 and therefore upgrade  revenue  was  much  lower  in  the  six months ended December 31, 1996. Worldwide  S-PLUS  product  line revenue increased 39.4% from $2,531,000 for the six  months  ended December 31, 1996 to $3,529,000 during the Transition Period, and  increased  as  a  percentage  of  total  revenues  from  26.7%  to  27.1%, respectively.   Worldwide  S-PLUS service revenue increased 167.7% from $269,000 in  the  six  months  ended  December 31, 1996 to $720,000 during the Transition Period,  and  increased  as  a  percentage  of total revenues from 2.8% to 5.5%, respectively.  Total  international revenues, attributable to all product lines, increased  20.9%  from  $3,182,000  in  1996 to $3,846,000 during the Transition Period,  and  decreased  as  a percentage of total revenues from 33.6% to 29.5%, respectively.  Total cost of revenues for the six-month period increased 27.0%, from $1,983,000 for  the  six months ended December 31, 1996 to $2,519,000 during the Transition Period,  and  decreased  as  a percentage of total revenues from 20.9% to 19.3%, respectively.  The  decrease  in total cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues  was primarily attributable to switching from disk to CD media with the release  of Mathcad 7 for Windows, thereby decreasing direct material costs on a per  unit  basis.  To  a lesser degree, fixed costs, such as licensing costs for the  "S"  language  used  in  the  S-PLUS  product  line and the amortization of purchased  technology,  decreased  as  a  percentage of total revenues due to an overall  higher  revenue base during the Transition Period.  Such decreases were partially  offset  by an increase in the inventory provision to adequately cover excess  inventory exposure and an increase in cost of services from $404,000 for the  six months ended December 31, 1996 to $702,000 during the Transition Period consistent  with  the  increase  in  service  revenue.  Sales  and marketing expenses increased 3.2%, from $5,007,000 for the six months ended  December  31,  1996  to  $5,169,000  during  the  Transition  Period, and decreased  as  a percentage of total revenues from 52.8% to 39.7%, respectively. The  increase  in  sales  and  marketing  expenses was primarily attributable to expenses incurred related to the launch of Mathcad 7 for Windows and S-PLUS 4.0, as  well  as  an  increase in S-PLUS domestic sales expenses incurred to support direct  sales  of  this  expanding  product  line.                                          22  Net  research and development expenses increased 18.4%,  from $2,378,000 for the six  months  ended December 31, 1996 to $2,816,000 during the Transition Period, and  decreased  as  a  percentage  of  total  revenues from 25.1% to 21.6%.  The increase  in  overall  net  research  and  development  expenses  was  primarily attributable  to  expenses  related  to development initiatives in the Company's Data  Analysis  Products  Division  and  additional  personnel  to  support such initiatives,  as  well as an increase in international product translation costs for Mathcad 7 French, German and Japanese. Funded research in the Company's Data Analysis  Products  Division  increased 1.9%, from $1,070,000 for the six months ended  December  31,  1996  to $1,090,000  for the six months ended December 31, 1997.  The increase in funded research is attributable to an increase in awarded contracts  and the related increase in personnel to fulfill those contracts. The Company's  Data  Analysis  Products  Division  research  department's  headcount increased  from  20  to  24  as  of  December  31,  1996  and December 31, 1997, respectively.  General  and  administrative  expenses increased 14.3% , from $1,241,000 for the six  months  ended  December 31, 1996 to $1,418,000 during the Transition Period and  decreased  as  a  percentage  of  total  revenues  from  13.1%  to  10.9%, respectively.  The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable  to costs incurred for management incentive compensation provisions based  primarily  on  the  achievement of profitability targets, and to a lesser extent,  to  fluctuations  in  international  exchange  rate  transactions.  Net  income  for  the  Transition  Period was $1,105,000 compared to net loss of $1,066,000  for  the  six  months ended December 31, 1996.  Improved performance from  the  refreshed  Mathcad  and  S-PLUS  product  lines  coupled  with margin improvements  all  contributed  to  this  improvement  in  profit.  Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources  Cash  and  cash equivalents, totaling $8,444,000 at December 31, 1999, increased $2,737,000  during  the  fiscal year ended December 31, 1999, from $5,707,000 at December 31, 1998.  The positive cash flow resulted primarily from cash provided by  operating  activities  of $2,808,000 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  of $1,134,000 which were offset by purchases of property, equipment and other  assets  of  $968,000.  The  Company  generated  $2,808,000 in cash from operating activities during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999.  The cash generated by operating activities was  primarily  attributable to net income of approximately $1,453,000, non-cash depreciation  and  amortization  charges,  and  an increase in deferred revenue, offset  by an increase in accounts receivable.  Accounts receivable and deferred revenue  increased  primarily  due to the growth in the Company's business.  The Company  used  $968,000 in investing activities primarily due to the purchase of $835,000  of  property  and  equipment.  Proceeds  generated  from capital lease obligations  and  equipment  financing  and  the  exercise  of  stock options of $467,000  and $1,134,000, respectively, were offset by payments on capital lease obligations  and  equipment  financing  of  $699,000.  The Company's financial reserves are represented by cash and cash equivalents as of  December  31,  1999.  The  Company  has  a  line  of credit agreement with a commercial  bank.  Borrowings under the line are limited to the lesser of 80% of eligible  domestic  accounts  or  $2,000,000  based  on  certain  profitability covenants.  Borrowings  are secured by substantially all of the Company's assets and  bear  interest  at  the  bank's  prime  rate plus 0.5%.  The line of credit contains  certain  restrictive  covenants,  including  minimum  amounts  of profitability,  equity, leverage and liquidity, all as defined in the agreement. There  were  no amounts outstanding under this line at December 31, 1999.   This line  expires  on  April  30,  2000.  As  of  December  31,  1999  the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $15.0 million and research and development credit carryforwards of $1.3 million. The  net  operating  loss  and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through  2013,  if  not used. Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, substantial  changes  in  the  Company's  ownership  may limit the amount of net operating  loss  carryforwards  that could be utilized annually in the future to offset  taxable  income.  A full valuation allowance has been established in our financial  statements to reflect the uncertainty of the Company's ability to use available  tax  loss  carryforwards  and  other  deferred  tax  assets.                                          23  Based  on  its planned investments in FreeScholarships.com, the Company believes its  financial  reserves  and  cash  flows  from  future  operations  may not be sufficient  to  meet  its  liquidity  requirements  for at least the next twelve months.  Therefore,  the Company anticipates one or more financing transactions, including  asset sales, bank borrowings, and sale of stock in either or both  of the  Company  and  its subsidiaries. However, if such financing is not available the Company has the ability to reduce its planned investment in FSC to ensure it meets  its  liquidity  requirements  for  the  next twelve months. The foregoing statement is forward-looking and involves risks and uncertainties, many of which are  outside  the  Company's control. The Company's actual experience may differ materially from that discussed above. Factors that might cause such a difference include,  but  are not limited to, those discussed in "Cautionary Statements" in this  Form  10-K  for  the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 as well as future events  that  have the effect of reducing the Company's available cash balances, such  as  unanticipated  operating  losses  or  capital  expenditures,  cash expenditures  related  to  possible  future  acquisitions,  or investment in new products  or  services.  The  Company  may  be  presented from time to time with acquisition  opportunities  that  require additional external financing, and the Company  may  from  time  to time seek to obtain additional funds from public or private  issuance of equity  or debt securities.  There can be no assurance that any  such  financing  will  be  available  at  all  or on terms favorable to the Company.  Recent  Accounting  Pronouncements  In  June  1999,  Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging  Activities-Deferral  of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which defers the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, issued  in  June  1998,  establishes  accounting  and  reporting  standards  for derivative  instruments,  including  certain  derivative instruments embedded in other  contracts, and hedging activities. It requires an entity to recognize all derivatives  as  either  assets  or  liabilities  in  the statement of financial position  and  measure  those  instruments  at  fair value. The Company does not expect  adoption  of  this  statement  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  its consolidated  position  or  operating  results.  In  December  1998, the AICPA issued Statement of Position 98-9, Modification of SOP  97-2 Software Revenue Recognition With Respect to Certain Transactions. SOP 98-9  requires  use  of  the  residual  method  of  recognition of revenues when vendor-specific  objective evidence exists for undelivered elements but does not exist  for  delivered  elements  of  a software arrangement. The Company will be required to comply with the provisions of SOP 98-9 for transactions entered into beginning  January  1,  2000.  The  Company does not expect adoption of SOP 98-9 will  have  a  material  impact  on its financial position or operating results.  In  December  1999,  the  Securities  and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, as amended by SAB 101(a), Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.  SAB  No.  101  is  effective  for the  second  quarter of all fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 1999.  Adoption  of  SAB  No. 101  is  not  expected  to have a material impact on the Company's  consolidated financial  position  or  results  of  operations.                                         24  ITEM  7A.  QUANTITATIVE  AND  QUALITATIVE  DISCLOSURES  ABOUT  MARKET  RISK       The  Company  develops  products  in  the  United  States  and  sells  them worldwide.  As  a  result,  the Company's financial results could be affected by factors  such  as  changes  in  foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. Since the Company's sales are currently priced in U.S.  dollars and translated into local currency amounts, a strengthening of the dollar could make the Company's products less competitive in foreign markets.The Company  operates  a  subsidiary  in  the  United  Kingdom which incurs expenses denominated  in  its  local  currency.  However, the Company believes that these operating  expenses  will  not  have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.  Interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level  of  U.S. interest rates, particularly since the company's investments are in  short-term  instruments  and the Company's available line of credit requires interest  payments calculated at variable rates. Based on the nature and current levels  of  the  Company's  investments  and debt, however, the Company believes that  there  is  no  material  market  risk  or  exposure.                The  Company's  general  investing  policy is to limit the risk of principal  loss  and  ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting credit and market risk. The Company currently places its investments in highly liquid money market  accounts  and short-term investments. All highly liquid investments with original  maturities  of  three  months  or  less  are  considered  to  be  cash equivalents.  ITEM  8.     FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  AND  SUPPLEMENTARY  DATA.
