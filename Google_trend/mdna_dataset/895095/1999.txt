ITEM  7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS.  In  December  1997,  the  Company  changed  its  fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31.  Accordingly, a six-month transition period ended December 31, 1997 is  included  below.  As  an  aid  to  understanding  the Company's operating results, the table below indicates  the  percentage relationships of income and expense items included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998  and the twelve months ended December 31, 1997 (unaudited), the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, the six months  ended  December  31,  1997  (the "Transition Period") and the six months ended  December  31,  1996,  the  two years ended June 30, 1997 and 1996 and the percentage  changes in those items for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998 and 1997 (unaudited), the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 and June 30, 1997, and  the  year  ended  June  30,  1997.                                                                                                       --------------Percentage Change--------------                                                                                             Fiscal      Transition   Fiscal - - ---------------------------------Percentage of Total Revenues---------------    Fiscal     Year Ended   Period (1)  Year Ended                            Fiscal                                             Year Ended   Dec 31,1998  compared to June 30,1997                             Year    Year             Six Months  Fiscal Year  Dec 31, 1998  compared to  Six Months compared to                             Ended   Ended                Ended       Ended      compared to    Fiscal      Ended       Fiscal                             Dec 31, Dec 31, Transition  Dec 31,     June 30     Year Ended   Year Ended   Dec 31,     Year Ended                               1998    1997     Period     1996    1997    1996  Dec 31, 1997 June 30,1997   1996     June 30,1996                             ------  ------  -------  ------  ------  ------  --------  --------------    ------     --------                      Revenues:                        (unaudited)        (unaudited)   Software licenses. . . .   85.2%   85.0%    85.4%      87.2%   85.9%   87.4%     15.5%        37.3%      34.6%      -16.4%   Services and other . . .   14.8%   15.0%    14.6%      12.8%   14.1%   12.6%     13.3%        44.4%      56.5%       -4.3%                             ------  ------  -------     ------  ------  ------  --------  --------------  ------    --------       Total revenues . . .  100.0%  100.0%   100.0%     100.0%  100.0%  100.0%     15.2%        38.3%      37.4%      -14.9%  Cost of Revenues:   Software licenses. . . .   12.1%   16.0%    14.0%      16.7%   17.7%   14.7%    -12.8%        -5.1%      15.1%        2.0%   Services and other . . .    5.3%    5.1%     5.4%       4.3%    4.6%    4.5%     18.3%        56.0%      73.8%      -12.4%                             ------  ------  -------     ------  ------  ------  --------  --------------  ------     --------      Total cost of revenues  17.4%   21.1%    19.3%      20.9%   22.3%   19.3%     -5.3%         7.6%      27.0%       -1.4%       Gross profit. . . . . . 82.6%   78.9%    80.7%      79.1%   77.7%   80.7%     20.7%        47.1%      40.2%      -18.1%  Operating Expenses:   Sales and marketing. . . . 42.4%   49.1%    39.7%      52.8%   58.0%   46.8%     -0.5%         1.1%       3.2%        5.5%   Research and development . 20.3%   26.3%    21.6%      25.1%   29.1%   17.6%    -11.1%        -3.5%      18.4%       40.5%   General and administrative 11.1%   13.7%    10.9%      13.1%   15.5%   11.8%     -6.7%        -0.7%      14.3%       11.3%                             ------  ------  -------     ------  ------  ------  --------      --------------  ------  --------      Total operating expenses.73.8%   89.1%    72.2%      91.0%  102.5%   76.2%     -4.6%           -0.5%    9.0%       14.5%  Income(loss) from operations. 8.8%  -10.2%     8.5%     -11.9%  -24.9%    4.5%    200.0%          149.2%    9.0%     -570.9%  Interest income(expense),net  0.4%    0.4%     0.2%       0.8%    0.8%    0.9%      3.8%          -40.8%  -73.8%      -27.7%                             ------  ------  -------     ------  ------  ------  --------   --------------  ------    --------  Income (loss) before provision   for income taxes . . . . .  9.2%   -9.8%     8.5%     -11.%  -24.1%    5.4%     207.7%           152.7%    9.8%    -478.2%  Provision for income taxes .  0.1%    0.2%     0.1%       0.2%    0.3%    0.2%    -51.1%           -48.3%   20.0%       -9.7%                             ------  ------  -------     ------  ------  ------  --------   --------------  ------    --------  Net Income (loss) . . .  .    9.1%  -10.0%     8.5%     -11.3%  -24.4%    5.2%    204.2%          151.6%    9.8%     -499.7%                             ======  ======  =======     ======  ======  ======  ========       ==========  ======    ========    (1)  The  Company  changed  its  fiscal  year  from June 30 to December 31.  The Transition Period represents the six month       period  from  July  1,  1997  -  December  31,  1997.      Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 1998 Compared to the Twelve Months Ended December 31,  1997  (unaudited)  Total  revenues  increased  15.2%  from  $21,224,000 for the twelve months ended December  31,  1997  to $24,447,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998. The  increase  in  total  revenues  was  primarily attributable to worldwide new license  and upgrade revenue generated by the Company's Mathcad product line, as well  as new license and service revenue generated from the S-PLUS product line.  Worldwide  Mathcad product line revenues increased 11.9% from $13,947,000 in the twelve  months  ended  December 31, 1997 to $15,606,000 during the twelve months ended  December  31,  1998, but decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 65.7%  to  63.8%  for  the  twelve  months  ended  December  31,  1997 and 1998, respectively.  The  increase in Mathcad product line revenue is due primarily to the release of Mathcad 8 (released in September 1998) and Mathcad 7 (released in June  1997).  To  a  lesser  extent, this increase is also due to the release of StudyWorks  II  in  March  1998.  Worldwide  S-PLUS  license and service revenue increased  21.5% from $7,277,000 in the twelve months ended December 31, 1997 to $8,841,000  during the twelve months ended December 31, 1998, and increased as a percentage of total revenues from 34.3% to 36.2%, respectively.  The increase in S-PLUS  product  line revenue is primarily attributable to the release of S-PLUS 4.5  (released  in May 1998) and S-PLUS 4.0 (released in September 1997).  Total international  revenues,  attributable to all product lines, increased 3.2% from $6,682,000 in 1997 to $6,897,000 in 1998, and decreased as a percentage of total revenues  from  31.5%  to  28.2%,  respectively.  Total  cost  of  revenues  decreased  5.3% from $4,482,000 for the twelve months ended  December  31,  1997 to $4,246,000 during the twelve months ended December 31,  1998,  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 21.1% to 17.4%, respectively.  The  decrease  in total cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues  was primarily attributable to switching from disk to CD media with the release  of Mathcad 7 for Windows, thereby decreasing direct material costs on a per  unit  basis.  Sales  and marketing expenses for the twelve-months ended December 31, 1997 were $10,413,000  and  remained  relatively consistent as compared to $10,364,000 for the  fiscal year ended December 31, 1998, and decreased as a percentage of total revenues  from  49.1%  to  42.4%,  respectively.  Research and development expenses decreased 11.1% from $5,581,000 for the twelve months  ended  December  31,  1997  to  $4,964,000  during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998, and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 26.3% to 20.3%,  respectively.  The  decrease  in  research  and development expenses was primarily  attributable  to  a  decrease  in  consulting  costs  associated with development  initiatives in the Company's Data Analysis Products Division and an increase  in  research  contribution.  General  and  administrative  expenses  decreased  6.7%  from $2,909,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1997 to $2,713,000 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998, and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 13.7% to 11.1%,  respectively.  The  decrease  in  overall  general  and  administrative expenses was primarily attributable to decreases in foreign currency transaction losses.  Net  income  for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 was $2,220,000 compared to  a  net  loss  of  $2,129,000  for the twelve months ended December 31, 1997. Improved  performance  from  the  recently  refreshed Mathcad and S-PLUS product line,  coupled  with  margin  improvements  and  management control of operating expenses  contributed  to  this  improvement  in  profit.    Fiscal  Year Ended December 31, 1998 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1997  Total revenues increased 38.3% from $17,678,000 for the twelve months ended June 30,  1997  to  $24,447,000  for  the  fiscal year ended December 31, 1998.  This increase  in  total revenues was primarily attributable to worldwide new license and upgrade revenue generated by the Mathcad product line as well as new license and  service  revenue  generated  from  the  S-PLUS  product  line.  Worldwide  Mathcad  product  line  sales increased 31.7% from $11,850,000 in the twelve  months  ended  June 30, 1997 to $15,606,000 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998, but decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 67.0% to 63.8%,  respectively.  The  twelve  months ended December 31, 1998 had increased revenue  associated  with  Mathcad  8 (released in September 1998) and Mathcad 7 (released  in June 1997).  Worldwide S-PLUS product line revenue increased 51.7% from  $5,828,000  in  the twelve months ended June 30, 1997 to $8,841,000 during the  fiscal year ended December 31, 1998, and increased as a percentage of total revenues  from  33.0% to 36.2%, respectively.  S-PLUS product line had increased license  and  services revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 due to the  release  of  S-PLUS  4.5 (released in May 1998) and S-PLUS 4.0 (released in September  1997).  Total  international  revenues,  attributable  to all product lines,  increased  14.6%  from  $6,017,000  in  1997  to $6,897,000 in 1998, and decreased  as  a percentage of total revenues from 34.0% to 28.2%, respectively.  Total  cost  of  revenues  increased  7.6% from $3,946,000 for the twelve months ended  June  30,  1997  to  $4,246,000 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998,  and  decreased  as  a  percentage  of total revenues from 22.3% to 17.4%, respectively.  The  decrease  in total cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues  was primarily attributable to switching from disk to CD media with the release  of Mathcad 7 for Windows, thereby decreasing direct material costs on a per  unit  basis.  Sales  and  marketing  expenses  for  the twelve-months ended June 30, 1997 were $10,251,000  and  remained relatively consistent compared to $10,364,000 for the fiscal  year  ended  December  31,  1998, but decreased as a percentage of total revenues  from  58.0%  to  42.4%,  respectively.  Research  and development expenses decreased 3.5% from $5,143,000 for the twelve months  ended  June 30, 1997 to $4,964,000 during the fiscal year ended December 31,  1998,  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 29.1% to 20.3%. The  decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to a  decrease  in  consulting costs associated with development initiatives in the Company's  Data  Analysis  Products  Division  and  an  increase  in  research contribution.  General and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997 were $2,732,000  and remained consistent at $2,713,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 1998, and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 15.5% to 11.1%,  respectively.  The  consistency  in  expenditures  and  reduction  as  a percentage  of  total  revenues  was due to management efforts to control costs.  Net  income  for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 was $2,220,000 compared to  net  loss of $4,300,000 for the twelve months ended June 30, 1997.  Improved performance from the recently refreshed Mathcad and S-PLUS product lines coupled with  margin  improvements  contributed  to  this  increase  in  profit.           Transition Period Ended December 31, 1997 Compared to the Six-Month Period Ended December  31,  1996  (unaudited)  Total revenues increased 37.4% from $9,478,000 for the six months ended December 31,  1996  to  $13,024,000 during the Transition Period.  This increase in total revenues  was primarily attributable to upgrade revenue generated by the release of Mathcad 7 for Windows in June 1997, new license revenue generated from S-PLUS 4.0  released in September 1997, and to a lesser extent, S-PLUS service revenue.  Mathcad  for Windows generated upgrade revenue of $680,000 during the six months ended  December  31,  1996  compared to upgrade revenue of $2,677,000 during the Transition  Period,  an  increase as a percentage of total revenues from 7.2% to 20.6%,  respectively.  Prior  to  the  release  of Mathcad 7 for Windows in June 1997,  the  Company's  last  significant  upgrade,  Mathcad 6.0 for Windows, was released  approximately  twenty-three  months earlier in July 1995 and therefore upgrade  revenue  was  much  lower  in  the  six months ended December 31, 1996. Worldwide  S-PLUS  product  line revenue increased 39.4% from $2,531,000 for the six  months  ended December 31, 1996 to $3,529,000 during the Transition Period, and  increased  as  a  percentage  of  total  revenues  from  26.7%  to  27.1%, respectively.   Worldwide  S-PLUS service revenue increased 167.7% from $269,000 in  the  six  months  ended  December 31, 1996 to $720,000 during the Transition Period,  and  increased  as  a  percentage  of total revenues from 2.8% to 5.5%, respectively.  Total  international revenues, attributable to all product lines, increased  20.9%  from  $3,182,000  in  1996 to $3,846,000 during the Transition Period,  and  decreased  as  a percentage of total revenues from 33.6% to 29.5%, respectively.  Total  cost of revenues for the six-month period increased 27.0% from $1,983,000 for  the  six months ended December 31, 1996 to $2,519,000 during the Transition Period,  and  decreased  as  a percentage of total revenues from 20.9% to 19.3%, respectively.  The  decrease  in total cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues  was primarily attributable to switching from disk to CD media with the release  of Mathcad 7 for Windows, thereby decreasing direct material costs on a per  unit  basis.  To  a lesser degree, fixed costs, such as licensing costs for the  "S"  language  used  in  the  S-PLUS  product  line and the amortization of purchased  technology,  decreased  as  a  percentage of total revenues due to an overall  higher  revenue base during the Transition Period.  Such decreases were partially  offset by an increase in the inventory provision  to adequately cover excess  inventory exposure and an increase in cost of services from $404,000 for the  six months ended December 31, 1996 to $702,000 during the Transition Period consistent  with  the  increase  in  service  revenue.  Sales  and  marketing expenses increased 3.2% from $5,007,000 for the six months ended  December  31,  1996  to  $5,169,000  during  the  Transition  Period, and decreased  as  a percentage of total revenues from 52.8% to 39.7%, respectively. The  increase  in  sales  and  marketing  expenses was primarily attributable to expenses incurred related to the launch of Mathcad 7 for Windows and S-PLUS 4.0, as  well  as  an  increase in S-PLUS domestic sales expenses incurred to support direct  sales  of  this  expanding  product  line.  Research  and  development  expenses increased 18.4% from $2,378,000 for the six months  ended  December 31, 1996 to $2,816,000 during the Transition Period, and decreased  as  a percentage of total revenues from 25.1% to 21.6%.  The increase in  overall  research  and  development  expenses  was primarily attributable to expenses  related  to  development  initiatives  in  the Company's Data Analysis Products  Division and additional personnel to support such initiatives, as well as  an increase in international product translation costs for Mathcad 7 French, German  and  Japanese.    General  and administrative expenses increased 14.3% from $1,241,000 for the six months  ended  December  31, 1996 to $1,418,000 during the Transition Period and decreased  as  a percentage of total revenues from 13.1% to 10.9%, respectively. The  increase  in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to  costs  incurred  for  management  incentive  compensation  provisions  based primarily  on  the achievement of profitability targets, and to a lesser extent, to  fluctuations  in  international  exchange  rate  transactions.  Net  income  for  the  Transition  Period was $1,105,000 compared to net loss of $1,066,000  for  the  six  months ended December 31, 1996.  Improved performance from  the  refreshed  Mathcad  and  S-PLUS  product  lines  coupled  with margin improvements  all  contributed  to  this  improvement  in  profit.  Fiscal  Year  Ended  June  30,  1997 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1996  Total  revenues  decreased 14.9% from $20,767,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30,  1996 ("Fiscal 1996") to $17,678,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997 ("Fiscal 1997").  The decrease in total revenues was primarily attributable to a worldwide  decrease  in  both  new  license and upgrade revenue generated by the Company's  core product, Mathcad for Windows, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in  sales of Electronic Books, which work with Mathcad, and a decrease in S-PLUS product line and services revenue.  The decrease in total revenues was partially offset  by  revenue  generated  by  the  release of Mathcad 6.0 for Macintosh in November  1996,  revenue  generated  by the StudyWorks! product line released in June  1996  and  revenue  generated  from  the Axum product line acquired in the second  quarter  of  Fiscal  1996.      Mathcad  for  Windows  generated  upgrade  revenue  of $4,287,000 in Fiscal 1996 compared  to  upgrade  revenue  of  $1,388,000  in  Fiscal 1997, a decrease as a percentage  of  total  revenues  from 20.6% to 7.9%, respectively.  Prior to the release  of  Mathcad  7 for Windows in June 1997, the Company's last significant upgrade, Mathcad 6.0 for Windows, was released approximately twenty-three months earlier  during  the  fiscal  year  ended  June  30, 1995, and its upgrade cycle therefore  came  to  a  close  in  Fiscal  1997.  Worldwide  Mathcad for Windows non-upgrade revenue decreased 13.8% from $7,377,000 in Fiscal 1996 to $6,359,000 in  Fiscal  1997  due  primarily  to  the  Company's  distribution  channel's anticipation  of  the delivery of the next major release of Mathcad for Windows, Mathcad  7 for Windows, and decreasing sell-through of the older Mathcad 6.0 for Windows  release.  Worldwide  S-PLUS product line and services revenue decreased 8.7%  from $5,904,000 in Fiscal 1996 to $5,389,000 in Fiscal 1997, and increased as  a  percentage  of  total  revenues  from  28.4%  to 30.5%, respectively. The decrease  in  S-PLUS  product  line  and  services revenue was attributable to a reduction in license revenue, due to a material shift from UNIX license sales to lower  priced  Windows  license sales, and to the discontinuance of unprofitable S-PLUS  services revenue.  Moreover, the product line reached its fourth year of life  without a major new release, resulting in sluggish new license sales prior to  the  delivery of S-PLUS 4.0 in September 1997.  Revenues attributable to the Axum  product  line  acquired  in  the TriMetrix, Inc. acquisition accounted for $676,000,  or  3.3% of total revenues, in Fiscal 1996 compared to $1,023,000, or 5.8%  of  total  revenues,  in  Fiscal  1997.  Total  international  revenues attributable  to  sales  of  all  Company  product  lines  decreased  10.9% from $6,756,000  in  Fiscal  1996  to  $6,018,000  in Fiscal 1997, and increased as a percentage  of  total  revenues  from  32.5%  to  34.0%,  respectively.    Total  cost  of  revenues  decreased  1.4%  from  $4,000,000  in  Fiscal 1996 to $3,946,000  in Fiscal 1997, and increased as a percentage of total revenues from 19.3%  to  22.3%,  respectively.  The  increase  in  total cost of revenues as a percentage  of  total  revenues  was  primarily  attributable  to a reduction of inventory  reserves  in  Fiscal  1996 based on an evaluation of actual inventory exposure and reserve requirements.  In contrast, the Company increased inventory reserves  in  Fiscal  1997  to  adequately cover inventory exposure in the sales distribution  channel  as the Company prepared to release its next major upgrade of  Mathcad,  Mathcad 7 for Windows.  In addition, fixed licensing costs for the "S"  language used in the S-PLUS product line increased in Fiscal 1997 per terms of  the  license  agreement  and  other fixed costs, such as the amortization of purchased  technology,  increased  as  a  percentage  of  total  revenues  by approximately  1.5%  due  to  an  overall  lower  revenue  base  in Fiscal 1997.  Sales  and  marketing  expenses increased 5.5% from $9,719,000 in Fiscal 1996 to $10,251,000 in Fiscal 1997, and increased as a percentage of total revenues from 46.8%  to  58.0%,  respectively.  The  increase  in  overall sales and marketing expenses  was  attributable to marketing expenses incurred related to the Fiscal 1997 launch of the StudyWorks! product line, Mathcad 6.0 for Macintosh and, most recently,  Mathcad  7  for Windows, as well as to an increase in S-PLUS domestic sales  expenses  as  the Company reorganized its sales infrastructure to support direct  sales  into  this  expanding  product  line.  International  sales  and marketing  expenses  increased 3.8% from $2,285,000 in Fiscal 1996 to $2,372,000 in  Fiscal  1997.  Research and development expenses increased 40.6% from $3,659,000 in Fiscal 1996 to  $5,143,000  in  Fiscal 1997, and increased as a percentage of total revenues from  17.6% to 29.1%.  The increase in overall research and development expenses was  primarily  attributable  to  increased  personnel  and  consulting  costs associated  with  the  continued expansion and development of the S-PLUS product line,  specifically related to the first release of StatServer in April 1997 and the  impending  release  of  S-PLUS  4.0  in  September  1997.  General  and  administrative  expenses increased 11.3% from $2,455,000 in Fiscal 1996  to  $2,732,000  in  Fiscal  1997  and  increased  as a percentage of total revenues from 11.8% to 15.5%, respectively.  The increase in overall general and administrative  expenses  was  primarily  attributable  to  fluctuations  in international  exchange  rate  transactions.  The Company recorded exchange rate losses of $12,000 in Fiscal 1996 compared to exchange rate losses of $257,000 in Fiscal  1997.  Net  loss for Fiscal 1997 was $4,300,000 compared to net income of $1,076,000 in Fiscal  1996.  Fiscal  1997  reflected  a  year of investment for the Company as evidenced  by  its commitment to strategic development initiatives, most notably in  the  Company's Data Analysis Products Division.  The release of new products with  new  product  cycles  will  support renewed growth in both the Mathcad and S-PLUS  product  lines.    Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources  Cash  and  cash equivalents, totaling $5,707,000 at December 31, 1998, increased $1,573,000  during  the  fiscal year ended December 31, 1998, from $4,134,000 at December 31, 1997.  The positive cash flow resulted primarily from cash provided by  operating  activities  of $2,163,000 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  of  $369,000  which were offset by purchases of property, equipment and other  assets  of  $1,098,000.      The  Company  generated  $2,163,000 in cash from operating activities during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998.  The cash generated by operating activities was  primarily  attributable to net income of approximately $2,220,000, non-cash depreciation  and  amortization  charges,  and  an increase in deferred revenue, offset  by an increase in accounts receivable.  Accounts receivable and deferred revenue  increased  primarily  due to the growth in the Company's business.  The Company used $1,098,000 in investing activities primarily due to the purchase of $624,000  of  property  and  equipment,  and  the purchase of certain intangible assets  for  $382,000.  Proceeds  generated  from  capital lease obligations and equipment  financing and the exercise of stock options of $815,000 and $369,000, respectively, were offset by payments on capital lease obligations and equipment financing  of  $641,000.  The Company's financial reserves are represented by cash and cash equivalents as of  December  31,  1998.  The  Company  has  a  line  of credit agreement with a commercial  bank.  Borrowings under the line are limited to the lesser of 65% of eligible  domestic  accounts  or  $1,000,000  based  on  certain  profitability covenants.  Borrowings  are secured by substantially all of the Company's assets and bear interest at the bank's prime rate plus 1%.  The line of credit contains certain  restrictive  covenants,  including  minimum  amounts  of profitability, equity,  leverage and liquidity, all as defined in the agreement.  There were no amounts  outstanding  under  this  line  at  December  31, 1998.   This line was renewed  on  February  24,  1999 and now expires on April 30, 2000.   Borrowings under  this  renewed  line are limited to the lesser of 80% of eligible domestic accounts or $2,000,000 based on certain profitability covenants.  Borrowings are secured  by  substantially  all of the Company's assets and bear interest at the bank's  prime  rate  plus  0.5%.  The  Company  believes  its  financial  reserves  and  cash  flows  from  future operations  will  be  sufficient to meet its liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.  The foregoing statement is forward-looking and involves risks  and  uncertainties,  many of which are outside the Company's control. The Company's  actual  experience  may  differ materially from that discussed above. Factors  that  might  cause  such  a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed in "Cautionary Statements" in this Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended  December  31,  1998  as  well  as  future  events that have the effect of reducing  the Company's available cash balances, such as unanticipated operating losses  or  capital  expenditures,  cash expenditures related to possible future acquisitions,  or  investment  in  new products or services.  The Company may be presented  from  time  to  time  with  acquisition  opportunities  that  require additional  external  financing,  and  the Company may from time to time seek to obtain  additional  funds  from  public  or  private  issuance of equity or debt securities.  There can be no assurance that any such financing will be available at  all  or  on  terms  favorable  to  the  Company.     Year  2000  Readiness  Disclosure  Statement   Many  currently  installed  computer  systems and software products are coded to accept  only  two  digit entries in the date code field.  These date code fields will  need  to  accept four digit entries to distinguish 21st century dates from 20th  century dates.  As a result, many companies' software and computer systems may  need  to  be  upgraded or replaced in order to comply with such "Year 2000" requirements.  MathSoft  is in the process of evaluating and correcting the Year 2000  compliance  of  its  proprietary  products  and  services  and third party equipment  and  software that it uses, as well as its non-information technology systems,  such  as  building  security,  voice  mail  and  other  systems.  The Company's Year 2000 compliance efforts consist of the following phases:  (i) identification  of  all  software  products,  information technology systems and non-information  technology  systems;  (ii)  assessment of repair or replacement requirements; (iii) repair or replacement; (iv) testing; (v) implementation; and (vi)  creation  of  contingency  plans  in the event of Year 2000 failures.  The Company  has  completed  phase  (i) and has substantially completed phase  (ii). The Company expects to substantially complete phase(iii) by June 1999 and phases (iv),  (v)  and  (vi)  of  its  Year  2000 compliance efforts by September 1999.  To  date,  the  Company  has not incurred any material expenditure in connection with  identifying  or  evaluating  Year  2000  compliance  issues.  Preliminary estimates  regarding  expected  costs  to MathSoft for evaluating and correcting Year  2000  issues are in the range of $450,000 to $850,000, but there can be no assurance  that  the  costs  will  not  exceed  such  amounts.  The  Company's expectations regarding Year 2000 remediation efforts will evolve as it continues to  analyze and correct its systems.  The Company has not yet developed a formal Year  2000-specific  contingency  plan.  The  Company expects that a formal Year 2000  contingency  plan  will  evolve  as  it completes its Year 2000 compliance efforts.  Failure by the Company to resolve Year 2000 issues with respect to its products  and  services  could  have  a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operation and financial condition.  Furthermore, failure of third-party  equipment  or software to operate properly with regards to the year 2000  and  thereafter  could require MathSoft to incur significant unanticipated expenses  to  remedy  any  problems.
