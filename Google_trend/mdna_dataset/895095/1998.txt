ITEM  7.         MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS.  As  an  aid  to  understanding  the Company's operating results, the table below indicates  the  percentage relationships of income and expense items included in the  Consolidated Statements of Operations for the six months ended December 31, 1997 (the  "Transition  Period") and the six months ended December 31, 1996, the three  years  ended  June 30, 1997 and the percentage changes in those items for six  months  ended  December  31, 1997 and 1996 and the two years ended June 30, 1997.

The Transition Period represents the  six  month period  from  July  1,  1997  -  December  31,  1997.  *  Not  meaningful.    Transition  Period  Ended  December  31,  1997 Compared to the Six-Month Period Ended  December  31,  1996   Total revenues for the Transition Period increased 37.4% from $9,478,000 for the six  months ended December 31, 1996 to $13,024,000 during the Transition Period. This  increase  in  total revenues was primarily attributable to upgrade revenue generated  by  the  recent  release  of  Mathcad 7 for Windows in June 1997, new license  revenue  generated  from SPLUS-4.0 released in September 1997, and to a lesser  extent,  SPLUS  service  revenue.  Mathcad  for  Windows  generated  upgrade revenue of $680,000 for the six months ended  December  31,  1996  compared to upgrade revenue of $2,677,000 during the Transition  Period,  an  increase as a percentage of total revenues from 7.2% to 20.6%,  respectively.    Prior  to  the release of Mathcad 7 for Windows in June 1997,  the  Company's  last  significant  upgrade,  Mathcad 6.0 for Windows, was released  approximately  twenty-three  months earlier in July 1995 and therefore upgrade  revenue  was  much  lower  in  the  six months ended December 31, 1996. Worldwide  S-PLUS  product  line revenue increased 39.4% from $2,531,000 for the six  months  ended December 31, 1996 to $3,529,000 during the Transition Period, and  increased  as  a  percentage  of  total  revenues  from  26.7%  to  27.1%, respectively.    Worldwide S-PLUS service revenue increased 167.7% from $269,000 in  the  six  months  ended  December 31, 1996 to $720,000 during the Transition Period,  and  increased  as  a  percentage  of total revenues from 2.8% to 5.5%, respectively.  Total international revenues attributable to sales of all Company product  lines increased 20.9% from $3,182,000 for the six months ended December 31,  1996  to  $3,846,000  during  the  Transition  Period,  and  decreased as a percentage  of  total  revenues  from  33.6%  to  29.5%,  respectively.  Total  cost of revenues for the six-month period increased 27.0% from $1,983,000 for  the  six months ended December 31, 1996 to $2,519,000 during the Transition Period,  and  decreased  as  a percentage of total revenues from 20.9% to 19.3%, respectively.    The decrease in total cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues  was primarily attributable to switching from disk to CD media with the release  of Mathcad 7 for Windows, thereby decreasing direct material costs on a per  unit  basis.   To a lesser degree, fixed costs, such as licensing costs for the  "S"  language  used  in  the  S-PLUS  product  line and the amortization of purchased  technology,  decreased  as  a  percentage of total revenues due to an overall  higher  revenue base during the Transition Period.  Such decreases were partially offset by increased inventory reserves during the Transition Period to adequately  cover  inventory  exposure  in the sales distribution channel and an increase in cost of services from $404,000 for the six months ended December 31, 1996  to  $702,000  during  the Transition Period due to the increase in service revenue.  Sales  and  marketing  expenses  for  the  six-month  period increased 3.2% from $5,007,000  for  the six months ended December 31, 1996 to $5,169,000 during the Transition Period, and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 52.8% to 39.7%,  respectively.   The increase in overall sales and marketing expenses was primarily  attributable  to expenses incurred related to the launch of Mathcad 7 for  Windows  and  S-PLUS  4.0,  as well as an increase in S-PLUS domestic sales expenses  incurred  to  support  direct  sales  of  this expanding product line.  Research  and development expenses for the six-month period increased 18.4% from $2,378,000  for  the six months ended December 31, 1996 to $2,816,000 during the Transition Period, and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 25.1% to 21.6%.   The increase in overall research and development expenses was primarily attributable  to  expenses  related  to development initiatives in the Company's Data  Analysis  Products  Division  and  additional  personnel  to  support such initiatives,  as  well as an increase in international product translation costs for  Mathcad  7  French,  German  and  Japanese.   General  and  administrative  expenses  for the six-month period increased 14.3% from  $1,241,000 for the six months ended December 31, 1996 to $1,418,000 during the Transition Period and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 13.1% to  10.9%,  respectively.    The  increase in overall general and administrative expenses  was  primarily attributable to costs incurred for management incentive compensation  provisions  based  primarily  on  the achievement of profitability targets,  and to a lesser extent, to fluctuations in international exchange rate transactions.  Net  income  for  the  Transition  Period was $1,105,000 compared to net loss of $1,066,000  for  the  six  months ended December 31, 1996.  Improved performance from the recently refreshed Mathcad and S-PLUS product lines coupled with margin improvements  all  contributed  to  this  improvement  in  profit.      Fiscal  Year  Ended  June  30,  1997 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1996   Total  revenues  decreased 14.9% from $20,767,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30,  1996 ("Fiscal 1996") to $17,678,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997 ("Fiscal 1997").  The decrease in total revenues was primarily attributable to a worldwide  decrease in both new license revenue and upgrade revenue generated by the  Company's  core  product,  Mathcad  for  Windows, and to a lesser extent, a decrease  in  sales of Electronic Books, which work with Mathcad, and a decrease in S-PLUS product line and services revenue.  The decrease in total revenues was partially  offset  by  revenue  generated  by  the  release  of  Mathcad 6.0 for Macintosh  in  November  1996, revenue generated by the StudyWorks! product line released  in June 1996 and revenue generated from the Axum product line acquired in  the  second  quarter  of  Fiscal  1996.  Mathcad  for  Windows  generated  upgrade  revenue  of $4,287,000 in Fiscal 1996 compared  to  upgrade  revenue  of  $1,388,000  in  Fiscal 1997, a decrease as a percentage  of  total  revenues  from 20.6% to 7.9%, respectively.  Prior to the release  of  Mathcad  7 for Windows in June 1997, the Company's last significant upgrade, Mathcad 6.0 for Windows, was released approximately twenty-three months earlier  during  July  1995,  and its upgrade cycle therefore came to a close in Fiscal  1997.  Worldwide Mathcad for Windows non-upgrade revenue decreased 13.8% from $7,377,000 in Fiscal 1996 to $6,359,000 in Fiscal 1997 due primarily to the Company's  distribution channel's anticipation of the delivery of the next major release  of  Mathcad  for  Windows,  Mathcad  7  for  Windows,  and  decreasing sell-through  of  the  older  Mathcad 6.0 for Windows release.  Worldwide S-PLUS product  line and services revenue decreased 8.7% from $5,904,000 in Fiscal 1996 to  $5,389,000  in  Fiscal 1997, and increased as a percentage of total revenues from  28.4%  to  30.5%,  respectively.  The  decrease in S-PLUS product line and services  revenue  was  attributable to a reduction in license revenue, due to a material  shift  from  UNIX license sales to lower priced Windows license sales, and  to  the  discontinuance of unprofitable S-PLUS services revenue.  Moreover, the  product  line  reached  its fourth year of life without a major new release resulting  in  sluggish new license sales prior to the delivery of S-PLUS 4.0 in the  Transition Period.  Revenues attributable to the Axum product line acquired in  the  TriMetrix,  Inc.  acquisition  accounted for $676,000, or 3.3% of total revenues,  in  Fiscal 1996 compared to $1,023,000, or 5.8% of total revenues, in Fiscal  1997.  Total international revenues attributable to sales of all Company product  lines  decreased  10.9% from $6,756,000 in Fiscal 1996 to $6,018,000 in Fiscal  1997,  and  increased  as  a  percentage of total revenues from 32.5% to 34.0%,  respectively.  Total  cost  of  revenues  decreased  1.4%  from  $4,000,000  in  Fiscal 1996 to $3,946,000  in Fiscal 1997, and increased as a percentage of total revenues from 19.3%  to  22.3%,  respectively.    The  increase in total cost of revenues as a percentage  of  total  revenues  was  primarily  attributable  to a reduction of inventory  reserves  in  Fiscal  1996 based on an evaluation of actual inventory exposure and reserve requirements.  In contrast, the Company increased inventory reserves  in  Fiscal  1997  to  adequately cover inventory exposure in the sales distribution  channel  as the Company prepared to release its next major upgrade of  Mathcad,  Mathcad 7 for Windows.  In addition, fixed licensing costs for the "S"  language used in the S-PLUS product line increased in Fiscal 1997 per terms of  the  license  agreement  and  other fixed costs, such as the amortization of purchased  technology,  increased  as  a  percentage  of  total  revenues  by approximately  1.51%  due  to  an  overall  lower  revenue  base in Fiscal 1997.   Sales  and  marketing  expenses increased 5.5% from $9,719,000 in Fiscal 1996 to $10,251,000 in Fiscal 1997, and increased as a percentage of total revenues from 46.8%  to  58.0%,  respectively.  The  increase  in  overall sales and marketing expenses  was  attributable to marketing expenses incurred related to the Fiscal 1997 launch of the StudyWorks! product line, Mathcad 6.0 for Macintosh and, most recently,  Mathcad  7  for Windows, as well as to an increase in S-PLUS domestic sales  expenses  as  the Company reorganized its sales infrastructure to support direct  sales  into  this  expanding  product  line.    International  sales and marketing  expenses  increased 3.8% from $2,285,000 in Fiscal 1996 to $2,372,000 in  Fiscal  1997.  Research and development expenses increased 40.6% from $3,659,000 in Fiscal 1996 to  $5,143,000  in  Fiscal 1997, and increased as a percentage of total revenues from  17.6% to 29.1%.  The increase in overall research and development expenses was  primarily  attributable  to  increased  personnel  and  consulting  costs associated  with  the  continued expansion and development of the S-PLUS product line, specifically related to the first release of StatServer in April, 1997 and the  impending  release  of  S-PLUS  4.0  during  the  Transition  Period.  General  and  administrative  expenses increased 11.3% from $2,455,000 in Fiscal 1996  to  $2,732,000  in  Fiscal  1997  and  increased  as a percentage of total revenues from 11.8% to 15.5%, respectively.  The increase in overall general and administrative  expenses  was  primarily  attributable  to  fluctuations  in international  exchange  rate  transactions.  The Company recorded exchange rate losses of $12,000 in Fiscal 1996 compared to exchange rate losses of $257,000 in Fiscal  1997.  Net  loss for Fiscal 1997 was $4,300,000 compared to net income of $1,076,000 in Fiscal  1996.    Fiscal  1997  reflected a year of investment for the Company as evidenced  by  its commitment to strategic development initiatives, most notably in  the  Company's Data Analysis Products Division.  The release of new products with  new  product  cycles  will  support renewed growth in both the Mathcad and S-PLUS  product  lines.   Fiscal  Year  Ended  June  30,  1996 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1995   Total  revenues  increased 30.7% from $15,883,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30,  1995  ("Fiscal 1995") to $20,767,000 in Fiscal 1996.  The increase in total revenues  was primarily attributable to an increase in worldwide Mathcad product line licenses, an increase in worldwide S-PLUS product line and services revenue and  revenue generated from the Axum product line acquired in the second quarter of  Fiscal  1996.  The  release  of  Mathcad  6.0  in July 1995 supported a 129% worldwide  increase in Mathcad upgrade revenue from $1,873,000 in Fiscal 1995 to $4,287,000  in  Fiscal  1996.  Mathcad  upgrade  revenue  also  increased  as  a percentage  of total revenues from 11.8% in Fiscal 1995 to 20.6% in Fiscal 1996. The  Company's last significant upgrade, Mathcad 5.0, was released approximately eighteen  months  earlier  during  January 1994, and its upgrade cycle therefore came  to  a  close  in  Fiscal 1995.  Worldwide Mathcad non-upgrade product line sales  increased  18.3%  from  $6,236,000 in Fiscal 1995 to $7,377,000 in Fiscal 1996 and worldwide S-PLUS product line and services revenue increased 10.9% from $5,324,000  in  Fiscal  1995  to  $5,904,000  in  Fiscal  1996.  The increase in worldwide  non-upgrade  Mathcad revenue was due primarily to the Company's focus throughout Fiscal 1996 on a generating new license Mathcad sales by an increased penetration  into  the  education  market  and  renewed growth in the commercial markets.  Total international revenues increased 17.7% from $5,739,000 in Fiscal 1995  to  $6,756,000  in  Fiscal  1996,  and  decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 36.1% to 32.5%, respectively.  The increase in total international revenues was due to Mathcad upgrade revenues generated by the release of Mathcad 6.0, in addition to global distribution expansion efforts in both the commercial and  education markets.  Revenues attributable to the Axum product line acquired in  the  TriMetrix,  Inc.  acquisition  accounted for $676,000, or 3.3% of total revenues, in Fiscal 1996. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions in Fiscal  1996  were  not  significant.   Total  cost  of  revenues  decreased  1.6  %  from  $4,064,000 in Fiscal 1995 to $4,000,000  in Fiscal 1996, and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 25.6%  to  19.3%,  respectively.    The  decrease in total cost of revenues as a percentage  of  total  revenues  was primarily attributable to the allocation of fixed  costs,  such  as  royalties and the amortization of purchased technology, over  a  higher revenue base for the year.  In addition, amortization of product development  costs  accounted for $489,000 of total cost of revenues, or 3.1% of total  revenues,  in  Fiscal  1995.    There  was  no  amortization  of  product development  costs  in  Fiscal  1996  as  amounts  were  fully  amortized.  Sales  and  marketing expenses increased 11.7% from $8,703,000 in Fiscal 1995 to $9,719,000  in Fiscal 1996, and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 54.8%  to  46.8%,  respectively.  The  increase  in  overall sales and marketing expenses  was  primarily attributable to more aggressive advertising and channel promotional  activities  and  additional headcount and related costs in both the domestic  sales  and marketing functions.  These increases were partially offset by  a  reduction  in  direct mail marketing activities to prospective customers. International  marketing  expenses  decreased  from $2,168,000 in Fiscal 1995 to $1,661,000  in  Fiscal  1996  due  primarily  to a discontinuance of direct mail marketing  activity  to  prospective customers and reduced installed base direct mail  marketing  activity.  Research and development expenses increased 19.6% from $3,059,000 in Fiscal 1995 to  $3,659,000  in  Fiscal 1996, and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from  19.2% to 17.6%.  The increase in overall research and development expenses was  primarily  due  to  the  addition  of  personnel  from  the TriMetrix, Inc. acquisition  as  well  as  expenses incurred related to product localization for international  markets  and  S-PLUS  development  efforts.  General  and  administrative  expenses increased 20.9% from $2,030,000 in Fiscal 1995  to  $2,455,000  in  Fiscal  1996  and  decreased  as a percentage of total revenues from 12.8% to 11.8%, respectively.  The increase in overall general and administrative  expenses was primarily attributable to costs incurred to attract and retain key management personnel in both the Company's Cambridge headquarters and  Seattle  operation  including the addition of a new General Manager for the Company's  Data  Analysis Products Division in the third quarter of Fiscal 1996.  Net  income  for Fiscal 1996 was $1,076,000 compared to a net loss of $1,891,000 in  Fiscal 1995, excluding the $1,662,000 non-cash charge for the revaluation of certain  intangible  assets.    The  release  of  Mathcad  6.0  in July 1995 and expansion of global distribution channels supported worldwide growth in both the Mathcad and S-PLUS product lines.  In addition, the Company's renewed commitment to  the  education  market  in Fiscal 1996 resulted in increased penetration for both  existing  product lines and new product lines, such as StudyWorks released in  June  1996.  Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources   Cash  and  cash  equivalents totaling $4,133,000 at December 31, 1997, increased $1,331,000  during  the Transition Period from $2,802,000 at June 30, 1997.  The positive cash flow resulted primarily from cash provided by operating activities of  $1,602,000, proceeds from exercise of stock options and warrants of $179,000 offset  by  purchases  of  property  and  equipment  of  $424,000.  The  Company  generated  $1,602,000 in cash from operating activities during the Transition  Period.    The  cash generated by operating activities was primarily attributable  to  net  income of approximately $1,105,000, non-cash depreciation and  amortization charges, and to an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in  prepaid expenses.  The changes in accounts payable and prepaid expenses were due  to  the  timing  of payments and management's cash planning and forecasting efforts.    The  increase  in  accounts  receivable  and the decrease in accrued expenses offset these sources of cash.  Accounts receivable increased due to the growth  in  the  Company's  business  and  accrued expenses decreased due to the timing  of  certain payments.  The Company used $439,000 in investing activities primarily  due  to the purchase of $424,000 of property and equipment.  Proceeds generated  from  sales/leaseback  equipment  financing and the exercise of stock options  of  $84,000  and  $179,000,  respectively,  were  offset by payments on capital  lease  obligations  of  $139,000.  The Company's financial reserves are represented by cash and cash equivalents as of  December  31,  1997.    The  Company  has  a line of credit agreement with a commercial  bank.  Borrowings under the line are limited to the lesser of 65% of eligible  domestic  accounts  or  $1,000,000  based  on  certain  profitability covenants.  Borrowings are secured substantially all of the Company's assets and bear  interest  at  the  bank's prime rate plus 1%.  The line of credit contains certain  restrictive  covenants,  including  minimum  amounts  of profitability, equity,  leverage and liquidity, all as defined in the agreement, and expires on December 31,1998.  There were no amounts outstanding under this line at December 31,  1997.  The  Company  believes  its  financial  reserves  and  cash  flows  from  future operations  will  be  sufficient to meet its liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.  The foregoing statement is forward-looking and involves risks  and  uncertainties,  many of which are outside the Company's control. The Company's  actual  experience  may  differ materially from that discussed above. Factors  that  might  cause  such  a difference include, but are not limited to, those  discussed in "Cautionary Statements" in this Form 10-K for the Transition Period  as  well as future events that have the effect of reducing the Company's available  cash  balances,  such  as  unanticipated  operating losses or capital expenditures  or cash expenditures related to possible future acquisitions.  The Company  may be presented from time to time with acquisition opportunities which require  additional  external  financing,  and the Company may from time to time seek  to  obtain  additional funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt  securities.    There  can  be no assurance that any such financing will be available  at  all  or  on  terms  favorable  to  the  Company.  In  addition  to the other information in this report, the cautionary statements discussed  in  this  Form  10-K  for  the Transition Period should be considered carefully  in  evaluating the Company and its business.  Information provided by the Company from time to time may contain certain "forward-looking" information, as  that  term is defined by (i) the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  (the  "Act")  and  (ii)  in  releases  made by the Securities and Exchange Commission  (the "SEC").  These cautionary statements are being made pursuant to the  provisions  of  the Act and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the  "safe  harbor"  provisions  of  the  Act.
