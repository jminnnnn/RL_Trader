ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company reported net income of $71.6 million or $1.50 per combined common share, assuming dilution, compared to $175.7 million or $3.89 per combined diluted common share for the full year of 1996. (See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements.)       The earnings reported for the full year of 1997 reflect an increase in provision for credit losses of $114 million, primarily as a result of higher credit losses in the consumer credit card portfolio. This portfolio was subsequently transferred to the LLC in connection with the Transaction during the first quarter of 1998 (see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, 1996 earnings reflected a $33.8 million gain on the sale of credit card relationships.       During 1997, net interest income and the owned net interest margin increased $14.8 million and 7 basis points, respectively. These increases are primarily a result of the substantial growth in the personal finance and business loan and lease portfolios along with an increase in investments and interest bearing deposits, offset by a reduction in the higher yielding credit card portfolio. The owned personal finance portfolio grew from an average of $242.9 million in 1996 to $586.2 million in 1997, a 141% increase. The business loan and lease portfolio also showed strong growth, rising to an average of $333.1 million during 1997 from $200.1 million during 1996. Noninterest revenues excluding the $33.8 million gain on the sale of credit card relationships in 1996 increased $72.4 million to $845.1 million from $772.7 million in 1996. The increase in other noninterest revenues for 1997 is a result of significant increases in personal finance, business loan and lease noninterest revenues and in other revenues. Personal finance noninterest revenues increased by almost 56% to $170 million primarily as a result of the substantial increase in receivables securitized. In 1997 the Company securitized $3.4 billion of personal finance loans compared to $1.4 billion in 1996. The increase in business loan and lease noninterest revenues also reflects an increase in securitization activity. Business loan and lease receivables securitized in 1997 totalled $563 million compared to $363 million in 1996. "Other" other noninterest revenues increased almost $14.2 million due to an increase in other credit card revenues.       The increases in net interest income and noninterest revenues were offset by increases in the provision for loan losses as previously mentioned, as well as operating expenses. The provision for credit losses rose to $210.8 million in 1997 from $96.9 million in 1996. The increase in the provision for credit losses experienced in 1997 resulted from a higher level of charge-offs and delinquencies primarily in the consumer credit card portfolio, as well as management's decision to increase the ratio of the loan loss allowance to receivables to 4.1% at December 31, 1997 from 3.4% at the end of 1996. The charge-off rate in the owned portfolio rose to 5.6% in 1997 from 2.3% in 1996. The 30-day delinquency rate rose to 5.9% in 1997 from 5.5% in 1996. Operating expenses increased to $630.8 million in 1997 from $523.2 million in 1996. The 1997 operating expense ratio increased to 3.4% from 2.9% in 1996. This increase primarily reflects the addition of employees required to support increased collection efforts related to the credit card portfolio and an increase in the employees needed to support the growth in personal finance activities. Other operating expenses also increased as a result of increased marketing and the resources required to support current and future growth in the portfolios.       Net income for 1996 of $175.7 million was 29% higher than the $136.7 million reported for 1995. On a per combined share basis, assuming dilution, net income was $3.89 compared to $3.20 for 1995. The growth in earnings in 1996 was attributable primarily to a 49% increase in noninterest revenues to $806.5 million from $543.0 in 1995. The growth in noninterest revenues was a result of substantial growth in average managed receivables which increased to $14.9 billion in 1996 from $9.5 billion in 1995. Noninterest revenues for 1996 also reflect a $33.8 million gain on the sale of consumer credit card customer relationships. Credit card securitization activities were affected by the adoption in the third quarter of 1996 of a new charge-off methodology relating to bankruptcies (see "Asset Quality"), the upward repricing of interest rates and fees, increases in charge-offs and the related impact on the allowance for loan losses, all of which had an approximate $50 million impact (earnings increase) in 1996, as well as a 57% increase in average securitized receivables. The increase in noninterest revenues was partially offset by increases in the provision for credit                                        20    22  losses reflecting an increase in the charge-off and delinquency rates in 1996 to 3.2% and 5.4% respectively from the 1995 levels of 2.2% and 3.3%, respectively. The operating expense ratio was flat at 2.9% for both 1996 and 1995.       On February 20, 1998 the Company announced that it had completed the Transaction with Fleet whereby the Company and certain of its subsidiaries and Fleet and certain of its subsidiaries contributed substantially all of their respective consumer credit card businesses, subject to liabilities, to the LLC. Advanta has retained a minority membership interest in the LLC, which at the closing date of the Transaction was valued at $20 million. The Transaction was submitted to a vote of stockholders and was approved on February 20, 1998, the closing date for the Transaction. (See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company realized an after tax gain of approximately $530 million which was recorded in the first quarter of 1998. Concurrently with the Transaction, the Company purchased 7,882,750 shares of its Class A Common Stock and 12,482,850 of its Class B Common Stock at $40 per share net, and 1,078,930 of its depositary shares each representing one one-hundredth interest in a share of 6 3/4% Convertible Class B Preferred Stock, Series 1995 (Stock Appreciated Income Linked Securities (SAILS)) at $32.80 per share net, through an issuer tender offer. (See Notes 8 and 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements).       Associated with the Transaction, the Company intends to substantially reduce corporate expenses and expenses associated with business and product development which are not directly associated with its mortgage and business services companies.       Going forward, the Company will focus on providing innovative financial products and services to consumers and small businesses through its rapidly growing mortgage and business services companies.  NET INTEREST INCOME  Net interest income represents the excess of income generated from interest-earning assets, including on balance-sheet receivables, investments and money market instruments over the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and debt.       Net interest income of $93.1 million for 1997 increased $14.8 million or 18.9% from 1996 as a result of a $682.2 million or 15.3% increase in average interest-earning assets and an increase in the owned net interest margin, which rose to 1.91% in 1997 from 1.84% in 1996, partially offset by higher levels of interest-bearing liabilities which increased 16.7% in 1997. The higher owned net interest margin resulted from a 33 basis point increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets primarily as a result of the repricing of the consumer credit card portfolio. The increase in the owned net interest margin was negatively impacted by the mix of earning assets reflecting the Company's decision to maintain a conservative position in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. In 1997 the investment portfolio, which earned an average yield of 5.73% represented 47.8% of total interest-earning assets, while the higher yielding receivable balances represented only 52.2% of total owned interest-earning assets. In 1996 investments earned a similar average yield of 5.72% but represented only 31.5% of total owned interest-earning assets; receivable balances with an average yield of 8.90% represented 68.5% of total owned interest-earning assets.       Net interest income of $78.3 million for 1996 increased $5.4 million or 7% from 1995 as a result of a $1.7 billion or 63% increase in average owned interest-earning assets, largely offset by a lower owned net interest margin, which fell to 1.84% in 1996 from 2.80% in 1995. The lower owned net interest margin primarily resulted from a 99 basis point decrease in the yield on average interest-earning assets as a significant portion of consumer credit card receivables on the balance sheet were at introductory rates, partially offset by a 34 basis point decrease in the cost of funds.       Credit card, mortgage and other personal finance and business loan and lease receivable securitization activity shifts revenues from interest income to noninterest revenues. This ongoing securitization activity reduces the level of higher-yielding receivables on the balance sheet while proportionately increasing the balance sheet levels of new lower-yielding receivables and money market assets. Net interest income on securitized credit card balances is reflected in credit card securitization income. Net interest income on securitized mortgage and other personal finance loans is reflected in income from personal finance activities,                                         21    23  and net interest income on securitized business loans and leases is reflected in business loan and lease other revenues. All securitization income is included in noninterest revenues. (See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements).       Average managed credit card receivables of $11.4 billion for 1997 decreased $0.8 billion or 6.7% from 1996. In 1997, average owned credit card receivables were $1.7 billion compared to $2.6 billion in 1996. This decrease is attributable to a number of factors including increased competition in the credit card industry, changes in consumer cardholder behavior and changes in marketing strategy.       Average managed personal finance loans increased 83.7% to $3.9 billion in 1997, from $2.1 billion in 1996. The average balance of owned personal finance loans increased to $586 million in 1997 from $243 million in 1996. Personal finance loan originations of $3.7 billion in 1997 were up $2.2 billion or 144.4% from 1996. Personal finance loans securitized in 1997 totalled $3.4 billion compared to $1.4 billion in 1996. Yields on owned personal finance loans decreased to 10.01% in 1997 from 10.62% in 1996 as a result of a different mix of loans in the owned inventory from which the yield calculation is based.       Average managed business loans and leases of $1.1 billion increased $459 million or 76.1% from 1996. Average owned balances of business loans and leases increased $133 million or 66.5% during 1997 primarily due to the success of the business credit card, as those originations increased 107.1% from $519 million in 1996 to $1.1 billion in 1997. Total business loan and lease originations were $1.4 billion in 1997 compared to $856 million in 1996. Additionally, during 1997, the Company securitized $563 million of business loan and lease receivables. Yields on owned business loans and leases increased to 12.26% in 1997 from 11.97% in 1996.       The owned average cost of funds increased to 6.31% in 1997 from 6.12% in 1996. The Company has utilized derivatives to manage interest rate risk (see discussion under "Derivatives Activities").       The following table provides an analysis of both owned and managed interest income and expense data, average balance sheet data, net interest spread (the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities), and net interest margin (the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid to fund interest-earning assets) for 1995 through 1997. Average owned loan and lease receivables and the related interest revenues include certain loan fees.                                         22    24                               INTEREST RATE ANALYSIS                                                      YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, ($ IN THOUSANDS)           -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           1997                                 1996                            ----------------------------------   ----------------------------------                              AVERAGE                  AVERAGE     AVERAGE                  AVERAGE                              BALANCE      INTEREST     RATE       BALANCE      INTEREST     RATE -

Net interest income includes the amount of net interest income which has been reported as noninterest revenues. In addition, the provision for credit losses includes the amount by which the provision for credit losses would have been higher had the securitized receivables remained as owned and the provision for credit losses been equal to actual reported charge-offs (see "Asset Quality"). Noninterest revenues on the managed income statement exclude the net interest income and credit losses associated with the securitized credit card assets.  PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  The provision for credit losses of $210.8 million in 1997 increased $114.0 million or 117.7% from $96.9 million in 1996. The increase was due to higher charge-offs on owned receivables, which increased 114.3% from $70.6 million in 1996 to $151.2 million in 1997 and higher levels of delinquencies which continued to increase throughout the year. Consistent with this experience, management's estimate of possible losses inherent in the loan portfolio at year end increased, resulting in an increase in the ratio of the loss allowance to receivables to 4.1% at the end of 1997 from 3.4% at year end 1996.       The provision for credit losses of $96.9 million in 1996 increased $43.5 million or 82% from $53.3 million in 1995. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the desired level of the allowance given the increase in charge-offs and impaired assets during 1996.       A description of the credit performance of the loan portfolio is set forth under the section entitled "Credit Risk Management."                                         25    27  NONINTEREST REVENUES  ($ IN THOUSANDS) - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                   1997        1996        1995 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        Gain on sale of credit cards                                 $      0    $ 33,820    $      0 Other noninterest revenues:   Credit card securitization income                           252,631     258,066     183,360   Credit card servicing income                                176,061     176,567     117,369   Income from personal finance activities                     169,973     109,167      50,541   Credit card interchange income                               85,208     102,804      92,439   Business loan and lease other revenues                       70,943      61,622      41,050   Credit card overlimit fees                                   46,447      16,465       4,755   Insurance revenues, net                                      37,816      38,175      30,146   Equity securities (losses) gains                            (11,426)      6,522      15,386   Other                                                        17,484       3,324       7,968 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total other noninterest revenues                             $845,137    $772,712    $543,014 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total noninterest revenues                                   $845,137    $806,532    $543,014 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        Noninterest revenues increased in 1997 to $845.1 million from $806.5 million in 1996. The 1996 figure includes a gain on the sale of credit card customer relationships of $33.8 million. Excluding this gain, noninterest revenues increased by $72.4 million or 9.4% in 1997. This increase was primarily the result of income derived from increased securitization activity in the personal finance and business loan and lease portfolios, as described below. There were no new credit card securitization transactions in 1997 due to the decrease in average managed credit card receivables during the period.       Due to prior period securitizations of credit card receivables, activity from securitized account balances, which otherwise would be reported as net interest income and charge-offs, is reported in securitization income and servicing income, both of which are included in noninterest revenues. Credit card securitization income was affected by the adoption in the third quarter of 1996 of a new charge-off methodology relating to bankruptcies (see "Asset Quality"), the upward repricing of interest rates and fees, increases in charge-offs and the related impact on the allowance for loan losses all of which had an approximate $50 million impact (earnings increase) in 1996, as well as a 57% increase in average securitized receivables. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of securitization income.       The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 125, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities" ("SFAS 125"), effective January 1, 1997. (See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements.) The adoption of SFAS 125 did not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.       Credit card servicing income, which represents fees paid to the Company for continuing to service accounts which have been securitized, remained unchanged in 1997 at $176.1 million compared to $176.6 million in 1996. Such fees generally approximate 2% of securitized receivables and are consistent with the $9.6 billion of average securitized receivables in both 1997 and 1996.       Interchange income represents fees that are payable by merchants to the credit card issuer for sale transactions. Total interchange income, which represents approximately 1.4% of credit card purchases, decreased to $85.2 million in 1997 from $102.8 million in 1996 reflecting the lower volume of transactions experienced in 1997.       During 1997, the Company securitized $3.4 billion of mortgage and home equity loans compared to $1.4 billion in 1996. As a result, income from personal finance activities of $170.0 million for 1997 increased 55.7% from $109.2 million in 1996. The 1997 income reflects the use of higher prepayment assumptions as well as a change in the mix of the loans securitized. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of income from personal finance loans.                                         26    28       Business loan and lease other revenues increased $9.3 million to $70.9 million in 1997 primarily due to an 80.8% growth in average securitized business loans and leases from 1996. Credit card overlimit fees on the managed portfolio increased significantly in 1997 as a result of the Company's risk based pricing strategies. Insurance revenues, net, were $37.8 million in 1997, down slightly from the $38.2 million reported in 1996. The decline is attributable to lower receivable balances in the credit card portfolio.       Equity securities (losses) gains in 1997 reflect a decrease in carrying value of portfolio investments in the Company's venture capital unit. "Other" other noninterest revenues increased by $14.2 million due to an increase in other credit card revenues.       Noninterest revenues of $806.5 million in 1996 increased $263.5 million or 49% from $543.0 million in 1995, primarily due to increases in credit card securitization, servicing and interchange income, as well as higher personal finance and business loan and lease revenues. Noninterest revenues for 1996 also included a $33.8 million gain on the sale of credit card customer relationships.

This decrease reflects the lower level of credit card originations in 1997 (see Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements).       Total other operating expenses of $561.5 million for 1997 were up $126.8 million or 29.2% from $434.7 million in 1996. The increase in total other operating expenses is attributable, in part, to a $64.6 million or 35.4% increase in salaries and employee benefits as a result of an increase in the number of employees from 3,541 at year-end 1996 to 4,498 at year-end 1997, including the addition of staff in the consumer credit card collection area and additions to staff to support the growth in loan production and serviced receivables in personal finance. Other factors affecting the increase in other operating expenses were a $21.1 million or 65.9% increase in marketing expenses relating to new business advertising for the personal finance and business loan                                         27    29  products and increased advertising related to account retention initiatives for the consumer credit card portfolio. External processing fees for 1997 reflect a $10 million cash rebate related to prior periods' credit card processing performance. Without the rebate, external processing costs would have increased by $10.4 million or 24.4% over the $42.8 million reported in 1996. This increase is primarily the result of customer retention and relationship management programs in the credit card area. Other operating expenses, including equipment and occupancy expenses reflected increases consistent with the current and projected increase in employees and serviced customer accounts and the addition of space and new technology required to support this growth. "Other" other operating expenses increased by $5.7 million or 28.4% primarily as a result of a full year of expenses associated with the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities.       The amortization of credit card deferred origination costs increased by $16.2 million to $88.5 million in 1996 from $72.3 million in 1995. The increase reflects the growth in credit card originations experienced during the last half of 1995 and in 1996.       Total other operating expenses increased by $156.3 million or 56% to $434.7 million in 1996 from $278.4 million in 1995. Part of the increase in total other operating expenses resulted from a $66 million or 57% increase in salaries and employee benefits. In addition, professional and other consulting fees increased $25.3 million from $14.9 million in 1995 to $40.2 million in 1996.  INCOME TAXES  The Company's consolidated income tax expense was $24.9 million for 1997, or an effective tax rate of 26% compared to tax expense of $89.1 million in 1996, or an effective tax rate of 34%, and tax expense of $75.2 million in 1995, or an effective rate of 36%. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 1996 to 1997 resulted from a higher level of insurance-related activities, and tax credits from investments in combination with a lower level of pretax income.  ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT  The financial condition of Advanta Corp. is managed with a focus on maintaining high credit quality standards, disciplined management of market risks and prudent levels of leverage and liquidity.  MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY  Market risk is the potential for loss or diminished financial performance arising from adverse changes in market forces such as interest rates and market prices. Market risk sensitivity is the degree to which a financial instrument, or a company that owns financial instruments is exposed to market forces. The Company regularly evaluates its market risk profile and attempts to minimize the impact of market risks on net interest income and net income.       The Company's exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk, and equity price risk is immaterial relative to expected overall financial performance. The Company's financial performance can, however, be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, changes in economic conditions, shifts in customer behavior, and other factors. Changes in economic conditions and shifts in customer behavior are difficult to predict, and the financial performance of the Company generally cannot be insulated from such forces.       Financial performance variability as a result of fluctuations in interest rates is commonly called interest rate risk. Interest rate risk generally evolves from mismatches in the timing of asset and liability repricing (gap risk) and from differences between the repricing indices of assets and liabilities (basis risk).       The Company attempts to analyze the impact of interest rate risk by regularly evaluating the perceived risks inherent in its asset and liability structure, including securitized instruments and off-balance sheet instruments. Risk exposure levels vary continuously, as changes occur in the Company's asset/liability mix, market interest rates, prepayment trends, and other factors affecting the timing and magnitude of cash flows. Computer simulations are used to generate expected financial performance in a variety of interest rate environments. Those results are analyzed to determine if actions need to be taken to mitigate the Company's interest rate risk.                                        28    30       In managing interest rate risk exposure, the Company periodically securitizes receivables, sells and purchases assets, alters the mix and term structure of its funding base, changes its investment portfolio and uses derivative financial instruments. Derivative instruments, by policy, are not used for speculative purposes (see discussion under "Derivative Activities").       The Company has measured its interest rate risk using a rising rate scenario and a declining rate scenario. Net interest income is estimated using a third party software model that uses standard income modeling techniques. The Company estimates that its net interest income over a twelve month period would neither materially increase or decrease if interest rates were to rise or fall by 200 basis points or less. Both increasing and decreasing rate scenarios assume an instantaneous shift in rates and measure the corresponding change in expected net interest income over one year. The scenario results reflect the completed Transaction with Fleet (see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements). As a result of the Transaction with Fleet, the Company's interest rate risk profile has changed; however, the sensitivity to changes in interest rate is not material.       The above estimates of net interest income sensitivity alone do not provide a comprehensive view of the Company's exposure to interest rate risk. The quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters and assumptions utilized in generating the results. Such analyses are useful only when viewed within the context of the parameters and assumptions used. The above rate scenarios in no way reflect management's expectation regarding the future direction of interest rates, and they depict only two possibilities out of a large set of possible scenarios.       In addition to interest rate risk, the Company has other financial instruments, namely capitalized servicing rights and interest only strips, that are subject to prepayment risk. Prepayments are principal payments in excess of scheduled principal payments. Prepayments generally result from entire loan payoffs due largely to refinancing a loan or selling a home. Actual or anticipated prepayment rates are expressed in terms of a constant prepayment rate ("CPR"), which represents the annual percentage of beginning loan balances that prepay. To a degree, prepayment rates are related to market interest rates and changes in those interest rates. The precise relationship between them, however, is not known at this time. Accordingly, the Company believes it is prudent to disclose the fair value sensitivity of these instruments based on changes in prepayment rate assumptions rather that based on changes in interest rates.       The Company's capitalized servicing rights and interest only strips derive from both fixed and variable rate loans, the majority of which are fixed. Fixed and variable rate loans are currently prepaying at different rates and are expected to continue this behavior in the future. The Company has estimated the fair value impact of prepayment changes of 2.5% CPR for fixed rate loans and 3% CPR for variable rate loans. These key changes in prepayment assumptions could result in an $18 million change in fair value. In addition, changes in the interest rate environment generally affect the level of loan originations. Prepayment assumptions are not the only assumptions in the fair value calculation, but they are the most influential. Other key assumptions are not directly impacted by market forces as defined earlier. The above prepayment scenarios do not reflect management's expectation regarding the future direction of prepayments, and they depict only two possibilities out of a large set of possible scenarios.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  The Company's goal is to maintain an adequate level of liquidity, for both long- and short-term needs, through active management of both assets and liabilities. During 1997, the Company, through its subsidiaries, securitized $3.4 billion of personal finance loans and $0.6 billion of business loan and lease receivables. In addition, funds totalling approximately $996 million were raised during this same period through the issuance of unsecured notes, other borrowings and an increase in deposits at ANB (and its predecessors by merger). Cash generated from these transactions was temporarily invested in short-term, high quality investments at money market rates awaiting redeployment to pay down borrowings and to fund future credit card, personal finance and business loan receivable growth. Cash and equivalents exceeded amounts normally held to provide liquidity protection subsequent to the Company's March 17, 1997 announcement relating to a decrease in expected 1997 financial results. At December 31, 1997, the Company had approximately $1.5 billion of loan                                         29    31  and lease receivables and $1.3 billion of investments available for sale which could be sold to generate additional liquidity.       The Company's funding strategy for 1998 relies heavily on the cash, cash equivalents and investments released by the Transaction with Fleet as well as deposit gathering activity at both ANB and AFC. As a result of the Transaction with Fleet, approximately $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments which had previously been held by the Company in connection with its consumer credit card business was no longer required in such business and became available for general corporate purposes. The Company used approximately $850 million of such amount (before taking into account the exercise price of options) to purchase 7,882,750 shares of its Class A Common Stock, 12,482,850 of its Class B Common Stock, and 1,078,930 of its SAILS Depositary Shares through an issuer tender offer which was completed on February 20, 1998 (see Notes 8 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Following the completion of the Transaction with Fleet and the Company's tender offer, the Company expects to benefit from a substantial cash position. However, the external sources described below will remain in place both for contingency funding and for continued future utilization.       Funding diversification has been an essential component of the Company's liquidity and capital management. The Company and ANB have utilized both retail and institutional on balance sheet funding sources issuing a variety of debt and deposit products. The Company and ANB also have utilized a secured revolving credit facility and off balance sheet securitization funding (described below).       The debt securities of Advanta and ANB (and its predecessors by merger) had investment-grade ratings from all of the nationally recognized statistical rating agencies throughout 1996. Beginning March 1997 through early 1998, the various rating agencies lowered their ratings on the debt securities of each of Advanta and its banking subsidiaries. As of March 1998, senior debt of Advanta was rated investment grade by one agency and below investment grade by the other four agencies; and debt of ANB was rated investment grade by two agencies and below investment grade by the other three agencies.       On May 1, 1997, Advanta Mortgage Corp. USA and its subsidiaries entered into a $500 million secured revolving credit facility, $250 million of which is committed. Also, deposit sources proved readily expandable in 1997 as demonstrated in the growth noted above. In addition, notwithstanding the Company's current liquidity, efforts continue to develop new sources of funding, both through previously untapped customer segments and through development of new financing structures.       In December 1996, Advanta Capital Trust I, a newly formed statutory business trust established by and wholly-owned by the Company (the "Trust"), issued in a private offering $100 million of capital securities, representing preferred beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust (the "Capital Securities"). The Company used the proceeds from the sale for general corporate purposes. The sole assets of the Trust consist of $100 million of 8.99% junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company due December 17, 2026 (the "Junior Subordinated Debentures"). The Capital Securities will be subject to mandatory redemption under certain circumstances, including at any time on or after December 17, 2006 upon the optional prepayment by the Company of the Junior Subordinated Debentures. The obligations of the Company with respect to the Junior Subordinated Debentures, when considered together with the obligations of the Company under the Indenture relating to the Junior Subordinated Debentures, the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust relating to the Capital Securities and the Capital Securities Guarantee issued by the Company with respect to the Capital Securities will provide, in the aggregate, a full and unconditional guarantee of payments of distributions and other amounts due on the Capital Securities. In July, 1997, the Company and the Trust exchanged the outstanding Capital Securities and Junior Subordinated Debentures for substantially identical securities which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). The Company also exchanged the Capital Securities Guarantee for a substantially identical guarantee which was also registered under the Act. The Trust has no operations or assets separate from its investment in the Junior Subordinated Debentures. Separate financial statements of the Trust are not presented because management has determined that they would not be meaningful to investors.                                         30    32       In August 1995, in a public offering, the Company sold 2,500,000 depositary shares each representing a one-hundredth interest in a share of Stock Appreciation Income Linked Securities (SAILS). The SAILS constitute a series of the Company's Class B Preferred Stock, designated as 6 3/4% Convertible Class B Preferred Stock, Series 1995 (SAILS). On September 15, 1999, unless either previously redeemed by the Company or converted at the option of the holder, each share of the SAILS will automatically convert into 100 shares of Class B Common Stock. Proceeds from the offering, net of underwriting discount, were approximately $90 million. The Company used the proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including financing the growth of its subsidiaries. As of February 20, 1998, after giving effect to the purchase of shares through an issuer tender offer made following the Transaction with Fleet, 1,421,070 shares of Class B Preferred Stock remain outstanding.       The Company also filed a shelf registration statement in 1996 with the Securities and Exchange Commission which provides for the Company to sell up to $1.6 billion of debt securities. The Company has issued approximately $1.0 billion of debt securities under this shelf.       In September 1995, ANB (and its predecessors by merger) established a $2.25 billion bank note program. Under this program, ANB may issue an aggregate of $2.0 billion of senior bank notes and $250 million of subordinated bank notes. These notes may have maturities ranging from seven days to fifteen years from the date of issuance. In connection with the Transaction with Fleet, a significant portion of bank notes issued under this program was transferred to the LLC.       As of December 31, 1997, the Company and ANB had a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. Following the closing of the Transaction with Fleet in 1998, the facility was terminated by the Company and ANB.

For the fiscal CEBA year ended September 30, 1996, AUS's average assets did not exceed the allowable amount and, accordingly, AUS was in full compliance with CEBA growth limits. The timing and size of securitizations, on-balance sheet liability structure and rapid changes in balance sheet structure had frequently been due to the management of AUS's balance sheet within this growth constraint. However, on September 30, 1996 this growth rate provision of CEBA was repealed which has created substantial new flexibility with respect to asset/liability management for AUS (and now ANB) and ultimately the Company.       As of December 31, 1997 ANB's total deposits were $2.8 billion, and AFC, a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial loan corporation had total deposits of $195.4 million. A significant portion of ANB's deposits were contributed to the LLC in connection with the Transaction with Fleet.       ANB's combined Tier I and Tier II capital ratio at December 31, 1997 was 16.39%. At December 31, 1996, the combined Tier I and Tier II capital ratio was 15.84% for AUS and 17.20% for Old ANB. In each case, ANB, AUS and Old ANB met the requirements of the Comptroller and qualified each of ANB, AUS and Old ANB as well-capitalized.       In addition, the Company's insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain capital, deposit and dividend rules and regulations as prescribed by state jurisdictions in which they are authorized to operate. At December 31, 1997 and 1996 the insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with such rules and regulations.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  The Company spent $83.4 million for capital expenditures in 1997, primarily for the construction of buildings in Pennsylvania for the mortgage division and a new office building in Delaware, leasehold improvements, additional space in existing buildings, office and voice communication equipment and furniture and fixtures. This compared to $78.4 million for capital expenditures in 1996 and $20.6 million in 1995.       In 1998, the Company anticipates capital expenditures to be lower than in 1997 as a result of the decreased need of capital expenditures to support the consumer credit card business contributed to the LLC.  YEAR 2000 ISSUE  Many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field. These programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century. If not                                        32    34  corrected, many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the Year 2000. In connection with this issue (the "Year 2000 Issue"), the Company has initiated a comprehensive assessment of its computer systems and applications, managed by a team led by two senior information technology managers and organized as a separate Year 2000 Project Office (the "Project Office"). The Project Office has developed standards for its work based on work of leading consultants in the field. The Project Office has developed a review process featuring a "Year 2000 Score Card" that will be used to measure the degree to which each of the Company's computer applications are impacted by the Year 2000 Issue.       The Company has also initiated communications with all of its significant outside service providers and some of its larger clients to determine the extent to which the Company is vulnerable to those third parties' failure to remediate their own Year 2000 Issue. There can be no assurance that the systems used by outside service providers or other third parties upon which the Company's systems rely will be timely converted, or that a failure to convert by another company, or a conversion that is incompatible with the Company's systems, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.       The Company expects that its on-going evaluation of its systems and applications and testing for the implementation of any modifications of existing computer programs or conversions to new programs, to the extent necessary to address the Year 2000 Issue, will be substantially completed by the end of 1998, consistent with the Year 2000 guidelines issued by the Comptroller. The Company, therefore, believes that the Year 2000 Issue will not pose significant operational problems for the Company. The Company, however, has not completed its evaluation of the costs of addressing the issue. While management does not expect that the costs of evaluating and reprogramming these systems will be significant, the Company cannot yet estimate the actual costs of the necessary remediation program. Moreover, the Company notes that GAAP requires that the costs of becoming Year 2000 compliant, including without limitation modifying computer software or converting to new programs, be charged to expense as they are incurred. The Company believes that the Year 2000 Issue will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's future financial condition, liquidity or results of operations during 1998 and in future periods.  DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES  The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risks. The Company has a number of mechanisms in place that enable it to monitor and control both market and credit risk from these derivatives activities. At the broader level, all derivatives strategies are managed under a hedging policy approved by the Board of Directors that details the use of such derivatives and the individuals authorized to execute derivatives transactions. All derivatives strategies must be approved by the Company's senior management.       As part of this approval process, a market risk analysis is completed to determine the potential impact on the Company from severe negative (stressed) movements in market rates. By policy, derivatives transactions may only be used to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risks or for cost reduction and may not be used for speculative purposes. As such, the impact of any derivatives transaction is calculated using the Company's asset/liability model to determine its suitability.       The Company's Investment Committee (a management committee) has a counterparty credit policy. This policy details the maximum credit exposure, transaction limit and transaction term for counterparties based on an internally assigned Investment Committee credit rating. Internal counterparty credit ratings reflect the credit ratings from nationally recognized rating agencies, as well as other significant credit factors where appropriate. Each counterparty's credit quality is reviewed as new information becomes available, and, in any case, at least quarterly. Activities with counterparties will be suspended if there is reason to believe that their credit quality is below the Company's set standards.       For each counterparty, credit exposure amounts are calculated in a stress environment and represent the maximum aggregate credit exposure from derivatives and other capital market transactions the Company is willing to accept from an individually approved counterparty. To manage counterparty exposure, the Company also uses negotiated agreements that establish threshold exposure amounts for each counterparty above which the Company has the right to call for and receive collateral for the amount of such excess, thereby limiting its                                        33    35  exposure to the threshold amount. The threshold levels can be fixed or may change as the credit rating of the counterparty changes, and in all cases, the threshold levels are well below the maximum allowable exposure amounts described above.       Counterparty master agreements and any collateral agreements, by policy, must be signed prior to the execution of any derivatives transactions with a counterparty. To date, substantially all master agreements with counterparties have included bilateral collateral agreements. As such, the potential exposure from a particular counterparty is limited to the maximum threshold level for that counterparty.       The Company has a treasury middle office that is independent of the trading function, which measures, monitors, and reports on credit, market, and liquidity risk exposures from capital markets, hedging and derivative product activities. It is the responsibility of this department to ensure compliance with respect to the hedging policy, including the counterparty transaction limits, transaction terms and trader authorizations. In addition, this department marks each derivatives position to market on a weekly basis using both internal and external models. These models have been benchmarked against a sample of derivatives dealers' valuation models for accuracy. Position and counterparty exposure reports are generated and used to manage collateral requirements of the counterparty and the Company.       All of these procedures and processes are designed to provide reasonable assurance that prior to and after the execution of any derivatives strategy, market, credit and liquidity risks are fully analyzed and incorporated into the Company's asset/liability and risk measurement models and the proper accounting treatment for the transaction is identified and executed.       During 1996, the FASB issued its exposure draft for accounting for hedging and derivatives. This draft, an attempt to standardize accounting treatment for derivatives and hedging, would alter the accounting treatment for the use of such instruments in the reduction of interest rate risk. The FASB is currently reviewing comments on the exposure draft. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of these deliberations at this time.  CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT  Management regularly reviews the loan and lease portfolio in order to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The evaluation includes such factors as the inherent credit quality of the loan portfolio, past experience, current economic conditions and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is maintained for on-balance sheet receivables. The on-balance sheet allowance is intended to cover all credit losses inherent in the owned loan portfolio. With regard to securitized assets, anticipated losses and related recourse liabilities are reflected in the calculations of Securitization Income, Amounts due from Credit Card Securitizations and Other Assets. Recourse liabilities are intended to cover all probable credit losses over the life of the securitized receivables. Management evaluates both its on-balance sheet and recourse requirements and, as appropriate, effects additions to these accounts.       The allowance for credit losses on a consolidated basis was $137.8 million, or 4.1% of owned receivables, at December 31, 1997, compared to $89.2 million, or 3.4% of owned receivables, at December 31, 1996. The allowance for credit losses on a consolidated basis was $53.5 million, or 1.9% of owned receivables, in 1995.  ASSET QUALITY  Impaired assets include both nonperforming assets (personal finance loans and business loans and leases past due 90 days or more, real estate owned, bankrupt, decedent and fraudulent credit card accounts, and off-lease equipment) and accruing loans past due 90 days or more on credit cards and leases. The carrying value for real estate owned is based on fair value and costs of disposition and is reflected in other assets.       Gross interest income that would have been recorded in 1997 and 1996 for owned nonperforming assets, had interest been accrued throughout the year in accordance with the assets' original terms, was approximately $2.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively. The amount of interest on nonperforming assets included in income for 1997 and 1996 was $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively.                                         34    36       In the third quarter of 1996, the Company adopted a new charge-off methodology related to bankrupt credit card accounts, providing for up to a 90-day (rather than up to a 30-day) investigative period following notification of the bankruptcy petition, prior to charge-off. This new methodology is consistent with others in the credit card industry. The 1997 and 1996 credit statistics set forth in the following tables reflect this change in methodology.       The 1997 asset quality information reflects generally higher charge-off and delinquency rates primarily in the credit card business which was consistent with industry trends.       The total managed charge-off rate for 1997 was 5.3% for 1997 compared to 3.2% in 1996. The charge-off rate on managed credit cards increased from 3.7% in 1996 to 7.0% in 1997. The charge-off rate for managed personal finance loans showed a slight increase, rising to 0.8% in 1997 from 0.7% in 1996. For 1997, the charge-off rate for business loans and leases was 3.2% compared to 2.3% for the prior year.       On the total owned portfolio the charge-off rate was 5.6% in 1997 compared to 2.3% for 1996. The charge-off rate on the owned credit card portfolio rose to 7.9% from 2.5% one year earlier. The charge-off rate on owned personal finance loans decreased from 1.3% in 1996 to 1.0% in 1997. The 1997 charge-off rate on business loans and leases was 2.5% compared to 1.5% in 1996.       Nonperforming assets in the total managed portfolio rose to $328.8 million or 1.8% of receivables in 1997 compared to $191.7 million or 1.2% at the end of 1996. In the managed credit card portfolio, nonperforming assets increased to $101.3 million or 0.9% of receivables from $89.1 million or 0.7% in 1996. The nonperforming assets in the managed personal finance portfolio totalled $200.6 million or 3.8% of receivables at the end of 1997, up from $93.1 million or 3.4% at the end of 1996. In the managed business loan and lease portfolio, nonperforming assets totalled $26.8 million or 2.1% of receivables in 1997 compared to $9.5 million or 1.2% at the end of 1996.       In the owned portfolio, nonperforming assets totalled $51.1 million or 1.5% of receivables at the end of 1997 compared to $29.8 million or 1.1% of receivables at the end of 1996. Nonperforming assets in the owned credit card portfolio rose to $21.1 million or 0.8% of receivables compared to $13.9 million or 0.7% at the end of 1996. In the owned personal finance portfolio, nonperforming assets increased to $23.2 million or 4.9% of loans at year end 1997, up from $13.0 million or 3.5% at the end of 1996. Nonperforming assets totalled $6.7 million or 2.2% of receivables in the business loan and lease portfolio, at the end of 1997, up from $2.9 million or 1.4% at the end of 1996.       Loans delinquent 30 days or more in the total managed portfolio were $1.1 billion or 6.0% of receivables at year end 1997, up from $886.7 million or 5.4% of receivables at December 31, 1996. In the managed credit card portfolio loans delinquent 30 days or more totalled $594.4 million or 5.29% of receivables in 1997, compared to $632.1 million or 5.0% of receivables at year end 1996. In the managed personal finance loan portfolio at year end 1997, loans 30 days or more delinquent totalled $391.9 million or 7.4% of receivables, up from $194.4 million or 7.1% of receivables at December 31, 1996. Loans 30 days or more delinquent in the managed business loan and lease portfolio were $81.7 million or 6.5% of receivables at year end 1997 compared to $59.9 million or 7.3% at year end 1996.       In the owned portfolio, loans delinquent 30 days or more at year end 1997 totalled $201.9 million or 5.9% of receivables, up from $145.6 million or 5.5% at year end 1996. Loans 30 days or more delinquent in the owned credit card portfolio totalled $141 million or 5.5% of loans at year end 1997, up from $107.3 million or 5.2% at the end of 1996. At the end of 1997 loans delinquent 30 days or more in the owned personal finance portfolio totalled $42.9 million or 9.0% of receivables compared to $28.5 million or 7.6% at the end of 1996. Owned business loans and leases delinquent more than 30 days at year end 1997 totalled $17.8 million or 6.0% of receivables compared to $9.5 million or 4.4% at the end of 1996.       Impaired assets in the total managed portfolio were $532 million at December 31, 1997 or 3.0% of receivables compared to $420.5 million or 2.6% at year end 1996. In the managed credit card portfolio, impaired assets totalled $304.4 million or 2.7% of receivables at the end of 1997 compared to the 1996 level of $317.9 million or 2.5% of receivables. In the owned portfolio, total impaired assets were $100.6 million or 3.0% of receivables in 1997, up from $70.4 million or 2.7% at the end of 1996. In the owned credit card portfolio,                                        35    37  impaired assets rose to $70.5 million or 2.7% of receivables in 1997 compared to $54.5 million or 2.7% at the end of 1996.       Past due loans represent accruing loans that are past due 90 days or more as to collection of principal and interest. Credit card receivables, except those on bankrupt, decedent and fraudulent accounts, continue to accrue interest until the time they are charged off at 186 days contractual delinquency. In contrast, all personal finance loans and most business loans and leases are put on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due.       During 1994, the Company implemented a new policy for the charge-off of mortgage loans. Under this policy, when a nonperforming mortgage loan becomes twelve months delinquent, the Company writes down the loan to its net realizable value, regardless of anticipated collectibility.
