ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  Net income for 1996 of $175.7 million increased $39.0 million or 29% from the $136.7 million reported for 1995. Earnings per share of $3.89 increased 22% from the $3.20 reported for 1995.           Earnings in 1996 reflected a $5.4 billion or 56% increase in average managed receivables, and a $263.5 million or 49% rise in noninterest revenues derived principally from securitized receivables and a $33.8 million gain on the sale of credit card customer relationships. The securitization of $1.4 billion of mortgage and home equity loans in 1996, 158% greater than in 1995, also contributed to the increase in noninterest revenues, as income from personal finance loans (mortgage, home equity and auto loans) was up $58.6 million or 116% from 1995. Credit card securitization activities were affected by the adoption in the third quarter of 1996 of a new charge-off methodology relating to bankruptcies (see Asset Quality), the upward repricing of interest rates and fees, increases in charge-offs and the related impact on reserves, all of which had an approximate $50 million impact (earnings increase) in 1996, as well as a 57% increase in average securitized receivables. Total other operating expenses (excluding the amortization of credit card deferred origination costs, net) increased 56%, consistent with the increase in average managed receivables. Thus, the operating expense ratio was 2.9% for both 1996 and 1995. Asset quality indicators tracked unfavorably, as the total managed charge-off rate increased to 3.2% in 1996 from 2.2% in 1995. The 30-day and over delinquency rate on managed receivables increased to 5.4% at December 31, 1996 from 3.3% at year end 1995. The 1996 indicators reflect the new charge-off methodology relating to credit card bankruptcies. Without this change, the managed charge-off rate and the 30-day and over delinquency rate on managed receivables would have been 3.5% and 5.2%, respectively. The changes in the delinquency and charge-off rates from year to year reflect the trend in unsecured consumer credit quality which is being experienced throughout the industry. This trend is continuing in the first quarter of 1997.           Over the last three years, average managed receivables have grown at a compound annual rate of 53%. This receivable growth has greatly contributed to higher net income and earnings per share. A significant component of this receivable growth strategy is the Company's continuing efforts to market "risk-adjusted" credit card products, whereby credit cards are issued with lower rates to customers whose credit quality is expected to result in a lower rate of credit losses (the "risk-adjusted pricing strategy"). The Company's pricing structure on its credit card products also reflects low "introductory" credit card rates, which reprice upwards after an introductory period of up to one year. It is estimated that approximately $3 billion of receivables will reprice upwards in the first quarter of 1997. At repricing, most of the receivables on these credit cards will have been securitized, and consequently, the enhanced revenues on those receivables will be recorded primarily as increased noninterest revenues (securitization income). Although this will not affect the owned net interest margin, it is expected that it will positively impact the managed net interest margin.           Net income for 1995 of $136.7 million increased $30.6 million or 29% from the $106.1 million reported for 1994. Earnings per share of $3.20 increased 24% from the $2.58 reported for 1994. Earnings grew in 1995 primarily as a result of a 56% increase in average managed receivables, from $6.1 billion in 1994 to $9.5 billion in 1995, partially offset by an approximate 13% contraction in the managed net interest margin. Noninterest revenues of $543.0 million in 1995 increased $147.2 million or 37% from $395.8 million in 1994. This increase was primarily due to a 62% increase in average securitized receivables. The operating expense ratio decreased to 2.9% in 1995 from 3.7% in 1994. The total managed charge-off rate for 1995 fell to 2.2% from 2.3% in 1994.           On March 17, 1997, the Company announced that it expects to report 1997 results well below previous expectations. The Company stated it expects to report a loss in the area of $20 million, or approximately $0.44 cents per share, for the first quarter, and to report net profit for full-year 1997 of approximately $1.50 per share. This interruption in the Company's historical pattern of strong financial results reflects a number of factors, including continuing increases in consumer bankruptcies and charge-offs and lower receivable balances than originally anticipated in its credit card business. The Company's mortgage financing, leasing and insurance businesses continue to perform well. In addition to considering other strategic alternatives with its financial and other advisors, the Company is pursuing a number of steps to return the Company to its historical levels of financial performance by increasing revenues and stemming credit card losses.           This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, including but not limited to projections of future earnings, that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. The most significant among these risks and uncertainties are: (1) the Company's managed net interest margin, which in turn is affected by the Company's success in originating new credit card accounts, the receivables volume and initial pricing of new accounts, the impact of repricing existing accounts and account attrition, the mix of account types and interest rate fluctuations; (2) the level of delinquencies and charge-offs; and (3) the level of expenses. Earnings also may be affected by factors that affect consumer debt, competitive pressures and the ratings on debt of the Company and its subsidiaries. Additional risks that may affect the Company's future performance are detailed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the Company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  NET INTEREST INCOME  Net interest income represents the excess of income generated from interest-earning assets, including on-balance sheet receivables, investments and money market instruments over the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and debt.      26                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries           Net interest income of $78.3 million for 1996 increased $5.4 million or 7% from 1995 as a result of a $1.7 billion or 63% increase in average interest-earning assets, largely offset by a lower owned net interest margin, which fell to 1.84% in 1996 from 2.80% in 1995. The lower owned net interest margin resulted from a 99 basis point decrease in the yield on average interest-earning assets as a significant amount of credit cards on the balance sheet are at introductory rates, partially offset by a 34 basis point decrease in the cost of funds.           Net interest income of $72.9 million for 1995 increased $2.5 million or 4% from 1994 as a result of a $737 million or 37% increase in average interest-earning assets, largely offset by a lower owned net interest margin, which fell to 2.80% in 1995 from 3.67% in 1994. The lower owned net interest margin primarily resulted from a 124 basis point increase in the cost of funds.           Credit card, personal finance, and business loan and lease receivable securitization activity shifts revenues from interest income to noninterest revenues. This ongoing securitization activity reduces the level of higher-yielding receivables on the balance sheet while proportionately increasing the balance sheet levels of new lower-yielding receivables and money market assets. Net interest income on securitized credit card balances is reflected in credit card securitization income. Net interest income on securitized mortgage and other personal finance loans is reflected in income from personal finance activities, and net interest income on securitized business loans and leases is reflected in business loan and lease other revenues. All securitization income is included in noninterest revenues. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements.           Average managed credit card receivables of $12.2 billion for 1996 increased $4.5 billion or 58% from 1995. This increase resulted from the successful marketing of low introductory rate credit cards which generated approximately 1.7 million new accounts. In 1996, average owned credit card receivables were $2.6 billion compared to $1.6 billion in 1995.           Average managed personal finance loans increased to $2.1 billion in 1996, a 38% increase from $1.5 billion in 1995. The average balance of owned personal finance loans increased to $243 million in 1996 from $185 million in 1995. Personal finance loan originations of $1.5 billion in 1996 were up $728 million or 94% from 1995. Yields on owned personal finance loans increased to 10.62% from 9.38% in 1995 reflecting a lower proportion of nonperforming loans on the balance sheet in 1996 versus the prior year.           Average managed business loans and leases of $604 million increased $289 million or 92% from 1995. Average owned balances of business loans and leases increased $116 million or 138% during 1996 primarily due to the success of the business credit card, as originations increased 552% from $80 million in 1995 to $519 million in 1996. Additionally, during 1996, the Company completed its first business card securitizations totaling $229 million of receivables. Yields on owned business loans and leases decreased to 11.97% in 1996 from 12.59% in 1995.           The owned average cost of funds dropped to 6.12% from 6.46% in 1995. The Company has utilized derivatives to manage interest rate risk (see discussion under "Derivatives Activities").           The following table provides an analysis of both owned and managed interest income and expense data, average balance sheet data, net interest spread (the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities), and net interest margin (the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid to fund interest-earning assets) for 1994 through 1996. Average owned loan and lease receivables and the related interest revenues include certain loan fees.       27                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries

In the Consolidated Income Statements, securitized net interest income is reported as noninterest revenues. In addition, the provision for credit losses includes the amount by which the provision for credit losses would have been higher had the securitized receivables remained as owned and the provision for credit losses been equal to actual reported charge-offs (see Asset Quality). Noninterest revenues exclude the net interest income and credit losses associated with the securitized credit card receivables.  PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  The provision for credit losses of $96.9 million in 1996 increased $43.5 million or 82% from $53.3 million in 1995. The increase was primarily due to higher charge-offs on owned receivables, which increased 66% from $42.5 million in 1995 to $70.6 million in 1996 and to the higher levels of impaired assets which continued to increase throughout the year.           The provision for credit losses of $53.3 million in 1995 increased $19.1 million or 56% from $34.2 million in 1994. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the desired level of reserves given the increase in impaired assets and delinquency levels during 1995.

The increase includes a $33.8 million gain on the sale of credit card customer relationships in June 1996. Excluding this gain, noninterest revenues increased $229.7 million or 42% from 1995. This rise resulted primarily from income derived from increased securitization activity in all areas, as described below.           Due to the securitization of credit card receivables, activity from securitized account balances, which otherwise would be reported as net interest income and charge-offs, is reported in securitization income and servicing income, both of which are included in noninterest revenues. Credit card securitization activities were affected by the adoption in the third quarter of 1996 of a new charge-off methodology relating to bankruptcies (see Asset Quality), the upward repricing of interest rates and fees, increases in charge-offs and the related impact on reserves, all of which had an approximate $50 million impact (earnings increase) in 1996, as well as a 57% increase in average securitized receivables. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of securitization income.           The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") has issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 125 "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities" ("SFAS 125"). This statement is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after December 31, 1996, and will be applied prospectively. The adoption of SFAS 125 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.           Credit card servicing income, which represents fees paid to the Company for continuing to service accounts which have been securitized, increased to $176.6 million in 1996 from $117.4 million in 1995, in line with the increase in securitized credit cards. Such fees generally approximate 2% of securitized receivables.           Interchange income represents fees that are payable by merchants to the credit card issuer for sale transactions. Total interchange income, which represents approximately 1.4% of credit card purchases, increased 11% to $102.8 million in 1996 from $92.4 million in 1995.      31                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries           During 1996, the Company securitized $1.4 billion of mortgage and home equity loans compared to $542 million in 1995. As a result, income from personal finance activities of $109.2 million for 1996 increased 116% from $50.5 million in 1995. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of income from personal finance activities.           Business loan and lease other revenues increased $20.6 million to $61.6 million in 1996 primarily due to a 75% growth in average securitized business loans and leases from 1995. Insurance revenues, net, were $38.2 million in 1996, an increase of $8.0 million over 1995. This growth is attributed to the successful marketing of insurance products in the credit card, personal finance, and business loan and lease areas.           Noninterest revenues of $543.0 million in 1995 increased $147.2 million or 37% from $395.8 million in 1994, primarily due to increases in credit card securitization, servicing and interchange income, as well as higher business loan and lease and insurance revenues. Noninterest revenues for 1994 included an $18.4 million gain on the sale of credit card customer relationships.

This increase resulted primarily from amortization related to the increased spending on credit card origination costs that were incurred over the last eighteen months (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).           Total other operating expenses of $434.7 million for 1996 were up $156.3 million or 56% from $278.4 million in 1995. The increase in total other operating expenses is attributable, in part, to a $66.0 million or 57% increase in salaries and employee benefits as a result of an increase in the number of employees from 2,409 at year-end 1995 to 3,541 at year-end 1996, including the addition of senior management to assist in the strategic growth of the various business units. Other factors affecting the increase in other operating expenses were a $25.3 million or 169% increase in professional fees primarily as a result of corporate strategic initiatives as well as an overall increase in credit card related costs comparable to the 58% increase in average managed credit card receivables.      32                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries           The amortization of credit card deferred origination costs, net, increased from $39.4 million in 1994 to $72.3 million in 1995. This increase resulted primarily from amortization related to the $80.6 million of credit card origination costs that were incurred since the fourth quarter of 1994 (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).           Total other operating expenses of $278.4 million for 1995 were up $51.0 million or 22% from $227.4 million in 1994. Part of the increase in total other operating expenses resulted from a $28.0 million or 32% increase in salaries and employee benefits. Other factors affecting the increase in other operating expenses were a $5.8 million or 26% increase in external processing resulting primarily from a 27% increase in the number of accounts managed year-to-year, and an overall increase in credit card related costs.  INCOME TAXES  The Company's consolidated income tax expense was $89.1 million for 1996, or an effective tax rate of 34%, compared to tax expense of $75.2 million, or a 36% effective rate, in 1995 and tax expense of $59.1 million, or a 36% effective rate, in 1994. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 1995 to 1996 resulted from a higher level of insurance-related activities, tax credits from investments and lower levels of state income taxes.  ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT  The financial condition of Advanta Corp. is managed with a focus on maintaining high credit quality standards, disciplined interest rate risk management and prudent levels of leverage and liquidity.  INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY  Interest rate sensitivity refers to net interest income variability resulting from mismatches between asset and liability indices (basis risk) and the effects which changes in market interest rates have on asset and liability repricing mismatches (gap risk).           The Company attempts to minimize the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and net income by regularly evaluating the risk inherent in its asset and liability structure, including securitized assets. This risk arises from continuous changes in the Company's asset/liability mix, market interest rates, the yield curve, prepayment trends and the timing of cash flows. Computer simulations are used to evaluate net interest income volatility under varying rate, spread and volume projections over monthly time periods of up to two years.           In managing its interest rate sensitivity position, the Company periodically securitizes receivables, sells and purchases assets, alters the mix and term structure of its funding base, changes its investment portfolio and short-term investment position, and uses derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and create match funding of assets and liabilities. Derivative financial instruments, by policy, are not used for any speculative purposes (see discussion under "Derivatives Activities"). The Company has primarily utilized variable rate funding in pricing its credit card securitization transactions in an attempt to match the variable rate pricing dynamics of the underlying receivables sold to the trusts. Variable rate funding is used on the balance sheet as well, in support of unsecuritized receivables which carry variable rates. Although credit card receivable rates are generally set at a spread over a floating rate index, they often contain interest rate floors. These floors have the impact of converting the credit card receivables to fixed rate receivables in a low interest rate environment. In addition, the Company at times offers fixed rate pricing to consumers for the introductory rate period of its credit cards. In instances when a significant portion of credit card receivables carry fixed rate introductory pricing or are at their floors, the Company may convert part of the underlying funding to a fixed rate by using interest rate hedges, swaps and fixed rate securitizations. In pricing mortgage and business loan and lease securitizations, both fixed rate and variable rate funding are used depending upon the characteristics of the underlying receivables and the overall interest rate risk exposure to the Company. Additionally, basis risk exists in on-balance sheet       33                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries  funding as well as in securitizing credit card receivables at a spread over the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") when the rate on the underlying assets is indexed to the prime rate. The Company measures the basis risk resulting from potential variability in the spread between prime and LIBOR and incorporates such risk into the asset and liability management process. During 1996, substantially all new credit cards were issued using LIBOR as the repricing index. The effect of this change is the reduction of prime/LIBOR basis risk over time. The Company continues to seek cost-effective alternatives for minimizing this risk.           Interest rate fluctuations affect net interest income at virtually all financial institutions. While interest rate volatility does have an effect on net interest income, other factors also contribute significantly to changes in net interest income. Specifically, within the credit card portfolio, pricing decisions and customer behavior regarding convenience usage affect the yield on the portfolio. These factors may counteract or exacerbate income changes due to fluctuating interest rates. The Company closely monitors interest rate movements, competitor pricing and consumer behavioral changes in its ongoing analysis of net interest income sensitivity.  LIQUIDITY, FUNDING AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  The Company's goal is to maintain an adequate level of liquidity, both long and short-term, through active management of both assets and liabilities. During 1996, the Company, through its subsidiaries, securitized $3.4 billion of credit card receivables, $1.4 billion of mortgage and home equity loans and $363 million of business loans and leases. Cash generated from these transactions was temporarily invested in short-term, high quality investments at money market rates awaiting redeployment to pay down borrowings and to fund future receivable growth. See the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for more information regarding liquidity, funding and capital resources. In addition, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Supplemental Schedules thereto for additional information regarding the Company's investment portfolio.           Over the last nine years, the Company has successfully accessed the securitization market to efficiently support its growth strategy. While securitization should continue to be a reliable source of funding for the Company, other funding sources are available and include deposits, medium-term notes, senior and subordinated debt, repurchase agreements, committed and uncommitted bank lines, bank notes, federal funds purchased and the ability to sell assets and raise additional equity.           In February 1995, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Advanta National Bank ("Advanta National" or "ANB"), a Delaware based credit card bank, commenced operations. The Company's initial capitalization of Advanta National was $50 million, consisting of $25 million in common stock and $25 million of additional paid in capital. Additional capital totaling $114 million and $39 million was contributed during 1996 and 1995, respectively, in order to maintain Advanta National as a "well capitalized" bank under applicable regulations. As a credit card bank, Advanta National is limited to one office, can engage only in consumer credit card operations and cannot accept deposits other than savings and time deposits of $100,000 or more. Advanta National had total assets of $2.2 billion at December 31, 1996.           Funding diversification is an essential component of the Company's liquidity management. The debt securities of Advanta Corp., Advanta National Bank USA ("AUS"), and ANB investment-grade ratings from the nationally recognized rating agencies throughout 1996. These ratings allowed the Company to further diversify its funding sources. In March 1997, the various rating agencies lowered their ratings on the debt securities of each of Advanta Corp., AUS and ANB by one or two grades. As of March 17, 1997, debt of the two banks, AUS and ANB, was still rated at or above the lowest level of investment grade by each agency; debt of the parent company, Advanta Corp., maintained investment grade ratings (at or above the lowest investment grade level) from three of the rating agencies, but was rated one level below investment grade by Standard & Poors and two levels below investment grade by Moody's Investors Service. Efforts continue to develop new sources of funding, both through previously untapped customer segments and through developing new financing structures.            In August 1995, in a public offering, the Company sold 2,500,000 depositary shares each representing a one-hundredth interest in a share of Stock Appreciation Income Linked Securities ("SAILS"). The SAILS constitute a series of the Company's Class B Preferred Stock, designated as 6 3/4% Convertible Class B Preferred Stock, Series 1995 (SAILS). On September 15, 1999, unless either previously redeemed by the Company or converted at the option of the holder, each share of the SAILS will automatically convert into 100 shares of Class B Common Stock. Proceeds from the offering, net of underwriting discount, were approximately $90 million. The Company used the proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including financing the growth of its subsidiaries.      34                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries           In September 1995, AUS and Advanta National (the "Banks") established a $2.25 billion bank note program. Under this program, the Banks may issue an aggregate of $2.0 billion of senior bank notes and $250 million of subordinated bank notes. These notes may have maturities ranging from seven days to fifteen years from date of issuance.           In July 1996, the Company's $510 million revolving credit facility was replaced with a new $1 billion revolving credit facility. A portion of this facility is available to the Banks as well. Also, in July, the Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $1.6 billion of debt securities.           On December 17, 1996, Advanta Capital Trust I, a newly formed statutory business trust established by the Company (the "Trust"), issued in a private offering to two institutional investors $100 million of capital securities, representing preferred beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust (the "Capital Securities"). The sole assets of the Trust consist of $100 million of 8.99% junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company due December 17, 2026 (the "Junior Subordinated Debentures"). The Capital Securities will be subject to mandatory redemption under certain circumstances, including at any time on or after December 17, 2006 upon the optional prepayment by the Company of the Junior Subordinated Debentures. The Company has guaranteed the obligations of the Trust. The Company used the proceeds from the sale for general corporate purposes.           At the Advanta parent company level, steady building of liquidity and capital in 1996 and 1995 was achieved as a result of $135 million of net dividends from subsidiaries in 1996 and $66.1 million in 1995. The Board of Directors currently intends to have the Company pay regular quarterly dividends to its shareholders, maintaining an approximate 20% premium on the dividend paid on the Class B common shares; however, the Company plans to reinvest the majority of its earnings to support future growth. In the fourth quarter of 1996, the quarterly dividends on the Class A Common and Class B Common shares were raised to $.11 and $.132 respectively, from the previous levels of $.09 and $.108.           At December 31, 1996, the Company was carrying $1.5 billion of loans available for sale. The fair value of such loans was in excess of their carrying value at year end. In connection with liquidity and asset/liability management, the Company had $1.7 billion of investments available for sale at December 31, 1996.

For the fiscal CEBA year ended September 30, 1996, AUS's average assets did not exceed the allowable amount and, accordingly, AUS was in full compliance with CEBA growth limits. However, on September 30, 1996 this growth rate provision of CEBA was repealed which has created substantial new flexibility with respect to asset/liability management for AUS and ultimately the Company. The timing and size of securitizations, on-balance sheet liability structure and rapid changes in balance sheet structure have frequently been due to the management of AUS's balance sheet within this growth constraint. As a result of the elimination of this growth restriction, the Company is currently evaluating the corporate structure  of its two banking subsidiaries.           In addition to AUS's total deposits of $1.2 billion, deposits at December 31, 1996 included $705.1 million of time deposits at Advanta National and $50.4 million of deposits at Advanta Financial Corp. ("AFC"), a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial loan corporation. AFC's assets and operations are not currently material to the Company, and the Company does not expect them to become material in the near term.           While there are no specific capital requirements for Advanta Corp., the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency requires that AUS and Advanta National maintain a risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%. Both banks were in excess of the required level and exceeded the minimum capital level of 10% required for designation as a "well-capitalized" depository institution. At December 31, 1996 and 1995, AUS's risk-based capital ratio was 15.84% and 11.56%, respectively. Advanta National's risk-based capital ratio at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was 17.20% and 12.28%, respectively. The Company intends to take the necessary actions to maintain AUS and Advanta National, at a minimum, as "adequately capitalized" banks. In addition, the Company's insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain capital, deposit and dividend rules and regulations as prescribed by state jurisdictions in which they are authorized to operate. At December 31, 1996 and 1995 the insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with all requisite rules and regulations.       36                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  The Company spent $78.4 million for capital expenditures in 1996, primarily for the purchase of land and a building in Pennsylvania, leasehold improvements to both the Company's new headquarters and a Colorado office building, additional space in existing buildings, office and voice communication equipment and furniture and fixtures. This compared to $20.6 million for capital expenditures in 1995 and $24.1 million in 1994.           In 1997, the Company anticipates capital expenditures to be comparable to those of 1996 to accommodate growth in its operating units.  DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES  The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risks. The Company has a number of mechanisms in place that enable it to monitor and control both market and credit risk from these derivatives activities. At the broader level, all derivatives strategies are managed under a hedging policy approved by the Board of Directors that details the use of such derivatives and the individuals authorized to execute derivatives transactions. All derivatives strategies must be approved by the Company's senior management (President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer).           As part of this approval process, a market risk analysis is completed to determine the potential impact on the Company from severe negative (stressed) movements in the market. By policy, derivatives transactions may only be used to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risks or for cost reduction and may not be used for speculative purposes. As such, the impact of any derivatives transaction is calculated using the Company's asset/liability model to determine its suitability.           The Company's Investment Committee (a management committee) has a counterparty credit policy. This policy details the maximum credit exposure, transaction limit and transaction term for counterparties based on an internally assigned Investment Committee credit rating. Internal counterparty credit ratings reflect the credit ratings from nationally recognized rating agencies, as well as other significant credit factors where appropriate. Each counterparty's credit quality is reviewed as new information becomes available, and, in any case, at least quarterly. Activities with counterparties will be suspended if there is reason to believe that their credit quality is below the Company's set standards.           For each counterparty, credit exposure amounts are calculated in a stress environment and represent the maximum aggregate credit exposure from derivatives and other capital market transactions the Company is willing to accept from an individually approved counterparty. To manage counterparty exposure, the Company also uses negotiated agreements that establish threshold exposure amounts for each counterparty above which the Company has the right to call for and receive collateral for the amount of such excess, thereby limiting its exposure to the threshold amount. The threshold levels can be fixed or may change as the credit rating of the counterparty changes, and in all cases, the threshold levels are well below the maximum allowable exposure amounts described above.           Counterparty master agreements and any collateral agreements, by policy, must be signed prior to the execution of any derivatives transactions with a counterparty. To date, substantially all master agreements with counterparties have included bilateral collateral agreements. As such, the potential exposure from a particular counterparty is limited to the maximum threshold level for that counterparty.           The Company has a treasury middle office independent of the trading function, which measures, monitors and reports on credit, market and liquidity risk exposures from capital markets, hedging and derivative product activities. It is the responsibility of this department to ensure compliance with respect to the hedging policy, including the counterparty transaction limits, transaction terms and trader authorizations. In addition, this department marks each derivatives position to market on a weekly basis using both internal and external models. These models have been benchmarked against a sample of      37                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries  derivatives dealers' valuation models for accuracy. Position and counterparty exposure reports are generated and used to manage collateral requirements of the counterparty and the Company.           All of these procedures and processes are designed to provide reasonable assurance that prior to and after the execution of any derivatives strategy, market, credit and liquidity risks are fully analyzed and incorporated into the Company's asset/liability and risk measurement models and the proper accounting treatment for the transaction is identified and executed.           During 1996, the FASB issued its exposure draft for accounting for hedging and derivatives. This draft, an attempt to standardize accounting treatment for derivatives and hedging, would materially alter the accounting treatment for the use of such instruments in the reduction of interest rate risk. The FASB is currently reviewing comments received on the exposure draft. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of these deliberations at this time.  CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT  Management regularly reviews the loan portfolio in order to evaluate the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses. The evaluation includes such factors as the inherent credit quality of the loan portfolio, past experience, current economic conditions, projected credit losses and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio. The reserve for credit losses is maintained for on-balance sheet receivables. The on-balance sheet reserve is intended to cover all credit losses inherent in the owned loan portfolio. With regard to securitized assets, anticipated losses and related recourse reserves are reflected in the calculations of Securitization Income, Amounts due from Credit Card Securitizations and Other Assets. Recourse reserves are intended to cover all probable credit losses over the life of the securitized receivables. Management evaluates both its on-balance sheet and recourse reserve requirements and, as appropriate, effects additions to and/or transfers between these accounts.           The reserve for credit losses on a consolidated basis was $89.2 million, or 3.4% of owned receivables, at December 31, 1996, compared to $53.5 million, or 1.9% of owned receivables, at December 31, 1995. The reserve for credit losses on a consolidated basis was $41.6 million, or 2.1% of owned receivables, in 1994.  ASSET QUALITY  Impaired assets include both nonperforming assets (personal finance loans and business loans and leases past due 90 days or more, real estate owned, bankrupt, decedent and fraudulent credit card accounts, and off-lease equipment) and accruing loans past due 90 days or more on credit cards. The carrying value for real estate owned is based on net realizable value after taking into account holding costs and costs of disposition and is reflected in other assets.           Gross interest income that would have been recorded in 1996 and 1995 for owned nonperforming assets, had interest been accrued throughout the year in accordance with the assets' original terms, was approximately $3.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively. The amount of interest on nonperforming assets included in income for 1996 and 1995 was $.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively.           In the third quarter of 1996, the Company adopted a new charge-off methodology related to bankrupt credit card accounts, providing for up to a 90-day (rather than up to a 30-day) investigative period following notification of the bankruptcy petition, prior to charge-off. This new methodology is consistent with others in the credit card industry. The 1996 credit statistics set forth in the following table reflect this change in methodology.           On the total managed portfolio, impaired assets were $420.5 million, or 2.6% of receivables, at year end 1996 compared to $167.1 million, or 1.4% of receivables, in 1995. Nonperforming assets on the total managed portfolio were $191.7 million, or 1.2% of receivables, compared to $82.2 million, or .7%, in 1995. The total managed charge-off rate for 1996 was 3.2%, compared to 2.2% for 1995. The charge-off rate on managed credit cards was 3.7% for 1996 compared to 2.5% for 1995. As of March 17, 1997, the Company was projecting estimated 1997 charge-off rates on the total managed portfolio of 5.2%-5.6% for the first quarter and 5.0%-6.0% for the full year, and rates on managed credit cards of 6.6%-7.0% for the first quarter and 6.5%-7.5% for the full year.    38                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries           The 30 day and over delinquency rate on the managed portfolio rose to 5.4% at December 31, 1996 compared to 3.3% at December 31, 1995. The 30 day and over delinquency rate on managed credit cards was 5.0% at year end 1996 compared to 2.6% at year end 1995. As of March 17, 1997, the Company was projecting estimated 30 day and over delinquency rates as of March 31, 1997 of 5.7%-6.1% of the total managed portfolio, and of 5.2%-5.6% of managed credit cards.           Past due loans represent accruing loans that are past due 90 days or more as to collection of principal and interest. Credit card receivables, except those on bankrupt, decedent and fraudulent accounts, continue to accrue interest until the time they are charged off at 186 days contractual delinquency. In contrast, all personal finance loans and business loans and leases are put on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due.           During 1994, the Company implemented a new policy for the charge-off of mortgage loans. Under this policy, when a nonperforming mortgage loan becomes twelve months delinquent, the Company writes down the loan to its net realizable value, regardless of anticipated collectibility. Consequently, in 1994, all mortgage loans that had been twelve or more months delinquent, as well as any mortgages that became twelve months delinquent during the year were written down to their net realizable value.       39                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries           The following tables provide a summary of reserves, impaired assets, delinquencies
