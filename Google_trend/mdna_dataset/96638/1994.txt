ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   Overview  Net income for 1993 rose to $76.6 million or $1.92 per share. This reflects increases of 60% and 39%, respectively, from the $48.0 million or $1.38 per share reported in 1992. Net income before extraordinary item was $77.9 million or $1.95 per share, increases of 62% and 41%, respectively, from 1992. Earnings per share for 1993 incorporated a 15% increase in the number of common shares outstanding versus 1992, reflecting an equity offering by the Company in March 1993. Earnings per share for 1992 have been adjusted to reflect an effective three-for-two stock split as a result of the October 15, 1993 stock dividend.       Earnings for 1993 increased primarily as a result of a $1.1 billion or 34% increase in average managed receivables, continued improvement in credit quality with the total managed charge-off rate decreasing from 3.4% in 1992 to 2.9% in 1993, and controlled growth in operating expenses. The Company continues to securitize a majority of the growth in its receivables and to report the performance of the securitized receivables as noninterest revenues. Consequently, the 34% increase in average managed receivables resulted in a $62.5 million or 32% increase in noninterest revenues to $255.6 million in 1993, from $193.1 million in 1992. As a result of improved credit quality, the provision for credit losses in 1993 fell to $29.8 million from $47.1 million in 1992. Despite a lower provision, reserve coverage of impaired owned assets was higher at December 31, 1993 compared to a year ago. Disciplined cost management resulted in operating expenses increasing only 27%, while average managed receivables grew 34% and the operating expense ratio fell to 4.1% for 1993 compared to 4.4% in 1992.       Net interest income of $72.1 million for 1993 increased $3.4 million or  5% from 1992 as a result of a $170 million increase in average earning asset  balances, offset by a 22 basis point drop in the owned net interest margin.  The Company is executing a strategy to market a "risk-adjusted" credit card  product in which credit cards are issued with lower rates to customers whose  credit quality is expected to result in a lower rate of credit losses (the "risk-adjusted" strategy). This strategy resulted in a drop in credit card yields thereby lowering the owned net interest margin.       Over the last three years, average managed receivables have grown at a compound annual rate of 34%. This receivable growth has generated higher financial returns, net income and earnings per share. The Company intends to continue pursuing a strategy of receivable growth with a goal of increasing average managed receivables by 30% or more in 1994.         Net income for 1992 of $48.0 million or $1.38 per share increased 91% and 72%, respectively, from $25.2 million or $.81 per share in 1991.         Earnings increased in 1992 primarily as a result of an $807 million or 34% increase in average managed receivables and a 51 basis point increase in the managed net interest margin. Average securitized assets rose 67% in 1992 increasing noninterest revenues $59.8 million or 45%. The largest single component of noninterest revenues, credit card securitization income, rose $38.3 million or 90% as average securitized credit card receivables increased 85%.        The provision for credit losses was down 15% in 1992 compared to 1991 as a result of lower charge-offs and delinquency levels on owned receivables. Operating expenses increased 28% with a 34% increase in average managed receivables, while operating expenses as a percentage of average managed receivables fell to 4.4% in 1992 from 4.6% in 1991.

AND SUBSIDIARIES  The owned net interest margin fell to 4.85% in 1993 from 5.07% in 1992, due to a 173 basis point decrease in the yield on interest earning assets partially offset by a 151 basis point improvement in the cost of funding those assets. In 1993, the owned net interest margin of 4.85% reflects the benefit of the March 1993 equity offering and increased retained earnings.            Credit card, mortgage and lease receivable securitization activity shifts revenues from interest income to noninterest revenues. This ongoing securitization activity reduces the level of higher-yielding receivables on the balance sheet while increasing the quantity of lower-yielding money market assets. While the money market assets are subsequently replaced with new receivables, the active securitization program reduces the average yield of the on-balance sheet portfolio. Net interest income on securitized credit card balances is reflected in credit card securitization income. Net interest income on securitized mortgage loans is reflected in income from mortgage banking activities, and net interest income on securitized lease receivables is reflected in leasing revenues, net. All securitization income is included in noninterest revenues. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements.           Average managed credit card receivables of $3.0 billion for 1993 increased $755 million or 34% from 1992. This increase can be attributed to several successful credit card campaigns which generated approximately 853,000 new accounts and a large volume of balance transfers by card- holders. Owned receivable balances would have been higher in both years had it not been for the securitization of $1.0 billion of credit card receivables in 1993 and $950 million in 1992. The 241 basis point decline in the yield on owned credit card receivables was the result of the Company's "risk-adjusted" strategy and the influence of a predominance of newer, lower-yielding accounts in the owned portfolio. It is anticipated that these accounts will start repricing upwards in 1994.           Average managed mortgage loans increased to $1.0 billion in 1993, a 34% increase from $786.3 million in 1992. The average balance of owned mortgage loans de-creased to $154.2 million in 1993 from $185.6 million in 1992 primarily due to the securitization of $608 million of receivables in 1993. Mortgage loan originations of $510 million in 1993 were up $84 million or 20% from 1992. Yields on owned mortgage loans decreased to 9.91% from 11.40% in 1992 reflecting the lower rate environment and a significant increase in the proportion of first lien mortgage loans in the portfolio.           Average managed lease receivables of $154.8 million increased $45 million or 42% from 1992. Average owned balances on leases increased $12.7 million during 1993 due to increased originations and portfolio purchases. Yields on owned leases increased from 17.46% in 1992 to 18.70% in 1993 due to a higher amount of late fees.           A significant decline in the owned average cost of funds was experienced in 1993 as the cost of funds fell to 5.18% from 6.39% in 1992. The rollover of deposits in a lower rate environment, lower money market rates, and the Company's entrance into funding markets not previously available to them with a newly acquired investment-grade rating were the primary reasons for this decline.            Net interest income of $68.7 million in 1992 dropped slightly from $69.3 million in 1991 primarily as a result of a 61 basis point decline in the owned net interest margin. This decline in the owned net interest margin was a result of a 218 basis point decline in yields on interest earning assets partially offset by a 157 basis point improvement in the cost of funding those assets. Offsetting this decline in the owned net interest margin was a $96 million increase in average interest earning asset balances.           The following table provides an analysis of both owned and managed interest income and expense data, average balance sheet data, net interest spread (the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities), and net interest margin (the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid to fund interest earning assets) for 1991 through 1993. Average owned loan and lease receivables and the related interest revenues exclude deferred origination costs and the amortization thereof (see Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements) and include certain loan fees.                                            23    20                                                 ADVANTA CORP.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES - - - --------------------------- The provision for credit losses of $29.8 million in 1993 decreased $17.3 million or 37% from $47.1 million in 1992. This decrease can be attributed to lower charge-offs on owned receivables, which on a consolidated basis were 2.4% of average receivables compared to 3.9% in 1992, and to lower levels of impaired assets. The owned impaired asset level fell to $22.5 million at December 31, 1993, from $31.6 million a year ago. Lower delinquency levels helped to strengthen the Company's reserve coverage of impaired assets to 138.6% at December 31, 1993, from 127.4% a year ago.          During 1993, the Company transferred $11 million of on-balance sheet unallocated loan loss reserves to increase off-balance sheet mortgage loan recourse reserves, which reserves are netted against excess mortgage servicing rights.            The provision for credit losses of $47.1 million in 1992 decreased $8.4 million or 15% from $55.5 million in 1991. This decrease was primarily due to lower charge-offs on owned receivables and lower impaired asset levels.

Due to the securitization of credit card receivables, activity from securitized account balances normally reported as net interest income and charge-offs is reported in securitization income and servicing income, both of which are included in noninterest revenues.  Credit card securitization income increased 68% to $135.8 million from $80.8 million in 1992 while average securitized credit card receivables increased 46% to $2.1 billion in 1993 from $1.5 billion in the prior year. Securitization income as a percentage of average securitized receivables was 6.4% in 1993 compared with 5.6% for 1992. See Note 1 to Con-solidated Financial Statements for further description of securitization income.            Credit card securitization income is the revenue collected on the securitized receivables, including interest, interchange income and certain fees, less the related ex-penses, including interest payments to investors in the trusts, charge-offs, servicing costs and transaction expenses.           Credit card servicing income increased to $41.6 million in 1993 from $28.6 million in 1992. Servicing income represents fees paid to the Company for continuing to service accounts which have been securitized. Such fees approximate 2% of securitized receivables.            Total interchange income earned represents approximately 1.4% of credit card purchases. The amount of inter-change paid to the securitization trusts ranges from 1% to 2% of securitized balances and is included in credit card securitization income. Interchange income decreased 39% to $18.8 million in 1993 from $30.7 million in 1992 due to a larger proportion of interchange revenues being included in securitization income.  Other credit card revenues, which include credit insurance, cash advance fees and other credit card related revenues, were basically flat year-to-year due to an increasing proportion of credit card revenues becoming part of securitization income. Additionally, the amortization of annual fee income on owned credit card receivables previously had been included in other credit card revenues; beginning in 1993, this amoritization is included as a com-ponent of net interest income.          During 1993, the Company securitized $608 million of mortgage loans compared to $385 million in 1992. In 1993, increased credit losses on the securitized portfolio decreased income from mortgage banking activities by approximately $14 million. Increased prepayments also de-creased income from mortgage banking activities by $14 million in 1993. Consequently, mortgage banking income of $24.1 million was relatively flat compared with 1992. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of mortgage banking income.          Noninterest revenues of $193.1 million in 1992 increased $59.7 million or 45% from $133.4 million in 1991 primarily due to increases in credit card securitization and servicing income.                                             26    23                                        ADVANTA CORP.

The increase in operating expenses can be primarily attrib-uted to: (a) a $13.9 million, or 27%, increase in salaries and employee benefits with a 22% increase in the number of employees from 1992, (b) a $4.9 million increase in marketing expenses as the Company promoted its finan-cial products as well as enhanced its general public visibility, (c) a $3.6 million increase in external processing resulting primarily from a 26% increase in the number of accounts managed year-to-year, (d) a $5.1 million increase in professional fees as the Company invested in long-term planning projects, and (e) an overall increase in credit card related costs due to a 27% increase in the number of accounts managed.          Operating expenses of $137.6 million for 1992 were up $29.8 million or 28% from $107.8 million in 1991 while average managed receivables grew 34%. This increase in operating expenses can be primarily attributed to: (a) a $9.0 million, or 21%, increase in salaries and employee benefits with a 23% increase in the number of employees year-to-year, (b) a $5.7 million increase in marketing expenses to market the Company's financial products and enhance its general visibility, (c) a $2.3 million increase in credit card fraud losses, due to the growth in managed credit card receivables and a higher incidence of fraud, and (d) an overall increase in credit card related costs due to a 15% increase in the number of accounts managed. In 1991, credit card fraud losses included $3.9 million related to the acceleration of charge-offs (see discussion in "Asset Quality" on page 30). The operating expense ratio fell to 4.4% in 1992 from 4.6% in 1991.  INCOME TAXES The Company's consolidated income tax expense was $45.3 million for 1993, or an effective tax rate of 37%, compared to tax expense of $29.1 million, or 38%, in 1992 and tax expense of $14.2 million, or 36%, in 1991. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 1992 to 1993 resulted from a higher level of tax-free income, while the increase in the effective tax rate from 1991 to 1992 resulted from higher pretax income and less tax-free income year-to-year.   ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT - - - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The financial condition of Advanta Corp. is managed with a focus on maintaining high credit quality standards, disci-plined interest rate risk management and prudent levels of leverage and liquidity.  INTEREST RATE SENSIVITY Interest rate sensitivity refers to the net interest income volatility resulting from changes in interest rates, product spread variability and mismatches in the repricing intervals between interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities.            The Company attempts to minimize the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and net income by regularly evaluating the risk inherent in its asset and liability structure, including securitized assets. This risk arises from continuous changes in the Company's asset/liability mix, market interest rates, the yield curve, prepayment trends and the timing of cash flows. Computer simulations are used to evaluate net interest income volatility under varying rate, spread and volume projections over monthly time periods of up to two years.          In managing its interest rate sensitivity position, the Company periodically securitizes, sells and purchases assets, alters the mix and term structure of its retail and institutional funding base and complements its basic business activities by changing the investment portfolio and short-                                             27    24                                            ADVANTA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES  term asset positions. The Company has primarily utilized variable rate funding in pricing its credit card securitization transactions in an attempt to match the pricing dynamics of the underlying receivables sold to the trusts. Although credit card receivables are priced at a spread over the prime rate, they generally contain interest rate floors. These floors have the impact of converting the credit card receivables to fixed rate receivables in a low interest rate environment. In instances when a significant portion of credit card receivables are at their floors, the Company may convert part of the underlying funding to a fixed rate by using interest rate hedges, swaps and fixed rate securitizations. In pricing mortgage and lease securitizations, primarily fixed rate fund-ing is used as nearly all of the receivables sold to investors carry a fixed rate.          Interest rate fluctuations affect net interest income at virtually all financial institutions. While interest rate volatility does have an effect on net interest income, other factors also contribute significantly to changes in net inter-est income. Specifically, within the credit card portfolio, pricing decisions and customer behavior regarding convenience usage affect the yield on the portfolio. These factors may counteract or exacerbate income changes due to fluc-tuating interest rates. The Company closely monitors interest rate movements, competitor pricing and consumer behavioral changes in its ongoing analysis of net interest income sensitivity.  LIQUIDITY, FUNDING, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company's goal is to maintain an adequate level of liquidity, both long- and short-term, through active management of both assets and liabilities. During 1993, the Company, through its subsidiaries, securitized $1.0 billion of credit card receivables, $608 million of mortgage loans and $68 million of lease receivables. Cash generated from these transactions was temporarily invested in short-term, high quality investments at money market rates awaiting redeployment to pay down deposits and to fund future credit card, mortgage loan and lease receivable growth. See Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for more information regarding liquidity, funding and capital resources. In addition, see Note 5 to Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplemental Schedules thereto for additional information regarding the Company's investment portfolio.          Over the last six years, the Company has accessed the securitization market to efficiently support its growth strate-gy. While securitization should continue to be a reliable source of funding for the Company, other funding sources are available and include deposits, subordinated debt, medium-term notes and the ability to sell assets and raise additional equity.            At December 31, 1993, the Company was carrying $668 million of loans available for sale. The fair value of such loans was in excess of their carrying value at year end. In connection with managing liquidity and asset/liability management, the Company had $308 million of investments available for sale at December 31, 1993. See Note 18 to Consolidated Financial Statements for fair value disclosures.            In August 1993, the Company's principal subsidiary, Colonial National Bank USA ("Colonial National" or the "Bank"), sold $50 million of subordinated notes which had received an investment-grade rating and qualified as Tier 2 capital.            The following table details the composition of the deposit base at year end for each of the past five years.

AND SUBSIDIARIES  It is expected that deposits will increase slightly in 1994, as the Bank is likely to expand its asset base within the limits permitted under the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 ("CEBA"). As a grandfathered institution under CEBA, the Company must limit the Bank's asset growth to 7% per annum. For the fiscal CEBA year ended September 30, 1993, the Bank's average assets did not exceed the allowable amount and, accordingly, the Bank was in full compliance with CEBA growth limits.          Deposits at December 31, 1993 include $38 million of deposits at Colonial National Financial Corp. ("CNF"), a Utah state-chartered, FDIC- insured industrial loan corporation (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company). CNF's assets or operations are not currently material to the Company, and the Company does not expect them to become material in the near term.            During 1993, the debt securities of Advanta Corp. achieved investment-grade ratings from the nationally recognized rating agencies. These ratings have allowed the Company to further diversify its funding sources. In November 1993, the Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $1 billion of debt securities, and subsequently sold $150 million of three-year notes under this registration statement. The Company also anticipates selling up to an additional $500 million of medium-term notes as needed. In addition, steady building of liquidity and capital in 1993 and 1992 was achieved as a result of $76.5 million of dividends from subsidiaries in 1993 and $40.0 million in 1992, and retained earnings of $69.3 million in 1993 and $44.0 million in 1992. The Board of Directors currently intends to have the Company pay regular quarterly dividends to its shareholders, maintaining a 20% premium on the dividend paid on the Class B shares; however, the Company plans to reinvest the majority of its earnings to support future growth.            During 1993, the Company raised $90 million in new equity through a 3.0 million share (pre-split) Class B common stock offering. Proceeds were used to support future growth.          Other elements contributed to liquidity at the subsidiary level (other than the Bank) in 1993. Advanta Mortgage Corp. USA ("Advanta Mortgage") had lines of credit totaling $190 million, which, because of other available funding sources, were not renewed when they expired in December 1993. Advanta Leasing Corp. ("Advanta Leasing") also has lines of credit totaling approximately $86 million.            While there are no specific capital requirements for Advanta Corp., the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency requires that Colonial National maintain a risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%. Colonial National's risk-based capital ratio of 12.06% at December 31, 1993 was in excess of the required level and, in fact, exceeded the mini-mum required capital level of 10% for designation as a "well capitalized" depository institution. The Company intends to take the necessary actions to maintain Colonial National as a "well capitalized" bank. In addition, the Company is subject to various rate setting rules and capital regulations related to the Advanta Insurance Companies. At December 31, 1993, the Company was in full compliance with these rules and regulations.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES The Company spent $11.3 million for capital expenditures in 1993, primarily for the purchase of a building, improvements to that building and additional space in other build-ings, office and voice communication equipment and furniture and fixtures. This compared to $5.3 million for capital expenditures in 1992 and $4.2 million in 1991.            In 1994, the Company anticipates capital expenditures to exceed those of 1993 as its facilities are expanding and the Company is continuing to upgrade its voice and comm-unication systems.          In 1994, the Company anticipates that its marketing expenditures will exceed those of 1993 as the Company continues to manage account retention, originate new accounts and develop new consumer products for its customers.  CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT - - - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Management regularly reviews the loan portfolio in order to evaluate the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses. The evaluation includes such factors as the inherent credit quality of the loan portfolio, past experience, current eco-nomic conditions, projected credit losses and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio. The reserve for credit losses is maintained for on-balance sheet receivables. The on-balance sheet reserve is intended to cover all credit losses inherent in the owned loan portfolio. With regard to securitized assets, anticipated losses and related recourse reserves are reflected in the calculations of Securitization Income and Amounts Due From Securitizations. Recourse reserves are intended to cover all probable credit losses over the life of the securitized receivables.                                             29    26                                             ADVANTA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES          The reserve for credit losses on a consolidated basis was $31.2 million, or 2.4% of receivables, at December 31, 1993, down from $40.2 million, or 4.0% of receivables, in 1992. Due to improved credit quality, this reserve level resulted in higher reserve coverage of impaired assets (nonperforming assets and accruing loans past due 90 days or more on credit cards) of 138.6% at December 31, 1993, compared to 127.4% at December 31, 1992. Reserve cover-age of impaired credit card assets was 183.7% at December 31, 1993, down slightly from 187.6% at year end 1992.          The reserve for credit losses on a consolidated basis increased to $40.2 million, or 4.0% of receivables, in 1992 up from $36.4 million, or 2.9% of receivables, in 1991. This reserve level and a decrease in impaired assets resulted in higher reserve coverage of impaired assets.  ASSET QUALITY  Impaired assets include both nonperforming assets (mortgage loans and leases past due 90 days or more, real estate owned, credit card receivables due from cardholders in bankruptcy, and off-lease equipment) and accruing loans past due 90 days or more on credit cards. The carrying values for both real estate owned and equipment held for lease or sale are based on net realizable value after taking into account holding costs and costs of disposition and are reflected in other assets.            On the total managed portfolio, impaired assets were $95.1 million, or 1.8% of receivables, at year end 1993 compared to $92.7 million, or 2.5% of receivables, in 1992. Nonperforming assets on the total managed portfolio were $63.6 million, or 1.2% of receivables, compared to $57.8 million, or 1.6%, in 1992. A key credit quality statistic, the 30-plus-day delinquency rate on managed credit cards, dropped to 2.4% from 3.7% a year ago. The total managed charge-off rate for 1993 was 2.9%, compared to 3.4% for 1992. The charge-off rate on managed credit cards was 3.5% for 1993, down from 4.5% for 1992.           On the total owned portfolio, impaired assets were $22.5 million, or 1.8% of receivables, in 1993 compared to $31.6 million, or 3.2%, in 1992.  Gross interest income that would have been recorded in 1993 and 1992 for owned nonperforming assets, had interest been accrued through-out the year in accordance with the assets' original terms, was approximately $1.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively. The amount of interest on nonperforming assets included in income for 1993 and 1992 was $.3 million and $.5 million, respectively.            Past due loans represent accruing loans that are past due 90 days or more as to collection of principal and interest. Credit card receivables, except those on bankrupt, decedent and fraudulent accounts, continue to accrue interest until the time they are charged off at 186 days contractual delinquency. In contrast, all mortgage loans and leases are put on nonaccrual when they become 90 days past due. Owned credit card receivables past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest were $11.0 million or 1.0% of receivables at December 31, 1993, compared to $16.3 million, or 2.2% of receivables, a year ago.           Through 1990, when the Company received notice that a credit cardholder had filed a bankruptcy petition or was deceased, the Company established a reserve equal to the full balance of the receivable. The receivable, if not paid, would be charged off in accordance with the Com-pany's normal credit card charge-off policy at 186 days contractual delinquency. Likewise, receivables in accounts identified as fraudulent would be reserved against and written off (as an operating expense) when they became 186 days contractually delinquent. These policies are consistent with many leading competitors in the credit card industry.            During 1991, the Company adopted a new policy for the charge-off of bankrupt, decedent and fraudulent credit card accounts. Under the new policy, the Company charges off bankrupt or decedent accounts within 30 days of notification and accounts suspected of being fraudulent after a 90-day investigation period, unless the investigation shows no evidence of fraud. Consequently, in 1991, both newly identified bankrupt, decedent and fraudulent accounts, as well as those previously identified, were written off. The 1991 charge-off rates included in the following tables exclude the effect of this acceleration.           With respect to the mortgage loan business, in 1993 the Company continued to face several difficult challenges: softening real estate values, increased prepayments and a higher level of charge-offs. The managed charge-off rate on mortgage loans increased from .8% in 1992 to 1.3% in 1993. The 1993 charge-off amount includes $3.0 million of accelerated charge-offs. The managed mortgage charge-off rate in 1994 is anticipated to stay at a high level.                                            30    27                                          ADVANTA CORP.
