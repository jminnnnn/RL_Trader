ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  Net income for 1995 of $136.7 million increased $30.6 million or 29% from the $106.1 million reported for 1994. Earnings per share of $3.20 advanced 24% from the $2.58 reported for 1994. The higher earnings resulted primarily from substantial growth in average managed receivables, partially offset by the contraction in the managed net interest margin. Additionally, disciplined cost management and continued strong credit quality performance enhanced the financial results.           Earnings grew in 1995 primarily as a result of a 56% increase in average managed receivables, from $6.1 billion in 1994 to $9.5 billion in 1995, partially offset by an approximate 13% contraction in the managed net interest margin. As a majority of the receivables continue to be securitized, the Company records the net earnings on these securitized receivables as noninterest revenues. Noninterest revenues of $543.0 million in 1995 increased $147.2 million or 37% from $395.8 million in 1994. This increase was primarily due to a 62% increase in average securitized receivables. In 1995, the Company's venture capital unit, Advanta Partners LP, recorded $15.4 million of equity securities gains which are included in noninterest revenues. In 1994, noninterest revenues included an $18.4 million gain on the sale of $150 million of credit card customer relationships. Total other operating expenses (excluding the amortization of credit card deferred origination costs, net) increased only 22% despite the 56% growth in average managed receivables. Thus, the operating expense ratio decreased to 2.9% in 1995 from 3.7% in 1994. The total managed charge-off rate for 1995 fell to 2.2% from 2.3% in 1994.           Average managed receivables have tripled from the $3.2 billion reported in 1992. This receivable growth has greatly contributed to higher net income and earnings per share. The Company intends to continue pursuing a strategy of receivable growth with a goal of increasing average managed receivables by 40% or more in 1996. A significant component of this growth strategy is the Company's continuing efforts to market "risk-adjusted" credit card products, whereby credit cards are issued with lower rates to customers whose credit quality is expected to result in a lower rate of credit losses (the "risk-adjusted pricing strategy"). The Company's pricing structure on its credit card products also reflects low "introductory" credit card rates, which reprice upwards after an introductory period of up to one year. In 1995, as in 1994, the impact of these introductory rates was to reduce the managed net interest margin, as the success of the Company's marketing campaigns resulted in substantial growth of new receivables earning interest at the introductory rates. It is estimated that approximately $2.2 billion of receivables will reprice upwards in the first quarter of 1996. At repricing, most of the receivables on these credit cards will have been securitized, and consequently, the enhanced revenues on those receivables will be recorded primarily as increased noninterest revenues (securitization income).  Although this will not affect the owned net interest margin, it is expected that it will positively impact the managed net interest margin.           Net income for 1994 rose to $106.1 million or $2.58 per share. This reflects increases of 38% and 34%, respectively, from the $76.6 million or $1.92 per share reported in 1993. Earnings for 1994 increased primarily as a result of a $1.9 billion or 45% increase in average managed receivables, improvements in credit quality with the total managed charge-off rate decreasing from 2.9% in 1993 to 2.3% in 1994, and controlled growth in operating expenses. The 45% increase in average managed receivables and an $18.4 million gain on the sale of credit card customer relationships were the major factors in the $140.2 million or 55% increase in noninterest revenues to $395.8 million in 1994, from $255.6 million in 1993. Disciplined cost management resulted in other operating expenses increasing only 30% while average managed receivables grew 45%, lowering the operating expense ratio to 3.7% for 1994 from 4.1% in 1993.

Net interest income of $72.9 million for 1995 increased $2.5 million or 4% from 1994 as a result of a $737 million or 37% increase in average interest earning assets, largely offset by a lower owned net interest margin, which fell to 2.80% in 1995 from 3.67% in 1994. The lower owned net interest margin primarily resulted from a 124 basis point increase in the cost of funds. The yield on average interest earning assets increased 45 basis points, but would have been considerably higher had it not been for the volume of credit card receivables issued at low "introductory" rates.           Net interest income of $70.4 million for 1994 decreased $8.3 million or 11% from 1993 as a result of a lower owned net interest margin partially offset by a $336 million increase in average earning asset balances. The significant increase in credit cards offered at low "introductory" rates in 1994 compared to the previous year contributed to the lower owned net interest margin.           Credit card, mortgage and lease receivable securitization activity shifts revenues from interest income to noninterest revenues. This ongoing securitization activity reduces the level of higher-yielding receivables on the balance sheet while proportionately increasing the balance sheet levels of new lower-yielding receivables and money market assets. Net interest income on securitized credit card balances is reflected in credit card securitization income. Net interest income on securitized mortgage loans is reflected in income from mortgage banking activities, and net interest income on securitized lease receivables is reflected in leasing revenues, net. All securitization income is included in noninterest revenues. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements.           Average managed credit card receivables of $7.7 billion for 1995 increased $3.0 billion or 64% from 1994. This increase resulted from the very successful marketing of low introductory rate credit cards which generated approximately 1.7 million new accounts and from large volumes of balance transfers from both new and established cardholders. In 1995, average owned credit card receivables were $1.6 billion compared to $1.2 billion in 1994. Owned receivable balances would have been higher in both years had it not been for the securitization of $3.4 billion of credit card receivables in 1995 and $2.2 billion in 1994.           Average managed mortgage loans increased to $1.5 billion in 1995, a 26% increase from $1.2 billion in 1994. The average balance of owned mortgage loans increased to $184.9 million in 1995 from $120.0 million in 1994 partially due to the strategic decision not to securitize mortgages in the fourth quarter of 1995. Mortgage loan originations of $773 million in 1995 were up $280 million or 57% from 1994. Yields on owned mortgage loans increased to 9.38% from 8.18% in 1994 reflecting a lower proportion of nonperforming loans on the balance sheet in 1995 versus the prior year. During 1994, the Company initiated a program to repurchase nonperforming loans from the securitization trusts (see discussion under "Provision for Credit Losses").           Average managed lease receivables of $315 million increased $113 million or 56% from 1994. Average owned balances of leases increased only $24 million or 39% during 1995 due to the securitization of $146 million of lease receivables in 1995. Yields on owned leases decreased to 12.59% in 1995 from 14.36% in 1994.           An increase in the owned average cost of funds occurred in 1995 as the cost of funds rose to 6.46% from 5.22% in 1994. The full effect of the rising rate environment that began in the first quarter of 1994 was experienced in 1995, as the Federal Funds rate (the rate at which banks borrow from one another) increased from 3.0% in early 1994 to 6.0% in midyear 1995. Consequently, the rollover of deposits and debt during 1995 was at higher rates than in 1994. The Company has utilized derivatives to manage the impact of rising rates on net income (see discussion under "Derivatives Activities").           The following table provides an analysis of both owned and managed interest income and expense data, average balance sheet data, net interest spread (the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities), and net interest margin (the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid to fund interest-earning assets) for 1993 through 1995. Average owned loan and lease receivables and the related interest revenues include certain loan fees.          26                                                    Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries

In addition, the provision for credit losses represents the amount by which the provision for credit losses would have been higher had the securitized receivables remained as owned and the provision for credit losses been equal to charge-offs. Both net interest income and the provision for credit losses described above are netted and included in other noninterest revenues in the Consolidated Income Statements.        28                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries                             TOTAL MANAGED RECEIVABLES                            ($ in millions)                                      [GRAPH]                                     1991        1992        1993       1994        1995 - - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------            Serviced                         2,847      3,720       5,246       8,155     $12,215 Owned                                                              - - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  The provision for credit losses of $53.3 million in 1995 increased $19.1 million or 56% from $34.2 million in 1994. The increase was primarily due to the Company's desire to maintain a targeted level of reserve coverage of impaired assets on credit cards as well as to provide additional reserves against a possible downturn in the economy given an increase in impaired asset and delinquency levels. The owned impaired asset level on credit cards increased from $14.7 million in 1994 to $19.9 million in 1995. The total owned impaired asset level, however, decreased by $4.0 million from $43.3 million in 1994 to $39.3 million at the end of 1995. The higher 1994 level was due to the repurchase of approximately $50 million of nonperforming mortgage loans from the securitization trusts, an action undertaken in order to lower funding costs on those mortgages. In connection with these repurchases, the Company also transferred $13 million of off-balance sheet recourse reserves to on-balance sheet reserves. These repurchases increased the owned impaired asset level while having no impact on either the level of managed impaired assets or the provision for credit losses.  At December 31, 1995, approximately $11.6 million of the loans repurchased during 1994 remained on the balance sheet as either nonperforming loans or other real estate owned.           The provision for credit losses of $34.2 million in 1994 increased only $4.4 million or 15% from $29.8 million in 1993 despite a 22% increase in average owned receivables. The owned impaired asset level on credit cards was relatively flat in 1994 compared to 1993.           A description of the credit performance of the loan portfolio is set forth under the section entitled "Credit Risk Management."

This improvement resulted from a 74% growth in average securitized credit card receivables, a 63% growth in average securitized lease receivables and a $15.4 million equity securities gain on an investment held by the Company's venture capital unit, partially offset by a contraction in the net interest margin on the securitized credit card portfolio. The 1994 total reflected an $18.4 million gain on the sale of credit card customer relationships.           Due to the securitization of credit card receivables, activity from securitized account balances normally reported as net interest income and charge-offs is reported in securitization income and servicing income, both of which are included in noninterest revenues. Credit card securitization income increased 23% to $183.4 million from $149.0 million in 1994 as a result of a 74% increase in average securitized credit card receivables from $3.5 billion in 1994 to $6.1 billion in 1995, partially offset by a contraction in the net interest margin. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of securitization income.           Credit card securitization income is the excess of revenue collected on the securitized receivables, including interest and certain fees, over the related securitization trust expenses, including interest payments to investors in the trusts, charge-offs, servicing costs and transaction expenses. Credit card servicing income which represents fees paid to the Company for continuing to service accounts which         29                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries                                NONINTEREST REVENUES                               ($ in millions)                                      [GRAPH]                                                1991        1992       1993        1994        1995 - - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                    Other Noninterest Revenues                   133         193         256        396         $543 Credit Card Securitization Income                          - - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   have been securitized, increased to $117.4 million in 1995 from $69.0 million in 1994. Such fees generally approximate 2% of securitized receivables.           Interchange income represents fees that are payable by merchants to the credit card issuer for sale transactions. For 1994 and 1993, interchange income on securitized credit cards has been reclassified from credit card securitization income to credit card interchange income. Total interchange income, which represents approximately 1.4% of credit card purchases, increased 29% to $92.4 million in 1995 from $71.7 million in 1994.           During 1995, the Company securitized $542 million of mortgage loans compared to $456 million in 1994. Mortgage banking income of $50.5 million for 1995 increased 34% from $37.6 million in 1994. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of mortgage banking income.           Leasing revenues, net, increased $19.5 million to $41.1 million in 1995 primarily due to a 63% growth in average securitized lease receivables from 1994. Insurance revenues, net, were $27.7 million in 1995, an increase of $15.0 million over 1994. This strong growth is attributed to the successful marketing of insurance products in the credit card, mortgage and leasing businesses.           Noninterest revenues of $395.8 million in 1994 increased $140.2 million or 55% from $255.6 million in 1993, primarily due to increases in credit card securitization, servicing and interchange income, the gain on the sale of the credit card customer relationships, and higher leasing and insurance revenues.

This increase resulted primarily from amortization related to the $80.6 million of credit card origination costs that were deferred since the fourth quarter of 1994 (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).           Total other operating expenses of $278.4 million for 1995 were up $51.0 million or 22% from $227.4 million in 1994. The increase in total other operating expenses resulted from a $28.0 million or 32% increase in salaries and employee benefits, partially due to the addition of senior management to assist in the strategic growth of the various business units. Other factors affecting the increase in other operating expenses were a $5.8 million or 26% increase in external processing resulting primarily from a 27% increase in the number of accounts managed year-to-year, and an overall increase in credit card related costs due to a 26% increase in the number of managed credit card accounts.         30                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries           The amortization of credit card deferred origination costs, net, increased from $6.6 million in 1993 to $39.4 million in 1994, primarily due to a $25.7 million increase in amounts deferred under third party agreements. Total other operating expenses of $227.4 million for 1994 rose $52.8 million or 30% from 1993. This overall growth was a result of a $23.2 million or 35% increase in salaries and employee benefits as well as increases in marketing, external processing and other credit card related costs, as a result of the 42% increase in the number of managed credit card accounts in 1994.                              OPERATING EXPENSE RATIO                             (in percent)                                      [GRAPH]      1991             4.6 1992             4.4 1993             4.1 1994             3.7 1995             2.9%            As a result of continued investments in developmental initiatives, in 1995, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with The Royal Bank of Scotland ("RBS"), for the purpose of issuing credit cards in the United Kingdom. This new company, RBS Advanta, first began issuing bankcards in October 1995. The net results from the operations are not currently material to the Company and are not expected to be so in 1996. However, the Company expects that the anticipated receivable growth will favorably impact future earnings.  Income Taxes  The Company's consolidated income tax expense was $75.2 million for 1995, or an effective tax rate of 36%, compared to tax expense of $59.1 million, or a 36% effective rate, in 1994 and tax expense of $45.3 million, or a 37% effective rate, in 1993. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 1993 to 1994 resulted from a higher level of tax-free income and lower levels of state income taxes.  ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT  The financial condition of Advanta Corp. is managed with a focus on maintaining high credit quality standards, disciplined interest rate risk management and prudent levels of leverage and liquidity.  Interest Rate Sensitivity  Interest rate sensitivity refers to managed net interest income variability resulting from mismatches between asset and liability indices (basis risk) and the effects which changes in market interest rates have on asset and liability repricing mismatches (gap risk).           The Company attempts to minimize the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and net income by regularly evaluating the risk inherent in its asset and liability structure, including securitized assets. This risk arises from continuous changes in the Company's asset/liability mix, market interest rates, the yield curve, prepayment trends and the timing of cash flows. Computer simulations are used to evaluate net interest income volatility under varying rate, spread and volume projections over monthly time periods of up to two years.           In managing its interest rate sensitivity position, the Company periodically securitizes receivables, sells and purchases assets, alters the mix and term structure of its funding base, changes its investment portfolio and short-term investment position, and uses derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used for the express purpose of managing exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Derivative financial instruments, by policy, are not used for any speculative purposes (see discussion under "Derivatives Activities"). The Company has primarily utilized variable rate funding in pricing its credit card securitization transactions in an attempt to match the variable rate pricing dynamics of the underlying receivables sold to the trusts. Variable rate funding is used on the balance sheet as well, in support of unsecuritized receivables which carry variable rates. Although credit card receivable rates are generally set at a spread over a floating rate index, they often contain interest rate floors. These floors have the impact of converting the credit card receivables to fixed rate receivables in a low interest rate environment. In addition, the Company at times offers fixed rate pricing to consumers for the introductory rate period of its credit cards. In instances when a significant portion of credit card receivables carry fixed rate introductory pricing or are at their floors, the Company may convert part of        31                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries  the underlying funding to a fixed rate by using interest rate hedges, swaps and fixed rate securitizations. In pricing mortgage and lease securitizations, both fixed rate and variable rate funding are used depending upon the characteristics of the underlying receivables. Additionally, basis risk exists in on-balance sheet funding as well as in securitizing credit card receivables at a spread over the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") when the rate on the underlying assets is indexed to the prime rate. The Company measures the basis risk resulting from potential variability in the spread between prime and LIBOR and incorporates such risk into the asset and liability management process. During 1995, substantially all new credit cards were issued using LIBOR as the repricing index. The effect of this change will be the reduction of prime/LIBOR basis risk over time. The Company continues to seek cost-effective alternatives for minimizing this risk.           Interest rate fluctuations affect net interest income at virtually all financial institutions. While interest rate volatility does have an effect on net interest income, other factors also contribute significantly to changes in net interest income. Specifically, within the credit card portfolio, pricing decisions and customer behavior regarding convenience usage affect the yield on the portfolio. These factors may counteract or exacerbate income changes due to fluctuating interest rates. The Company closely monitors interest rate movements, competitor pricing and consumer behavioral changes in its ongoing analysis of net interest income sensitivity.  Liquidity, Funding and Capital Resources  The Company's goal is to maintain an adequate level of liquidity, both long and short-term, through active management of both assets and liabilities. During 1995, the Company, through its subsidiaries, securitized $3.4 billion of credit card receivables, $542 million of mortgage loans and $146 million of lease receivables. Cash generated from these transactions was temporarily invested in short-term, high quality investments at money market rates awaiting redeployment to pay down borrowings and to fund future credit card, mortgage loan and lease receivable growth. See the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for more information regarding liquidity, funding and capital resources. In addition, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Supplemental Schedules thereto for additional information regarding the Company's investment portfolio.           Over the last eight years, the Company has successfully accessed the securitization market to efficiently support its growth strategy. While securitization should continue to be a reliable source of funding for the Company, other funding sources are available and include deposits, medium-term notes, senior and subordinated debt, repurchase agreements, committed and uncommitted bank lines, bank notes, federal funds purchased and the ability to sell assets and raise additional equity.           In February 1995, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Advanta National Bank ("Advanta National"), a Delaware-based credit card bank, commenced operations. The Company's initial capitalization of Advanta National was $50 million, consisting of $25 million in common stock and $25 million of additional paid-in-capital. Additional capital infusions totaling $39 million took place during 1995. As a credit card bank, Advanta National is limited to one office, can engage only in consumer credit card operations and cannot accept deposits other than savings and time deposits of $100,000 or more. It is anticipated that Advanta National will continue to be the originator of a substantial portion of the Company's credit cards. Advanta National had total assets of $1.1 billion at December 31, 1995.           Funding diversification is an essential component of the Company's liquidity management. The debt securities of Advanta Corp., Colonial National Bank USA ("Colonial National"), and Advanta National have achieved investment-grade ratings from the nationally recognized rating agencies. These ratings have allowed the Company to further diversify its funding sources. Efforts continue to develop new sources of funding, both through previously untapped customer segments and through developing new financing structures.           In 1994, the Company obtained revolving credit facilities totaling $255 million from a consortium of banks and $255 million in money market bid lines. In the second quarter of 1995, the Company's $255 million revolving credit facilities were replaced with a new $510 million revolving credit facility which is available to Advanta National as well. The Company may also sell up to $325 million of medium-term notes as needed.           In August 1995, in a public offering, the Company sold 2,500,000 depositary shares each representing a one-hundredth interest in a share of Stock Appreciation Income Linked Securities ("SAILS"). The SAILS constitute a series of the Company's Class B Preferred Stock, designated as 6 3/4% Convertible Class B Preferred Stock, Series 1995 (SAILS). On September 15, 1999, unless either previously redeemed by the Company or converted at the option of the holder,         32                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries  each share of the SAILS will automatically convert into 100 shares of Class B Common Stock. Proceeds from the offering, net of underwriting discount, were approximately $90 million. The Company used the proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including financing the growth of its subsidiaries.           In September 1995, Colonial National and Advanta National (the "Banks") established a $2.25 billion bank note program. The Banks may issue an aggregate of $2.0 billion of senior bank notes and $250 million of subordinated bank notes. These notes may have maturities ranging from seven days to fifteen years from date of issuance. In the fourth quarter of 1995, Advanta National sold $323 million of senior notes through this program.           In addition, at the Advanta parent company level, steady building of liquidity and capital in 1995 and 1994 was achieved as a result of $66.1 million of dividends from subsidiaries in 1995 and $39.6 million in 1994, and retained earnings of $121.2 million in 1995 and $96.2 million in 1994. The Board of Directors currently intends to have the Company pay regular quarterly dividends to its shareholders, maintaining an approximate 20% premium on the dividend paid on the Class B common shares; however, the Company plans to reinvest the majority of its earnings to support future growth.           At December 31, 1995, the Company was carrying $1.1 billion of loans available for sale. The fair value of such loans was in excess of their carrying value at year end. In connection with liquidity and asset/liability management, the Company had $533 million of investments available for sale at December 31, 1995. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for fair value disclosures.

For the fiscal CEBA year ended September 30, 1995, Colonial National's average assets did not exceed the allowable amount and, accordingly, Colonial National was in full compliance with CEBA growth limits. The timing and size of securitizations, on-balance sheet liability structure and rapid changes in balance sheet structure are frequently due to the management of Colonial National's balance sheet within this growth constraint.           In addition to Colonial National's total deposits of $1.3 billion, deposits at December 31, 1995 included $612 million of time deposits at Advanta National and $38 million of deposits at Advanta Financial Corp. ("AFC"), a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial loan corporation. AFC's assets and operations are not currently material to the Company, and the Company does not expect them to become material in the near term.           While there are no specific capital requirements for Advanta Corp., the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency requires that Colonial National and Advanta National maintain a risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%. Both banks were in excess of the required level and exceeded the minimum capital level of 10% required for designation as a "well-capitalized" depository institution. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, Colonial National's risk-based capital ratio was 11.56% and 12.04%, respectively.  Advanta National's risk-based capital ratio at December 31, 1995 was 12.28%. The Company intends to take the necessary actions to maintain Colonial National and Advanta National as "well-capitalized" banks. In addition, the Company's insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain capital, deposit and dividend rules and regulations as prescribed by state jurisdictions in which they are authorized to operate. At December 31, 1995 and 1994 the insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with all requisite rules and regulations.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  The Company spent $20.6 million for capital expenditures in 1995, primarily for the purchase of land in Delaware, additional space in existing buildings, office and voice communication equipment and furniture and fixtures. This compared to $24.1 million for capital expenditures in 1994 and $13.3 million in 1993.           In 1996, the Company anticipates capital expenditures to exceed those of 1995 as its facilities are expanding and the Company is continuing to upgrade its voice and communication systems. The Company also anticipates that its 1996 marketing expenditures will exceed those of 1995 as the Company continues to originate new accounts, manage account retention and develop new consumer products for its customers.  DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES  The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risks. The Company has a number of mechanisms in place that enable it to monitor and control both market and credit risk from these derivatives activities. At the broader level, all derivatives strategies are managed under a hedging policy approved by the Board of Directors that details the use of such derivatives and the individuals authorized to execute derivatives transactions. All derivatives strategies must be approved by the Company's senior management (President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer).           As part of this approval process, a market risk analysis is completed to determine the potential impact on the Company from severe negative (stressed) movements in the market. By policy, derivatives transactions may only be used to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risks or for cost reduction and may not be used for speculative purposes. As such, the impact of any derivatives transaction is calculated using the Company's asset/liability model to determine its suitability.           The Company's Investment Committee (a management committee) has a counterparty credit policy. This policy details the maximum credit exposure, transaction limit and transaction term for counterparties based on an internally assigned Investment Committee credit rating. Counterparty internal credit ratings reflect the credit ratings from nationally recognized rating agencies, as well as other significant credit factors where appropriate. Each counterparty's credit quality is reviewed as new information becomes available, and, in any case, at least quarterly. Activities with counterparties will be suspended if there is reason to believe that their credit quality is below the Company's set standards.           For each individually approved counterparty, a credit exposure amount, representing the maximum aggregate credit exposure from derivatives transactions the Company is willing to accept from that counterparty, is calculated for a hypothetical stress environment.       34                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries   To manage counterparty exposure, the Company also uses negotiated agreements that establish threshold exposure amounts for each counterparty above which the Company has the right to call for and receive collateral for the amount of such excess, thereby limiting its exposure to the threshold amount. The threshold levels can be fixed or may change as the credit rating of the counterparty changes, and in all cases, the threshold levels are well below the maximum allowable exposure amounts described above.           Counterparty master agreements and any collateral agreements, by policy, must be signed prior to the execution of any derivatives transactions with a counterparty. To date, substantially all master agreements with counterparties have included bilateral collateral agreements. As such, the potential exposure from a particular counterparty is limited to the maximum threshold level for that counterparty.           The Company has a treasury middle office independent of the trading function, which measures, monitors, and reports on credit, market, and liquidity risk exposures from hedging and derivative product activities. It is the responsibility of this department to ensure compliance with respect to the hedging policy, including the counterparty transaction limits, transaction terms and trader authorizations. In addition, this department marks each derivatives position to market on a weekly basis using both internal and external models. These models have been benchmarked against a sample of derivatives dealers' valuation models for accuracy. Position and counterparty exposure reports are generated and used to manage collateral requirements of the counterparty and the Company.           All of these procedures and processes are designed to provide reasonable assurance that prior to and after the execution of any derivatives strategy, market, credit and liquidity risks are fully analyzed and incorporated into the Company's asset/liability and risk measurement models and the proper accounting treatment for the transaction is identified and executed.  CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT  Management regularly reviews the loan portfolio in order to evaluate the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses. The evaluation includes such factors as the inherent credit quality of the loan portfolio, past experience, current economic conditions, projected credit losses and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio. The reserve for credit losses is maintained for on-balance sheet receivables. The on-balance sheet reserve is intended to cover all credit losses inherent in the owned loan portfolio. With regard to securitized assets, anticipated losses and related recourse reserves are reflected in the calculations of Securitization Income, Amounts due from Credit Card Securitizations and Other Assets. Recourse reserves are intended to cover all probable credit losses over the life of the securitized receivables. Management evaluates both its on-balance sheet and recourse reserve requirements and, as appropriate, effects transfers between these accounts.           The reserve for credit losses on a consolidated basis was $53.5 million, or 1.9% of receivables, at December 31, 1995, compared to $41.6 million, or 2.1% of receivables, at December 31, 1994. The reserve coverage of impaired assets (nonperforming assets and accruing loans past due 90 days or more on credit cards) increased to 136.3% at December 31, 1995, from 96.1% at December 31, 1994. Reserve coverage of impaired credit card assets was 185.8% at December 31, 1995, relatively even with 186.5% at year end 1994.           The reserve for credit losses on a consolidated basis was $41.6 million, or 2.1% of receivables, in 1994, compared to $31.2 million, or 2.4% of receivables, in 1993.     35                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries   ASSET QUALITY  Impaired assets include both nonperforming assets (mortgage loans and leases past due 90 days or more, real estate owned, bankrupt, decedent and fraudulent credit card accounts, and off-lease equipment) and accruing loans past due 90 days or more on credit cards.  The carrying values for both real estate owned and equipment held for lease or sale are based on net realizable value after taking into account holding costs and costs of disposition and are reflected in other assets.           On the total managed portfolio, impaired assets were $167.1 million, or 1.4% of receivables, at year end 1995 compared to $102.4 million, or 1.3% of receivables, in 1994. Nonperforming assets on the total managed portfolio were $82.2 million, or .7% of receivables, compared to $61.6 million, or .8%, in 1994. The total managed charge-off rate for 1995 was 2.2%, compared to 2.3% for 1994. The charge-off rate on managed credit cards was 2.5% for 1995, flat with 1994.           On the total owned portfolio, impaired assets were $39.3 million, or 1.4% of receivables in 1995, compared to $43.3 million, or 2.2%, in 1994. Gross interest income that would have been recorded in 1995 and 1994 for owned nonperforming assets, had interest been accrued throughout the year in accordance with the assets' original terms, was approximately $4.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The amount of interest on nonperforming assets included in income for 1995 and 1994 was $1.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively.           Past due loans represent accruing loans that are past due 90 days or more as to collection of principal and interest.  Credit card receivables, except those on bankrupt, decedent and fraudulent accounts, continue to accrue interest until the time they are charged off at 186 days contractual delinquency. In contrast, all mortgage loans and leases are put on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due. Owned credit card receivables past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest were $17.4 million or .7% of receivables at December 31, 1995, compared to $11.2 million, or .6% of receivables, a year ago.           During 1991, the Company adopted a new policy for the charge-off of bankrupt, decedent and fraudulent credit card accounts.  Under the new policy, the Company charges off bankrupt or decedent accounts within 30 days of notification and accounts suspected of being fraudulent after a 90-day investigation period, unless the investigation shows no evidence of fraud. Under the previous policy, such accounts were charged off in accordance with the Company's normal credit card charge-off policy at 186 days contractual delinquency. Consequently, in 1991, both newly identified bankrupt, decedent and fraudulent accounts, as well as those previously identified, were written off. The 1991 charge-off rates included in the following tables exclude the effect of this acceleration.           During 1994, the Company implemented a new policy for the charge-off of mortgage loans. Under this policy, when a nonperforming mortgage loan becomes twelve months delinquent, the Company writes down the loan to its net realizable value, regardless of anticipated collectibility. Consequently, in 1994, all mortgage loans that had been twelve or more months delinquent, as well as any mortgages that became twelve months delinquent during the year were written down to their net realizable value. Thus, 1994's managed mortgage loan charge-off rate of 1.7% was unusually high compared to the 1995 level of .9%.     36                                                   Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries   The following tables provide a summary of reserves, impaired assets, delinquencies and charge-offs for the past five years:    ($ in thousands)                                                              December 31, -
