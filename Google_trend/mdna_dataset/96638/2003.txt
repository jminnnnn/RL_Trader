ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  Our primary business segment is Advanta Business Cards, one of the nation's largest issuers of business credit cards to small businesses. In addition to our business credit card lending business, we have venture capital investments. Through the first quarter of 2001, we had two additional lending businesses, Advanta Mortgage and Advanta Leasing Services. In the first quarter of 2001, we completed our exit from the mortgage business, announced the discontinuance of our leasing business, and restructured our corporate functions to a size commensurate with our ongoing businesses. We are continuing to service the existing leasing portfolio rather than sell the business or the portfolio. The results of the mortgage and leasing businesses are reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented. The results of our ongoing businesses are reported as continuing operations for all periods presented.       For the year ended December 31, 2002, we reported net loss from continuing operations of $15.6 million, or $0.63 per combined common share, assuming dilution, compared to net loss from continuing operations of $30.5 million, or $1.19 per combined diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2000, we reported net income from continuing operations of $11.2 million, or $0.44 per combined diluted common share. Loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes a pretax charge of $43.0 million related to a ruling in the litigation associated with the transfer of our consumer credit card business in 1998, and pretax investment losses on venture capital investments of $6.9 million. Loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 includes pretax investment losses on venture capital investments of $28.9 million and $41.8 million of pretax unusual charges representing costs associated with the restructure of our corporate functions to a size commensurate with our ongoing businesses and certain other unusual charges related to employee costs. Income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 includes pretax investment gains, net, on venture capital investments of $7.7 million and a $7.0 million pretax charge for an increase in litigation reserves.       Net income (loss) from continuing operations included the following business segment results:    ($ IN THOUSANDS)                                                 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                                               ------------------------------                                                                 2002       2001       2000 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        Pretax income (loss): Advanta Business Cards                                        $ 63,244   $ 63,515   $ 45,325 Venture Capital                                                (10,101)   (33,158)     3,382 Other (1)                                                      (51,545)   (72,808)   (37,515) - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total pretax income (loss)                                       1,598    (42,451)    11,192 Income tax (expense) benefit                                   (17,170)    11,995          0 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net income (loss) from continuing operations                  $(15,572)  $(30,456)  $ 11,192 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   (1) Other includes investment and other activities not attributable to the     Advanta Business Cards or venture capital segments.       In the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded an after-tax loss on the discontinuance of our mortgage and leasing businesses of $8.6 million, or $0.34 per combined common share, assuming dilution. In the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded an after-tax loss on the discontinuance of our mortgage and leasing businesses of $31.6 million, or $1.23 per combined diluted common share. We also recorded an after-tax loss on the discontinuance of our leasing business of $4.3 million, or $0.17 per combined diluted common share, effective December 31, 2000. The components of the after-tax loss on discontinuance recorded in 2002 include a pretax loss on the Mortgage Transaction of $25.3 million, a pretax gain on the discontinuance of our leasing business of $11.3 million, and tax benefit of $5.4 million. The components of the after-tax loss on discontinuance recorded in 2001 include a pretax gain on the Mortgage Transaction of $20.8 million, a pretax loss on the discontinuance of our leasing business of $45.0 million, and tax expense of $7.4 million. See "Discontinued Operations" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion.                                          22        Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $8.4 million, or $0.33 per combined diluted common share, for the period from January 1, 2001 through February 28, 2001, the effective date of the Mortgage Transaction. In the year ended December 31, 2000, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $163.6 million, or $6.45 per combined diluted common share.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We have identified the following as our most critical accounting policies and estimates in that they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in such estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.    Fair Value of Venture Capital Investments  Investments of our venture capital segment are included in investments available for sale and carried at estimated fair value. Management makes fair value determinations based on quoted market prices, when available, and considers the investees' financial results, conditions and prospects, values of comparable companies and market liquidity, when market prices are not available. In accordance with specialized industry accounting principles of venture capital companies, unrealized and realized gains and losses on these investments are included in other revenues in the consolidated income statements. The fair values of these equity investments are subject to significant volatility. Our investments in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time, and changes in concentrations may affect price volatility. We primarily invest in privately held companies, including early stage companies. These investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products the investees have under development may never materialize.    Allowance for Receivable Losses  The allowance for receivable losses is maintained for on-balance sheet receivables and is intended to cover all losses inherent in the owned receivable portfolio. Business credit card receivables are comprised of principal amounts due from cardholders for purchase activities and cash advances, and amounts due from cardholders relating to billed interest and fees. The allowance for receivable losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectibility of receivables in light of historical experience by loan type, the nature and volume of the receivable portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay and prevailing economic conditions. Since our receivable portfolio is comprised of large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, we generally evaluate each group collectively for impairment through the use of a migration analysis as well as the consideration of other factors that may indicate loss. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.       Provisions for credit losses, representing the portion of receivable losses attributable to principal, are reported separately on the consolidated income statements. Losses are charged against the allowance for receivable losses when management believes the uncollectibility of a receivable balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for receivable losses. Provisions for interest and fee losses are recorded as direct reductions to interest and fee income. The accrued interest and fee portion of charged-off receivables is charged against the allowance for receivable losses. All subsequent recoveries of charged-off receivables are classified as principal recoveries, since any amounts related to accrued interest and fees are de minimus.                                          23     Securitization Transactions  A significant portion of our funding for Advanta Business Cards is through off-balance sheet business credit card securitizations using a securitization trust. The securitization trust was created to hold the collateral (the securitized receivables) and issue debt to investors. The securitization trust is a qualifying special-purpose entity as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities -- a Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125," and therefore, is not consolidated as part of Advanta Corp.'s consolidated financial statements. We do not provide any guarantee of the debt issued by the special-purpose entity and our recourse in the transactions is limited to the value of our interests in securitizations that serve as credit enhancement to the investors' interests in the securitized receivables.       Our business credit card securitization transactions are accounted for as sales since we surrender control over the securitized receivables. Securitization income is recognized at the time of the sale, equal to the excess of the fair value of the assets obtained (principally cash) over the allocated cost of the assets sold and transaction costs. Fair value estimates used in the recognition of securitization income require assumptions of payment, default and interest rates. To the extent actual results are different than those estimates, the impact is recognized in securitization income.       We generally retain an interest in securitized receivables in the form of restricted cash reserve accounts, retained interest-only strips and subordinated trust assets related to securitizations. Subordinated trust assets represent an ownership interest in the securitized receivables that is subordinated to the other investors' interests. Retained interests in securitizations serve as credit enhancement to the investors' interests in the securitized receivables. These assets are carried at estimated fair value and the resulting unrealized gain or loss from the valuation is included in securitization income.       We estimate the fair value of retained interests in securitizations based on a discounted cash flow analysis when quoted market prices are not available. The cash flows of the retained interest-only strip are estimated as the excess of the weighted average interest yield on each pool of the receivables sold over the sum of the interest rate earned by the note holder, the servicing fee and an estimate of future credit losses over the life of the existing receivables. Cash flows are discounted from the date the cash is expected to become available to us (the "cash-out" method). These cash flows are projected over the life of the receivables using payment, default, and interest rate assumptions that management believes would be used by market participants for similar financial instruments subject to prepayment, credit and interest rate risk. The cash flows are discounted using an interest rate that management believes a purchaser unrelated to the seller of the financial instrument would demand. As estimates used are influenced by factors outside our control, there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates, making it reasonably possible that they could change in the near term. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for the key assumptions used in the estimation of fair values of the retained interest in securitizations at December 31, 2002 and 2001. Interest income is recognized over the life of the retained interests in securitizations using the discount rate used in the valuation.       Accrued interest and fees on securitized receivables are reduced by an allowance for amounts estimated to be uncollectible. The allowance is estimated using the same methodology as that used for on-balance sheet receivables that is described above in "Allowance for Receivable Losses." Provisions for interest and fee losses on securitized receivables are recorded as a reduction of securitization income.       In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities -- An Interpretation of ARB No. 51." The interpretation requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if the company has variable interests that give it a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns of the entity. The consolidation requirements apply to all variable interest entities created after January 31, 2002. In addition, public companies must apply the consolidation requirements to variable interest entities that existed prior to February 1, 2003 and remain in existence as of the beginning of annual or interim periods beginning after June 15, 2003. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this interpretation will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations since qualifying special-purpose entities, as defined in SFAS 140, are exempt from the consolidation requirements of this interpretation.                                          24     Business Credit Card Rewards Programs  We offer bonus mile and cash-back reward programs with certain of our business credit cards. Eligible cardholders earn bonus miles for air travel or up to 2% cash-back rewards based on net purchases charged on their business credit card account. The costs of future reward redemptions are estimated and a liability is recorded at the time bonus miles or cash-back rewards are earned by the cardholder. The estimated costs of future reward redemptions are classified as a reduction of other revenues in the consolidated income statements. Estimates of costs of future reward redemptions include an assumption regarding the percentage of cardholders that will redeem the rewards and vary depending on the structure of the rewards program. It is reasonably possible that actual results will differ from our estimates or that our estimated liability for these programs may change.    Litigation Contingencies  Advanta Corp. and its subsidiaries are involved in class action lawsuits, other litigation, claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business or discontinued operations, including litigation arising from our operation of the mortgage business prior to the Mortgage Transaction in the first quarter of 2001. See discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. Management believes that the aggregate loss, if any, resulting from these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of our operations based on the level of litigation reserves we have established and our current expectations regarding the ultimate resolutions of these existing actions. Our litigation reserves are estimated based on the status of litigation and our assessment of the ultimate resolution of each action after consultation with our attorneys. However, due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and since the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings are influenced by factors outside of our control, it is reasonably possible that our estimated liability under these proceedings may change or that actual results will differ from our estimates. Our litigation reserves are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in estimates or other charges related to litigation are included in operating expenses of the respective business segment if related to continuing operations, or gain (loss) on discontinuance of mortgage and leasing businesses if related to discontinued operations.    Income Taxes  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the asset and liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, we determine the net deferred tax asset or liability based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the various assets and liabilities and give current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax asset and recognize a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In establishing the valuation allowance, we consider (1) estimates of expected future taxable income, (2) existing and projected book/tax differences, (3) tax planning strategies available, and (4) the general and industry specific economic outlook. This analysis is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Changes in estimate of deferred tax asset realizability, if applicable, are included in income tax expense (benefit) on the consolidated income statements and would affect all business segments since the consolidated effective tax rate is applied to all business segments' pretax income (loss).    Discontinued Operations  Our exit from the mortgage business and discontinuance of the leasing business represent the disposal of business segments following Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 30. Accordingly, results of these operations are classified as discontinued in all periods presented. Our accounting for discontinued operations was not impacted by the issuance of SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," since its provisions for disposal groups of long-lived assets are effective for disposal activities initiated after January 1, 2002. Estimates of future cash flows are used in the accounting for discontinued operations, including estimates of the future costs of mortgage business-related litigation and estimates of operating results through the remaining term of the leasing portfolio. As all estimates used are influenced by factors outside our control, there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates, making it reasonably                                         25   possible that they could change in the near term. Changes in estimates related to discontinued operations are included in gain (loss) on discontinuance of mortgage and leasing businesses on the consolidated income statements.  ADVANTA BUSINESS CARDS  Advanta Business Cards originated, directly and through the use of third parties, 241,869 new accounts during the year ended December 31, 2002, 224,255 new accounts in 2001 and 311,275 new accounts in 2000. Our managed business credit card receivable portfolio is comprised of both owned business credit card receivables and securitized business credit card receivables. Managed business credit card receivables grew 27% in the year ended December 31, 2002 and 23% in the year ended December 31, 2001. We expect managed business credit card receivables to grow approximately 15% to 20% in the year ended December 31, 2003. Our originations in 2002 included a broader array of competitively-priced offerings and products, including promotional pricing and rewards programs, designed to selectively attract and retain more higher credit quality customers and to respond to the competitive environment in the credit card industry. The level of originations and growth in receivables in 2001 reflected our plan to grow the portfolio in a controlled manner that we believed was prudent given the prevailing economic environment.       Pretax income for Advanta Business Cards was $63.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $63.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2001 and $45.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2000. The components of pretax income for Advanta Business Cards in the years ended December 31 were as follows:    ($ IN THOUSANDS)                                                2002        2001        2000 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        Net interest income on owned receivables                      $  55,204   $  53,421   $  53,087 Noninterest revenues                                            246,957     215,280     149,452 Provision for credit losses                                     (40,006)    (35,373)    (36,307) Operating expenses                                             (198,911)   (169,813)   (120,907) - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pretax income                                                 $  63,244   $  63,515   $  45,325 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        Net interest income on owned receivables and noninterest revenues in 2002 reflect a decrease in the average yield earned on our owned and securitized business credit card receivables. The decrease in yield is a result of a broader array of competitively-priced offerings and products in 2002, including promotional pricing, designed to selectively attract and retain more higher credit quality customers and to respond to the competitive environment. The increase in net interest income on owned receivables in 2002 as compared to 2001 is due to a $90 million increase in average owned business credit card receivables and a decrease in our cost of funds, partially offset by the decrease in average yield earned on our owned business credit card receivables. The increase in noninterest revenues in 2002 as compared to 2001 is comprised of increased securitization income, servicing revenues, interchange income and other fee revenues due to the growth in average managed receivables. Securitization income was also impacted by the decrease in yield on securitized receivables discussed above, a decrease in the interest rate earned by noteholders and an increased net charge-off rate on securitized receivables.       The increase in the provision for credit losses in 2002 as compared to 2001 reflects an increase in average owned business credit card receivables, partially offset by estimates as of December 31, 2002 of a lower level of inherent losses in the portfolio, based on delinquency and net charge-off rate trends and the current composition of the portfolio, as compared to estimates as of December 31, 2001. The increase in operating expenses in 2002 as compared to 2001 resulted from growth in managed receivables and additional investments in initiatives to strengthen our position as a leading issuer of business credit cards to the small business market.       The increase in noninterest revenues and operating expenses in 2001 as compared to 2000 was due primarily to growth in managed receivables. The provisions for credit losses and noninterest revenues in the year ended December 31, 2001 include the impact of an increase in managed credit losses due to the seasoning of the business credit card portfolio and the economic environment during the period. The provision for credit                                          26   losses in the year ended December 31, 2000 includes an $8 million increase attributable to a revision of our estimate of the allowance for receivable losses as a result of the following factors: (1) discussions with our banking regulators relating to the implementation of the agreement between Advanta Bank Corp. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that was disclosed in June 2000; (2) changes in the economic environment; and (3) the use of more conservative loss estimates for certain segments of the loan portfolio. See further discussion in the "Provision and Allowance for Receivable Losses" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  VENTURE CAPITAL  The components of pretax income (loss) for our venture capital segment in the years ended December 31 were as follows:    ($ IN THOUSANDS)                                                2002       2001      2000 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        Net interest expense                                          $   (711)  $ (1,508)  $(1,481) Realized gains (losses), net                                       (48)    (9,296)   11,371 Unrealized losses, net                                          (6,860)   (19,583)   (3,691) Other revenues                                                      16         27       167 Operating expenses                                              (2,498)    (2,798)   (2,984) - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pretax income (loss)                                          $(10,101)  $(33,158)  $ 3,382 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        As shown in the table above, pretax income (loss) of our venture capital segment is comprised primarily of realized and unrealized gains and losses on our venture capital investments, which reflect the market conditions for those investments in each respective period, and operating expenses. The estimated fair value of our venture capital investments was $13.5 million at December 31, 2002, and $18.6 million at December 31, 2001.  INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE  Interest income decreased by $24.3 million to $103.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in interest income in 2002 was due primarily to a decrease in the average yield earned on our investments and receivables as a result of the prevailing interest rate environment and the competitively-priced offers described below. Also contributing to the decrease in interest income was a decrease in average federal funds sold, restricted interest-bearing deposits and investments of $377 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to 2001. Excess liquid assets resulting from the Mortgage Transaction in the first quarter of 2001 were held in short-term, high quality investments until they could be deployed. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in average business credit card receivables of $90 million in the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to 2001.       In 2002, our marketing campaigns have included a broader array of competitively-priced offerings and products, including promotional pricing and rewards programs, designed to selectively attract and retain more higher credit quality customers and to respond to the competitive environment. In the year ended December 31, 2002, these competitively-priced offers resulted in a decline in yields on business credit card receivables, and are anticipated to result in lower credit losses in future periods and higher interchange income due to higher purchase volume. We anticipate that these trends on business credit card receivables will continue in 2003 and that our risk-adjusted revenues as a percentage of average managed business credit card receivables will be between 10.5% and 11.5% in the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to 12% in the year ended December 31, 2002. Risk-adjusted revenues represent net interest margin and fee revenues, less net principal charge-offs.       During the year ended December 31, 2002, interest expense decreased by $34.9 million to $47.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in interest expense in 2002 was due to a reduction in average outstanding deposits and debt and a decrease in our average cost of funds. Our average cost of funds decreased from 7.24% in the year ended December 31, 2001 to 5.17% in the year ended                                          27   December 31, 2002. The decrease in our average cost of funds is primarily a result of the prevailing interest rate environment.       Interest income decreased by $14.2 million to $127.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. During the same period, interest expense decreased by $4.0 million to $82.5 million. The decrease in interest income was due primarily to a decrease in average business credit card receivables and investments. Also contributing to the decreased interest income was a decrease in the average yield earned on our investment portfolio caused by the interest rate environment and a shift in the composition of the portfolio. Short-term investments, including federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits, represented 52% of the average investment portfolio in the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to 27% in the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in interest expense was due to a decrease in interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by an increase in our average cost of funds.       The following table provides an analysis of interest income and expense data, average balance sheet data, net interest spread and net interest margin for both continuing and discontinued operations. The net interest spread represents the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest margin represents the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid to fund interest-earning assets. Interest income includes late fees on business credit card receivables. Average receivables include deferred origination costs, net of deferred fees.

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR RECEIVABLE LOSSES  In the year ended December 31, 2002, the provision for credit losses increased by $4.9 million to $40.9 million as compared to 2001, and the provision for interest and fee losses increased by $2.5 million to $6.9 million as compared to 2001. The provision for interest and fee losses in 2002 includes a $698 thousand increase due to the change in income billing practice effective October 1, 2002. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The increase in both provisions reflects growth in average owned business credit card receivables of $90 million in the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to 2001, partially offset by a reduction in our estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio as of December 31, 2002, based on improving delinquency and charge-off rate trends from April to December 2002 and the current composition of the portfolio as compared to our estimate as of December 31, 2001. In 2001, we were anticipating worsening net charge-off rates for the first quarter of 2002 due to the composition and seasoning of the portfolio at December 31, 2001.  DELINQUENCY AND CHARGE-OFF RATE TRENDS ON OWNED BUSINESS CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES                                                        DEC. 31,   SEP. 30,   JUN. 30,   MAR. 31,   DEC. 31,                                                       2002       2002       2002       2002       2001 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------            Receivables 90 days or more delinquent                2.7%       2.9%       3.3%       3.4%       3.3% Receivables 30 days or more delinquent                5.3        6.4        6.5        7.1        6.7 Net principal charge-offs as a % of owned business   credit card receivables for the three months   ended (annualized)                                  6.5        8.2        8.2        9.4        8.2 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                           29        The improvements in delinquency rates are the result of the current composition of the portfolio and enhancements in the collections area of operations. In June 2000, we ceased origination of business credit card accounts with Fair, Isaac and Company ("FICO") credit scores of less than 661. We estimate that charge-offs for accounts with FICO credit scores of less than 661 at origination reached their peak in the first quarter of 2002, based on the average age of that segment of the portfolio. Although charge-off levels are not always predictable since they are impacted by the economic environment and other factors beyond our control, we anticipate charge-off rates for the year ended December 31, 2003 and for each quarter of 2003 to be lower than the comparable periods of 2002. This expectation is based on the current composition of the portfolio that reflects our strategic initiative to selectively attract and retain more higher credit quality customers, enhancements in the collections area of operations made in 2002, and the current level of delinquencies. However, we are expecting charge-off rates in the first and second quarters of 2003 to be higher than the rate experienced in the fourth quarter of 2002, due to the current level of receivables 90 days or more delinquent and historical seasonal trends of charge-offs and bankruptcy petitions.       The provision for credit losses in the year ended December 31, 2001 was $36.0 million as compared to $36.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2000. The provision for interest and fee losses was $4.4 million in 2001 as compared to $2.3 million in 2000. The provision for credit losses in 2000 includes a revision in our estimate of the allowance for receivable losses on business credit card receivables. The revised estimate for the overall portfolio was recorded in September 2000 and was developed based on discussions with our banking regulators, changes in the economic environment and the use of more conservative loss estimates for certain segments of the receivable portfolio. Those segments included accounts with lower credit scores, accounts held by businesses in operation less than twelve months, and accounts in which cash borrowings comprise a significant portion of the outstanding balance. As a result of these changes in estimate in 2000, we increased our allowance for receivable losses by approximately $8 million, which increased the provision for credit losses and decreased net income by approximately $8 million or $0.32 per diluted combined share for the year ended December 31, 2000. The provisions for credit losses and interest and fee losses in 2001 reflect the seasoning of the business credit card portfolio and the economic environment. These factors were evident in the delinquency rates and charge-off rates in 2001 as compared to 2000. Total owned business credit card receivables 30 days or more delinquent increased from 5.5% at December 31, 2000 to 6.7% at December 31, 2001. The charge-off rate on owned business credit card receivables for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 7.2% as compared to 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2000.       At December 31, 2002, the allowance for receivable losses on a consolidated basis was $46.2 million, or 9.8% of owned receivables, compared to $42.0 million, or 9.4%, at December 31, 2001. The allowance for receivable losses on business credit card receivables was $44.5 million, or 10.0% of owned receivables, at December 31, 2002, as compared to $41.2 million, or 9.9%, at December 31, 2001.       The allowance for receivable losses on other receivables was $1.7 million at December 31, 2002 and $802 thousand at December 31, 2001. The increase in the allowance for receivable losses on other receivables in the year ended December 31, 2002 was due to general economic conditions and corresponding increases in delinquency rates. The rate of other receivables 90 days or more delinquent was 3.11% at December 31, 2002 as compared to 2.07% at December 31, 2001.       We follow the charge-off and re-age policies established by the Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. Under this policy, unpaid receivables are charged off in the month the account becomes 180 days contractually delinquent; unpaid balances of accounts that declare hardship or enter credit counseling are charged off in the month the account becomes 120 days contractually delinquent; unpaid receivables of accounts in bankruptcy are charged off within 60 days of receipt of notification of filing from the bankruptcy court or within the previous timeframes discussed, whichever is shorter; and fraudulent amounts are charged off after a 90-day investigative period, unless our investigation shows no evidence of fraud. Prior to October 1, 2000, unpaid receivables of accounts in bankruptcy were charged off within 90 days of receipt of notification of filing from the bankruptcy court.       In July 2002, the bank regulatory agencies issued draft guidance on account management and loss allowance for credit card lending. It described the agencies' expectations for prudent risk management                                          30   practices for credit card activities, particularly with regard to credit line management, over-limit accounts, and workouts. The draft guidance also addressed income recognition and loss allowance practices for credit card lending. We completed our evaluation of the draft guidance in 2002 and did not expect the implementation of the guidance to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations. In January 2003, the bank regulatory agencies issued the final guidance. The guidance includes provisions generally applicable to all credit card issuers. We are still evaluating the impact the minimum payment provisions may have on our future delinquencies and charge-offs. We do not expect the other provisions of the final guidance to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations. However, similar to other examination guidance, this guidance provides wide discretion to the bank regulatory agencies in the application to any particular institution. Accordingly, our bank examiners could require changes in our account management or loss allowance practices in the future.       The following table provides credit quality data as of and for the year-to-date periods indicated for our on-balance sheet receivable portfolio including a summary of allowances for receivable losses, nonaccrual receivables, accruing receivables past due 90 days or more, delinquencies and charge-offs. Consolidated data includes business credit cards, consumer credit cards through February 1998, and other receivables. Gross interest income that would have been recorded for nonaccrual receivables, had interest been accrued throughout the year in accordance with the assets' original terms, was $4.6 million in 2002.

(2) Effective October 1, 2000, business credit card charge-off statistics     reflect the adoption of a new charge-off policy for bankruptcies. Bankrupt     business credit cards are charged off within a 60-day investigative period     after receipt of notification. The previous policy provided a 90-day     investigative period. Business credit card principal charge-offs for the     year ended December 31, 2000 include a 0.2% acceleration of charge-offs in     connection with the adoption of this policy.                                          31   SECURITIZATION INCOME  Securitization income was $119.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2002, $108.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2001, and $67.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in securitization income in 2002 as compared to 2001 was due primarily to increased volume of securitized receivables. Securitization income in 2002 was also impacted by a decline in yields on securitized receivables, a decrease in the interest rate earned by note holders, and an increased net charge-off rate on securitized receivables. These fluctuations in yields and rates are similar to those experienced in on-balance sheet business credit card receivables as discussed in the "Interest Income and Expense" and "Provision and Allowance for Receivable Losses" sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In 2003, we anticipate an increase in the volume of securitized receivables, as a result of anticipated receivables growth, which is expected to result in an increase in securitization income as compared to 2002. The increase in securitization income in 2001 as compared to 2000 was due to increased volume of securitized receivables and increased yields on securitized receivables, partially offset by increased charge-offs on securitized receivables.    Managed Receivable Data  Performance on a managed receivable portfolio basis is relevant because we retain interests in the securitized receivables and, therefore, we have a financial interest in and exposure to the performance of the securitized receivables.

The increase in servicing revenues in 2002 and 2001 was due to increased volume of securitized business credit card receivables.

The increase in interchange income in the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 was primarily due to higher purchase volume related to the increase in average managed business credit card accounts and receivables. The average interchange rate was 2.1% in the year ended December 31, 2002, 2.2% in the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2.1% in the year ended December 31, 2000.       Increases in business credit card rewards in the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, were due to the increase in average managed business credit card accounts in the rewards programs and the corresponding purchase activity in those accounts, partially offset by a change in estimate in 2002. In 2002, we revised our estimate of the bonus mile reward liability, including a change in the assumed percentage of cardholders that will ultimately claim rewards from 80% to 70% and a change in the estimated cost of future reward redemptions, based on experience for that program life-to-date. The impact of the change in estimate of the bonus mile reward liability was an approximate $1.9 million increase in other revenues in the year ended December 31, 2002. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. We anticipate that this change in estimate will have a favorable impact on results of operations in future periods, depending on the levels of bonus mile rewards earned by cardholders in those periods.       Increases in cash advance fees in the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are due to growth in managed business credit card accounts.       In 2002, our marketing campaigns have included a broader array of competitively-priced offerings and products, including balance transfer promotions, promotional pricing and rewards programs, geared specifically toward attracting more higher credit quality customers. We have experienced an increased volume of balance transfers to cardholder accounts in the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to 2001 due to these marketing campaigns. In connection with offering promotional pricing on balance transfers, we began assessing balance transfer fees to cardholders in the first quarter of 2002.       Investment securities gains (losses) include changes in the fair value and realized gains (losses) on venture capital investments. Investment securities gains (losses) in the year ended December 31, 2002 include $6.9 million of net decrease in valuations of venture capital investments, and $0.7 million of realized gains on other investments. Investment securities gains (losses) in the year ended December 31, 2001 include $9.3 million in realized losses on venture capital investments, $19.6 million in decreases in valuations of venture capital investments, and $2.7 million of realized gains on other investments. Investment securities gains (losses) in the year ended December 31, 2000 include $11.4 million in gains on the sale of venture capital investments, $3.7 million of net decrease in valuations of venture capital investments, and $2.2 million of realized losses on other investments.                                          33        In the second quarter of 2001, we sold $389.7 million of deposit liabilities to E*TRADE Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of E*TRADE Group, Inc., resulting in a $2.8 million loss.       Insurance revenues (losses), net, and other includes charges of $1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2002 related to valuation adjustments on other receivables held for sale. In the first quarter of 2001, we successfully negotiated an early termination of our strategic alliance with Progressive Casualty Insurance Company to direct market auto insurance. Insurance revenues, net and other in the year ended December 31, 2001 includes operating results of insurance operations, the impact of the termination of the strategic alliance with Progressive Casualty Insurance Company and $10 million of charges related to the write-off of insurance-related deferred acquisition costs that were unrealizable subsequent to the termination of the auto insurance strategic alliance. Insurance revenues, net and other in the year ended December 31, 2000 includes a charge of approximately $3 million in the insurance business relating to the settlement of a large policy claim.  LOSS ON TRANSFER OF CONSUMER CREDIT CARD BUSINESS  On January 22, 1999, Fleet Financial Group and certain of its affiliates filed a lawsuit against Advanta Corp. and certain of its subsidiaries in Delaware Chancery Court in connection with the transfer of our consumer credit card business in 1998. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. On January 22, 2003, the trial court issued a decision ruling on all but one of the issues that were to be determined at trial, and ordered further briefing on the remaining outstanding issue. In the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized a $43.0 million pretax charge representing the estimated impact of implementing the court's decisions. This charge was classified in continuing operations as a loss on transfer of consumer credit card business, consistent with the classification of the gain on transfer of consumer credit card business of $541 million in 1998.

These included initiatives to provide additional value to our existing customers, customer retention activities, development of additional products and services, development of affinity cards and partnership relationships, and enhancement of internet capabilities for servicing our customers. External processing expenses in 2002 also reflect a reduction in the contracted rate for these services that occurred during the first quarter of 2002.       The increase in amortization of business credit card deferred origination costs, net, in the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, is attributable to our strategic                                          34   initiative to selectively attract and retain more higher credit quality customers and the competitive environment for credit card issuers. Amortization of business credit card deferred origination costs in the year ended December 31, 2002 also includes a change in estimate of $1.4 million. Effective July 1, 2002, we refined our estimate of the timing of when accounts are acquired to better match the resulting estimated period of benefit to the amortization of deferred acquisition costs. The impact of this change in estimate in the year ended December 31, 2002 was a decrease in amortization of business credit card deferred origination costs of $1.4 million. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.       The increase in marketing expense in the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001 also resulted from our strategic initiative to selectively attract and retain more higher credit quality customers and the competitive environment for credit card issuers, partially offset by decreased origination activities in our retail note program as a result of our high liquidity position subsequent to the Mortgage Transaction in 2001.       Professional fees decreased in the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001 due primarily to a reduction in legal expenses related to the timing of litigation activity. Credit expense increased in the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001 due to growth in the volume of charged-off accounts, partially offset by the shift in the types of recoveries. There was an increase in the proportion of total recoveries collected through sales of pools of charged-off accounts and a decrease in the proportion collected through outsourced individual account recovery efforts.       The decrease in insurance expense in the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to 2001 is primarily a result of a decrease in FDIC insurance costs on deposit liabilities. Our FDIC insurance costs decreased due to the significant reduction in our outstanding deposits at Advanta National Bank subsequent to the Mortgage Transaction, and due to a decrease in the insurance assessment rate at Advanta Bank Corp. In addition, insurance expense in the year ended December 31, 2002 includes a $0.4 million reduction of our estimated liability related to worker's compensation insurance.       Other operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2002 include a $1.1 million decrease in litigation reserves resulting from a reduction of damages in a jury verdict. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. Other operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2001 include a $2.2 million cash rebate related to prior periods' business credit card processing costs.       Salaries and employee benefits, amortization of business credit card deferred origination costs, net, external processing and fraud loss expenses increased in the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000 due primarily to growth in managed business credit card receivables. Professional fees decreased by $3.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in professional fees was due to consulting costs incurred in 2000 associated with the implementation of our bank regulatory agreements, partially offset by increased legal costs in 2001. The decrease in marketing expenses in the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to 2000 reflects decreased origination activities in our retail note program as a result of our high liquidity position subsequent to the Mortgage Transaction in the first quarter of 2001. Other expenses in the year ended December 31, 2000 included an increase in litigation reserves of $7.0 million.  UNUSUAL CHARGES  Subsequent to our exit from the mortgage business and discontinuance of our leasing business in the first quarter of 2001, we implemented a plan to restructure our corporate functions to a size commensurate with our ongoing businesses and incurred certain other unusual charges related to employee costs. The restructuring activities had no significant impact on operations while they were ongoing. Due to the termination of employees and the write-off of certain assets no longer used, we expected and realized lower personnel expenses in the support functions in the 12 months following the charges, and expected to realize lower depreciation and amortization expense over the following 5-7 years. These decreases were due to the termination of employees and the write-off or write-down of assets previously deployed in connection with exited businesses. We also expected and realized the elimination of the costs of the contractual commitments                                          35   associated with exited business products from future operating results over the estimated timeframe of the contracts.    Employee costs  In the first quarter of 2001, we recorded a $4.1 million charge for severance and outplacement costs associated with the restructuring of corporate functions. There were 69 employees severed who were entitled to benefits. These employees worked in corporate support functions including accounting and finance, human resources, information technology, legal and facilities management. Employees were notified in March 2001, and severance amounts were payable over a 12-month period following the employee's termination date. These payments were completed in the third quarter of 2002.       Additionally, during 2001, we incurred $23.2 million of other employee costs. This amount included approximately $10 million attributable to bonuses to certain key employees in recognition of their efforts on behalf of Advanta in the strategic alternatives process. It also included approximately $4.5 million of bonuses in recognition of the restructuring of the company and other significant transitional efforts. These bonuses were paid over a 12-month period. In the second quarter of 2001, we recorded a $1.0 million increase in employee costs related to a revision in estimate associated with these bonuses. In 2001, we accelerated vesting of 32% of outstanding options that were not vested at the date of the closing of the Mortgage Transaction. This acceleration resulted in a noncash charge of $1.3 million. In connection with reviewing our compensation plans after the Mortgage Transaction and restructuring of corporate functions, we implemented a program whereby all outstanding stock appreciation rights and shares of phantom stock were terminated in exchange for cash to be paid through a deferred compensation arrangement. We recorded charges of $2.9 million associated with this exchange. The charge reflects a $0.7 million reduction recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2001, as actual cash settlement costs were less than estimated. Due to the restructuring of the company, we implemented programs whereby certain out-of-the-money options were exchanged for shares of stock, and whereby certain shares of restricted stock were exchanged for cash and stock options in a tender offer, subject to certain performance conditions and vesting requirements. Noncash charges associated with the issuance of the stock, stock options and the tender offer totaled $3.6 million. This charge reflects a $1.4 million increase recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2001, as actual noncash charges associated with the tender offer were more than estimated.    Expenses associated with exited businesses/products  In the first quarter of 2001, we recorded charges of $2.2 million related to other products exited for which no future revenues or benefits would be received. In the third quarter of 2001, we were able to settle some of these commitments for less than originally estimated, and reduced the charge by $0.7 million. We paid the remaining costs, which included lease and other commitments, in the third quarter of 2002.       In 1998, in connection with the transfer of our consumer credit card business to Fleet Credit Card LLC, we made major organizational changes to reduce corporate expenses incurred in the past: (1) to support the business contributed to Fleet Credit Card LLC in the transfer of our consumer credit card business, and (2) associated with the business and products no longer being offered or not directly associated with our mortgage, business credit card and leasing units. As of December 31, 2000, the remaining accrual related to charges associated with these organizational changes was $13.0 million. This accrual related to contractual commitments to certain customers, and non-related financial institutions that were providing benefits to those customers, under a product that was no longer offered and for which no future revenues or benefits would be received. A third party assumed the liabilities associated with these commitments in the first quarter of 2001, and we recorded an additional charge relating to the settlement of these commitments of $10.3 million.    Asset impairments  In connection with our plan to restructure our corporate functions to a size commensurate with our ongoing businesses during the first quarter of 2001, we identified certain assets that would no longer be used, and the carrying costs of these assets were written off resulting in a charge of $2.6 million. We estimated the realizable                                          36   value of these assets to be zero due to the nature of the assets, which include leasehold improvements and capitalized software.  INCOME TAXES  We reported a pretax loss in the year ended December 31, 2002 as a result of the $43.0 million charge related to the ruling in the litigation associated with the transfer of our consumer credit card business in 1998. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. Since the gain on the transfer of our consumer credit card business in 1998 was not subject to income tax, the $43.0 million charge in 2002 did not result in a tax benefit. As a result, we reported income tax expense from continuing operations of $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Our effective tax rate, excluding the $43.0 million charge, was 38.5% for the year ended December 31, 2002.       We reported a pretax loss in the year ended December 31, 2001 as a result of unusual charges, valuation adjustments on venture capital investments and the loss on the discontinuance of the leasing business in 2001. A valuation allowance was provided against a portion of the resulting deferred tax asset given our pre-existing net operating loss carryforwards and the uncertainty of the realizability of the incremental deferred tax asset, resulting in an effective tax rate of 28% for income from continuing operations for 2001. In the year ended December 31, 2000, we also reported a pretax loss and a valuation allowance was provided against the resulting deferred tax asset, resulting in a 0% effective tax rate.       At December 31, 2002, net operating loss carryforwards were $636 million, of which $391 million expire in 2018, $29 million expire in 2019, $1 million expire in 2020 and $215 million expire in 2021. We utilized net operating loss carryforwards of $49 million in 2002. Additionally in 2000, $29 million was carried back to prior years. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of tax matters currently before the Internal Revenue Service Regional Office of Appeals.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  In the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded an after-tax loss on the discontinuance of our mortgage and leasing businesses of $8.6 million. The components of this loss include a pretax charge of $7.5 million for a litigation settlement related to a mortgage loan servicing agreement termination fee collected in December 2000, a $17.8 million pretax charge primarily related to an increase in our estimated costs of mortgage business-related contingent liabilities, an $11.3 million pretax gain on leasing discontinuance, and a tax benefit of $5.4 million. The $17.8 million charge relates primarily to an increase in our estimated 2002 and future costs of mortgage business-related contingent liabilities in connection with (1) contingent liabilities and litigation costs arising from the operation of the mortgage business prior to the Mortgage Transaction that were not assumed by the buyer, and (2) costs related to Advanta's litigation with Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation in connection with the Mortgage Transaction. The change in estimate reflects the legal and consulting fees and other costs that we expect to incur based on current levels of contingent liabilities and expense rates, and considers the status of the discovery process associated with the Mortgage Transaction litigation. The $11.3 million pretax gain on leasing discontinuance represents a revision in the estimated operating results of the leasing segment over the remaining life of the lease portfolio due primarily to favorable credit performance. The leasing portfolio performed favorably as compared to the expectations and assumptions established in 2001. This improvement was the result of successfully obtaining a replacement vendor to service leased equipment for a former leasing vendor that had filed for bankruptcy protection, and operational improvements in the leasing collections area.       In the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded an after-tax loss on the discontinuance of our mortgage and leasing businesses of $31.6 million. The components of this net loss include a pretax gain on the Mortgage Transaction of $20.8 million, a pretax loss on the discontinuance of our leasing business of $45.0 million, and a tax provision of $7.4 million. The gain on the Mortgage Transaction does not reflect any impact from the post-closing adjustment process that has not yet been completed due to litigation related to the Mortgage Transaction. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. The $45.0 million pretax loss on the discontinuance of the leasing business in 2001 was due to a change in estimate of the operating results                                          37   of the leasing segment over the remaining life of the lease portfolio. The change in estimate was needed due to an increase in estimated credit losses expected throughout the remaining term of the leasing portfolio based on credit loss experience in 2001. A principal factor contributing to the increased credit losses in 2001 was that one of our former leasing vendors had filed for bankruptcy protection and this vendor's financial problems were impacting its ability to service the leased equipment in a segment of our leasing portfolio. This vendor was unique from our other leasing vendors in that it had a significant servicing relationship with our customers and the equipment under lease provided fee revenue to our customers for usage. Also, our contract with the vendor provided that the vendor would provide a guaranty if the performance of the leases did not meet certain criteria. This guaranty was considered when underwriting the leases.       We recorded a loss on the discontinuance of our leasing business of $4.3 million, net of tax, effective December 31, 2000, representing the estimated operating results through the remaining term of the leasing portfolio. Estimated operating results of the leasing business included estimated valuations of retained interests in leasing securitizations, estimated cash flows from on-balance sheet lease receivables, interest expense and operating expenses.       Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $8.4 million for the period from January 1, 2001 through February 28, 2001, the effective date of the Mortgage Transaction. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $163.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2000. Loss from discontinued operations in the year ended December 31, 2000 includes charges which were made in response to our regulatory review process, including the implementation of the agreements with the bank regulators that were signed during the second and third quarters of 2000, and changes during the second quarter in the market and the political and regulatory environment for subprime lending. These charges included a pretax reduction in the valuation of Advanta National Bank's retained interests in mortgage securitizations of $214.0 million and an increase in Advanta National Bank's on-balance sheet allowance for receivable losses related to mortgage loans of $22.0 million. These Advanta National Bank charges reduced net income by $236.0 million or $9.31 per combined common diluted share.       In addition, loss from discontinued operations in the year ended December 31, 2000 includes $20.3 million of pretax charges resulting from changes in valuation assumptions related to retained interests in leasing securitizations, primarily due to higher credit losses associated with certain unprofitable segments of broker originations from prior periods. These charges reduced net income by $20.3 million or $0.80 per combined common diluted share. Loss from discontinued operations in the year ended December 31, 2000 also includes $25.3 million of revenues related to termination fees received under a mortgage servicing agreement.  ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT  We manage our financial condition with a focus on maintaining high credit quality standards, disciplined management of market risks and prudent levels of growth, leverage and liquidity.  MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY  Market risk is the potential for loss or diminished financial performance arising from adverse changes in market forces including interest rates and market prices. Market risk sensitivity is the degree to which a financial instrument, or a company that owns financial instruments, is exposed to market forces. Fluctuations in interest rates, changes in economic conditions, shifts in customer behavior, and other factors can affect our financial performance. Changes in economic conditions and shifts in customer behavior are difficult to predict, and our financial performance generally cannot be insulated from these forces.       We are exposed to equity price risk on the equity securities in our investments available for sale portfolio. A significant portion of our equity securities at December 31, 2002 represented venture capital investments. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the market exposure on equity investments. A 20% adverse change in equity prices would result in an approximate $4.1 million decrease in the fair value of our equity investments as of December 31, 2002. A 20% adverse change would have resulted in an approximate $5.3 million decrease in fair value as of December 31, 2001.                                          38        Financial performance variability as a result of fluctuations in interest rates is commonly called interest rate risk. Interest rate risk generally results from mismatches in the timing of asset and liability repricing (gap risk) and from differences between the repricing indices of assets and liabilities (basis risk). We regularly evaluate our market risk profile and attempt to minimize the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income, securitization income and net income. In managing interest rate risk exposure, we may periodically securitize receivables, sell and purchase assets, alter the mix and term structure of our funding base, change our investment portfolio, or use derivative financial instruments. Derivatives are not used for trading or speculative activities. There were no interest rate swaps or other derivatives outstanding related to continuing operations at December 31, 2002 or 2001.       Risk exposure levels vary continuously, as changes occur in our asset/liability mix, market interest rates and other factors affecting the timing and magnitude of cash flows. We attempt to analyze the impact of interest rate risk by regularly evaluating the perceived risks inherent in our asset and liability structure, including derivative instruments, if applicable. Computer simulations are used to generate expected financial performance in a variety of interest rate environments. Those results are analyzed to determine if actions need to be taken to mitigate our interest rate risk.       We measure our interest rate risk using a rising rate scenario and a declining rate scenario. Net interest income is estimated using a third party software model that uses standard income modeling techniques. We also measure the effect of interest rate risk on our managed net interest income, which includes net interest income on owned assets and net interest income on securitized receivables. The measurement of managed net interest income in addition to net interest income on owned assets is meaningful because our securitization income fluctuates with yields on securitized receivables and interest rates earned by note holders. Both increasing and decreasing rate scenarios assume an instantaneous shift in rates and measure the corresponding change in expected net interest income as compared to a base case scenario. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, we estimated that our owned net interest income and managed net interest income would change as follows over a twelve-month period:                                                                  2002    2001 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------      Estimated percentage increase (decrease) in owned net   interest income:   Assuming 200 basis point increase in interest rates          16 %     5 %   Assuming 200 basis point decrease in interest rates           3 %    (3)% Estimated percentage increase (decrease) in managed net   interest income:   Assuming 200 basis point increase in interest rates          (4)%    (7)%   Assuming 200 basis point decrease in interest rates           9 %     7 % - --------------------------------------------------------------------------        Our owned and securitized business credit card receivables include interest rate floors that cause our managed net interest income to rise in the declining rate scenario. Our managed net interest income decreases in a rising rate scenario due to the portion of the business credit card portfolio that is effectively at a fixed rate because of the nature of the pricing of the accounts and the variable rate funding of off-balance sheet securitized receivables. Changes in the composition of our balance sheet, the current interest rate environment at December 31, 2002 as compared to December 31, 2001, and a reset of interest rate floors on a significant portion of our business credit cards portfolio during 2002 have also impacted the results of the owned and managed net interest income sensitivity analyses.       The above estimates of net interest income sensitivity alone do not provide a comprehensive view of our exposure to interest rate risk. The quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters and assumptions utilized in generating the results. These analyses are useful only when viewed within the context of the parameters and assumptions used. The above rate scenarios in no way reflect management's expectation regarding the future direction of interest rates, and they depict only two possibilities out of a large set of possible scenarios.                                          39   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Our goal is to maintain an adequate level of liquidity, for both long-term and short-term needs, through active management of both assets and liabilities. Since Advanta Corp.'s debt rating is not investment grade, our access to unsecured, institutional debt is limited. However, we do have access to a diversity of funding sources as described below, and had a high level of liquidity at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002, we had $332 million of federal funds sold, $177 million of receivables held for sale, and $126 million of investments, which could be sold to generate additional liquidity.       Components of funding were as follows at December 31:                                                                        2002               2001                                                               ----------------   ---------------- ($ IN THOUSANDS)                                                AMOUNT      %      AMOUNT      % - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------          Off-balance sheet securitized receivables (1)                 $2,172,266    60%  $1,893,162    56% Deposits                                                         714,028    19      636,915    19 Debt and other borrowings                                        315,886     9      355,899    11 Capital securities                                               100,000     3      100,000     3 Equity                                                           321,313     9      366,299    11 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                                                         $3,623,493   100%  $3,352,275   100% =================================================================================================   (1) Includes both off-balance sheet business credit card receivables and     off-balance sheet lease receivables related to discontinued operations.     Excludes our ownership interest in the investor principal balance of     securitizations (subordinated trust assets) that are held on-balance sheet     and classified as retained interests in securitizations or assets of     discontinued operations.       At December 31, 2002, our ratio of equity, including capital securities, to on-balance sheet assets was 25.1% as compared to 28.5% at December 31, 2001. In managing our capital needs, we also consider our ratio of equity to managed assets, since our on-balance sheet assets include retained interests in securitizations that serve as credit enhancement to the investors' interests in the securitized receivables. The ratio of equity, including capital securities, to managed assets was 10.9% at December 31, 2002 as compared to 13.2% at December 31, 2001. We calculate managed assets as follows:                                                                       DECEMBER 31,                                                               ----------------------- ($ IN THOUSANDS)                                                 2002         2001 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Total on-balance sheet assets                                 $1,681,613   $1,636,680 Off-balance sheet securitized receivables                      2,172,266    1,893,162 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Managed assets                                                $3,853,879   $3,529,842 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     Off-Balance Sheet Securitizations  As shown in the components of funding table above, off-balance sheet securitizations provide a significant portion of our funding and they are one of our primary sources of liquidity. These transactions enable us to limit our credit risk in the securitized receivables to the amount of interests retained on-balance sheet. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for key securitization data including income, cash flows and assumptions used in measuring the fair value of our retained interests in securitizations. Our accounting policies related to securitization transactions are discussed in the "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.       We completed one public business credit card securitization in each of 2002 and 2001, and our first two public business credit card securitizations in 2000. These public securitizations enabled us to grow off-balance sheet business credit card receivables as a component of our funding. In addition to the public securitizations, the securitization trust has two non-public series outstanding. The first series, Series 1997-A, provides off-balance sheet funding through a $330 million committed commercial paper conduit facility, through which $330 million of business credit card receivables were securitized at December 31, 2002. The commitment can                                          40   be withdrawn under certain conditions, similar to the conditions for an early amortization event, as described below, for the other series of the securitization trust. Our commercial paper conduit facility also requires the servicer, Advanta Bank Corp., to meet its minimum regulatory capital requirements. Upon the expiration of $50 million of this commercial paper conduit facility in March 2003 and the remainder of $280 million in June 2003, management expects to obtain the appropriate level of replacement funding under similar terms and conditions. The second non-public series was a securitization completed in 2000.       The revolving periods for each series of the business credit card securitization trust extend to the following dates:    ($ IN THOUSANDS)  INVESTOR PRINCIPAL                       BALANCE AT       SCHEDULED END OF                   DECEMBER 31, 2002    REVOLVING PERIOD - -------------------------------------------------------      Series 1997-A          $341,725               June 2003 Series 2000-A           157,068            January 2003 Series 2000-B           600,000              March 2003 Series 2000-C           400,000            January 2005 Series 2001-A           300,000               July 2007 Series 2002-A           300,000          September 2004        In addition to investor principal balance, our securitized business credit card receivables include billed interest and fees of $50.4 million on those accounts at December 31, 2002.       When the revolving periods of the series end and they start their expected amortization periods, we will need to replace the funding currently being provided by those series. We expect the $157 million Series 2000-A to complete its amortization period by April 2003 and the $600 million Series 2000-B to complete its amortization period by July 2003. Management expects to replace this funding through a combination of increased deposits and private and public securitization transactions under similar terms and conditions as our current private and public securitizations. However, based on recent trends in market rates for asset-backed securities issued by certain other credit card companies and our recent experience, we expect the costs of our public securitization transactions in 2003 will be higher than what we experienced in 2002.       The securitization agreements contain conditions that would trigger an early amortization event. An early amortization event would result in the end of the revolving period prior to the expected dates above, which would require us to find an alternate means of funding new receivables generated on existing business credit card accounts. The conditions include the failure to make payments under the terms of the agreement, or the insolvency or other similar event of Advanta Bank Corp. An early amortization event would also be triggered for each individual series if the three-month average excess spread percentage was not maintained at a level greater than 0% for that series. Excess spread represents income-related cash flows on securitized receivables (interest, interchange and fees) net of note holders' interest, servicing fees, and credit losses. At December 31, 2002, our three-month average excess spread was 11%. Based on the current levels of excess spread, our financial condition and other considerations, management believes that it is unlikely that the trust or any individual series will have an early amortization event. The business credit card securitization agreements do not have any provisions or conditions involving the debt rating of Advanta Corp.    Deposits, Debt, Other Borrowings and Equity  In the first quarter of 2001, we received in excess of $1 billion in cash proceeds from the Mortgage Transaction that resulted in liquidity in excess of the needs of our continuing businesses. We strategically used the proceeds to strengthen Advanta for the future, including a significant reduction in our leverage. In the second quarter of 2001, we sold $389.7 million of our deposit liabilities to E*TRADE Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of E*TRADE Group, Inc. We also paid off substantially all of our outstanding medium-term notes and reduced our outstanding retail notes. In the year ended December 31, 2001, we reduced debt and deposits by $1.1 billion. Also, Advanta National Bank suspended originations of deposit accounts. Excess liquid assets were held in short-term, high-quality investments earning money market rates until they could be deployed. As a result, we had interest expense in excess of interest income on this excess liquidity that was not included                                          41   in Advanta Business Cards or venture capital segment results. We do not anticipate that we will incur net interest expense unrelated to the funding of our Advanta Business Cards or venture capital segments in the year ended December 31, 2003 since the excess liquid assets described above have been deployed as of December 31, 2002.       We continue to offer unsecured debt securities of Advanta Corp., in the form of RediReserve Certificates and Investment Notes, to retail investors through our retail note program. We change the interest rates we offer frequently, depending on market conditions and our funding needs. The rates also vary depending on the size of each investment. At December 31, 2002, $316 million of RediReserve Certificates and Investment Notes were outstanding with interest rates ranging from 2.75% to 11.56%.       In the first quarter of 2001, after consideration of the parent liquidity and the capital requirements for the ongoing business, the Board of Directors of Advanta Corp. authorized management to purchase up to 1.5 million shares of Advanta Corp. common stock or the equivalent dollar amount of our capital securities, or some combination thereof. In August 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional 1.5 million shares of Advanta Corp. common stock, bringing the total authorization to up to 3.0 million shares. We intend to continue to make purchases modestly and when we believe it is prudent to do so while we analyze evolving capital requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we repurchased 693,300 shares of our Class B Common Stock. In the year ended December 31, 2002, we repurchased 1,554,759 shares of our Class B Common Stock.       Advanta Corp. and its subsidiaries are involved in class action lawsuits, other litigation, claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business or discontinued operations, including litigation arising from our operation of the mortgage business prior to the Mortgage Transaction in the first quarter of 2001. Management believes that the aggregate loss, if any, resulting from existing litigation, claims and other legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or capital resources based on our current expectations regarding the ultimate resolutions of these actions and amounts held in escrow in connection with certain litigation. However, due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and since the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings are influenced by factors outside of our control, it is reasonably possible that the estimated cash flow related to these proceedings may change or that actual results will differ from our estimates.

We expect to fund commitments related to operating leases with operating cash flows.       In addition to these obligations, we have commitments to extend credit to our business credit card customers, representing unused lines of credit, of $6.1 billion at December 31, 2002 and $4.6 billion at December 31, 2001. Lines of credit on our customers' business credit cards totaled $8.6 billion at December 31, 2002 and $6.6 billion at December 31, 2001. We believe that our customers' utilization of their lines of credit will continue to be substantially less than the amount of the commitments, as has been our experience to date. We expect to fund the commitments to extend credit with the various components of funding described above, similar to the funding of other new receivables.    Regulatory Agreements and Restrictions at Subsidiaries  Advanta Bank Corp. and Advanta National Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements and other regulatory provisions that restrict their ability to lend and/or pay dividends to Advanta Corp. and its affiliates. Our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to certain capital and dividend rules and regulations as prescribed by state jurisdictions in which they are authorized to operate. See "Part I -- Government Regulation."       In 2000, Advanta Bank Corp. entered into agreements with its bank regulatory agencies, primarily relating to the bank's subprime lending operations. These agreements imposed temporary deposit growth limits at Advanta Bank Corp. and required prior regulatory approval of cash dividends. In April 2002, the agreements were removed and, as a result, the restrictions in the agreements on deposit growth and payment of                                         43   cash dividends are no longer applicable. In connection with removing the agreements, Advanta Bank Corp. reached an understanding with its regulators, reflecting continued progress in our ongoing efforts to enhance Advanta Bank Corp.'s practices and procedures. Effective October 2002, the understanding was revised. The revised understanding replaces the provisions of the prior understanding and provides for the bank to enhance certain of its internal planning and monitoring processes. The revised understanding is consistent with the manner in which Advanta Bank Corp. is currently operating its business and includes no restrictions expected to have any impact on our financial results.       In 2000, Advanta National Bank also reached agreements with its bank regulatory agency, primarily relating to the bank's subprime lending operations. The agreements established temporary asset growth limits at Advanta National Bank, imposed restrictions on taking brokered deposits and required that Advanta National Bank maintain certain capital ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory standards. In 2001, Advanta National Bank entered into an additional agreement with its regulatory agency regarding restrictions on new business activities and product lines at Advanta National Bank after the Mortgage Transaction, and the resolution of outstanding Advanta National Bank liabilities. The agreement also reduced the capital requirements for Advanta National Bank to 12.7% for Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted assets, and to 5% for Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets as defined in the agreement. In addition, the agreement prohibits the payment of dividends by Advanta National Bank without prior regulatory approval. Management believes that Advanta National Bank was in compliance with its regulatory agreements at December 31, 2002.       At December 31, 2002, Advanta Bank Corp.'s combined total capital ratio (combined Tier I and Tier II capital) was 18.46%, and Advanta National Bank's combined total capital ratio was 23.13%. At December 31, 2001, Advanta Bank Corp.'s combined total capital ratio was 18.80%, and Advanta National Bank's combined total capital ratio was 23.34%. In each case, Advanta Bank Corp. and Advanta National Bank had capital at levels a bank is required to maintain to be classified as "well-capitalized" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. However, Advanta National Bank does not meet the definition of "well-capitalized" because of the existence of its agreement with its regulatory agency, even though it has achieved the higher imposed capital ratios required by the agreement.       Total stockholders' equity of our banking and insurance affiliates was $280 million at December 31, 2002, of which $226 million was restricted. At January 1, 2003, $54.6 million of stockholders' equity of our bank and insurance affiliates was available for payment of cash dividends in 2003 under applicable regulatory guidelines without prior regulatory approval.       In addition to dividend restrictions at banking subsidiaries, certain non-bank subsidiaries are subject to minimum equity requirements as part of securitization or other agreements. The total minimum equity requirement of non-bank subsidiaries was $10 million at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002, the non-bank subsidiaries were in compliance with these minimum equity requirements.       Management believes that the restrictions, for both bank and non-bank subsidiaries, will not have an adverse effect on Advanta Corp.'s ability to meet its cash obligations due to the current levels of liquidity and diversity of funding sources.
