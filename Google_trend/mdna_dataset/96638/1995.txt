ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   Net income for 1994 of $106.1 million increased $29.5 million or 38% from the $76.6 million reported for 1993. Earnings per share of $2.58 increased 34% from the $1.92 reported for 1993. Net income before extraordinary item was $77.9 million or $1.95 per share in 1993. The increased earnings resulted primarily from substantial growth in average managed receivables, partially offset by the contraction in the managed net interest margin. Additionally, continued improvement in credit quality and disciplined cost management contributed to the improved financial results.           Average managed receivables of $6.1 billion in 1994 increased 45% from $4.2 billion in 1993. As a majority of the receivables continue to be securitized, the Company records the net cash flows on these securitized receivables as noninterest revenues. Noninterest revenues of $395.8 million in 1994 increased $140.2 million or 55% from $255.6 million in 1993. This increase was due to the 45% increase in average managed receivables, as well as an $18.4 million gain on the sale of $150 million of credit card customer relationships. This transaction allowed the Company to make additional investments in marketing and developmental initiatives. Including these increases in marketing and developmental expenses, total other operating expenses (excluding the amortization of credit card deferred origination costs, net) increased only 30% in 1994 despite the 45% growth in average managed receivables. The operating expense ratio decreased to 3.7% in 1994 from 4.1% in 1993. Asset quality indicators also continued to trend favorably. The total managed charge-off rate for 1994 fell to 2.3% from 2.9% in 1993, and the 30-day and over delinquency rate on managed receivables decreased to 2.7% at December 31, 1994 from 3.6% at year end 1993.           Over the last three years, average managed receivables have grown at a compound annual rate of 38%. This receivable growth has generated higher return on assets, net income and earnings per share. The Company intends to continue pursuing a strategy of receivable growth with a goal of increasing average managed receivables by 40% or more in 1995. A significant component of this growth strategy is the Company's marketing of "risk-adjusted" credit card products, whereby credit cards are issued with lower rates to customers whose credit quality is expected to result in a lower rate of credit losses (the "risk-adjusted pricing strategy"). The Company's pricing structure on its credit card products also reflects low "introductory" credit card rates, which reprice upwards after an introductory period of up to one year. In 1994, the impact of these introductory rates was to reduce the managed net interest margin significantly, as the success of the Company's marketing campaigns resulted in substantial new receivable growth earning interest at the introductory rates. While the Company expects to increase earnings in 1995, it is anticipated that the managed net interest margin will continue to decline in 1995 as the result of the impact of the introductory rates on credit cards.           Net income for 1993 rose to $76.6 million or $1.92 per share. This reflects increases of 60% and 39%, respectively, from the $48.0 million or $1.38 per share reported in 1992. Earnings for 1993 increased primarily as a result of a $1.1 billion or 33% increase in average managed receivables, improvements in credit quality with the total managed charge-off rate decreasing from 3.4% in 1992 to 2.9% in 1993, and controlled growth in operating expenses. The 33% increase in average managed receivables was the main driver in the $62.5 million or 32% increase in noninterest revenues to $255.6 million in 1993, from $193.1 million in 1992. As a result of improved credit quality, the provision for credit losses in 1993 fell to $29.8 million from $47.1 million in 1992. Despite a lower provision, reserve coverage of impaired owned assets was higher at December 31, 1993 compared to a year earlier. Disciplined cost management resulted in other operating expenses increasing only 27%, while average managed receivables grew 33% and the operating expense ratio fell to 4.1% for 1993 from 4.4% in 1992.    23                                                                               23                                                    Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries   NET INTEREST INCOME  Net interest income represents the excess of income generated from interest-earning assets, including receivables, investments and money market instruments over the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and debt.           Net interest income of $70.4 million for 1994 decreased $8.2 million or 11% from 1993 as a result of a lower owned net interest margin, which fell to 3.67% in 1994 from 4.85% in 1993. The lower owned net interest margin resulted from a 121 basis point decrease in the yield on interest earning assets due to a significant increase in credit card receivables issued at low introductory rates, partially offset by a $336 million increase in average interest earning assets. Also affecting the owned net interest margin was a timing lag between the adjustments in the Company's funding rates and the repricing of the interest rates on the Company's credit cards as a result of multiple changes in the prime rate during 1994. The Company's credit cards (other than those with fixed rate introductory pricing) are contractually indexed monthly to the prime rate.           Net interest income of $78.6 million for 1993 increased $5.5 million or 7% from 1992 as a result of a $170 million increase in average earning asset balances, offset by a 22 basis point drop in the owned net interest margin. The Company began to execute its risk-adjusted pricing strategy during 1993. This strategy resulted in a drop in credit card yields thereby lowering the owned net interest margin.           Credit card, mortgage and lease receivable securitization activity shifts revenues from interest income to noninterest revenues. This ongoing securitization activity reduces the level of higher-yielding receivables on the balance sheet while increasing the balance sheet levels of new lower-yielding receivables and money market assets. Net interest income on securitized credit card balances is reflected in credit card securitization income. Net interest income on securitized mortgage loans is reflected in income from mortgage banking activities, and net interest income on securitized lease receivables is reflected in leasing revenues, net. All securitization income is included in noninterest revenues. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements.           Average managed credit card receivables of $4.7 billion for 1994 increased $1.7 billion or 55% from 1993. This increase resulted from the very successful marketing of low introductory rate credit cards which generated approximately 1.5 million new accounts and a large volume of balance transfers by cardholders. In 1994 average owned credit card receivables were $1.2 billion compared to $900 million in 1993. Owned receivable balances would have been higher in both years had it not been for the securitization of $2.2 billion of credit card receivables in 1994 and $1.0 billion in 1993. A 201 basis point decline in the yield on owned credit card receivables was the result of the Company continuing to employ the risk-adjusted pricing strategy and the influence of a predominance of newer, lower-yielding accounts in the owned portfolio. A majority of these new accounts will be repricing upwards during 1995.           Average managed mortgage loans increased to $1.2 billion in 1994, a 17% increase from $1.0 billion in 1993. The average balance of owned mortgage loans decreased to $120.0 million in 1994 from $154.2 million in 1993 primarily due to the securitization of $456 million of receivables in 1994. Mortgage loan originations of $493 million in 1994 were down $17 million or 3% from 1993. Yields on owned mortgage loans decreased to 8.18% from 9.91% in 1993 reflecting a greater proportion of nonperforming loans on the balance sheet. During 1994 the Company initiated a program to repurchase nonperforming loans from the securitization trusts (see discussion under "Provision for Credit Losses").    24                                                                               24                                                    Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries             Average managed lease receivables of $201.9 million increased $56.1 million or 39% from 1993. Average owned balances of leases increased only $2.6 million during 1994 due to the securitization of $101.6 million of receivables in 1994. Yields on owned leases decreased to 14.36% in 1994 from 18.70% in 1993 primarily due to the exclusion of late fees on securitized leases from the 1994 yield.           A slight increase in the owned average cost of funds was experienced in 1994 as the cost of funds rose to 5.22% from 5.18% in 1993. The rollover of deposits and money market instruments at higher rates resulted from a rising rate environment in 1994. The Company has utilized derivatives to manage the impact on the Company from rising rates (see discussion under "Derivatives Activities"). The achievement of investment-grade ratings in 1993 also enabled the Company in 1994 to benefit from alternative funding vehicles not previously available.           The following table provides an analysis of both owned and managed interest income and expense data, average balance sheet data, net interest spread (the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities), and net interest margin (the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid to fund interest earning assets) for 1992 through 1994. Average owned loan and lease receivables and the related interest revenues include certain loan fees.    25                                                                               25                                                    Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries   INTEREST RATE ANALYSIS    (Dollars in thousands)                                 Year Ended December 31,                                   -

In addition, provision for credit losses represents the amount by which provision for credit losses would have been higher had the securitized receivables remained as owned and provision for credit losses been equal to charge-offs. Both net interest income and provision for credit losses described above are netted and included in other noninterest revenues in the Consolidated Income Statements.     27                                                                               27                                                    Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries   PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  The provision for credit losses of $34.2 million in 1994 increased $4.4 million or 15% from $29.8 million in 1993. Net charge-offs on owned receivables for 1994 were $35.3 million, exceeding the provision for credit losses by $1.1 million. In 1993, the Company transferred $11 million of on-balance sheet reserves to off-balance sheet mortgage loan recourse reserves. In 1994, the Company initiated a program to repurchase nonperforming mortgages from the securitization trusts in order to lower funding costs on those mortgages. As a result, in 1994, the Company repurchased approximately $50 million of nonperforming mortgages and transferred approximately $13 million of off-balance sheet recourse reserves related to these loans to on-balance sheet reserves. When these mortgages were charged off in 1994, the Company did not need to provide additional amounts for them since reserves had been specifically provided for these mortgages at their repurchase date. These repurchases increased the owned impaired asset level while having no impact on either the level of managed impaired assets or the provision for credit losses. The owned impaired asset level was $43.3 million at December 31, 1994, compared to $22.5 million a year ago.           The provision for credit losses of $29.8 million in 1993 decreased $17.3 million or 37% from $47.1 million in 1992. This decrease was primarily due to lower charge-offs on owned receivables and lower impaired asset levels.           A description of the credit performance of the loan portfolio is set forth under the section entitled "Credit Risk Management."

This improvement resulted from a 66% growth in average securitized credit card receivables, from an $18.4 million gain on the sale of credit card customer relationships (see Note 13 to Consolidated Financial Statements), and from a 61% growth in average securitized lease receivables.           Due to the securitization of credit card receivables, activity from securitized account balances normally reported as net interest income and charge-offs is reported in securitization income and servicing income, both of which are included in noninterest revenues. Credit card securitization income increased 55% to $210.3 million from $135.8 million in 1993 while average securitized credit card receivables increased 66% to $3.5 billion in 1994 from $2.1 billion in the prior year. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of securitization income.           Credit card securitization income is the excess of revenue collected on the securitized receivables, including interest, interchange income and certain fees, over the related securitization trust expenses, including interest payments to investors in the trusts, charge-offs, servicing costs and transaction expenses. Credit card servicing income which represents fees paid to the Company for continuing to service accounts which have    28                                                                               28                                                    Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries   been securitized, increased to $69.0 million in 1994 from $41.6 million in 1993. Such fees normally approximate 2% of securitized receivables.           Interchange income represents fees that are payable by merchants to  the credit card issuer for sale transactions. Total interchange income earned approximates 1.4% of credit card purchases. The amount of interchange paid to the securitization trusts ranges from 1% to 2% of securitized balances and is included in credit card securitization income. Interchange income decreased 45% to $10.4 million in 1994 from $18.8 million in 1993 due to a larger proportion of interchange revenues being included in securitization income. Other credit card revenues, which include credit insurance, cash advance fees and other credit card related revenues, increased $2.7 million to $14.2 million in 1994 from $11.5 million in 1993.           During 1994, the Company securitized $456 million of mortgage loans compared to $608 million in 1993. Mortgage banking income of $37.6 million for 1994 increased from $24.1 million in 1993. In 1993, increased credit losses on the securitized portfolio reduced income from mortgage banking activities by approximately $14 million. Increased prepayments also reduced income from mortgage banking activities by $14 million in 1993. In 1994, although credit losses on the managed portfolio increased, the Company did not need to add additional amounts to off-balance sheet reserves as in previous years. Also, the Company did not experience the degree of increased prepayments that it did in 1993. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of mortgage banking income.           Noninterest revenues of $255.6 million in 1993 increased $62.5 million or 32% from $193.1 million in 1992, primarily due to increases in credit card securitization and servicing income, and leasing and insurance revenues. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in credit card interchange income.    29                                                                               29                                                    Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries   OPERATING EXPENSES           (Dollars in thousands)                                          - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                       1994             1993               1992 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------        Amortization of credit card   deferred origination   costs, net                      $ 39,381         $  6,566           $  4,482 Other operating expenses:   Salaries and employee      benefits                       88,681           65,469             51,599           Marketing                         32,339           18,742             13,845           External processing               22,618           16,604             12,993           Credit card fraud                                                                         losses                         16,654           13,779             13,134           Postage                           12,732            9,818              7,806           Professional fees                 10,985           10,761              5,700           Equipment expense                  9,293            6,550              5,629           Telephone expense                  8,615            5,402              4,379           Occupancy expense                  8,425            6,247              5,272           Credit and collection                                                                     expense                         7,604            7,055              5,273           Other                              9,457           14,174             11,970         - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------         Total other operating                                                                    expenses                        $227,403         $174,601           $137,600        - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Total operating                                                                          expenses                        $266,784         $181,167           $142,082        ==============================================================================  At year end:                                                                             Number of accounts                                                                        managed (000's)                 3,965            2,827              2,252           Number of employees                1,753            1,614              1,327         For the year:                                                                            Other operating expenses                                                                  as a percentage of                                                                     average managed                                                                        receivables                       3.7%             4.1%               4.4%        ==============================================================================           The amortization of credit card deferred origination costs, net, increased from $6.6 million in 1993 to $39.4 million in 1994. In May 1993, the Emerging Issues Task Force (the "EITF") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") reached a consensus regarding the deferral of amounts paid to a third party to acquire individual credit card accounts and the amortization period for such costs. As a result of this consensus, deferred origination costs and the amortization thereof are now linked to the privilege period of the card (which is normally 12 months), rather than to the related receivable. In 1994, the Company began including the amortization of these costs as an operating expense rather than a component of net interest income, as the costs no longer relate to the receivables. All prior periods have been reclassified for this change. Costs incurred for credit card originations initiated after the May 1993 EITF consensus date are being amortized over 12 months, rather than pursuant to the previous policy of 60 months. Due to the fact that 1993 was a transition year, the full impact of this change did not occur until 1994. Also affecting the increase in amortization was a $25.7 million increase in amounts deferred under these third party arrangements in 1994.           Total other operating expenses of $227.4 million for 1994 were up $52.8 million or 30% from $174.6 million in 1993. The increase in total other operating expenses primarily resulted from: (a) a $23.2 million or 35% increase in salaries and employee benefits, (b) a $13.6 million increase in marketing expenses as the Company promoted its financial products as well as enhanced its general public visibility, (c) a $6.0 million increase in external processing resulting primarily from a 40% increase in the number of accounts managed year-to-year, and (d) an overall increase in credit card related costs due to a 42% increase in the number of managed credit card accounts.           The amortization of credit card deferred origination costs, net, rose to $6.6 million in 1993 from $4.5 million in 1992, due to the change in the amortization period discussed above. Total other operating expenses of $174.6 million for 1993 rose $37.0 million or 27% from $137.6 million in 1992, driven by a 33% growth in average managed receivables. The overall growth in operating expenses was reflected in a $13.9 million or 27% increase in salaries and employee benefits, as well as increases in marketing expenses, external processing and other credit card related costs due to the 27% increase in the number of managed credit card accounts during 1993.    30                                                                               30                                                    Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries    INCOME TAXES  The Company's consolidated income tax expense was $59.1 million for 1994, or an effective tax rate of 36%, compared to tax expense of $45.3 million, or a 37% effective rate, in 1993 and tax expense of $29.1 million, or a 38% effective rate, in 1992. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 1993 to 1994 resulted from a higher level of tax-free income and lower levels of state taxes. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 1992 to 1993 resulted from a higher level of tax-free income.  ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT  The financial condition of Advanta Corp. is managed with a focus on maintaining high credit quality standards, disciplined interest rate risk management and prudent levels of leverage and liquidity.  INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY  Interest rate sensitivity refers to net interest income variability resulting from mismatches between asset and liability indices (basis risk) and the effects which these changes in market interest rates have on asset and liability maturity mismatches (gap risk).           The Company attempts to minimize the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and net income by regularly evaluating the risk inherent in its asset and liability structure, including securitized assets. This risk arises from continuous changes in the Company's asset/liability mix, market interest rates, the yield curve, prepayment trends and the timing of cash flows. Computer simulations are used to evaluate net interest income volatility under varying rate, spread and volume projections over monthly time periods of up to two years.           In managing its interest rate sensitivity position, the Company periodically securitizes, sells and purchases assets, alters the mix and term structure of its funding base, changes its investment portfolio and short-term investment position, and uses derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used for the express purpose of managing exposure to changes in interest rates and, by policy, are not used for any speculative purposes (see discussion under "Derivatives Activities"). The Company has primarily utilized variable rate funding in pricing its credit card securitization transactions in an attempt to match the variable rate pricing dynamics of the underlying receivables sold to the trusts. Variable rate funding is used on the balance sheet as well, in support of unsecuritized receivables which carry variable rates. Although credit card receivable rates are generally set at a spread over the prime rate, they often contain interest rate floors. These floors have the impact of converting the credit card receivables to fixed rate receivables in a low interest rate environment. In instances when a significant portion of credit card receivables are at their floors, the Company may convert part of the underlying funding to a fixed rate by using interest rate hedges, swaps and fixed rate securitizations. In pricing mortgage and lease securitizations, both fixed rate and variable rate funding are used depending upon the characteristics of the underlying receivables. Additionally, basis risk exists in on-balance sheet funding as well as securitizing credit card receivables at a spread over LIBOR when the rate on the underlying assets is indexed to the prime rate. The underlying liability or coupon on a securitization is often indexed to LIBOR, and LIBOR does not perfectly correlate to prime. The Company measures the basis risk resulting from potential variability in the spread between prime and LIBOR and incorporates such risk into the asset and liability management process. During 1994, $425 million in prime-LIBOR corridors were executed in order to provide protection against narrowing of these spreads. The Company continues to seek cost-effective alternatives towards minimizing this risk.           Interest rate fluctuations affect net interest income at virtually all financial institutions. While interest rate volatility does have an effect on net interest income, other factors also contribute significantly to changes in net interest income. Specifically, within the credit card portfolio, pricing decisions and customer behavior regarding convenience usage affect the yield on the portfolio. These factors may counteract or exacerbate income    31                                                                               31                                                    Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries   changes due to fluctuating interest rates. The Company closely monitors interest rate movements, competitor pricing and consumer behavioral changes in its ongoing analysis of net interest income sensitivity.  LIQUIDITY, FUNDING AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  The Company's goal is to maintain an adequate level of liquidity, both long and short-term, through active management of both assets and liabilities. During 1994, the Company, through its subsidiaries, securitized $2.2 billion of credit card receivables, $456 million of mortgage loans and $102 million of lease receivables. Cash generated from these transactions was temporarily invested in short-term, high quality investments at money market rates awaiting redeployment to pay down borrowings and to fund future credit card, mortgage loan and lease receivable growth. See the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for more information regarding liquidity, funding and capital resources. In addition, see Note 5 to Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplemental Schedules thereto for additional information regarding the Company's investment portfolio.           Over the last seven years, the Company has successfully accessed the securitization market to efficiently support its growth strategy.  While securitization should continue to be a reliable source of funding for the Company, other funding sources are available and include deposits, medium-term notes, subordinated debt, repurchase agreements, committed and uncommitted bank lines, bank notes, federal funds purchased and the ability to sell assets and raise additional equity. Funding diversification is an essential component of the Company's liquidity management. During 1993, the debt securities of Advanta Corp. and Colonial National Bank USA ("Colonial National" or the "Bank"), the principal operating subsidiary, achieved investment-grade ratings from the nationally recognized rating agencies. These ratings have allowed the Company to further diversify its funding sources. Efforts continue to develop new sources of funding, either through previously untapped customer segments or through developing new financing structures.           In November 1993, the Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $1 billion of debt securities. In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company sold $150 million of three-year notes under this registration statement and it sold $360 million of medium-term notes under this registration statement through 1994. The Company may sell up to an additional $490 million of medium-term notes as needed. Further diversification was achieved in 1994 when the Company obtained revolving credit facilities totaling $255 million from a consortium of banks and $255 million in money market bid lines. In addition, steady building of liquidity and capital in 1994 and 1993 was achieved as a result of $39.6 million of dividends from subsidiaries in 1994 and $76.5 million in 1993, and retained earnings of $96.2 million in 1994 and $69.3 million in 1993. The Board of Directors currently intends to have the Company pay regular quarterly dividends to its shareholders, maintaining an approximate 20% premium on the dividend paid on the Class B shares; however, the Company plans to reinvest the majority of its earnings to support future growth.           At December 31, 1994, the Company was carrying $573 million of loans available for sale. The fair value of such loans was in excess of their carrying value at year end. In connection with liquidity and asset/liability management, the Company had $319 million of investments available for sale at December 31, 1994. See Note 19 to Consolidated Financial Statements for fair value disclosures.    32                                                                               32                                                    Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries            In August 1993, Colonial National sold $50 million of subordinated notes which had received an investment-grade rating and qualified as Tier 2 capital for bank regulatory purposes. In December 1994, Colonial National sold $85 million of short-term bank notes which have maturities ranging from seven days to one year from date of issuance. These notes are not subordinated and do not qualify as Tier 2 capital.           As a grandfathered institution under the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 ("CEBA"), the Company must limit the Bank's average on-balance sheet asset growth to 7% per annum. For the fiscal CEBA year ended September 30, 1994, the Bank's average assets did not exceed the allowable amount and, accordingly, the Bank was in full compliance with CEBA growth limits. The timing and size of securitizations, on-balance sheet liability structure and rapid changes in balance sheet structure are frequently due to the management of the Bank's balance sheet within this growth constraint.           Deposits at December 31, 1994 include $33 million of deposits at Advanta Financial Corp. ("AFC"), a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial loan corporation (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, formerly named Colonial National Financial Corp.). AFC's assets and operations are not currently material to the Company, and the Company does not expect them to become material in the near term.           During 1993, the Company raised $90 million in new equity through a 3.0 million share (pre-split) Class B common stock offering.  Proceeds were used to support future growth.           While there are no specific capital requirements for Advanta Corp., the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency requires that Colonial National maintain a risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%. Colonial National's risk-based capital ratio of 12.04% at December 31, 1994 was in excess of the required level and exceeded the minimum capital level of 10% required for the designation as a "well-capitalized" depository institution. The Company intends to take the necessary actions to maintain Colonial National as a "well-capitalized" bank. In addition, the Company's insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain capital, deposit and dividend rules and regulations as prescribed by state jurisdictions in which they are authorized to operate.

This compared to $13.3 million for capital expenditures in 1993 and $5.3 million in 1992.           In 1995, the Company anticipates capital expenditures to exceed those of 1994 as its facilities are expanding and the Company is continuing to upgrade its voice and communication systems. The Company also anticipates that its 1995 marketing expenditures will exceed those of 1994 as the Company continues to originate new accounts, manage account retention and develop new consumer products for its customers.  DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES  The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing its exposure to interest rate risk. The Company has a number of mechanisms in place that enable it to monitor and control both market and credit risk from these derivatives activities. At the broader level, all derivatives strategies are managed under the hedging policy approved by the Board of Directors that details the use of such derivatives and the individuals authorized to execute derivatives transactions. All derivatives strategies must be approved by a senior management team (President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer).           As part of this approval process, a market risk analysis is completed to determine the potential impact on the Company from severe negative (stressed) movements in the market. By policy, derivatives transactions may only be used to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate risk and may not be used for speculative purposes. As such, the impact of any derivatives transaction is calculated using the Company's asset/liability model to determine its suitability.           The Company's Board has approved a counterparty credit policy. This policy details the maximum transaction limit and transaction term for counterparties with a given credit rating (from nationally recognized rating agencies) and the maximum allowable exposure amounts. The exposure amount is calculated in a stress environment and represents the maximum aggregate credit exposure from derivatives transactions the Company is willing to accept from a rated counterparty. Under negotiated agreements with the counterparties, once the aggregate exposure exceeds this level, the Company has the right to call for and receive collateral for the amount of such excess, thereby limiting its exposure to the threshold amount. The threshold levels can be fixed or may change as the credit rating of the counterparty changes.     34                                                                               34                                                    Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries            Under the credit policy, the Company's Investment Committee (a management committee) approves each specific derivatives counterparty, including its respective term and transaction limits, and the actual threshold amounts to be set within the Company's bilateral collateral agreements. Each counterparty's credit quality is reviewed as new market information becomes available, and, in any case, at least semi- annually. Counterparties will be dropped if there is reason to believe that their credit quality is below the Company's set standards.           Counterparty master agreements and any collateral agreements, by policy, must be signed prior to the execution of any derivatives transactions with a counterparty. To date, all master agreements with counterparties have included bilateral collateral agreements. As such, the potential exposure to a particular counterparty is limited to the maximum threshold level for that counterparty.           The Company has established an independent treasury accounting group which measures, monitors, and reports on credit, market, and liquidity risk exposures from hedging and derivative product activities. It is the responsibility of this department to ensure compliance with respect to the hedging policy, including the counterparty transaction limits, transaction terms and trader authorizations. In addition, this department marks each derivatives position to market on a weekly basis using both internal and external models that have been benchmarked against the derivatives dealers' monthly valuations. Position and counterparty exposure reports are generated and used to manage collateral requirements of the counterparty and the Company.           All of these procedures and processes are designed to provide reasonable assurance that prior to and after the execution of any derivatives strategy, market, credit and liquidity risks are fully analyzed and incorporated into the Company's asset/liability and risk measurement models and the proper accounting treatment for the transaction is identified.  CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT  Management regularly reviews the loan portfolio in order to evaluate the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses. The evaluation includes such factors as the inherent credit quality of the loan portfolio, past experience, current economic conditions, projected credit losses and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio. The reserve for credit losses is maintained for on-balance sheet receivables. The on-balance sheet reserve is intended to cover all credit losses inherent in the owned loan portfolio. With regard to securitized assets, anticipated losses and related recourse reserves are reflected in the calculations of Securitization Income, Amounts Due from Credit Card Securitizations and Other Assets. Recourse reserves are intended to cover all probable credit losses over the life of the securitized receivables. Management evaluates both its on-balance sheet and recourse reserve requirements and, as appropriate, effects transfers between these accounts.           The reserve for credit losses on a consolidated basis was $41.6 million, or 2.1% of receivables, at December 31, 1994, compared to $31.2 million, or 2.4% of receivables, in 1993. Due to the increase in the proportion of owned impaired mortgages, which have a lower level of reserve coverage, the reserve coverage of impaired assets (nonperforming assets and accruing loans past due 90 days or more on credit cards) dropped to 96.1% at December 31, 1994, from 138.6% at December 31, 1993. Reserve coverage of impaired credit card assets was 186.5% at December 31, 1994, up slightly from 183.7% at year end 1993.           The reserve for credit losses on a consolidated basis was $31.2 million, or 2.4% of receivables, in 1993 down from $40.2 million, or 4.0% of receivables, in 1992. Due to improved credit quality, this reserve level resulted in higher reserve coverage of impaired assets.    35                                                                               35                                                    Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries   ASSET QUALITY  Impaired assets include both nonperforming assets (mortgage loans and leases past due 90 days or more, real estate owned, credit card receivables due from cardholders in bankruptcy, and off-lease equipment) and accruing loans past due 90 days or more on credit cards. The carrying values for both real estate owned and equipment held for lease or sale are based on net realizable value after taking into account holding costs and costs of disposition and are reflected in other assets.           On the total managed portfolio, impaired assets were $102.4 million, or 1.3% of receivables, at year end 1994 compared to $95.1 million, or 1.8% of receivables, in 1993. Nonperforming assets on the total managed portfolio were $61.6 million, or .8% of receivables, compared to $63.6 million, or 1.2%, in 1993. A key credit quality statistic, the 30-day and over delinquency rate on managed credit cards, dropped to 2.0% from 2.4% a year ago. The total managed charge-off rate for 1994 was 2.3%, compared to 2.9% for 1993. The charge-off rate on managed credit cards was 2.5% for 1994, down from 3.5% for 1993.           On the total owned portfolio, impaired assets were $43.3 million, or 2.2% of receivables in 1994, compared to $22.5 million, or 1.8%, in 1993. This increase was due to the repurchase of the nonperforming mortgages from the securitization trusts (see "Provision for Credit Losses"). Gross interest income that would have been recorded in 1994 and 1993 for owned nonperforming assets, had interest been accrued throughout the year in accordance with the assets' original terms, was approximately $5.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The amount of interest on nonperforming assets included in income for 1994 and 1993 was $1.7 million and $.3 million, respectively.           Past due loans represent accruing loans that are past due 90 days or more as to collection of principal and interest. Credit card receivables, except those on bankrupt, decedent and fraudulent accounts, continue to accrue interest until the time they are charged off at 186 days contractual delinquency. In contrast, all mortgage loans and leases are put on nonaccrual when they become 90 days past due. Owned credit card receivables past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest were $11.2 million or .6% of receivables at December 31, 1994, compared to $11.0 million, or 1.0% of receivables, a year ago.           Through 1990, when the Company received notice that a credit cardholder had filed a bankruptcy petition or was deceased, the Company established a reserve equal to the full balance of the receivable. The receivable, if not paid, would be charged off in accordance with the Company's normal credit card charge-off policy at 186 days contractual delinquency. Likewise, receivables in accounts identified as fraudulent would be reserved against and written off (as an operating expense) when they became 186 days contractually delinquent. These policies are consistent with many leading competitors in the credit card industry.           During 1991, the Company adopted a new policy for the charge-off of bankrupt, decedent and fraudulent credit card accounts. Under the new policy, the Company charges off bankrupt or decedent accounts within 30 days of notification and accounts suspected of being fraudulent after a 90 day investigation period, unless the investigation shows no evidence of fraud. Consequently, in 1991, both newly identified bankrupt, decedent and fraudulent accounts, as well as those previously identified, were written off. The 1991 charge-off rates included in the following tables exclude the effect of this acceleration.           During 1994, the Company implemented a new policy for the charge-off of mortgage loans. Under this policy, when a nonperforming mortgage loan becomes twelve months delinquent, the Company writes down the loan to its net realizable value, regardless of anticipated collectibility. Consequently, in 1994 all mortgage loans that had been twelve or more months delinquent, as well as any mortgages that became twelve months delinquent during the year were written down to their net realizable value. Thus, the managed mortgage loan charge-off rate increased from 1.3% in 1993 to 1.7% in 1994. The managed mortgage charge-off rate in 1995 is anticipated to be closer to the 1.0% level.    36                                                                               36                                                    Advanta Corp. and Subsidiaries    The following tables provide a summary of reserves, impaired assets, delinquencies and charge-offs for the past five years.
