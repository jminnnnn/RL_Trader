ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OVERVIEW  Our primary business segment is Advanta Business Cards, one of the nation's largest issuers of business credit cards to small businesses. In addition to our business credit card lending business, we have venture capital investments. Through the first quarter of 2001, we had two additional lending businesses, Advanta Mortgage and Advanta Leasing Services. In the first quarter of 2001, we exited our mortgage business, announced the discontinuance of our leasing business, and restructured our corporate functions to a size commensurate with our ongoing businesses. We are continuing to service the existing leasing portfolio rather than sell the business or the portfolio. The results of the mortgage and leasing businesses are reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented. The results of our ongoing businesses are reported as continuing operations for all periods presented.       For the year ended December 31, 2001, we reported net loss from continuing operations of $30.5 million or $1.19 per combined common share, assuming dilution, compared to net income of $11.2 million or $0.44 per combined diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2000. For the year ended December 31, 1999, we reported net income from continuing operations of $41.3 million or $1.62 per combined diluted common share. The loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 includes pretax investment losses on venture capital investments of $28.9 million and $41.8 million of pretax unusual charges representing costs associated with the restructure of our corporate functions to a size commensurate with our ongoing businesses and certain other unusual charges related to employee costs.       In 2000, income from continuing operations includes pretax investment gains, net, on venture capital investments of $7.7 million, a pretax increase in the provision for credit losses on business credit cards of $18.4 million, and a $7.0 million pretax charge for an increase in litigation reserves.       In 1999, income from continuing operations includes a tax benefit of $50.0 million related to the former consumer credit card business. Income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 1999 also includes pretax unusual charges of $6.7 million for severance and outplacement costs associated with cost cutting initiatives implemented in the first quarter of 1999 and $10.0 million of additional costs associated with products exited in the first quarter of 1998. In addition, in 1999 we recognized pretax investment gains on venture capital investments of $29.2 million, and non-operating charges of $16.9 million related to our exit from the auto finance business.       Net income (loss) from continuing operations included the following business segment results:                                                                     YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                                               -----------------------------                                                                 2001      2000       1999 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        ADVANTA BUSINESS CARDS Pretax income                                                 $ 63,515   $45,325   $ 11,997 Income tax (expense)                                           (24,452)        0     (4,727) - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net income                                                    $ 39,063   $45,325   $  7,270 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- VENTURE CAPITAL Pretax income (loss)                                          $(33,158)  $ 3,382   $ 26,329 Income tax (expense) benefit                                    12,765         0    (10,068) - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net income (loss)                                             $(20,393)  $ 3,382   $ 16,261 ===========================================================================================        Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $8.4 million for the period from January 1, 2001 through February 28, 2001, the effective date of the Mortgage Transaction. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $163.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. In addition to the operating results of the discontinued operations, we recorded a loss on the discontinuance of our leasing business of $4.3 million, net of tax, effective December 31, 2000. We also recorded an after tax loss on the discontinuance of our mortgage and leasing businesses of $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The components of the net loss recorded in 2001 include a pretax gain on the Mortgage Transaction of                                          21   $20.8 million, a pretax loss on the discontinuance of our leasing business of $45.0 million, and tax expense of $7.4 million. The loss on the discontinuance of our leasing business in the year ended December 31, 2001 represents a revision to the estimated valuation of leasing assets and a decrease in the estimated pretax operating results over the remaining life of the lease portfolio, due primarily to the impact of a former leasing vendor's bankruptcy.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We have identified accounting for securitizations, the allowance for credit losses, valuation of venture capital investments, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and litigation contingencies as our most critical accounting policies and estimates in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These accounting policies, including the nature of the estimates and types of assumptions used, are described throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis.  ADVANTA BUSINESS CARDS  OVERVIEW  Advanta Business Cards offers business credit cards to small businesses using targeted direct mail, the Internet and telemarketing solicitation of potential cardholders. This product provides approved customers with access, through merchants, banks, checks and ATMs, to an instant unsecured revolving business credit line. Advanta Business Cards generates interest and other income through finance charges assessed on outstanding balances, interchange income, and cash advance and other credit card fees.       The managed business credit card receivable portfolio grew from $1.0 billion at December 31, 1999 to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2000 and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2001. Advanta Business Cards originated 224,255 new accounts during the year ended December 31, 2001, 311,275 new accounts in 2000 and 146,436 new accounts in 1999. The growth in receivables and level of originations in 2001 reflected our plan to grow our portfolio in a controlled manner that we believed was prudent given the prevailing economic environment.       Pretax income for Advanta Business Cards was $63.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $45.3 million for year ended December 31, 2000 and $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The components of pretax income for Advanta Business Cards for the years ended December 31 were as follows:                                                                    2001       2000      1999 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        Net interest income on owned receivables                      $ 43,337   $ 47,039   $23,185 Noninterest revenues                                           225,364    155,500    84,252 Provision for credit losses                                     35,373     36,307    17,926 Operating expenses                                             169,813    120,907    77,514 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pretax income                                                 $ 63,515   $ 45,325   $11,997 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        The increase in noninterest revenues in both years is due primarily to growth in securitized receivables and increased interchange income. The increases in operating expenses in both years resulted from growth in managed receivables. The provision for credit losses and noninterest revenues in the year ended December 31, 2001 include the impact of an increase in managed credit losses due to the seasoning of the business credit card portfolio and the current economic environment. The provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2000 includes an $8 million increase attributable to a revision of our estimate of the allowance for credit losses as a result of the following factors: (1) discussions with our banking regulators relating to the                                          22   implementation of the agreement between Advanta Bank Corp. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that was disclosed in June 2000; (2) changes in the economic environment; and (3) the use of more conservative loss estimates for certain segments of the loan portfolio. See further discussion in the "Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.

SECURITIZATION INCOME  A significant portion of our funding is through off-balance sheet business credit card securitizations via a securitization trust. The securitization trust was created to hold the collateral (the securitized receivables) and issue debt to investors. The securitization trust is a qualifying special-purpose entity as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities -- a Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125," and therefore, is not consolidated as part of Advanta Corp.'s consolidated financial statements. We do not provide any guarantee of the debt issued by the special-purpose entity and our recourse in the transactions is limited to the value of our interests in securitizations that act as credit enhancement to the investors' interests.       We sell business credit card receivables through securitizations with servicing retained. When we securitize, we surrender control over the transferred assets and account for the transaction as a sale to the extent that consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange. We allocate the previous carrying amount of the securitized receivables between the assets sold and the retained interests, based on their relative estimated fair values at the date of sale. Securitization income is recognized at the time of the sale, equal to the excess of the fair value of the assets obtained (principally cash) over the allocated cost of the assets sold and transaction costs. During the revolving period of each business credit card securitization, securitization income is recorded representing estimated gains on the sale of new receivables to the securitization trust on a continuous basis to replenish the investors' interest in securitized receivables that have been repaid by the business credit card account holders. Fair value estimates used in the recognition of securitization income require certain assumptions of payment, default and interest rates. To the extent actual results are different than those estimates, the impact is recognized in securitization income.       Retained interests in securitizations include restricted cash reserve accounts, retained interest-only strips and subordinated trust assets related to securitizations. Subordinated trust assets represent an ownership interest in the securitized receivables that is subordinated to the other investors' interests. Retained interests in securitizations serve as credit enhancement for the securitization transactions. We account for retained interests in securitizations as trading securities. These assets are recorded at estimated fair value and the resulting unrealized gain or loss from the valuation is included in securitization income.       We estimate the fair value of retained interests in securitizations based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The cash flows of the retained interest-only strip are estimated as the excess of the weighted average                                          23   finance charge yield on each pool of the receivables sold over the sum of the interest rate paid to the note holder, the servicing fee and an estimate of future credit losses over the life of the receivables. Cash flows are discounted from the date the cash is expected to become available to us (the "cash-out" method). These cash flows are projected over the life of the receivables using payment, default, and interest rate assumptions that management believes would be used by market participants for similar financial instruments subject to prepayment, credit and interest rate risk. The cash flows are discounted using an interest rate that management believes a purchaser unrelated to the seller of the financial instrument would demand. As all estimates used are influenced by factors outside our control, there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates, making it reasonably possible that they could change in the near term. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for the key assumptions used in the estimation of fair values of the retained interests in securitizations at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Interest income is recognized over the life of the retained interests in securitizations using the discount rate used in the valuation.       Advanta Business Cards recognized securitization income of $113.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, $70.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, and $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in securitization income in 2001 and 2000 was due to increased volume of securitized receivables and increased yields on securitized receivables, partially offset by increased credit losses on securitized receivables.       In September 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 140 which revised the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and required certain disclosures, but carried over most of SFAS No. 125's provisions without amendment. SFAS No. 140 was effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after March 31, 2001. The statement was effective for recognition and reclassification of collateral and for disclosures relating to securitization transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2000. The adoption of SFAS No. 140 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.       We adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 99-20, "Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interest in Securitized Financial Assets" on April 1, 2001. The implementation of EITF 99-20 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.  SERVICING REVENUES  Advanta Business Cards recognized servicing revenue of $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, and $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in servicing revenue in 2001 and 2000 was due to increased volume of securitized receivables.  INTERCHANGE INCOME  Business credit card interchange income on the managed portfolio was $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, $61.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, and $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in interchange income in both years was primarily due to higher purchase volume related to the increase in average managed business credit card accounts and receivables. The average interchange rate was 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2.1% for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999.  VENTURE CAPITAL  Our venture capital segment makes venture capital investments through our affiliates. Our investment objective is to earn attractive returns by building the long-term values of the businesses in which we invest. Our investment affiliates combine transaction expertise, management skills and a broad contact base with strong industry-specific knowledge. We actively monitor the performance of our venture capital investments and employees and officers of our investment affiliates participate on the boards of directors of some investees. Investments of our venture capital unit are included in investments available for sale and are carried at estimated fair value following the specialized industry accounting principles of this unit. Management makes fair value determinations based on quoted market prices, when available, and considers the investees' financial                                          24   results, conditions and prospects when market prices are not available. In accordance with the specialized industry accounting principles of venture capital investment companies, the unrealized and realized gains and losses on these investments are included in other revenues rather than other comprehensive income and the equity method of accounting for investments is not applied.       The fair value of our venture capital investments was $18.6 million at December 31, 2001 and $45.3 million at December 31, 2000. The fair values of these equity investments are subject to significant volatility. Our investments in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time, and changes in concentrations may affect price volatility. We primarily invest in privately-held companies, including early stage companies. These investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products the investees have under development may never materialize.       Consistent with market conditions for venture capital investments, pretax loss for the venture capital segment was $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, and included $28.9 million of realized losses and decreases in valuations of venture capital investments. Pretax income for the venture capital segment was $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, and included $11.4 million in gains on the sale of venture capital investments and $3.7 million of net decreases in valuations of venture capital investments. Pretax income for the venture capital segment was $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, and included $29.2 million of gains on the sale of venture capital investments.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  We recorded a loss on the discontinuance of our leasing business of $4.3 million, net of tax, effective December 31, 2000. We also recorded an after tax loss on the discontinuance of our mortgage and leasing businesses of $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The components of the net loss recorded in 2001 include a pretax gain on the Mortgage Transaction of $20.8 million, a pretax loss on the discontinuance of our leasing business of $45.0 million, and tax expense of $7.4 million.       Effective February 28, 2001, we completed the Mortgage Transaction and exit of our mortgage business, Advanta Mortgage, through a purchase and sale agreement with Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation as buyer. Prior to the Mortgage Transaction, Advanta Mortgage made nonconforming home equity loans directly to consumers and through brokers. This business unit originated and serviced first and second lien mortgage loans, including home equity lines of credit, through subsidiaries of Advanta. In addition to servicing and managing the loans it originated, Advanta Mortgage contracted with third parties to service their nonconforming home equity loans on a subservicing basis. Following the Mortgage Transaction, we no longer operate a mortgage business. The purchase and sale agreement provided for the sale, transfer and assignment of substantially all of the assets and operating liabilities associated with our mortgage business, as well as specified contingent liabilities arising from our operation of the mortgage business prior to closing that were identified in the purchase and sale agreement. We retained contingent liabilities, primarily relating to litigation, arising from our operation of the mortgage business before closing that were not specifically assumed by the buyer. The proceeds from the sale exceeded $1 billion, subject to closing adjustments, resulting in an estimated gross gain of approximately $60 million before transaction expenses, severance expenses and other costs. The gain on the Mortgage Transaction does not reflect any impact from the post-closing adjustment process. Although the Mortgage Transaction resulted in a gain for financial reporting purposes, due to book/tax differences, we will not pay any material federal income tax as a result of the sale. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of litigation related to the Mortgage Transaction.       On January 23, 2001, we announced that after a thorough review of strategic alternatives available for our leasing business, Advanta Leasing Services, we decided to cease originating leases. Advanta Leasing Services offered flexible lease financing programs on small-ticket equipment to small businesses. The primary products financed included office machinery, security systems and computers. We will continue to service the existing portfolio rather than sell the business or the portfolio. In connection with the discontinuance of the leasing business, we recorded a $4.3 million pretax loss effective December 31, 2000, representing the estimated operating results through the remaining term of the leasing portfolio. Estimated operating results of the leasing                                          25   business included estimated valuations of retained interests in leasing securitizations, estimated cash flows from on-balance sheet lease receivables, interest expense and operating expenses. As all estimates used are influenced by factors outside our control, there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates, making it reasonably possible that they could change in the near term. In the year ended December 31, 2001, we incurred an additional $45.0 million pretax loss on the discontinuance of the leasing business due to changes in the estimate of those operating results. These changes in estimate were needed due to an increase in estimated credit losses expected throughout the remaining term of the leasing portfolio based on credit loss experience in 2001. The primary factor contributing to the increased credit losses is that one of our former leasing vendors filed for bankruptcy protection and this vendor's financial problems have impacted its ability to service a segment of our leasing portfolio. This vendor is unique from our other leasing vendors in that it had a significant servicing relationship with our customers and the equipment under lease provided fee revenue to our customers for usage. Also, our contract with the vendor provided that the vendor would provide a guaranty if the performance of the leases did not meet certain criteria. This guaranty was considered when underwriting the leases.       Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $8.4 million for the period from January 1, 2001 through February 28, 2001, the effective date of the Mortgage Transaction. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $163.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 includes charges which were made in response to our regulatory review process, including the implementation of the agreements with the bank regulators that were signed during the second and third quarters of 2000, and changes during the second quarter in the market and the political and regulatory environment for subprime lending. These charges included a pretax reduction in the valuation of Advanta National Bank's retained interests in mortgage securitizations of $214.0 million and an increase in Advanta National Bank's on-balance sheet allowance for credit losses related to mortgage loans of $22.0 million. These Advanta National Bank charges reduced net income by $236.0 million or $9.31 per combined common diluted share.       In addition, loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 includes $20.3 million of pretax charges resulting from changes in valuation assumptions related to retained interests in leasing securitizations, primarily due to higher credit losses associated with certain unprofitable segments of broker originations from prior periods. These charges reduced net income by $20.3 million or $0.80 per combined common diluted share. Loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 also includes $25.3 million of revenues related to termination fees received under a mortgage servicing agreement. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.       Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 1999 includes $28.8 million of pretax valuation adjustments to the retained interests in mortgage securitizations and contractual mortgage servicing rights, which decreased net income by $17.4 million or $0.73 per combined diluted share. Of the total valuation adjustment, $10 million was recorded in the second quarter of 1999, which resulted from an increase in credit losses expected in the off-balance sheet mortgage loan portfolio based on portfolio trends and experience. The majority of the remaining charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1999 and resulted from an increase in the discount rate on the retained interest-only strip and an increase in the credit loss assumption. The discount rate was increased due to an increase in market interest rates and an observed trend toward higher discount rates in available public disclosures relating to comparable instruments. The increase in the loss assumption was due to an additional increase in credit losses expected in the off-balance sheet mortgage loan portfolio based on trends and experience. The decrease in the valuation caused by the increased discount rate and credit loss assumption was slightly offset by a decrease in prepayment speeds experienced.       Additionally, in the first quarter of 1999, we recorded pretax valuation adjustments to the retained interests in auto loan securitizations of $12 million, which decreased net income by $7.4 million, or $0.31 per combined diluted share. In the first quarter of 1999, management implemented a plan to exit the auto finance business and engaged an investment banker to solicit bids for the business as a whole, including our retained interests in auto securitizations and certain auto loan receivables. Although management did not ultimately accept any offers to acquire the retained interests, the informal bids received were considered as part of our                                          26   fair value analysis of the retained interests, which resulted in a decrease in the valuation of the assets as of March 31, 1999.  INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE  Interest income decreased by $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. During the same period, interest expense decreased by $4.0 million. The decrease in interest income was due primarily to a decrease in on-balance sheet business credit card receivables and investments. Also contributing to the decreased interest income was a decrease in the average yield earned on our investment portfolio caused by the interest rate environment and a shift in the composition of the portfolio. Short-term investments, including federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits, represented 71% of the average investment portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to 27% for the year ended December 31, 2000. Excess liquid assets were held in short-term, high-quality investments earning money market rates until they could be deployed. See further discussion in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. The decrease in interest expense was due to a decrease in interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by an increase in our average cost of funds.       Interest income increased by $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1999. During the same period, interest expense increased by $5.7 million. The increase in interest income was due to an increase in yields on business credit card receivables as well as an increase in average on-balance sheet business credit card receivables. The increase in interest expense was due to an increase in our average cost of funds.       Our average cost of funds increased to 7.24% in 2001 from 6.89% in 2000. Our average cost of funds was 5.87% in 1999. The increase in the average cost of funds in 2001 as compared to 2000 was attributable to the increase in debt as a percentage of total interest-bearing liabilities and an increase in the average interest rate on debt funding. Debt represented 35% of total average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to 27% for the same period of 2000. The average interest rate on debt funding was 9.47% for the period ended December 31, 2001 as compared to 8.17% for the same period of 2000. The average interest rate on debt funding increased in 2001 due to a change in the composition of our debt. We paid off substantially all of our medium-term notes in 2001 and did not renew or originate senior notes for a portion of 2001 due to our liquidity position. We expect our average interest rate on debt funding to decrease in the future as we replace the maturities of our higher rate notes with notes bearing lower interest rates more in line with the current market rates. The increase in the average cost of funds in 2000 as compared to 1999 was primarily attributable to rising market interest rates.       During 2001, 2000 and 1999, we used interest rate swaps to manage the impact of fluctuating interest rates on our cost of funds. The interest rate swaps effectively converted fixed rate medium-term notes to a LIBOR-based variable rate. Interest rate swap agreements generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated. There were no interest rate swaps outstanding related to continuing operations at December 31, 2001 because of the substantial reduction in outstanding medium-term notes during the year.                                          27        The following table provides an analysis of owned interest income and expense data, average balance sheet data, net interest spread, and net interest margin for both continuing and discontinued operations. Net interest spread represents the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin represents the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid to fund interest-earning assets. Interest income includes late fees on business credit card receivables. Average owned receivables include deferred origination costs, net of deferred fees.

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  The allowance for credit losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. The allowance for credit losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectibility of receivables in light of historical experience by loan type, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay and prevailing economic conditions. Since our loan portfolio is comprised of large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, we evaluate each group collectively for impairment. The allowance is determined primarily based on a migration analysis of delinquent and current accounts and certain qualitative factors consistent with applicable bank regulatory guidelines. As part of our evaluation, we compare actual credit loss performance to previously estimated credit losses, and make modifications to estimates as needed. This allowance for credit loss evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.       The allowance for credit losses is maintained for on-balance sheet receivables and is intended to cover all credit losses inherent in the owned loan portfolio. Anticipated losses on securitized assets are reflected in the calculations of securitization income and the fair value of retained interests in securitizations. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Such loss estimates are intended to cover all probable credit losses over the life of the securitized receivables. Management continually evaluates both its on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet estimates and, as appropriate, effects changes to these amounts.                                          29        Nonperforming assets include receivables past due 90 days or more, and bankrupt, decedent and fraudulent business credit card accounts. We charge losses on business credit card accounts against the allowance at 180 days contractually delinquent. Business credit card accounts suspected of being fraudulent are charged-off after a 90-day investigative period, unless our investigation shows no evidence of fraud. Effective October 1, 2000, bankrupt business credit cards are charged off within a 60-day investigative period after receipt of notification. The previous policy provided a 90-day investigative period. Net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses less current period recoveries. The accrued interest and fee portion of the charged-off receivable balance is deducted from current period income.       Receivables are put on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due. Gross interest income that would have been recorded for owned nonperforming assets, had interest been accrued throughout the year in accordance with the assets' original terms, was $2.7 million in 2001.       The provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $36.0 million as compared to $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The provision for credit losses in 2000 includes a revision in our estimate of the allowance for credit losses on business credit card receivables. The revised estimate for the overall portfolio was recorded in September 2000 and was developed based on discussions with our banking regulators, changes in the economic environment and the use of more conservative loss estimates for certain segments of the loan portfolio. Those segments included accounts with lower credit scores, accounts held by businesses in operation less than twelve months, and accounts in which cash borrowings comprise a significant portion of the outstanding balance. As a result of these changes in estimate in 2000, we increased our allowance for credit losses by approximately $8 million, which increased the provision for credit losses and decreased net income by approximately $8 million or $0.32 per diluted combined share for the year ended December 31, 2000. The provision for credit losses in 2001 reflects the seasoning of the business credit card portfolio and the current economic environment. These factors were evident in the delinquency rates and charge-off rates. Total owned business credit card receivables 30 days or more delinquent increased from 5.5% at December 31, 2000 to 6.7% at December 31, 2001. The charge-off rate on owned business credit card receivables for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 7.2% as compared to 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2000. We expect the trend of increasing charge-off rates to continue in 2002 due to the continued seasoning of the portfolio and the current economic environment. Although charge-off levels are not always predictable since they are impacted by the economic environment and other factors, we currently expect the twelve month average charge-off rate for 2002 to be between 8.5% and 9.5% on managed business credit card receivables. We expect charge-off rates to be higher in the first half of 2002 than in the second half based on the current composition of the portfolio.       For the year ended December 31, 2000, the provision for credit losses increased by $13.8 million as compared to 1999. The increase in the provision was primarily due to a change in estimate of the allowance for credit losses for business credit cards as discussed above and the maturing and growth of the business credit card portfolio in 2000. Average on-balance sheet business credit card receivables increased 88% in 2000 as compared with 1999.       At December 31, 2001, the allowance for credit losses on a consolidated basis was $42.0 million, or 9.4% of owned receivables, compared to $33.4 million, or 9.3%, at December 31, 2000. The allowance for credit losses on business credit card receivables was $41.2 million, or 9.9% of owned receivables, at December 31, 2001, as compared to $33.2 million, or 9.9%, at December 31, 2000.       The allowance for credit losses on other receivables was $802 thousand at December 31, 2001 and $202 thousand at December 31, 2000. The increase in the allowance for credit losses on other receivables in the year ended December 31, 2001 was due to growth in other receivables from $24.2 million at December 31, 2000 to $28.2 million at December 31, 2001. There were no significant changes or trends in credit quality statistics of other receivables in 1999 through 2001.                                          30   CREDIT QUALITY  The following table provides a summary of allowances for credit losses, nonperforming assets, delinquencies and charge-offs for the past five years.

Managed and owned business credit card charge-offs for     the year ended December 31, 2000 include a 0.2% acceleration of charge-offs     in connection with the adoption of this policy.                                          31   OTHER REVENUES                                                                     YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                       ($ IN THOUSANDS)                        ------------------------------                                                                 2001       2000       1999 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        Investment securities gains (losses), net                     $(26,227)   $ 5,473    $30,132 Business credit card rewards                                    (8,979)    (3,162)      (834) Loss on sale of deposits                                        (2,835)         0          0 Insurance revenues, net and other                                3,581      4,995      7,279 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total other revenues, net                                     $(34,460)   $ 7,306    $36,577 ============================================================================================        Investment securities gains (losses) include changes in the fair value and realized gains (losses) on venture capital investments. Investment securities losses for the year ended December 31, 2001 include $9.3 million in realized losses on venture capital investments, $19.6 million in decreases in valuations of venture capital investments, and $2.7 million of realized gains on other investments. Investment securities gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2000 include $11.4 million in gains on the sale of venture capital investments, $3.7 million of net decrease in valuations of venture capital investments, and $2.2 million of realized losses on other investments. Investment securities gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 1999 include $29.2 million of gains on the sale of venture capital investments.       Business credit card rewards, which include bonus miles and cash-back rewards, are earned by eligible cardholders based on net purchases charged to their accounts. The cost of future reward redemptions are estimated and recorded at the time bonus mile points or cash-back rewards are earned by the cardholder. We estimate that 80% to 100% of cardholders will ultimately claim rewards. The estimate varies depending on the structure of the rewards program. These costs of future reward redemptions are recorded as a reduction of other revenues. Increases in business credit card rewards in the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were due to the increase in average managed business credit card accounts in the rewards programs and the corresponding purchase activity in those accounts.       In the second quarter of 2001, we sold $389.7 million of deposit liabilities to E*TRADE Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of E*TRADE Group, Inc., resulting in a $2.8 million loss.       In the first quarter of 2001, we successfully negotiated an early termination of our strategic alliance with Progressive Casualty Insurance Company to direct market auto insurance. Insurance revenues, net and other for the year ended December 31, 2001 includes operating results of insurance operations, the impact of the termination of the strategic alliance with Progressive Casualty Insurance Company and $10 million of charges related to the write-off of insurance-related deferred acquisition costs that were unrealizable subsequent to the termination of the auto insurance strategic alliance. Insurance revenues, net and other for the year ended December 31, 2000 includes a charge of approximately $3 million in the insurance business relating to the settlement of a large policy claim.

Average managed business credit card receivables increased 36% in 2001 from $1.4 billion at December 31, 2000 to $1.9 billion at December 31, 2001. We expect our total operating expenses to continue to increase in 2002 as we make additional investments in initiatives to strengthen our position as a leading issuer of business credit cards to the small business market. These include initiatives to provide additional value to our existing customers, customer retention campaigns, development of ancillary non-financial products and services, development of affinity cards and partnership relationships, and enhancement of internet capabilities for servicing our customers.       Professional fees decreased by $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in professional fees was due to consulting costs incurred in 2000 associated with the implementation of our bank regulatory agreements, partially offset by increased legal costs in 2001. The decrease in marketing expenses in the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to 2000 reflects our decreased origination activities related to senior notes as a result of our liquidity position subsequent to the Mortgage Transaction in the first quarter of 2001. See further discussion in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. Other expenses decreased $5.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. Other expenses in the year ended December 31, 2000 included an increase in litigation reserves of $7.0 million.       Salaries and employee benefits, amortization of business credit card deferred origination costs, net, external processing, marketing, equipment, and fraud loss expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1999 due primarily to increased marketing and account origination activities in Advanta Business Cards as well as the resulting growth in managed business credit card receivables. Business credit card new account originations increased by 113% for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to 1999, and average managed business credit card receivables grew by 54% in the same period. The increase in equipment expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to 1999 also includes an increase in depreciation expense associated with information technology upgrades placed in service during 1999. Professional fees increased by $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase was due to increased legal activity and consulting costs, including consulting costs associated with the implementation of our bank regulatory agreements.  LITIGATION CONTINGENCIES  Advanta Corp. and its subsidiaries are involved in class action lawsuits, other litigation, claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business or discontinued operations, including litigation arising from our operation of the mortgage business prior to the Mortgage Transaction in the first quarter of 2001. See discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. Management believes that the aggregate liabilities, if any, resulting from these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of our operations based on the level of litigation reserves we have established and our expectations regarding the ultimate resolutions of these actions. However, due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and since the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings are influenced by factors outside of our control, it is reasonably possible that our estimated liability under these proceedings may change or that actual results will differ from our estimates. Our litigation reserves at December 31, 2001 are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.  UNUSUAL CHARGES  Subsequent to the Mortgage Transaction and discontinuance of our leasing business in the first quarter of 2001, we implemented a plan to restructure our corporate functions to a size commensurate with our ongoing businesses and incurred certain other unusual charges related to employee costs. Also, in 1999, we implemented a plan to exit the auto finance business and to implement cost reduction initiatives throughout                                          33   the organization including the consolidation of support functions. Costs associated with these restructuring activities and other employee costs are included in unusual charges in the consolidated income statements.       The restructuring activities had no significant impact on operations while they were ongoing. Due to the termination of employees and the write-off of certain assets no longer used, we expect to realize lower personnel expenses in support functions in the 12 months following the charges, and expect to realize lower depreciation and amortization expense over the following 5-7 years. These decreases were due to the termination of employees and the write-off or write-down of assets previously deployed in connection with exited businesses. We also expected and realized the elimination of the costs of the contractual commitments associated with exited business products from future operating results over the estimated timeframe of the contracts.    Employee Costs  In the first quarter of 2001, we recorded a $4.1 million charge for severance and outplacement costs associated with the restructuring of corporate functions. There were 69 employees severed who were entitled to benefits. These employees worked in corporate support functions including accounting and finance, human resources, information technology, legal and facilities management. Employees were notified in March 2001, and we expect to pay severance amounts over a 12-month period.       Additionally, during 2001, we incurred $23.2 million of other employee costs. This amount includes approximately $10 million attributable to bonuses to certain key employees in recognition of their efforts on behalf of Advanta in the strategic alternatives process. It also includes approximately $4.5 million of bonuses in recognition of the restructuring of the company and other significant transitional efforts. These bonuses will be paid over a 12-month period. In the second quarter of 2001, we recorded a $1.0 million increase in employee costs related to a revision in estimate associated with these bonuses. In 2001, we accelerated vesting of 32% of outstanding options that were not vested at the date of the closing of the Mortgage Transaction. This acceleration resulted in a noncash charge of $1.3 million. In connection with reviewing our compensation plans after the Mortgage Transaction and restructuring of corporate functions, we implemented a program whereby all outstanding stock appreciation rights and shares of phantom stock were terminated in exchange for cash to be paid through a deferred compensation arrangement. We recorded charges of $2.9 million associated with this exchange. The charge reflects a $0.7 million reduction recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2001, as actual cash settlement costs were less than estimated. Due to the restructuring of the company, we implemented programs whereby certain out-of-the-money options were exchanged for shares of stock, and whereby certain shares of restricted stock were exchanged for cash and stock options in a tender offer, subject to certain performance conditions and vesting requirements. Noncash charges associated with the issuance of the stock, stock options and the tender offer totaled $3.6 million. This charge reflects a $1.4 million increase recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2001, as actual noncash charges associated with the tender offer were more than estimated.       In the first quarter of 1999, in connection with cost reduction initiatives and the consolidation of support functions, we recorded a $3.3 million charge for costs associated with staff reductions. These expenses included severance and outplacement costs. There were 121 employees severed who were entitled to benefits. This staff reduction was substantially complete by June 30, 1999. The final payment outstanding related to these employee costs was paid in the three months ended March 31, 2000.    Expenses Associated with Exited Businesses/Products  In the first quarter of 2001, we recorded charges of $2.2 million related to other products exited for which no future revenues or benefits would be received. In the third quarter of 2001, we were able to settle some of these commitments for less than originally estimated, and reduced the charge by $0.7 million. We expect to pay the remaining costs, which include lease and other commitments, in 2002.       In the first quarter of 1999, we implemented a plan to cease the origination of auto loans and recorded a $3.4 million charge for costs associated with exited businesses/products. The charges included severance and outplacement costs for 22 employees in the auto origination group, and professional fees associated with exited businesses/products not directly associated with our mortgage, business credit card and leasing units. We                                          34   completed the closing of the auto loan origination center and termination of related employees during the second quarter of 1999. We completed payment of the remaining professional fees during the first quarter of 2001.       In 1998, in connection with the transfer of our consumer credit card business to Fleet Credit Card LLC, we made major organizational changes to reduce corporate expenses incurred in the past: (a) to support the business contributed to Fleet Credit Card LLC in the transfer of our consumer credit card business, and (b) associated with the business and products no longer being offered or not directly associated with our mortgage, business credit card and leasing units. As of December 31, 1998, the remaining accrual related to expenses associated with exited businesses/products was $14.8 million. We had contractual commitments to certain customers, and non-related financial institutions that were providing benefits to those customers, under a product that was no longer offered and for which no future revenues or benefits would be received. In 1998, we recorded a charge of $22.8 million associated with these commitments, and an $8.3 million charge associated with the write-off of assets associated with this program that became unrealizable when the product was exited. In 1999, an additional charge of $10.0 million was recorded based on a change in the estimate of total expected costs for the contractual commitments related to the exited product. Updated information regarding future benefits to be provided in connection with these contractual commitments indicated a higher level of benefits than originally estimated. A third party assumed the liabilities associated with these commitments in the first quarter of 2001, and we recorded an additional charge relating to the settlement of these commitments of $10.3 million.    Asset Impairments  In connection with our plan to restructure our corporate functions to a size commensurate with our ongoing businesses during the first quarter of 2001, we identified certain assets that would no longer be used, and the carrying costs of these assets were written off resulting in a charge of $2.6 million. We estimated the realizable value of these assets to be zero due to the nature of the assets, which include leasehold improvements and capitalized software.  INCOME TAXES  As a result of unusual charges, valuation adjustments on venture capital investments and the loss on the discontinuance of the leasing business in 2001, we reported a pretax loss for the year ended December 31, 2001. A valuation allowance has been provided against a portion of the resulting deferred tax asset given our pre-existing net operating loss carryforwards and the uncertainty of the realizability of the incremental deferred tax asset. In the year ended December 31, 2000, we also reported a pretax loss and a valuation allowance was provided against the resulting deferred tax asset, resulting in a 0% effective tax rate. In establishing the valuation allowance, management considered (1) estimates of expected future taxable income, (2) existing and projected book/tax differences, (3) tax planning strategies available, and (4) the general and industry specific economic outlook. Based on this analysis, management believes the net deferred tax asset of $107 million at December 31, 2001 will be realized. This analysis is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.       In 1999, in connection with the filing of the 1998 tax returns, additional book/tax differences related to the disposition of our consumer credit card business in 1998 were quantified. These book/tax differences, when combined with certain less significant recurring differences, resulted in net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $521 million at December 31, 1999. This amount is net of $96 million carried back to prior years, and includes $500 million that pertains to losses incurred on the consumer credit card portfolio after the date of the disposition of our consumer credit card business. A deferred tax asset of $50 million, net of valuation allowance, resulting from the net operating loss carryforwards was recorded as an income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 1999.       At December 31, 2001, remaining net operating loss carryforwards were $662 million, of which $407 million expire in 2018, $29 million expire in 2019, $15 million expire in 2020 and $211 million expire in 2021. We utilized net operating loss carryforwards of $85 million in 2000. Additionally in 2000, $29 million was carried back to prior years.                                          35   ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT  We manage our financial condition with a focus on maintaining high credit quality standards, disciplined management of market risks and prudent levels of growth, leverage and liquidity.  MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY  Market risk is the potential for loss or diminished financial performance arising from adverse changes in market forces including interest rates and market prices. Market risk sensitivity is the degree to which a financial instrument, or a company that owns financial instruments, is exposed to market forces. Fluctuations in interest rates, changes in economic conditions, shifts in customer behavior, and other factors can affect our financial performance. Changes in economic conditions and shifts in customer behavior are difficult to predict, and our financial performance generally cannot be insulated from these forces.       We are exposed to equity price risk on the equity securities in our investments available for sale portfolio. The majority of our equity securities at December 31, 2001 represented venture capital investments. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the market exposure on these investments. A 20% adverse change in equity prices would result in an approximate $5 million decrease in the fair value of our equity investments as of December 31, 2001. A 20% adverse change would have resulted in an approximate $15 million decrease in fair value as of December 31, 2000.       Financial performance variability as a result of fluctuations in interest rates is commonly called interest rate risk. Interest rate risk generally results from mismatches in the timing of asset and liability repricing (gap risk) and from differences between the repricing indices of assets and liabilities (basis risk). We regularly evaluate our market risk profile and attempt to minimize the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and net income. In managing interest rate risk exposure, we periodically securitize receivables, sell and purchase assets, alter the mix and term structure of our funding base, change our investment portfolio and use derivative financial instruments. Derivatives are not used for trading or speculative activities. We adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities -- an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133," on January 1, 2001. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 and No. 138 had no impact on income from continuing operations and was not material to income from discontinued operations.       Risk exposure levels vary continuously, as changes occur in our asset/liability mix, market interest rates and other factors affecting the timing and magnitude of cash flows. We attempt to analyze the impact of interest rate risk by regularly evaluating the perceived risks inherent in our asset and liability structure, including derivative instruments. Computer simulations are used to generate expected financial performance in a variety of interest rate environments. Those results are analyzed to determine if actions need to be taken to mitigate our interest rate risk.       We measure our interest rate risk using a rising rate scenario and a declining rate scenario. Net interest income is estimated using a third party software model that uses standard income modeling techniques. We also measure the effect of interest rate risk on our managed net interest income, which includes net interest income on owned assets and net interest income on securitized receivables. Both increasing and decreasing rate scenarios assume an instantaneous shift in rates and measure the corresponding change in expected net interest income as compared to a base case scenario. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, we estimated that our net interest income and managed net interest income would change as follows over a twelve-month period:                                                                  2001    2000 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------      Estimated percentage increase (decrease) in owned net   interest income:   Assuming 200 basis point increase in interest rates           5%     13%   Assuming 200 basis point decrease in interest rates          (3)%    (2)% Estimated percentage increase (decrease) in managed net   interest income:   Assuming 200 basis point increase in interest rates          (7)%     4%   Assuming 200 basis point decrease in interest rates           7%     13% - --------------------------------------------------------------------------        Our business credit card receivables include interest rate floors that cause our managed net interest income to rise in the declining rate scenario. As of December 31, 2001, the interest rate floors also cause a                                         36   decrease in managed net interest income in a rising rate scenario. This is because rates at December 31, 2001 are well below certain of the interest rate floors, and a 200 basis point increase in rates would not impact the contractual rate on a substantial portion of the receivables. Changes in the size and the composition of our balance sheet from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2000, including a significant reduction in debt and deposits, also have impacted the results of sensitivity analysis in the owned net interest income scenarios.       The above estimates of net interest income sensitivity alone do not provide a comprehensive view of our exposure to interest rate risk. The quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters and assumptions utilized in generating the results. These analyses are useful only when viewed within the context of the parameters and assumptions used. The above rate scenarios in no way reflect management's expectation regarding the future direction of interest rates, and they depict only two possibilities out of a large set of possible scenarios.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Our goal is to maintain an adequate level of liquidity, for both long-term and short-term needs, through active management of both assets and liabilities. Since Advanta Corp.'s debt rating is not investment grade, our access to unsecured, institutional debt is limited. However, we do have access to a diversity of funding sources as described below, and have a high level of liquidity at December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2001, we had $230 million of federal funds sold, $203 million of receivables held for sale, and $162 million of investments, which could be sold to generate additional liquidity.       Components of funding were as follows at December 31:                                                                2001               2000               1999                                                       ----------------   ----------------   ----------------                                                         AMOUNT      %      AMOUNT      %      AMOUNT      % - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------              Off-balance sheet business credit card receivables    $1,626,709    53%  $1,324,137    33%  $  765,019    19% Deposits                                                 636,915    21    1,346,976    34    1,512,359    37 Debt and other borrowings                                355,899    11      759,473    19    1,121,674    27 Equity, including capital securities                     466,299    15      540,902    14      689,631    17 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Total                                                 $3,085,822   100%  $3,971,488   100%  $4,088,683   100% ============================================================================================================     Off-Balance Sheet Business Credit Card Securitizations  We completed our first two public business credit card securitizations in 2000 and completed an additional public securitization in 2001. These public securitizations enabled us to grow off-balance sheet business credit card receivables as a component of our funding in 2000 and 2001. In addition to the public securitizations, the securitization trust has two non-public series outstanding. The first series provides off-balance sheet funding through a $280 million committed commercial paper conduit facility, of which $160 million was unused at December 31, 2001. The commitment can be withdrawn under certain conditions, similar to the conditions for an early amortization event as described below for the other series of the securitization trust. Our commercial paper conduit facility also requires the servicer, Advanta Bank Corp., to be well-capitalized. Upon the expiration of this commercial paper conduit facility in June 2002, management expects to obtain the appropriate level of replacement funding under similar terms and conditions. The second non-public series was a securitization completed in 2000.       The revolving periods of the series of the securitization trust extend to the following dates:                    INVESTOR PRINCIPAL                     BALANCE AT       SCHEDULED END OF                 DECEMBER 31, 2001    REVOLVING PERIOD - -----------------------------------------------------      Series 1997-A        $129,750               June 2002 Series 2000-A         157,068          September 2002 Series 2000-B         600,000            October 2002 Series 2000-C         400,000            January 2005 Series 2001-A         300,000               July 2007        When the revolving periods of these series end and the series amortize, management expects to complete new securitizations under similar terms and conditions. The securitization agreements contain conditions that                                          37   would trigger an early amortization event. An early amortization event would result in the repayment of principal to investors prior to the expected dates above, which would require us to find an alternate means of funding new receivables. The conditions include the failure to make payments under the terms of the agreement, or the insolvency, receivership or other similar event of the servicer, Advanta Bank Corp. An early amortization event would also be triggered for each individual series if the three-month average excess spread percentage was not maintained at a level greater than 0% for that series. Excess spread represents income-related cash flows on securitized receivables (finance charges, interchange and fees) net of note holders' interest, servicing fees, and credit losses. At December 31, 2001, our three-month average excess spread was 13%. Based on the current levels of excess spread, our financial condition and other considerations, management believes that it is unlikely that the trust or individual series will have an early amortization event. The business credit card securitization agreements do not have any provisions or conditions involving the debt rating of Advanta Corp.    Deposits, Debt, Other Borrowings and Equity  In the first quarter of 2001, we received in excess of $1 billion in cash proceeds from the Mortgage Transaction. We have strategically used the proceeds to strengthen Advanta for the future, including a significant reduction in our leverage. In the second quarter of 2001, we sold $389.7 million of our deposit liabilities to E*TRADE Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of E*TRADE Group, Inc. We also paid off substantially all of our outstanding medium-term notes and reduced our outstanding senior notes. In the year ended December 31, 2001, we reduced debt and deposits by $1.1 billion. Also, Advanta National Bank has suspended originations of deposit accounts.       The Mortgage Transaction in the first quarter of 2001 resulted in liquidity in excess of the needs of our continuing businesses. Excess liquid assets were held in short-term, high-quality investments earning money market rates until they could be deployed. As a result, we had interest expense in excess of interest income on this excess liquidity in 2001. The deposit sale and significant debt reduction in the second quarter of 2001 reduced this net interest expense and excess liquidity. However, we expect to continue to have interest expense in excess of interest income for the next several quarters due to the time required for our higher-rate debt to mature. We anticipate replacing these debt maturities with notes bearing lower interest rates more in line with the current market rates.       In the first quarter of 2001, we successfully negotiated an early termination of our strategic alliance with Progressive Casualty Insurance Company to direct market auto insurance and received regulatory approval for a return of capital from our insurance subsidiary to the parent company, Advanta Corp. The return of capital from the insurance subsidiary to Advanta Corp., along with other payments from the insurance subsidiary in the first quarter of 2001, increased Advanta Corp. liquidity by $62.5 million.       In the first quarter of 2001, after consideration of the liquidity and the capital requirements for the ongoing business, the Board of Directors of Advanta Corp. authorized management to purchase up to 1.5 million shares of Advanta Corp. common stock or the equivalent dollar amount of our capital securities, or some combination thereof. We intend to make purchases modestly and when we believe it is prudent to do so. As of December 31, 2001, we have repurchased 693,300 shares of our Class B Common Stock.       The following tables detail the composition of the deposit base and the composition of debt and other borrowings at year end for each of the past five years.

We expect to fund commitments related to operating leases with operating cash flows.       In addition to these obligations, we make commitments to extend credit to our business credit card customers in the normal course of business. We had unused commitments to extend credit of $4.6 billion at December 31, 2001. We believe that our customers' utilization of their lines of credit will continue to be substantially less than the amount of the commitments, as has been our experience to date. We expect to fund the commitments to extend credit with the various components of funding described above, similar to the funding of other new receivables.    Regulatory Agreements and Restrictions at Subsidiaries  In June 2000, we announced that our banking subsidiaries, Advanta National Bank and Advanta Bank Corp., reached agreements with their respective bank regulatory agencies, primarily relating to the banks' subprime lending operations. The agreements outlined a series of steps to modify processes and formalize and document certain practices and procedures for the banks' subprime lending operations. The agreements also established temporary asset growth limits at Advanta National Bank and deposit growth limits at Advanta Bank Corp., imposed restrictions on taking brokered deposits at Advanta National Bank, and required that Advanta National Bank maintain certain capital ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory standards. Our regulatory agreements with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC") prohibit the payment of cash dividends by Advanta Bank Corp. or Advanta National Bank without prior regulatory approval.       Management believes that Advanta Bank Corp. and Advanta National Bank were each in compliance with their respective regulatory agreements at December 31, 2001.                                          39        In connection with the Mortgage Transaction in the first quarter of 2001, Advanta National Bank sought approval of the OCC for a return of capital to Advanta Corp. in the amount of $261 million. On February 28, 2001, the OCC approved the amount requested and, at the same time, Advanta National Bank entered into an agreement with the OCC regarding restrictions on new business activities and product lines at Advanta National Bank after the Mortgage Transaction and the resolution of outstanding Advanta National Bank liabilities. The agreement also reduced the capital requirements for Advanta National Bank to 12.7% for Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets, and to 5% for Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets as defined in the agreement. In addition, the agreement provides for prior OCC approval of any future dividends. Advanta Bank Corp. is unaffected by the agreement with the OCC.       At December 31, 2001, Advanta Bank Corp.'s combined total capital ratio (combined Tier I and Tier II capital) was 18.80%, and Advanta National Bank's combined total capital ratio was 23.34%. At December 31, 2000, Advanta Bank Corp.'s combined total capital ratio was 14.60%, and Advanta National Bank's combined total capital ratio was 15.08%. In each case, Advanta Bank Corp. and Advanta National Bank had capital at levels a bank is required to maintain to be classified as "well-capitalized" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. However, Advanta National Bank does not meet the definition of "well-capitalized" because of the existence of our agreement with the OCC, even though we have achieved the higher imposed capital ratios required by the agreement.       In the fourth quarter of 2001, the bank regulatory agencies issued an interagency policy statement that revised the regulatory capital treatment of recourse, direct credit substitutes, and residual interests in asset securitizations. This rule supercedes the former low-level recourse rules and requires that banks hold one dollar in total risk-based capital against every dollar of residual interest, with some exceptions. It further requires that credit enhancing interest-only strips in excess of 25% of Tier 1 capital be deducted from Tier 1 capital for purposes of calculating bank capital ratios. This rule has an effective date of January 1, 2002. Early adoption was permitted for transactions entered into prior to the effective date that result in a reduced capital requirement. Banks can delay until December 31, 2002, the application of the final rule to transactions entered into prior to January 1, 2002 that result in increased capital requirements. Advanta Bank Corp. elected to adopt the rule effective December 31, 2001 and it resulted in a reduced risk-based capital requirement. We do not anticipate the adoption of this rule will have an effect on the capital requirements of Advanta National Bank.       Advanta Bank Corp. and Advanta National Bank are prevented by regulatory restrictions from lending to Advanta Corp. and its affiliates unless these extensions of credit are secured by U.S. Government obligations or other specified collateral. Further, secured extensions of credit are limited in amount: (a) as to Advanta Corp. or any affiliate, to 10% of each bank's capital and surplus, and (b) as to Advanta Corp. and all affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of each bank's capital and surplus. See "Part I -- Government Regulation."       Our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to certain capital and dividend rules and regulations as prescribed by state jurisdictions in which they are authorized to operate.       Total stockholders' equity of our banking and insurance affiliates was $220 million at December 31, 2001, of which $218 million was restricted. At January 1, 2002, $2.2 million of stockholders' equity of our insurance affiliates was available for payment of cash dividends in 2002 under applicable regulatory guidelines without prior regulatory approval.       In addition to dividend restrictions at banking subsidiaries, certain non-bank subsidiaries are subject to minimum equity requirements as part of securitization or other agreements. The total minimum equity requirement of non-bank subsidiaries was $20 million at December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2001, the non-bank subsidiaries were in compliance with these minimum equity requirements.       Management believes that the restrictions, for both bank and non-bank subsidiaries, will not have an adverse effect on Advanta Corp.'s ability to meet its cash obligations due to the current levels of liquidity and diversity of funding sources.
