See Introductory Note on page one.           The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting (i) consolidated results of operations of the Company for Fiscal 2000 compared to Fiscal 1999, and Fiscal 1999 compared to Fiscal 1998, and (ii) financial liquidity and capital resources for Fiscal 2000. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein. Certain amounts presented in this Item 7 have generally been rounded to the nearest thousand and hundred thousand, as applicable, but the percentages calculated are based on actual amounts without rounding.           The Company operates primarily in the beverage alcohol industry in the United States. The Company reports its operating results in five segments: Bulk Alcohol Products (citrus brandy, citrus spirits, rum, cane spirits, fortified citrus wine, purchased distilled products and byproducts); Premium Branded Spirits (primarily rum, flavored rum and tequila); Bottling Operations (contract bottling services and proprietary and private label products); Vinegar and Cooking Wine (bulk vinegar, bulk cooking wine, vinegar stock and proprietary and private label case goods); and Corporate Operations and Other (primarily corporate related items).           Information regarding net sales, operating income (loss) and total assets of each of the Company's business segments and information regarding geographic areas is set forth in Note 12 to the Company's consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Company's net sales and gross margins (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) vary depending on the mix of business among the Company's products. Historically, gross margins have been highest in bulk alcohol products and premium branded spirits and lower in bottling operations and vinegar and cooking wine operations. Within its bottling operations, sales and gross margins have varied substantially based upon the mix of business from the Company's "Type A" and "Type B" bottling customers. Type A bottling customers pay the Company to purchase their raw materials and these costs are passed through to the customer. Type B bottling customers supply their own raw materials and are only charged for bottling charges. Although gross profit per case for the Company's Type A and Type B bottling customers is approximately equal, given the same case volume, net sales and cost of goods sold with respect to products bottled for Type A bottling customers are higher, and gross margins are lower, than for Type B bottling customers. As a result, significant fluctuations in volume of Type A bottling customers can distort the Company's gross margin.           The Company has a limited number of customers, and these customers often purchase bulk alcohol products in significant quantities or place significant orders for contract bottling services, distilled spirits, vinegar and cooking wine. Accordingly, the size and timing of purchase orders and product shipments can cause operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Additionally, some Company products generate higher profit margins than others, and changes in the Company's product mix will cause gross margins to fluctuate. Certain aspects of the Company's business are also seasonal, with increased demand for the Company's contract bottling services from April to October and increased production of the Company's bulk alcohol products during the months from November to June, corresponding to the Florida citrus-harvest. As a result of these factors, the Company's operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.           Net sales represent the Company's gross sales less excise taxes. Excise taxes are generally payable on products bottled by the Company. In addition, excise taxes are payable on sales of industrial alcohol to certain customers. Accordingly, excise taxes vary from period to period depending upon the Company's product and customer mix.                                        10   ACQUISITION OF MONARCH WINE COMPANY           On November 17, 1999, the Company completed the Monarch Acquisition. The purchase price was $23.8 million in cash. Monarch specializes in the manufacture of wines, including custom blended wines and cooking wines for the food industry and base wines for producers of vinegar and beverage alcohol.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1999           NET SALES. Net sales were $93.0 million in 2000, an increase of $21.2% from net sales of $76.7 million in 1999.           Net sales of bulk alcohol products were $37.5 million in 2000, an increase of 11.7% from net sales of $33.5 million in 1999. The increase resulted from increased sales of bulk alcohol resulting from the Monarch Acquisition. Unit sales of citrus spirits decreased 53.9% and unit sales of fortified citrus wine increased 59.1% in 2000 compared to 1999. These changes resulted from the Monarch Acquisition. Monarch was a major purchaser of the Company's citrus spirits for use in producing fortified citrus wine.           Net sales of premium branded spirits were $16.1 million in 2000, an increase of 32.9% from net sales of $12.1 million in 1999. Sales increases reflect the continued expansion of the Company's distribution network and the success of its Cruzan Flavored Rums and Porfidio Tequila brands.           Net sales of the Company's bottling operations were $16.8 million in 2000, a decrease of 5.4% from net sales of $17.8 million in 1999. The unit volume of the Company's bottling operations decreased 1.8% in 2000. The decrease in volume was primarily attributable to a decrease in business with the Company's largest Type A bottling customer. The Company believes that the business with this Type A bottling customer will not return to historic levels.           Net sales of vinegar and cooking wine were $20.5 million in 2000, an increase of 85.7% from net sales of $11.0 million in 1999. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of cooking wine resulting from the Monarch Acquisition. The Company has recently expanded its vinegar production capacity by building additional facilities.           GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit was $28.9 million in 2000, an increase of 21.6% from gross profit of $23.7 million in 1999. Gross margin increased to 31.0% in 2000 from 30.9% in 1999.           SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $17.9 million in 2000, an increase of 19.0% from $15.0 million in 1999. The increase was primarily attributable to (1) increased marketing expenses and new employees related to the Company's premium branded spirits business; (2) expenses incurred during the integration of the Monarch Acquisition, and (3) increased amortization expense.           OPERATING INCOME. The following table sets forth the operating income (loss) by operating segment.

INTEREST INCOME. The Company earns interest on its cash, short-term investments and notes receivable. The increase in interest income in 2000 was attributable to higher average amounts of cash, short-term investments and notes receivable outstanding compared to 1999.           INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense was $5.0 million in 2000 and $3.6 million in 1999. The increase in interest expense was due to higher levels of debt outstanding due to the Monarch Acquisition and higher interest rates during 2000 compared to 1999.           INCOME TAX EXPENSE. The Company's effective income tax rate was 24.6% in 2000 and 24.3% in 1999. The low tax rate is attributable to the Virgin Islands subsidiary, which has a 90% exemption from United States federal income taxes (see Note 9 to the Company's consolidated financial statements).   FISCAL 1999 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1998           NET SALES. Net sales were $76.7 million in 1999, an increase of 2.2% from net sales of $75.1 million in 1998.           Net sales of bulk alcohol products were $33.5 million in 1999, an increase of 3.1% from net sales of $32.5 million in 1998. The increase resulted primarily from (i) an increase in sales of citrus spirits and rum, and (ii) an improved product mix of sales of purchased distilled products. These increases were partially offset by decreases in citrus brandy, cane spirits and byproducts.           Net sales of premium branded spirits were $12.1 million in 1999, an increase of 15.6% from net sales of $10.5 million in 1998. Sales increases reflect the continued expansion of the Company's distribution network into new markets and the success of its Cruzan Flavored Rums and Porfidio Tequila.           Net sales in the Company's bottling operations were $17.8 million in 1999, a decrease of 7.3% from net sales of $19.2 million in 1998. The Company's overall bottling volume decreased 4.6% in 1999. The decrease in volume was primarily attributable to a decrease in business with the Company's largest Type A bottling customer. The Company believes that the business with this Type A bottling customer will not return to historic levels. Sales of the Company's proprietary and private label products decreased 1.5% in 1999.           Net sales of vinegar and cooking wine were $11.0 million in 1999, an increase of 4.6% from net sales of $10.5 million in 1998. The Company's two vinegar plants were operating at maximum capacity in 1999.           GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit was $23.7 million in 1999, an increase of 7.4% from gross profit of $22.1 million in 1998. Gross margin increased to 30.9% in 1999 from 29.4% in 1998. The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to a favorable change in product mix in the Company's bulk alcohol products and a decrease in contract bottling volume with a Type A bottling customer.           SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $15.0 million in 1999, an increase of 7.8% from $13.9 million in 1998. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 19.5% of net sales in 1999 and 18.6% in 1998. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 1999, was primarily attributable to increased marketing and new employees related to the Company's efforts to increase its distribution network. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in administrative overhead.                                     12             OPERATING INCOME.

INTEREST INCOME. The Company earns interest income on its cash, short-term investments and notes receivable. The increase in interest income in 1999 was attributable to higher average amounts of cash, short-term investments and notes receivable outstanding compared to 1998.           INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense was $3.6 million in 1999 and $3.9 million in 1998. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower levels of debt outstanding and lower rates during 1999 compared to 1998.           OTHER, NET. Included in other income is a nonrecurring gain of $.1 million in 1999 and $.4 million in 1998.           INCOME TAX EXPENSE. The Company's effective income tax rate was 24.3% in 1999 and 14.6% in 1998. The low tax rate is attributable to the Virgin Islands subsidiary which has a 90% exemption from United States federal income taxes. Also, in 1998 the Company amended its 1993, 1994 and 1995 income tax returns, which resulted in loss carryforwards available in 1998 and a refund of income taxes previously paid. No such loss carryforwards or refunds were available in 1999.  FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           GENERAL           The Company's principal use of cash in its operating activities is for purchasing raw materials to be used in its manufacturing operations, purchasing imported products for its premium branded spirits business and carrying inventories and the subsequent receivables. The Company's source of liquidity has historically been cash flow from operations and its line of credit. Some of the Company's manufacturing operations are seasonal and the Company's borrowings on its line of credit vary during the year. For example, the Company uses citrus molasses as its primary raw material in the production of citrus brandy and spirits at its two Florida distilleries. The Company buys citrus molasses, a byproduct of citrus juice production, from local manufacturers of citrus juice and concentrate during the citrus harvest, which generally runs from November to June. The Company generally begins purchasing citrus molasses in November and builds inventory of citrus brandy and spirits. The Company must manufacture and build inventory while raw materials are available due to the short life of the citrus molasses it purchases. Another seasonal business of the Company is its contract bottling services. Demand for contract bottling services is highest during the months from April through October. Management believes that cash provided by its operating and financing activities will provide adequate resources to satisfy its working capital, liquidity and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both its short-term and long-term capital needs.                                          13              OPERATING ACTIVITIES           Net cash provided by operating activities in 2000 was $4.4 million, which resulted from $9.5 million in net income adjusted for noncash items, less $5.1 million representing the net change in operating assets and liabilities.           INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES           Net cash used in investing activities in 2000 was $30.9 million, which resulted primarily from $5.8 million of capital expenditures, $23.8 million used for the Monarch Acquisition and a net increase of $2.3 million in short-term investments. Payments received on notes receivable of $1.8 million were offset by new notes issued of $.3 million. During the third quarter of 2000, the Company converted a $1,000,000 loan to Premier Wines & Spirits, Ltd. ("Premier"), a 45% owned subsidiary, into a capital contribution in order to improve Premier's capital structure.           The Company's capital expenditures were $5.8 million in 2000 and $2.6 million in 1999. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to (1) improving the Company's wine production capacity, (2) expanding vinegar production capacity and (3) improving the Company's rum production capacity.           Net cash provided by financing activities in 2000 was $24.5 million, which resulted from (1) proceeds from term loans and other notes of $56.9 million and (2) an increase of $8.5 million in borrowings under the revolving credit facility, offset by (3) payments of long-term debt totaling $40.1 million.           In November 1999, the Company's previous long-term debt and line of credit were replaced with a $71 million credit agreement between the Company and a syndicate of lenders. The new credit agreement consists of a $15 million revolving credit facility which expires in November 2002 and a term loan with an initial amount of $56 million which matures on December 31, 2004. In November 1999, the Company used $23.5 million of the term loan to fund the Monarch Acquisition. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility were $8.5 million at September 30, 2000. See Note 8 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the Company's long-term debt.           The Company's total debt was $59.3 million as of September 30, 2000, and its ratio of debt to equity was 1.1 to 1.           The Company's share of the undistributed earnings of the Bahamian and Virgin Islands subsidiaries was approximately $8.1 million and $21.1 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2000. No provision has been made for taxes which would result from the remittance of such undistributed earnings as the Company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely. See Note 9 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes related to these subsidiaries.           Based on current plans and business conditions, management expects that its cash and cash equivalents, together with any amounts generated from operations and available borrowings, will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS           In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 during the second quarter of Fiscal 2000.                                          14    EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES           The Company uses natural gas in its distilling operations and has recently experienced significant increases in its energy costs as a result of natural gas price increases. At the present time, management believes that the Company's energy costs relating to natural gas will continue to increase. Where competitively feasible, management plans to increase selling prices to offset the effects of natural gas price increases, but the Company may not be able to recover these energy cost increases.           Except as noted above, the Company's results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices. The Company has been able, subject to normal competitive conditions, to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices.  ITEM 7A.
