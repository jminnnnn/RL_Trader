produces, imports and markets premiumbranded spirits; bottles beverage alcohol and other beverages on a contractbasis and under private labels; and produces vinegar and cooking wine.     TheCompanys net sales and gross margins (gross profit as a percentage of netsales) vary depending on the mix of business among the Companys products.  Historically, gross margins have been highestin bulk alcohol products and premium branded spirits and lower in bottlingoperations and vinegar and cooking wine operations.  Within its bottling operations, sales andgross margins have varied substantially based upon the mix of business from theCompanys Type A and Type B bottling customers.  Type A bottling customers pay the Company topurchase their raw materials and these costs are passed through to thecustomer.  Type B bottling customers supplytheir own raw materials and are only charged for bottling charges.  Although gross profit per case for theCompanys Type A and Type B bottling customers is approximately equal, giventhe same case volume, net sales and cost of goods sold with respect to productsbottled for Type A bottling customers are higher, and gross margins are lower,than for Type B bottling customers.  As aresult, significant fluctuations in volume of Type A bottling customers candistort the Companys gross margin.     Thesize and timing of purchase orders and product shipments can cause operatingresults to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, particularly sincesome customers purchase bulk alcohol products in significant quantities at onetime or place significant orders at one time for contract bottling services,distilled spirits, vinegar and cooking wine. Additionally, some Company products generate higher profit margins thanothers, and changes in the Companys product mix will therefore cause grossmargins to fluctuate.  Certain aspects ofthe Companys business are also seasonal, with increased demand for the Companyscontract bottling services from April to October and increasedproduction of the Companys bulk alcohol products from November to June,corresponding to the Florida citrus-harvest. As a result of these factors, the Companys operating results may varysignificantly from quarter to quarter.     Netsales represent the Companys gross sales less excise taxes. Excise taxes aregenerally payable on sales of certain of the Companys bulk alcohol productsand on all alcohol products bottled by the Company.  However, there are no excise taxes paid onsales made to customers that have tax permits. Accordingly, excise taxes may vary significantly from period to perioddepending upon the Companys product and customer mix.     18            Results ofOperations     Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004     Net Sales . Net saleswere $106.5 million in 2005, an increase of 10.4% from net sales of $96.4million in 2004.     Net salesof bulk alcohol products were $40.4 million in 2005, an increase of 8.4% fromnet sales of $37.2 million in 2004.  Theincrease resulted primarily from increased shipments of rum, citrus spirits andfortified wine offset by decreased shipments of citrus brandy and canespirits.  The decrease in citrus brandyand cane spirits was due in part to the timing of customer orders and also dueto a market decline for these products.  Managementbelieves that the Companys sales of citrus spirits have increased during 2005due to a decrease in the recent market surplus of grape spirits which some ofthe Companys customers may have been using as an alternative ingredient intheir product formulations.  However,management believes that this increase in business could be temporary and thatthe Companys sales of citrus spirits could decrease in the future if themarket surplus of grape spirits increases. In 2005, unit sales of citrus brandy and cane spirits decreased 4.3% and18.0%, respectively, compared to 2004, and the average selling price of citrusbrandy decreased 2.6%.  Also in 2005,unit sales of the Companys rum and fortified wine products increased 3.0% and7.9%, respectively, compared to 2004, and the average selling price for theCompanys rum increased 4.8% while the average selling price for fortified winedecreased 2.0%.  The average sellingprices for these bulk alcohol products varied due to changes in product andcustomer mix.     Netsales of premium branded spirits were $32.9 million in 2005, an increase of22.6% from net sales of $26.8 million in 2004. Sales of the Companys Cruzan Estate Rums and Cruzan Flavored Rumsincreased 21.3% in 2005 compared to 2004. Sales of Cruzan Estate Rums and Cruzan Flavored Rums increased from $2.2million in Fiscal 1996 to $25.5 million in Fiscal 2005.  During this time, the Cruzan brand has beenrecognized as one of the fastest growing brands in the spirits industry bycertain beverage industry publications and the Cruzan Rums have won numeroustasting awards from several prestigious beverage industry organizations.  Since January 2003, several of theCompanys competitors have introduced their own lines of flavored rum productsinto the marketplace, which, in certain fiscal quarters, has negativelyimpacted the level of sales growth of Cruzan Flavored Rums.  Some of the Companys competitors in the rumand flavored rum categories have significantly greater financial and otherresources than the Company, which could adversely affect the Companys salesgrowth of Cruzan Estate Rums and Cruzan Flavored Rums. As a response to suchincreased competition, and in order to provide further impetus to the growth ofCruzan Estate Rums and Cruzan Flavored Rums, management significantly increasedits marketing budget in Fiscal 2004 and increased it again for Fiscal 2005 inan effort to support the continued growth of the Companys Cruzan brand.  This increase in marketing expenses hasincreased the operating loss for this business segment in Fiscal 2005 andFiscal 2004.  Management intends tocontinue its increased expenditures in 2006 to maintain the growth of theCruzan Rum brand.     Netsales of the Companys bottling operations were $13.0 million in 2005, anincrease of 9.0% from net sales of $11.9 million in 2004.  While sales in the Companys bottlingoperations increased 9.0% in 2005, unit volume decreased 15.4% and the averageprice per case increased 28.9%.  Theprimary reason for the increase in the average price per case was the additionin August 2005 of a new Type A contract bottling customer for which theCompany supplies raw materials in addition to a bottling charge.  Sales in the Companys bottling operationshave declined in recent fiscal years both as a result of a contraction in theready-to-drink product category, for which the Company is a contract bottlerand in the Companys private label business as a result of a loss of certainlarge private label bottling customers. Responding to this decline in business, in July 2004 the Companycompleted the partial consolidation of its bottling operations to reduceoverhead.  However, bottling operationsvolume did not even meet the Companys reduced expectations for 2004, whichcaused a continuing loss in this segment. The Company has been placing a renewed emphasis on the sales effort inthis segment while seeking other contract bottling opportunities.  The Company has explored alternatives in itstwo bottling facilities, including further consolidation, a partial sale andshedding less profitable product lines. In December 2004, management discontinued production of allproducts in the Lake Alfred bottling plant with the exception of one productionline bottling vinegar, cooking wine and juices. In January 2005, the operation of this bottling line was reduced toone shift.  At the present time, theCompany has not taken an impairment charge relating to its bottling operationsas the carrying value of its bottling assets is less than fair value.     Netsales of vinegar and cooking wine were $20.2 million in 2005, a decrease of1.0% from net sales of $20.4 million in 2004. In 2005, total unit sales of vinegar and cooking wine decreased 3.9%compared to 2004,     19            although the average selling price per unit increased 3.0%.  The average selling prices of vinegar andcooking wine increased due primarily to a combination of decreased sales oflower priced white distilled vinegar and an increase in sales of higher pricedvinegar case goods.     Gross Profit .  Gross profit was $34.7 million in 2005, anincrease of 17.2% from gross profit of $29.6 million in 2004.  During 2005, bulk alcohol gross profitdecreased $1.1 million primarily due to higher energy costs; premium brandedspirits gross profit increased $4.2 million due to sales increases; bottlingoperations gross loss decreased $1.3 million due to reducing overhead as aresult of the Companys bottling consolidation plan and profit from a newbottling contract of approximately $0.8 million; and vinegar and cooking winegross profit increased $0.7 million due to an improved product mix.  Gross margin was 32.6% in 2005 and 30.8% in2004.     Selling, General andAdministrative Expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses were $38.3 million in 2005,an increase of 15.3% from $33.2 million in 2004.  The increase was primarily attributable to a$4.1 million increase in administrative, marketing and advertising expenses inthe Companys premium branded spirits business in an effort to support thecontinued growth of the Companys Cruzan brand. Management intends to continue to increase selling, general andadministrative expenditures in 2006 to maintain the growth of its Cruzan Rumbrand.  Also during 2005, the Companyscorporate overhead increased $0.8 million primarily due to professional feesincurred as a result of the acquisition by V&S of control of the Company.     Payment to be Made by Principal Stockholder .   Pursuantto a letter agreement entered into between Angostura and certain of the Companysmanagement on June 2, 2005, Angostura agreed to pay to certain of theCompanys management an aggregate amount of $9 million if the sale of Angosturascontrolling interest in the Company to ASCI were completed.  Although this sale was completed on September 26,2005, as of December 16, 2005, this payment has not been made.  This payment is not the obligation of theCompany and was negotiated between certain members of management and the formermajority owner without the participation of or ratification by the Companysboard of directors or any committee thereof and does not affect the Companysbalance sheet or cash flow statement. However, under Staff Accounting Bulletin 107 issued by the Commissionrelating to accounting for expenses or liabilities paid by principalstockholder(s), this expected payment by Angostura was treated as an expense ofthe Company in the statement of operations, and as a contribution to additionalpaid-in capital on the balance sheet.     Operating Income (Loss) .  The following table sets forth the operating income (loss) by reportablesegment of the Company for 2005 and 2004.                  Year Ended September 30,                     2005         2004                     (In  thousands)           Bulk alcohol products         $    9,324         $    9,021           Premium branded spirits         (7,274    )    (7,569    )      Bottling operations         (3,086    )    (3,904    )      Vinegar and cooking wine         2,471         3,041           Corporate operations         (14,009    )    (4,168    )                $    (12,574    )    $    (3,579    )                    As aresult of the above factors, operating loss was $12.6 million in 2005 and $3.6million in 2004.     TheCompanys premium branded spirits segment experienced operating losses of $7.3million in 2005 and $7.6 million in 2004. The operating losses reflected the Companys continuing efforts toincrease market share by reinvesting this and other segments gross profits inselling and marketing expenses.     As aresult of the factors described under Net Sales above, the Companys bottlingoperations segment reported an operating loss of $3.1 million in 2005 and $3.9million in 2004.     Interest Expense . Interest expense was $2.7 million in 2005 and $2.2 million in 2004.  The Companys borrowing rates and averageborrowings were higher in 2005 compared to 2004.     20            Income Tax Expense .   During2005 and 2004, the Company incurred operating losses from its U.S. operationsand recorded an income tax benefit of $3.9 million and $3.7 million,respectively.  The Companys VirginIslands subsidiary has a 90% exemption from U.S. Virgin Islands incometaxes.  The exemption is effectivethrough September 2020.  Inaddition, the Company benefited from the extraterritorial income exclusion in2005 and 2004.     Fiscal 2004Compared to Fiscal 2003     Net Sales . Net saleswere $96.4 million in 2004, an increase of 6.6% from net sales of $90.4 millionin 2003.     Netsales of bulk alcohol products were $37.2 million in 2004, an increase of 5.8%from net sales of $35.2 million in 2003. The increase resulted primarily from increased shipments of rum andfortified wine offset by decreased shipments of citrus brandy, citrus spiritsand cane spirits.  The decrease in citrusbrandy, citrus spirits and cane spirits was due in part to the timing ofcustomer orders.  In addition, in 2003,the Company had sales of cane spirits to a new customer that had difficultysourcing bulk alcohol from its regular supplier.  These sales of approximately $250,000 did notreoccur in 2004.  Management believesthat the Companys sales of citrus spirits declined approximately $176,000during 2004 due to a market surplus of grape spirits which some of the Companyscustomers may have been using as an alternative ingredient in their productformulations.  In 2004, unit sales ofcitrus brandy and spirits decreased 7.2% and 23.8%, respectively, compared to2003, and the average selling price of citrus brandy decreased 5.7%.  Also in 2004, unit sales of the Companysfortified wine products increased 17.4% compared to 2003, although the averageselling price for the Companys fortified wine decreased 3.4%.  The average selling prices for these bulkalcohol products decreased due to management lowering prices as a result ofincreased competition from grape spirits distillers and foreign wine producers.     Netsales of premium branded spirits were $26.8 million in 2004, an increase of29.0% from net sales of $20.8 million in 2003. Sales of the Companys Cruzan Estate Rums and Cruzan Flavored Rumsincreased 24.1% in 2004 compared to 2003. Sales of Cruzan Estate Rums and Cruzan Flavored Rums increased from $2.2million in Fiscal 1996 to $21.0 million in Fiscal 2004.  During this time, the Cruzan brand has beenrecognized as one of the fastest growing brands in the spirits industry bycertain beverage industry publications and the Cruzan Rums have won numeroustasting awards from several prestigious beverage industry organizations.  Since January 2003, several of theCompanys competitors have introduced their own lines of flavored rum productsinto the marketplace, which, in certain fiscal quarters, has negativelyimpacted the level of sales growth of Cruzan Flavored Rums.  Some of the Companys competitors in the rumand flavored rum categories have significantly greater financial and otherresources than the Company, which could adversely affect the Companys salesgrowth of Cruzan Estate Rums and Cruzan Flavored Rums. As a response to suchincreased competition, and in order to provide further impetus to the growth ofCruzan Estate Rums and Cruzan Flavored Rums, management significantly increasedits marketing budget for Fiscal 2004 in an effort to support the continuedgrowth of the Companys Cruzan brand, causing an increase in the operating lossfor this business segment.     In August andSeptember 2004, the eyes of three major hurricanes struck withinapproximately thirty miles of all of the Companys facilities in CentralFlorida.  Physical damage to the Companysfacilities of less than $100,000 occurred as a result of these hurricanes.  However, while difficult to quantify,disruptions to business caused by these hurricanes, including several days ofplant shut-downs, prolonged loss of power, product shipment interruptions andincreased labor costs, contributed to lost sales in the premium branded spiritssegment, as well as to the additional costs in the bottling and vinegar andcooking wine segments as discussed below. The Company and its insurance advisor determined that the lossesincurred during these hurricanes, including physical damage and businessinterruption, did not meet the deductible levels of the Companys casualtyinsurance policies due mainly to the fact that each hurricane had a separatedeductible requirement and the Companys disruptions were incurred over thecourse of all of the hurricanes, as well as the relatively minor physicaldamage incurred.     Netsales of the Companys bottling operations were $11.9 million in 2004, adecrease of 16.6% from net sales of $14.3 million in 2003.  During the first quarter of Fiscal 2004, theCompany lost a large private label bottling customer.  Net sales to this private label bottlingcustomer were approximately $2.5 million and 193,719 cases for the year ended September 30,2003, or approximately 17.6% of bottling operations net sales and 5.2% ofbottling operations volume.  Also during2004, excise taxes decreased $4.8 million compared to 2003, primarily due tothe decrease in sales to this private label bottling customer.  Sales in the Companys bottling operationsalso continued to decline as a result of a contraction in the ready-to-drinkproduct category, for which the Company is a contract bottler.  Responding to this decline, in July 2004the Company completed the partial consolidation of its     21            bottling operations to reduceoverhead.  However, bottling operationsvolume did not even meet the Companys reduced expectations for 2004, whichcaused a continuing loss in this segment. The Company placed a renewed emphasis on the sales effort in this segment,seeking other contract bottling opportunities. The Company explored other alternatives in its two bottling facilities,including further consolidation, a partial sale and shedding less profitableproduct lines.  In December 2004,management discontinued production of all products in the Lake Alfred bottlingplant with the exception of one production line bottling vinegar, cooking wineand juices.     Net sales of vinegar and cooking wine were$20.4 million in 2004, an increase of 1.3% from net sales of $20.2 million in2003.  In 2004, total unit sales ofvinegar and cooking wine decreased 16.9% compared to 2003, although the averageselling price per unit increased 21.9%. The average selling prices of vinegar and cooking wine increased due toa combination of decreased sales of lower priced white distilled vinegar andbulk cooking wine and a slight increase in sales of higher priced cooking winecase goods.     GrossProfit . Gross profit was $29.7 million in 2004, a decrease of 4.8% from grossprofit of $31.1 million in 2003.  During2004, bulk alcohol gross profit decreased $1.5 million as a result of highercitrus molasses and citrus concentrate raw material costs; premium brandedspirits gross profit increased with sales; bottling operations gross profitdecreased with sales and increased costs as a result of hurricane disruptions;and vinegar and cooking wine gross profit decreased $1.0 million due to highergrain alcohol and citrus concentrate raw material cost and increased productioncosts as a result of hurricane disruptions. Gross margin was 30.8% in 2004 and 34.4% in 2003.     Selling, General and Administrative Expenses .  Selling, general and administrative expenseswere $33.2 million in 2004, an increase of 32.6% from $25.1 million in2003.  The increase was primarilyattributable to a $7.6 million increase in administrative, marketing andadvertising expenses in the Companys premium branded spirits business in aneffort to support the continued growth of the Companys Cruzan brand.  Also during 2004, the Companys Compensationand Stock Option Committee approved a new Supplemental Executive RetirementPlan for certain key executives of the Company. This new plan replaces a deferred compensation plan, which resulted inthe cancellation of a $0.7 million liability which was credited to selling,general and administrative expenses.     Operating Income (Loss) .  The following table sets forth the operating income (loss) by reportablesegment of the Company for 2004 and 2003.                  Year Ended September 30,                     2004         2003                     (In thousands)           Bulk alcohol  products         $    9,021         $    11,432           Premium  branded spirits         (7,569    )    (2,271    )      Bottling  operations         (3,904    )    (1,901    )      Vinegar and  cooking wine         3,041         4,190           Corporate  operations         (4,168    )    (5,385    )                $    (3,579    )    $    6,065             As a result of the above factors, operatingloss was $3.6 million in 2004, as compared to operating income of $6.1 millionin 2003.     The Companys premium branded spirits segmentexperienced operating losses of $7.6 million in 2004 and $2.3 million in2003.  The operating losses reflected theCompanys continuing efforts to increase market share by reinvesting this andother segments gross profits in selling and marketing expenses.     As a result of the factors described under NetSales above, the Companys bottling operations segment reported an operatingloss of $3.9 million in 2004 and $1.9 million in 2003.     InterestExpense .  Interest expense was $2.2 million in 2004and $3.4 million in 2003.  The Companysborrowing rates and average borrowings were lower in 2004 compared to 2003.     OtherExpense .  OnNovember 26, 2002, the Company announced the retirement and resignation ofA. Kenneth Pincourt, Jr., its Founder, Chairman and Chief ExecutiveOfficer.  The Company entered into aretirement agreement with Mr. Pincourt, setting forth the terms of hisretirement and resignation.  Theretirement agreement     22            replaced Mr. Pincourtsprevious employment agreement. Under the retirement agreement, the Companyelected to accelerate retirement benefits under its deferred compensationprogram and to continue to pay compensation and provide related benefitsthrough July 15, 2004, the remaining term of Mr. Pincourts previousemployment contract.     Accelerated benefits under the deferredprogram amounted to $1,040,987, of which $549,220 had been accrued as of September 30,2002. Mr. Pincourts deferred compensation was paid to him on December 13,2002.  Also under the retirementagreement, Mr. Pincourt continued to receive monthly payments of $41,004through July 15, 2004, one bonus payment of $150,491, which was paid in October 2003,and a second bonus payment of $119,138, which was paid in August 2004.  Among other benefits, Mr. Pincourt wasalso able to participate in any health insurance plan, employee benefit plan orother arrangement made available by the Company or its subsidiaries to itsexecutives and key management employees, through July 15, 2004.  The Company recorded a charge for theretirement of Mr. Pincourt during 2003 and there were no charges withrespect to this in 2004.  The effect ofthis charge was included in other expense in the Companys consolidatedstatement of operations and amounted to $1,503,925 before income taxes.     The following table summarizes the chargemade during 2003 for Mr. Pincourts retirement:        Deferred compensation         $    1,040,987           Compensation and related benefits         1,012,158           Total         2,053,145                                 Less deferred compensation accrued as of  September 30, 2002         (549,220    )      Charged to expense         $    1,503,925                     On May 22, 2003, the Company announcedthe retirement of Troy Edwards, its Chief Financial Officer, Secretary,Treasurer and Controller.  The Companyrecorded a charge for the retirement of Mr. Edwards of $207,683 during thethird quarter of Fiscal 2003.  The effectof this charge was included in other expense in the Companys consolidatedstatement of operations.     IncomeTax Expense .   During 2004 and 2003, the Companyincurred operating losses from its U.S. operations and recorded an income taxbenefit of $3.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively.  The Companys Virgin Islands subsidiary has a90% exemption from U.S. Virgin Islands income taxes.  The exemption is effective through September 2020.  In addition, the Company benefited from theextraterritorial income exclusion in 2004 and 2003.     FinancialLiquidity and Capital Resources     General     The Companys principal use of cash in itsoperating activities is for labor, overhead and raw materials to be used in itsmanufacturing operations and purchasing imported products for its premiumbranded spirits business.  The Companys source of liquidity hashistorically been cash flow from operations and its line of credit.  Some of the Companys manufacturingoperations are seasonal and the Companys borrowings on its line of credit varyduring the year.     The Florida citrus harvest is generallyduring the months from November through June.  The majority of the Florida citrus harvest isprocessed as fresh fruit juice or juice concentrate.  A byproduct of citrus juice production iscitrus molasses which the Company uses as a raw material at its two Floridadistilleries to produce citrus brandy and spirits.  Due to the seasonal availability and short shelf-lifeof the citrus molasses raw material, the Company produces its estimated annualcustomer requirements during a seven-month period, and therefore, carries ahigher than normal level of inventory in relation to sales during thisseven-month period.  Generally, theCompanys inventory level increases during this seven month period anddecreases after the citrus harvest ends when the Company supplies its customerswith citrus brandy and spirits from inventory from July through October.     There are no federal regulations that requireminimum aging to be designated rum. However, due to the Companys high qualitystandards, the Company ages its Cruzan Estate Rums for two to five years andcertain of the Companys super premium rums are aged up to 12 years. Due to theCompanys own aging requirements,     23            production of Cruzan EstateRums is scheduled to meet demand two to three years in the future.  Accordingly, inventories are larger inrelation to sales and total assets than for other branded spirits suppliersthat do not age their products. Management expects to continue to increase theCompanys inventory of barrel aged rums to meet projected increased sales inthe future.     Another seasonal business of the Company isits contract bottling services.  Demandfor contract bottling services is highest from April through October.  During these months, the Companysrequirements increase for ingredients, glass bottles, caps, labels, packagingmaterials and labor.  During 2005, theCompany incurred losses from its bottling operations of $3.1 million.  Management has explored alternatives for itstwo bottling facilities, including further consolidation, a partial sale andshedding less profitable product lines. In December 2004, management discontinued production of allproducts in the Lake Alfred bottling plant with the exception of one productionline bottling vinegar, cooking wine and juices.   In January 2005, the operation of thisbottling line was reduced to one shift.     During 2005, management increased selling,general and administrative expenses in its premium branded spirits segment inan effort to support the continued growth of the Companys Cruzan brand.  Management intends to continue its increasedexpenditures in 2006 to maintain the growth of the Cruzan Rum brand.  To the extent that the increased expendituresdo not result in increased sales of the Cruzan brand, the Companys short-termliquidity may be adversely affected. However, management actively monitors sales and expenditures on anongoing basis, and retains the ability to adjust its level of expenditures inresponse to market conditions and in order to maintain sufficient liquidity.     Management believes that cash provided by itsoperating and financing activities will provide adequate resources to satisfyits working capital, liquidity and anticipated capital expenditure requirementsfor both its short-term and long-term capital needs.     OperatingActivities     Net cash used in operating activities in 2005was $3.7 million, which resulted from $0.7 million in net loss adjusted for noncash items, and a$3.0 million net change in operating assets and liabilities.     Investing andFinancing Activities     Net cash used in investing activities in 2005was $0.6 million, including capital expenditures of $3.4 million partially offset by principalpayments received on notes receivable of $3.2 million.     Net cash provided by financing activities in2005 was $4.2 million, which resulted primarily from a $3.1 million net increase in borrowings under therevolving credit facility and  $5.5million from the issuance of common stock off-set by $4.2 million of paymentson long-term debt.     In October 2001, the Company enteredinto a $70 million credit agreement with Wachovia Bank, consisting of a $40million term loan and a $30 million revolving loan facility.  In March 2004, the revolving loanfacility was reduced to $15 million.  Thecredit agreement was due to expire in January 2006.  On December 14, 2005, the Companyentered into a loan arrangement with V&S consisting of a $30 million termpromissory note and a $10 million revolving promissory note, both of which areunsecured, bear interest at the applicable LIBOR rate plus 90 basis points andmature on December 15, 2006.  Thenotes are non-amortizing and have no financial covenant requirements.  On December 16, 2005, the Company usedthe proceeds of these notes to refinance its existing credit agreement.     The Companys bank debt was $28.6 million asof September 30, 2005, and its ratio of total debt to equity was 0.60 to1.     The Companys share of the undistributedearnings of its Bahamian and Virgin Islands subsidiaries was approximately$47.5 million as of September 30, 2005. No provision has been made for taxes which would result from the remittanceof such undistributed earnings, as the Company intends to reinvest theseearnings indefinitely. See Note 10 to the Companys consolidated financialstatements for additional information on income taxes related to thesesubsidiaries.     24            Based on current plans and businessconditions, management expects that its cash and cash equivalents, togetherwith any amounts generated from operations and available borrowings, will besufficient to meet the Companys cash requirements for at least the next 12months.     CriticalAccounting Policies     The Companys significant accounting policiesare more fully described in Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financialstatements located in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Thepreparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principlesgenerally accepted in the United States of America requires management to makeestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets andliabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptionsor conditions. The Company believes that the following critical accountingpolicy is subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of itsconsolidated financial statements:     The Company has goodwill and intangibleassets associated with business acquisitions. The Company reviews these assetsfor impairment annually and whenever an event occurs or circumstances changethat would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these assets belowtheir carrying value. If the fair value of these assets is less than theircarrying value, then an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the excessof the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.     Off Balance SheetArrangements     The Company has no off-balance sheetarrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or futureeffect on the Companys financial condition, changes in financial condition,revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures orcapital resources that are material to investors.     25            ContractualObligations and Commitments     The following table reflects scheduledmaturities of contractual obligations as of September 30, 2005, includingprincipal maturities on long-term debt and future minimum payments on operatingleases with terms of one year or more.
