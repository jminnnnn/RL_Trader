ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS          OF OPERATIONS  INTRODUCTION           Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains "forward-looking statements." See "Introductory Note" on page 1.           The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting (i) consolidated results of operations of the Company for Fiscal 2002 compared to Fiscal 2001, and Fiscal 2001 compared to Fiscal 2000, and (ii) financial liquidity and capital resources for Fiscal 2002. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein. Certain amounts presented in this Item 7 have been rounded to the nearest thousand and hundred thousand, as applicable, but the percentages are based on actual amounts without rounding.           The Company operates primarily in the beverage alcohol industry in the United States. The Company reports its operating results in five segments: Bulk Alcohol Products (citrus brandy, citrus spirits, rum, cane spirits, fortified citrus wine, purchased distilled products and byproducts); Premium Branded Spirits (primarily Cruzan Estate Rums and Cruzan Flavored Rums); Bottling Operations (contract bottling services and proprietary and private label products); Vinegar and Cooking Wine (bulk vinegar, bulk cooking wine, vinegar stock and proprietary and private label case goods); and Corporate Operations and Other (primarily corporate related items).           Information regarding net sales, operating income (loss) and total assets of each of the Company's business segments and information regarding geographic areas is set forth in Note 13 to the Company's consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.           The following tables set forth statement of income items as a percentage of net sales and information on net sales of certain Company products.

The Company's net sales and gross margins (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) vary depending on the mix of business among the Company's products. Historically, gross margins have been highest in bulk alcohol products and premium branded spirits and lower in bottling operations and vinegar and cooking wine operations. Within its bottling operations, sales and gross margins have varied substantially based upon the mix of business from the Company's "Type A" and "Type B" bottling customers. Type A bottling customers pay the Company to purchase their raw materials and these costs are passed through to the customer. Type B bottling customers supply their own raw materials and are only charged for bottling charges. Although gross profit per case for the Company's Type A and Type B bottling customers is approximately equal, given the same case volume, net sales and cost of goods sold with respect to products bottled for Type A bottling customers are higher, and gross margins are lower, than for Type B bottling customers. As a result, significant fluctuations in volume of Type A bottling customers can distort the Company's gross margin.           The size and timing of purchase orders and product shipments can cause operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, particularly since some customers purchase bulk alcohol products in significant quantities or place significant orders for contract bottling services, distilled spirits, vinegar and cooking wine. Additionally, some Company products generate higher profit margins than others, and changes in the Company's product mix will therefore cause gross margins to fluctuate. Certain aspects of the Company's business are also seasonal, with increased demand for the Company's contract bottling services from April to October and increased production of the Company's bulk alcohol products from November to June, corresponding to the Florida citrus-harvest. As a result of these factors, the Company's operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.           Net sales represent the Company's gross sales less excise taxes. Excise taxes are generally payable on products bottled by the Company. In addition, excise taxes are payable on sales of industrial alcohol to certain customers. Accordingly, excise taxes vary from period to period depending upon the Company's product and customer mix.                                         10   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FISCAL 2002 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001           NET SALES. Net sales were $99.8 million in 2002 and 2001.           Net sales of bulk alcohol products were $35.4 million in 2002, a decrease of 10.8% from net sales of $39.7 million in 2001. The decrease resulted primarily from decreased sales of citrus brandy, citrus spirits, rum and fortified wine. The Company's bulk alcohol product sales have declined primarily due to increased competition.           Net sales of premium branded spirits were $24.7 million in 2002, an increase of 33.2% from net sales of $18.5 million in 2001. In 2002, net sales of premium branded spirits included $1.9 million of bulk tequila sales and $1.5 million of new Cruzan ready-to-drink products. Bulk tequila sales represent the liquidation of inventory that was held to produce Porfidio tequila. During the third quarter of 2002, the Company introduced a new line of Cruzan products in the ready-to-drink category, sales of which are included in the Company's premium branded spirits segment. The Company sold approximately 134,000 cases of this new product, representing net sales of $1.5 million through September 30, 2002. Sales of the Company's Cruzan ready-to-drink products are highly seasonal and there can be no assurance that sales of these products will continue at this level in the future. In addition, due to more competition within the ready-to-drink product category, the gross margin on the Cruzan ready-to-drink products is lower than other premium branded spirits in this segment. The Company is repositioning its Cruzan ready-to-drink products for the 2003 spring/summer season and is pursuing opportunities in the export market. Excluding bulk tequila and Cruzan ready-to-drink product sales, net sales of premium branded spirits were $21.2 million in 2002, an increase of 20.1% from net sales of $17.6 million in 2001.           Sales of the Company's Cruzan Estate Rums and Cruzan Flavored Rums increased $0.8 million and $4.4 million, or 19.1% and 51.2%, respectively, in 2002 compared to 2001. These sales increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of Porfidio tequila. Sales of Porfidio tequila were $1.5 million in 2001. However, the decrease in sales of Porfidio tequila has not had a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations.           Net sales of the Company's bottling operations were $18.7 million in 2002, a decrease of 9.6% from net sales of $20.6 million in 2001. The unit volume of the Company's bottling operations decreased 12.2% in 2002 as a result of decreased business with a large bottling customer. In addition, during 2002 the Company lost a contract bottling customer that represented approximately 48% of its 2002 unit volume in bottling operations. Management believes that this loss in volume will be partially offset by increased business with new and existing customers and that total bottling operations volume may decline by approxiately 25% in 2003.           Net sales of vinegar and cooking wine were $21.0 million in 2002, an increase of 0.5% from net sales of $20.9 million in 2001.           GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit was $31.1 million in 2002, a decrease of 2.9% from gross profit of $32.1 million in 2001. Gross margin decreased to 31.2% in 2002 from 32.2% in 2001. The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to a change in product mix as the unit volume of higher margin bulk alcohol products declined.           SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $22.5 million in 2002, an increase of 9.8% from $20.5 million in 2001. Effective October 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 142, which requires that goodwill and certain other intangible assets no longer be amortized. There was no goodwill amortization in 2002 compared to $1.3 million in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization in 2001, selling, general and administrative expenses were $22.5 million in 2002, an increase of 17.1% from $19.2 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to increased selling, general and administrative expenses related to the Company's premium branded spirits business of $1.9 million, which included increased marketing expenses of $1.1 million and $0.3 million of non-recurring legal expenses, and increased corporate overhead of $1.0 million, which included increases in insurance, personnel costs and $0.4 million of non-recurring taxes and forfeitures related to the BATF settlement with respect to export shipments of bulk alcohol products (see Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements).           OPERATING INCOME. The following table sets forth the operating income (loss) by operating segment of the Company for 2002 and 2001 and the percent change for the periods.                                         11                                                           YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,                                                       ------------------------                                                         2002           2001          % CHANGE                                                         ----           ----          --------                                                           (IN THOUSANDS)        Bulk Alcohol Products                                 $   10,539    $   12,781        (17.5) Premium Branded Spirits                                     (331)         (840)           - Bottling Operations                                          129           221        (41.4) Vinegar and Cooking Wine                                   4,602         4,739         (2.9) Corporate Operations and Other                            (6,339)       (5,352)           -                                                       ------------------------                                                       $    8,600    $   11,549        (25.5)                                                       ========================   As a result of the above factors, operating income was $8.6 million in 2002, a decrease of 25.5% from operating income of $11.5 million in 2001.           The Company's premium branded spirits segment experienced operating losses of $331,000 in 2002 and $840,000 in 2001. The operating losses reflected the Company's continuing efforts to increase market share by reinvesting segment gross profits in selling and marketing expenses, as well as legal expenses and decreased sales of Porfidio tequila discussed above.           INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense was $3.1 million in 2002 and $4.8 million in 2001. The decrease in interest expense was due to a lower average debt level and lower interest rates during 2002 compared to 2001.           INCOME TAX EXPENSE. The Company's effective income tax rate was 17.1% in 2002 and 20.1% in 2001. The low tax rate was attributable to a 90% exemption of the Company's Virgin Islands subsidiary from U.S. Virgin Islands income taxes. The exemption is effective through September 2020 (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, in 2002 and 2001 the Company benefited from the new Extraterritorial Income Exclusion.  FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000           NET SALES. Net sales were $99.8 million in 2001, an increase of 7.3% from net sales of $93.0 million in 2000.           Net sales of bulk alcohol products were $39.7 million in 2001, an increase of 6.1% from net sales of $37.5 million in 2000. The increase resulted primarily from increased sales of wine products due to the Monarch Acquisition. Unit sales of citrus spirits decreased 9.9% and unit sales of wine products increased 6.7% in 2001 compared to 2000. These changes resulted from the Monarch Acquisition, as Monarch was a major purchaser of the Company's citrus spirits for use in producing fortified citrus wine.           Net sales of premium branded spirits were $18.5 million in 2001, an increase of 15.1% from net sales of $16.1 million in 2000. This increase reflected the continued success of the Company's Cruzan Estate Rums and Cruzan Flavored Rums. Sales of the Company's Cruzan Estate Rums and Cruzan Flavored Rums increased 13.8% and 59.6%, respectively, in 2001 compared to 2000. The strong sales increases in Cruzan Estate Rums and Cruzan Flavored Rums were partially offset by a decrease in sales of Porfidio tequila. As of September 30, 2001, the Company was out of stock of Porfidio tequila. The Company has not received a shipment of Porfidio tequila since March 2001, and cannot predict when or whether shipments of Porfidio will resume. During June 2001, Mexican regulatory authorities alleged that the Porfidio distillery violated certain regulations related to the sale of tequila and have prohibited the export of Porfidio tequila. The allegations have been denied by the Porfidio distillery. In addition, as a result of a trademark dispute with the Company, the producer of Antiqueno Aguardiente, one of the Company's premium branded spirits products, suspended shipments of the product to the Company in June 2001. Sales of the product amounted to $1.6 million in 2001. As of November 2001, the Company was out of stock of Antiqueno Aguardiente. The Company entered into a settlement agreement with the producer of Antiqueno Aguardiente in April 2002. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the Company has been reappointed exclusive U.S. importer of Antiqueno Aguardiente for a four-year period. The Company resumed sales of Antiqueno Aguardiente in June 2002. Management believes that the decreases in sales of Porfidio tequila and Antiqueno Aguardiente have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations.           Net sales of the Company's bottling operations were $20.6 million in 2001, an increase of 22.7% from net sales of $16.8 million in 2000. The unit volume of the Company's bottling operations increased 46.2% in 2001 as a result of a bottling contract with a new customer.           Net sales of vinegar and cooking wine were $20.9 million in 2001, an increase of 1.8% from net sales of $20.5 million in 2000.                                         12            GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit was $32.1 million in 2001, an increase of 11.1% from gross profit of $28.9 million in 2000. Gross margin increased to 32.2% in 2001 from 31.0% in 2000. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to a change in product mix as a result of the Monarch Acquisition.           SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $20.5 million in 2001, an increase of 15.5% from $17.8 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to (1) increased selling, administrative and marketing expenses related to the Company's premium branded spirits business, and (2) increased amortization expense.           OPERATING INCOME. The following table sets forth the operating income (loss) by operating segment of the Company for 2001 and 2000 and the percent change for the periods.

The Company's premium branded spirits segment experienced an operating loss of $840,000 in 2001 compared to operating income of $120,000 in 2000. The operating loss reflected the Company's continuing efforts to increase market share by reinvesting segment gross profits in selling and marketing expenses, as well as the decrease in sales of Porfidio tequila discussed above.           The Company's bottling operations segment reported operating income of $221,000 in 2001 compared to an operating loss of $1,022,000 in 2000. The swing to profitability reflected volume increases as a result of a new major bottling contract.           INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense was $4.9 million in 2001 and $5.1 million in 2000. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower interest rates during 2001 compared to 2000.           INCOME TAX EXPENSE. The Company's effective income tax rate was 20.1% in 2001 and 24.6% in 2000. The low tax rate was attributable to a 90% exemption of the Company's Virgin Islands subsidiary from U.S. Virgin Islands income taxes. The exemption is effective through September 2020 (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, in 2001 the Company benefited from the new Extraterritorial Income Exclusion.  FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  GENERAL           The Company's principal use of cash in its operating activities is for purchasing raw materials to be used in its manufacturing operations, purchasing imported products for its premium branded spirits business and carrying inventories and the subsequent receivables. The Company's source of liquidity has historically been cash flow from operations and its line of credit. Some of the Company's manufacturing operations are seasonal and the Company's borrowings on its line of credit vary during the year. For example, the Company uses citrus molasses as its primary raw material in the production of citrus brandy and spirits at its two Florida distilleries. The Company buys citrus                                         13   molasses, a byproduct of citrus juice production, from local manufacturers of citrus juice and concentrate during the citrus harvest, which generally runs from November to June. The Company generally begins purchasing citrus molasses in November and builds inventory of citrus brandy and spirits. The Company must manufacture and build inventory while raw materials are available due to the short life of the citrus molasses it purchases. Another seasonal business of the Company is its contract bottling services. Demand for contract bottling services is highest from April through October. Management believes that cash provided by its operating and financing activities will provide adequate resources to satisfy its working capital, liquidity and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both its short-term and long-term capital needs.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES           Net cash provided by operating activities in 2002 was $12.3 million, which resulted from $11.6 million in net income adjusted for noncash items, and a $0.7 million net change in operating assets and liabilities.  INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES           Net cash used in investing activities in 2002 was $0.7 million, including capital expenditures of $6.0 million partially offset by a net redemption of short-term investments of $5.1 million.           Net cash used in financing activities in 2002 was $3.2 million, which resulted primarily from a $1.5 million increase in borrowings under the revolving credit facility, offset by $4.2 million of payments on long-term debt and $.9 million in refinancing costs.           In October 2001, the Company's previous long-term debt and line of credit were replaced with a $70 million credit agreement between the Company and a syndicate of lenders. The current credit agreement consists of (1) a $30 million revolving credit facility which expires in October 2004, and (2) a term loan with an initial amount of $40 million which matures on September 30, 2006. See Note 9 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the Company's long-term debt.           The Company's bank debt was $56.5 million as of September 30, 2002, and its ratio of total debt to equity was 1.06 to 1.           The Company's share of the undistributed earnings of its Bahamian and Virgin Islands subsidiaries was approximately $7.5 million and $27.9 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2002. No provision has been made for taxes which would result from the remittance of such undistributed earnings, as the Company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely. See Note 10 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes related to these subsidiaries.           Based on current plans and business conditions, management expects that its cash and cash equivalents, together with any amounts generated from operations and available borrowings, will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES           The Company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company's consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes that the following critical accounting policy is subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:           The Company has goodwill and intangible assets associated with business acquisitions. The Company reviews these assets for impairment annually and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these assets below their carrying value. If the fair value of these assets                                         14   is less than their carrying value, then an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS           In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." This statement supersedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" and the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions." SFAS No. 144 retains the fundamental provisions of SFAS No. 121 but eliminates the requirement to allocate goodwill to long-lived assets to be tested for impairment. This statement also requires discontinued operations to be carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business. SFAS No. 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early application encouraged. The Company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.  RETIREMENT OF CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER           During November 2002, the Company announced the retirement of A. Kenneth Pincourt, Jr., its Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Company has entered into an agreement with Mr. Pincourt, setting forth the terms of his retirement. Under this agreement, the Company elected to accelerate retirement benefits and continue to pay compensation and provide related benefits through July 15, 2004. The Company will record a charge for these items during the first quarter of its 2003 fiscal year. The effect of this charge, net of income tax benefits, will be approximately $1 million or $.18 per common share. In addition, the Company's majority shareholder, Angostura, Ltd., has entered into an agreement with Mr. Pincourt to purchase 595,985 shares of common stock.  EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES           The Company's results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices. The Company has been able, subject to normal competitive conditions, to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices.  ITEM 7A.

The table above summarizes the Company's market risk associated with debt obligations as of September 30, 2002.           In the event of an adverse change in interest rates, management would likely take certain actions to further mitigate the Company's exposure. However, due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no such actions. The Company had no financial instruments or derivative financial instruments held for trading purposes as of September 30, 2002.                                         15            See Note 9 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for additional information related to Company's financing arrangements.
