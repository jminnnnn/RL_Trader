The Company also imports and markets beverage alcohol and produces vinegar, cooking wine and other alcohol-related products.      Prior to March 31, 1997, the Company classified its sales of bulk alcohol products and case goods spirits as beverage ingredients and popular price spirits, respectively.  The Company feels that the new terms for these lines of business are more meaningful to an understanding of the nature of its products.       BULK ALCOHOL PRODUCTS.  The Company distills citrus brandy, citrus and cane spirits and rum, produces fortified citrus wine, and sells these products to over 30 producers of beverage alcohol in the United States and other foreign countries.  The Company also sells bulk grain alcohol, primarily to export customers.  Grain alcohol is purchased from several suppliers located in the Midwest. Citrus brandy and spirits are distilled from citrus juice byproducts purchased from manufacturers of citrus juice concentrate. The Company's citrus brandy is used primarily as an ingredient in flavored brandies. Citrus spirits are used primarily as a fortifying ingredient to increase the alcohol content of the Company's citrus wine and the wine of other manufacturers. The Company's citrus wine is fermented from citrus juice and fortified to increase its alcohol content to approximately 20% by volume. Known as fortified citrus wine, this product is used primarily as an ingredient in cordials, whiskies and other beverage alcohol. Rum and cane spirits are distilled from sugar cane molasses and are sold to other bottlers of rum, producers of beverage alcohol, food companies and flavor manufacturers. Rum is also used in the Company's spirits line.       CASE GOODS SPIRITS.  The Company produces, bottles and sells a complete  line of spirits under its own proprietary labels and under the private labels  of major retailers of liquor located in the Southeast. These products  currently include rum, gin, vodka, tequila, cordials and various whiskies,  and the Company continues to add additional products to this line.  Since the  acquisition of the Virgin Islands operations in 1994, the Company also  produces and sells case goods spirits in the U.S. Virgin Islands under the  Cruzan Rum label. The Company's proprietary labels include Cruzan Estate  Rums, Cruzan Rums, Ron Carlos Rums, Conch Republic Rums and "James's Harbor"  (gin, rum and vodka). The Company distills its own rum, but generally  produces its other spirits from grain alcohol purchased from third parties.  Depending on the particular formula for a product, the Company adds flavoring  and/or sugar, reduces the product's proof and then filters and bottles the  finished product. Also, the Company began in 1996 to import and market Cruzan  Rum, Porfidio Tequila and several brands from the former Blair product line  which was discontinued in 1995. Management's strategy has been to focus on  marketing and building premium brands in its case goods spirits business with  an initial emphasis on the rum and tequila categories.        CONTRACT BOTTLING.  The Company bottles coolers, prepared cocktails and  other beverage alcohol on a contract basis for other producers. The Company  also bottles non-alcohol beverage on a contract basis including fruit juices,  carbonated and non-carbonated fruit flavored beverages, flavored sparkling  water and ready-to-drink brewed iced teas.      VINEGAR AND COOKING WINE.   To complement its distilling, winery and bottling operations, the Company produces vinegar and cooking wine for sale to condiment manufacturers, food service distributors and major retailers.  The Company's sales to retailers are sold under its own proprietary labels and under the private labels of major retailers in the Southeast.      During the quarter ended September 30, 1995, the Company discontinued the operations of Blair, sold substantially all of its assets, terminated its employees, closed its facilities and began liquidating its remaining assets. The Company acquired Blair in August 1994. At that time management believed that Blair would enhance the Company's national sales capabilities and provide an entry to the imported wine and spirits segment of the beverage alcohol market. However, beginning in January 1995, Blair incurred substantial operating losses. In 1995, the losses from Blair amounted to $10,740,124 (net of tax benefit of $935,883), including operating losses during the phase out period of $1,871,173. These losses resulted from, among other things, the failure to meet exaggerated sales and gross profit projections furnished to the Company, unrecorded liabilities, surplus inventories, and inadequate reserves for uncollectible receivables, all of which were uncovered subsequent to the acquisition. The Company is reserving all rights that it has to indemnification from the selling shareholders of Blair under the merger agreement relating to the acquisition. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 15 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for additional information on the discontinued operations.                                         10       The Company's net sales and gross margins (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) vary depending on the mix of business among the Company's products.  Historically, gross margins have been highest in bulk alcohol products and lower in case goods spirits, contract bottling, vinegar and cooking wine operations.  Within its contract bottling operations, sales and gross margins have varied substantially based upon the mix of business from the Company's "Type A" and "Type B" bottling customers.  Type A bottling customers pay the Company to purchase their raw materials and these costs are passed through to the customer. Type B bottling customers supply their own raw materials and are only charged for bottling charges.  Although gross profit per case for the Company's Type A and Type B bottling customers is approximately equal, given the same case volume, net sales and cost of goods sold with respect to products bottled for Type A bottling customers are higher, and gross margins are lower, than for Type B bottling customers.  As a result, significant fluctuations in volume of Type A bottling customers can distort the Company's gross margin.      The Company has a limited number of customers, and these customers often purchase bulk alcohol products in significant quantities or place significant orders for contract bottling services.  Accordingly, the size and timing of purchase orders and product shipments can cause operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.  Additionally, some Company products generate higher profit margins than others, and changes in the Company's product mix will cause gross margins to fluctuate.  Certain aspects of the Company's business are also seasonal, with increased demand for the Company's contract bottling services from April to October and increased production of the Company's bulk alcohol products during the months from October to June, corresponding to the Florida citrus-growing season.  As a result of these factors, the Company's operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter.      Net sales represent the Company's gross sales less excise taxes. Excise taxes are generally payable on products bottled by the Company.  In addition, excise taxes are payable on sales of industrial alcohol to certain customers.  Accordingly, excise taxes vary from period to period depending upon the Company's product and customer mix.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS      In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 128, "Earnings per Share" (EPS), which simplifies existing computational guidelines, revises disclosure requirements, and increases the comparability of earnings per share on an international basis.  Management does not believe there will be a material effect on the Company's EPS, based on the application of this pronouncement.  SFAS No. 128 is effective for periods ending after December 15, 1997 and requires restatement of all prior period EPS data presented.  The Company will adopt SFAS No. 128 in its first quarter of fiscal year 1998.      In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," which changes the way public companies report information about operating segments. SFAS No. 131, which is based on the management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers, and the material countries in which the entity holds assets and reports revenue.  Management has not yet evaluated the effects of these changes on its reporting of segment information.  The Company will adopt SFAS No. 131 in its fiscal year 1999.  YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE      Management has initiated a program to prepare the Company's information systems for the year 2000, and to upgrade its information systems generally.  The Company is assessing the impact of the year 2000 issue on its operations, including the extent and cost of programming changes required to address this issue.  At the present time, it is not expected that the costs to prepare the Company's information systems for the year 2000 will have any material adverse impact on the Company's liquidity or results of operations.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS      Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains, among other things, information regarding revenue growth, expenditure levels and plans for development. These statements could be considered forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The following is a                                         11   list of factors, among others, that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements; business conditions and growth in certain market segments and industries and the general economy; competitive factors including increased competition and price pressures; availability of third party component products at reasonable prices; excise taxes; foreign currency exposure; changes in product mix; lower than expected customer orders and quarterly seasonal fluctuation of those orders; and product shipment interruptions.   Amounts presented in this Item 7 have generally been rounded to the nearest thousand and hundred thousand, as applicable, but the percentages calculated are based on actual amounts without rounding.  FISCAL 1997 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1996      NET SALES.  Net sales were $77.9 million in 1997, a decrease of .3% from net sales of $78.2 million in 1996.      Net sales of bulk alcohol products were $29.7 million in 1997, an increase of 1.1% from net sales of $29.4 million in 1996.  Bulk alcohol products produced by the Company include citrus brandy, citrus and cane spirits, rum and fortified citrus wine.  The Company also buys grain alcohol which it resells, primarily to export customers.  Unit sales of citrus brandy decreased 6.1% in 1997 and 3.9% in 1996.  The Company's citrus brandy is used primarily as an ingredient in flavored brandies.  Unit sales of citrus brandy have declined as a result of a decline in demand for brandy products which management believes is due to changing demographics.  Management expects this trend to continue in the future. Unit sales of citrus spirits increased 21.8% in 1997 and 29.8% in 1996.  Citrus spirits are used primarily as a fortifying ingredient to increase the alcohol content of citrus wine.  The increase in sales of citrus spirits was primarily due to increases in sales to other manufacturers of fortified citrus wine.  Unit sales of cane spirits increased 6.6% in 1997 after a 5.1% decrease in 1996.  Cane spirits are sold to flavor manufacturers.  Unit sales of rum decreased 4.0% in 1997 after a 4.6% increase in 1996.  The fluctuations in rum shipments are attributable to the timing of customer orders.  Unit sales of grain alcohol increased 73.3% in 1997 and 108.0% in 1996.  Grain alcohol is purchased from several suppliers located in the Midwest and resold primarily to export customers, the largest of which are in Eastern Europe and Russia.  Unit sales of fortified citrus wine decreased 9.7% in 1997 after an increase of  11.2% in 1996.  Fortified citrus wine is used as an ingredient in cordials, whiskies and other beverage alcohol.  Shipments of fortified citrus wine decreased in 1997 due to weak demand for certain products of one of the Company's largest wine customers as well as increased competition from other wine manufacturers.      Net sales of case goods spirits were $20.0 million in 1997, an increase of 21.9% from net sales of $16.4 million in 1996.  Beginning in 1996, management's strategy has been to focus on marketing and building premium brands in its case goods spirits business with an initial emphasis on the rum and tequila categories.  However, the Company experienced a volume decrease in unit sales of case goods spirits of 5.3% in 1997.  The volume decrease in case goods spirits is attributable to the value-priced and private label component of this category which has a lower gross margin.  The decrease in volume of value-priced and private label business was partially offset by an increase in the Company's premium Cruzan Rum business as well as an increase in super premium tequila.  The change in product mix in this category resulted in an increase in the average price per case of 28.6% in 1997.        Net sales of contract bottling services were $13.1 million in 1997, a decrease of 32.1% from net sales of $19.3 million in 1996.  The Company's contract bottling volume decreased 10.8% in 1997 after increasing 1.0% in 1996.  The decrease in volume is primarily attributable to a decrease in business with one of the Company's largest bottling customers.  The Company continues to provide a significant amount of contract bottling services to this customer even as this customer continues with its plan to transfer production to its own facility.  The Company also experienced a decrease in contract bottling services to export customers, primarily in Eastern Europe and Russia, as these customers increased their purchases of bulk grain alcohol.  The decreases in contract bottling volume discussed above were partially offset by increased volume with existing and new customers.      Net sales of vinegar and cooking wine were $9.4 million in 1997, an increase of 23.3% from net sales of $7.6 million in 1996.  The increase in net sales of vinegar and cooking wine was due to increased manufacturing efficiencies, new customers and an improved product mix.      GROSS PROFIT.  Gross profit was $21.4 million in 1997, an increase of 8.5 % from gross profit of $19.8 million in 1996.  Gross margin increased to 27.5% in 1997 from 25.3% in 1996.  The improvement in gross margin is primarily attributable to increased gross margins of the Company's bulk rum products in the Virgin Islands, reduced raw material costs in the Company's domestic distilling operations  and a decrease in contract bottling volume with a large Type A bottling customer.                                         12         SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $13.1 million in 1997, an increase of 14.3% from $11.5 million in 1996.  Selling, general  and administrative expenses were 16.8% of net sales in 1997 and 14.7% in 1996.  The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 1997 is primarily attributable to the Company's increased emphasis on marketing its premium brands and imported products and legal fees relating to the lawsuit against the former Blair stockholders.  See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.      INTEREST EXPENSE.  Interest expense was $4.1 million in 1997 and $4.4 million in 1996.  The decrease in interest expense was due to lower levels of debt outstanding during 1997.      INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME.  Interest income decreased to $.8 million in 1997 from $1.0 million in 1996 due to lower levels of cash, cash equivalents and notes receivable.  The notes receivable relate primarily to the sale of assets in the Bahamas and the discontinued operations.  Also included in other income is rental income from the Bahamian subsidiary and a gain of $.25 million in 1997 and $.15 million in 1996 relating to insured hurricane damage.      INCOME TAX EXPENSE.  The Company's effective income tax rate was 21% in 1997 and 1996.  The low tax rate is attributable to the Virgin Islands operations which has a 90% exemption from income taxes.  FISCAL 1996 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1995      NET SALES.  Net Sales were $78.2 million in 1996, an 11% increase from net sales of $70.2 million in 1995.       Net sales of bulk alcohol products increased 14% in 1996 due to volume increases in both distilled products and fortified citrus wine. Distilled products volume increased 16% and fortified citrus wine volume increased 11%. The increase in distilled products volume was due to a 108% increase in export sales of grain alcohol, a 5% increase in sales of rum, and a 37% increase in sales of citrus spirits. These increases  were offset by a 6% decrease in sales of citrus brandy. The increase in citrus wine volume was due to increased sales to new and existing customers. The average unit price for distilled products decreased 2% due to the increase in export sales of grain alcohol which have a lower unit price than other distilled products. The average unit price for fortified citrus wine increased 3%.       Net sales of case goods spirits increased 28%. The increase in net sales was due to the Company's new business of importing and marketing branded beverage alcohol, including its own Cruzan Rum. Net sales of case goods spirits without the branded beverages decreased 9%. The decrease was due to soft demand in the Southeast and a decrease in tourism in the Virgin Islands.       In the Company's contract bottling operations, net sales decreased 3%. The net decrease in sales was due to the loss of a Type A bottling customer which was partially offset by increases in sales to new and existing customers.        Net sales of vinegar and cooking wine increased 47%.  The increase in net sales was due to the construction of a new facility in Kentucky which began shipping vinegar at the end of 1995.       GROSS PROFIT.  Gross profit in 1996 was $19.8 million compared to $15.6 million in 1995.  Gross margin increased to 25.3% in 1996 from 22.3% in 1995.  The increase in gross margin was due to improved margins for most of the Company's products as well as a change in product and customer mix.       SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  Selling, general and administrative expenses in 1996 were $11.5 million compared to $11.6 million in 1995, and as a percentage of net sales, were 14.7% in 1996 compared to 16.6% in 1995.  Selling, general and administrative expenses in 1996 increased $1.5 million due to marketing expenses related to the new business of importing and marketing branded beverage alcohol.  This increase was offset by the fact that $1.6 million of selling, general and administrative expenses in 1995 were  non-recurring professional fees, litigation costs and write-offs of  intangibles and bad debts.       INTEREST EXPENSE.  The Company's total interest expense decreased in 1996 by approximately $767,000 due to the Company paying down debt and entering into an interest rate swap on the Company's bank note in the Virgin Islands which reduced the Company's interest rate to a fixed rate of 8.46% from prime plus one.  However, due to the Company allocating approximately $1,102,000 of interest expense from continuing operations to discontinued operations in 1995, interest expense from continuing operations increased approximately $336,000 in 1996.                                         13       INCOME TAX EXPENSE.  The Company's effective income tax rate was 21% in 1996 and 105% in 1995.  The low tax rate in 1996 is due to income from the Virgin Islands operations which has a 90% exemption from income taxes. In 1995, the Company incurred additional income tax expense from the repatriation of previously undistributed earnings of its Bahamian subsidiary.       EXTRAORDINARY ITEM.  During 1995, the Company recognized an extraordinary loss of $467,862, net of income tax benefit of $251,927 on its early extinguishment of debt.  This loss relates to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs due to the refinancing of long-term debt.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES                                       YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,                                      ------------------------                                  1997         1996           1995                                  ----         ----           ----                                           (in thousands)       Working capital            $31,640      $33,517         $35,435     Cash and cash investments    4,905        7,089           6,585     Capital expenditures         3,775        4,902           7,156     Total debt                  46,073       53,445          60,023     Cash provided by (used in)        operating activities       7,613       10,633          (2,046)     Cash provided by (used in)       investing activities       1,912       (3,500)        (10,643)     Cash provided by (used in)        financing activities      (7,214)      (6,539)          7,744       Working capital decreased in both 1997 and 1996.  In 1996, the decrease was primarily due to the discontinued operations of Blair and the use of net operating losses which reduced deferred income tax assets.  In 1997, the  decrease was primarily due to the Company using excess cash and cash investments to pay down debt and the use of net operating losses which reduced deferred income tax assets.  Although working capital decreased in 1997 and 1996 as described above, receivables and inventories relating to the Company's case goods spirits, distilling (bulk alcohol products) and vinegar businesses increased.  Within the Company's case goods spirits business, inventory of value-priced case goods decreased while inventory of the Company's premium brands increased.  The changes in inventory of case goods spirits relate to increases in sales of the Company's premium brands, the introduction of new premium brands and a decrease in value-priced and private label business.  Inventory of distilled bulk alcohol products increased due to increased production and relatively flat sales.  Inventory in the vinegar operations increased due to increased capacity and sales.      In 1997, the Company's cash from operating activities was lower than in 1996, due to the liquidation of the assets of discontinued operations in 1996.  In 1996, cash from operating activities was higher than in 1995, due to a net loss from discontinued operations in 1995.      Cash used in investing activities, exclusive of purchases and redemptions of certificates of deposit, decreased in 1997 and 1996 from the corresponding prior year periods due to reduced capital expenditures.      Cash used in financing activities increased in 1997 and 1996 from the corresponding prior year periods due to the Company paying down debt with cash from operations and cash investments.      At September 30, 1997, the Company had an unsecured bank line of credit of $20,000,000, which expires November 1, 1999.  The first $5 million of borrowings bear interest at 1.5% above the one-month LIBOR rate, borrowings in excess of $5 million bear interest at the prime rate.  The borrowings under this line were $4,246,947 at September 30, 1997.  The amount which can be borrowed on the line is based on the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement.  The agreement requires the Company to maintain a tangible net worth, as defined, a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge, interest coverage and current ratio.  In addition, the agreement prohibits the payment of cash dividends.  The Company was in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 1997.      The Company's total debt was $46.1 million as of September 30, 1997, and its ratio of debt to equity was 1.3 to 1.                                          14       The Company has operated in the Bahamas since 1964. Under Bahamian law, the Company pays no taxes on the profits from these operations, and such profits have generally been retained in the Bahamas. In addition, the Company has generally not paid United States federal income taxes on such profits. Repatriation of these profits could result in a significant United States federal income tax liability to the Company (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).       Based on current plans and business conditions, management expects that its cash and cash equivalents, together with any amounts generated from operations and available borrowings, will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.
