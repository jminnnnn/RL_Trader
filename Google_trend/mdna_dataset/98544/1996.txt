ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      The following tables set forth certain income statement items as a percentage of net sales, and certain information on net sales in each of the Company's operating categories.

The Company also imports and distributes alcoholic beverages throughout the United States and produces vinegar, cooking wine and certain other alcohol related products.      Beverage ingredients produced by the Company include fortified citrus wine, citrus brandy, citrus and cane spirits and rum. Also included in this category is grain alcohol which the Company buys in bulk and resells as bulk or packaged grain alcohol. Overall unit sales of beverage ingredients increased approximately 14% in 1996. Unit sales of rum have increased since 1994 due to the acquisition of the Company's Virgin Islands operations in February 1994. The Company expanded the production capacity of the Virgin Islands facility by 40% during 1995 and has shifted a substantial part of its domestic rum production offshore in                                         9  order to capitalize on the lower raw material costs available in the Virgin Islands. Unit sales of fortified citrus wine have increased substantially in 1995 and 1996 primarily due to increased sales to one of the Company's largest wine customers due to management's decision to expand geographically by acquiring the Louisville, Kentucky facility in December 1993. Unit sales of citrus brandy decreased 6% in 1996. Sales of citrus brandy have declined as a result of a decline in demand for brandy products which management believes is due to changing demographics. Management expects this trend to continue in the future.      Popular price spirits produced by the Company are distributed under the Company's proprietary labels and those of major retailers of liquor in the Southeast and include rum, vodka, gin, cordials, brandies and whiskies. Since the acquisition of the Virgin Islands operations in February 1994, the Company also produces and sells popular price spirits in the U. S. Virgin Islands. The Company is importing, marketing and distributing a limited number of alcoholic beverages from the former Blair product line in the United States. During 1995 and the first three quarters of 1996 the Company's popular price products experienced a decrease in profit margins due to increased costs of raw materials which the Company elected to absorb in order to maintain market share. During the fourth quarter of 1996 the cost of raw materials decreased and the Company was able to increase prices.      The Company's contract bottling operations consist primarily of bottling coolers, prepared cocktails and other non-alcoholic beverages. The Company's contract bottling volume decreased in 1995 due to the loss of certain bottling customers and some bottling customers discontinuing products. In addition, one of the Company's largest bottling customers decreased its orders for bottling services in accordance with its plan to transfer production to its own facility. The Company continues to provide a significant amount of contract bottling services to this customer. The underutilization of the Company's bottling facilities has significantly impacted the Company's profitability due to its high overhead costs. During 1995, management reduced labor and overhead costs in an effort to return this division to profitability. The Company's contract bottling volume increased slightly in 1996. While contract bottling volume to the Company's significant bottling customers was down slightly, this was offset by the addition of new customers and new business with an existing customer. Management is actively seeking to utilize its remaining capacity by bottling additional types of beverages and through expansion in the territories it serves.      During the quarter ended September 30, 1995, the Company discontinued the operations of Blair, sold substantially all of its assets, terminated its employees, closed its facilities and began liquidating its remaining assets. The Company acquired Blair in August 1994. At that time management believed that Blair would enhance the Company's national sales capabilities and provide an entry to the imported wine and spirits segment of the alcohol beverage market. However, beginning in January 1995, Blair incurred substantial operating losses. In 1995, the losses from Blair amounted to $10,740,124 (net of tax benefit of $935,883), including operating losses during the phase out period of $1,871,173. These losses resulted from, among other things, the failure to meet exaggerated sales and gross profit projections furnished to the Company, certain unrecorded liabilities, surplus inventories, and inadequate reserves for uncollectible receivables, all of which were uncovered subsequent to the acquisition. The Company is reserving all rights that it has to indemnification from the selling shareholders of Blair under the Merger Agreement relating to the acquisition. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.      The Company's net sales and gross margins (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) vary depending on the mix of business among the Company's product lines. Historically, gross margins have been highest in beverage ingredients and lower in popular price, contract bottling and vinegar and cooking wine operations. Within its contract bottling operations, sales and gross margins have varied substantially based upon the mix of business from the Company's largest bottling customers. Although gross profit per case for the Company's bottling customers are approximately equal, some customers pay the Company to purchase all raw materials. As a result, net sales and cost of goods sold with respect to products bottled for these customers are higher, and gross margins are lower, than for other bottling customers which supply their own raw materials.                                         10      Net sales represent the Company's gross sales less excise taxes. Excise taxes are generally payable on products bottled by the Company. In addition, excise taxes are payable on sales of industrial alcohol to certain customers. Accordingly, excise taxes vary from period to period depending upon the Company's product and customer mix.  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS      Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains, among other things, information regarding revenue growth, expenditure levels and plans for development. These statements could be considered forward looking statements that involve a nunber of risks and uncertainties. The following is a list of factors, among others, that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements; business conditions and growth in certain market segments and industries and the general economy; competitive factors including increased competition and price pressures; availability of third party component products at reasonable prices; excise taxes; foreign currency exposure; changes in product mix between and among product lines; lower than expected customer orders and quarterly seasonal fluctuation of those orders; and product shipment interruptions.      The following discussion relates to the results of continuing operations.  FISCAL 1996 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1995      NET SALES.  Net Sales for the year ended September 30, 1996, were $78.2 million, an 11% increase when compared to net sales of $70.2 million for the year ended September 30, 1995.      Beverage Ingredients net sales increased 14% during fiscal 1996 due to volume increases in both distilled products and fortified citrus wine. Distilled products volume increased 16% and fortified citrus wine volume increased 11%. The increase in distilled products volume was due to a 108% increase in export sales of grain alcohol, a 5% increase in sales of rum, and a 37% increase in sales of citrus spirits. These increases were offset by a 6% decrease in sales of citrus brandy. The increase in citrus wine volume is due to increased sales to new and existing customers. The average unit price for distilled products decreased 2% due to the increase in export sales of grain alcohol which have a lower unit price than other distilled products. The average unit price for fortified citrus wine increased 3%.      Net sales of popular price spirits increased 28%. The increase in net sales is due to the Company's new business of importing, marketing and distributing branded alcoholic beverages, including its own Cruzan Rum. Net sales of popular price spirits without the branded beverages decreased 9%. The decrease was due to soft demand in the Southeast and a decrease in tourism in the Virgin Islands.      In the Company's contract bottling operations, net sales decreased 3%. The net decrease in sales was due to the loss of a bottling customer for which the company purchased all raw materials which was partially offset by increases in sales to new and existing customers.      Net sales of vinegar and cooking wine increased 47%. The increase in net sales was due to the construction of a new facility in Kentucky which began shipping vinegar at the end of fiscal 1995.      GROSS PROFIT.  Gross profit for fiscal 1996 was $19.8 million compared to $15.6 million for fiscal 1995. Gross margin increased to 25.3% for fiscal 1996 from 22.3% for fiscal 1995. The increase in gross margin is due to improved margins for most of the Company's products as well as a change in product and customer mix.      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 1996 were $11.5 million compared to $11.6 million for fiscal 1995, and as a percentage of net sales, were 14.7% in fiscal 1996 compared to 16.6% in fiscal 1995. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 1996 increased $1.5 million due to marketing expenses related to the new business of importing, marketing and distributing branded alcoholic beverages. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 1995 included $1.6 million of non recurring professional fees, litigation costs and write-offs of intangibles and bad debts.                                         11      INTEREST EXPENSE.  The net increase in interest expense was approximately $336,000 for fiscal 1996 compared to fiscal 1995. Interest expense decreased for fiscal 1996 by approximately $767,000 due to a combination of the Company paying down debt during the year and entering into an interest rate swap on the Company's bank note in the Virgin Islands which reduced the Company's interest rate to a fixed rate of 8.46% from prime plus one. During fiscal 1995 the Company allocated approximately $1,102,000 of interest expense from continuing operations to discontinued operations.      INCOME TAX EXPENSE.  The Company's effective income tax rate was 21% for fiscal 1996 and 105% for fiscal 1995. The low tax rate in 1996 is due to income from the Virgin Islands operations which has a 90% exemption from income taxes. In 1995, the Company incurred additional income tax expense from the repatriation of previously undistributed earnings of its Bahamian subsidiary.  FISCAL 1995 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1994      NET SALES.  Net sales for the year ended September 30, 1995 were $70.2 million, a 4% decrease when compared to net sales of $73.3 million for the year ended September 30, 1994. Beverage ingredients net sales increased 13% during fiscal 1995. Distilled products volume increased 17% and fortified citrus wine volume increased 14%. The distilled products volume increase was due to a 55% increase in rum volume from the Virgin Islands operations acquired on February 4, 1994, which was partially offset by a 10% decrease in citrus brandy volume. Net sales of popular price spirits increased 7% due to a 5% increase in cases sold and a 2% increase in the average price per case. In the Company's contract bottling operations, net sales decreased 12% due primarily to a 10% decrease in the number of cases bottled. The primary reason for the lower amount of net sales in fiscal 1995 was the sale of the Bahamian liquor operations in August 1994. Net sales from those operations were approximately $6.1 million in fiscal 1994.      GROSS PROFIT.  Gross profit for fiscal 1995 was $15.6 million compared to $17.3 million for fiscal 1994. Gross margin decreased to 22.3% for fiscal 1995 from 23.7% for fiscal 1994. The decrease was due to a reduction in the Company's gross margin on popular price spirits of approximately 10% and a reduction in gross margin on contract bottling of approximately 4%.      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 1995 were $11.6 million, compared to $9.6 million in the prior year and, as a percentage of net sales, were 16.6% in fiscal 1995 compared to 13.1% in fiscal 1994. The dollar increase was due to several factors, the more significant of which are as follows: an additional four months of expenses from the Virgin Islands operations ($.6 million), corporate office salaries and professional fees ($.5 million), litigation costs ($.5 million), and write-offs of intangibles and bad debts ($.6 million). These increases were offset in part by a decrease in the selling, general and administrative expenses of the Bahamian operations ($.7 million) due to the sale of the Bahamian liquor operation.      INTEREST EXPENSE.  Interest expense increased approximately $1,472,000 during fiscal 1995 compared to the prior year due primarily to the additional indebtedness incurred on the Company's acquisitions during fiscal 1994 and to finance property and equipment additions. Also, the Company refinanced a major portion of its debt during November 1994.      INCOME TAX EXPENSE.  The Company's income tax expense for the year ended September 30, 1995 was affected by several factors. The Company's U.S. operations incurred a net operating loss of approximately $6.0 million but incurred additional income tax expense from the repatriation of previously undistributed earnings of the Bahamian subsidiary and for the earnings of the Virgin Islands operations. The Company has a 90% exemption from income taxes on the income of the Virgin Islands operations.                                         12  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      The Company's net cash provided by operating activities was $10.6 million for fiscal 1996 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $2.0 million in fiscal 1995. The largest components of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities are summarized as follows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1996 and 1995:                                                                                   1996            1995                                                                            -------------  --------------      Net income (loss)........................................................  $   4,544,798  $  (11,263,482) Adjustments to net income (loss):   Depreciation and amortization..........................................      4,048,125       4,712,291   Loss on impairment of assets...........................................       --             4,466,478   Deferred income taxes..................................................      1,056,000        (328,000) Change in operating assets and liabilities...............................

The net loss in fiscal 1995 included a loss from discontinued operations of $10.7 million, an extraordinary item of $.5 million relating to the early extinguishment of debt and approximately $.9 million in additional income tax expense due to the repatriation of $2.5 million of previously undistributed earnings of the Bahamian subsidiary.      The Company incurred higher amortization expense in fiscal 1995 due to a significant increase in intangibles relating to the acquisition of Blair in 1994. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995, when the operations of Blair were discontinued, the Company recorded a loss on impairment of assets relating to these intangibles.      In fiscal 1996 the Company's deferred income tax assets decreased due to its use of a portion of its net operating loss carryforward and the recognition, for tax purposes, of certain expenses of the discontinued operations. This resulted in $1,056,000 of deferred income tax expense. In fiscal 1995, when the Company incurred the net operating loss, the Company recorded a net deferred income tax benefit of $328,000.      In fiscal 1996, the Company's operating assets and liabilities increased $1,713,207. This increase relates to the Company's overall increase in sales and unit volume. In fiscal 1995, the Company's operating assets and liabilities decreased $2,905,350 due to classifying the assets and liabilities of Blair as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations.      The net assets of the discontinued operations at the end of fiscal 1995 were $2,853,063. During fiscal 1996, the Company liquidated most of these assets and liabilities and as of September 30, 1996 the net assets of discontinued operations were $124,786.      Net cash used in investing activities was $3.5 million for fiscal 1996 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $10.6 million during fiscal 1995.      During fiscal 1996, the Company received $1.6 million from payments on notes receivable and purchased $4.9 million of property and equipment. During fiscal 1995, the Company received $.9 million from payments on notes receivable, purchased $7.2 million of property and equipment and purchased $4.6 million of certificates of deposit.      During fiscal 1996 the Company's net cash used in financing activities was $6.5 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $7.7 million in fiscal 1995. During fiscal 1996 the Company reduced its line of credit by $4.1 million and paid down long-term debt by $2.5 million. During fiscal 1995 the Company increased borrowings on its line of credit by $10.1 million, received proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock of $.2 million, paid down its long-term debt by $2.1 million and paid $.5 million of loan closing costs.                                         13      The Company's long-term debt was $53.4 million as of September 30, 1996, and its ratio of long-term debt to equity was 1.7 to 1.      The Company has operated in the Bahamas since 1964. Under Bahamian law, the Company pays no taxes on the profits from these operations, and such profits have generally been retained in the Bahamas, including a portion which has been invested in real estate.
