ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (“MD&A”).     This MD&A section discusses our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, risk management practices, critical accounting policies, and estimates and certain factors that may affect our future results, including economic and industry-wide factors. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A above.        EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  RadioShack is a leading national retailer of mobile technology products and services, as well as products related to personal and home technology and power supply needs. RadioShack’s mobile technology products and services include wireless services from all major national carriers. Each U.S. RadioShack company-operated store and wireless kiosk offers services from at least three major national carriers.     We have two reportable segments, U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores and kiosks. The U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores segment consists solely of our 4,486 U.S. company-operated retail stores, all operating under the RadioShack brand name in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores offer a broad selection of relevant technology products, including innovative mobile devices, accessories, and services, as well as items for personal and home technology and power supply needs. The kiosks segment consists of our network of 1,267 kiosks located throughout the United States. These kiosks, which are not RadioShack-branded, are primarily located in Target and Sam’s Club store locations. Our kiosk locations offer a wide selection of mobile phones, accessories and related services. Our other operations include business activities that are not separately reportable, which include sales to our independent dealers, sales to other third parties through our service centers, sales generated by our www.radioshack.com website and our Mexican subsidiary, sales to commercial customers, and sales to other third parties through our global sourcing and manufacturing operations.     Our more than 7,100 locations in the U.S. and Mexico give us a unique competitive advantage in scale, reach and convenience. We strive to differentiate ourselves through an appealing store format, a comfortable store size, a carefully tailored product assortment, and knowledgeable sales experts.     We believe RadioShack occupies unique advantages in the consumer electronics marketplace, providing an alternative to big box retailers:         ·      We offer a broad selection of relevant technology products, including innovative mobile devices, accessories, and services, as well as items for personal and home technology and power supply needs. Our lineup features leading national brands and wireless carriers, as well as exclusive private brands.            ·      We continue to capitalize on the growth of wireless communications and consumer demand for customer-friendly wireless service plans and devices; our mobility assortment has been and will continue to be priced aggressively and is fully competitive with that of any alternative retailer or carrier.            ·      We believe we have sufficient financial strength.            ·      We believe we are efficient operators and are a high-margin operation with a proven culture of cost control.            ·      We have highly trained sales experts who offer friendly and personal service within an inviting, easy-to-shop store environment.        As with most other specialty retailers, our net sales and operating revenues, operating income and operating cash flows are greater during the fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the United States and Mexico.     External Factors Affecting Our Business  Since the fourth quarter of 2008 we have seen a highly challenging economy and muted consumer spending. However, the consumer electronics industry, particularly the mobile phone industry, has experienced attractive growth rates over the past several years, driven by product innovations and new services. The growth in mobile phones has been driven by growth in both the number of wireless subscribers and an increase in smartphones, which represent the latest in mobile phone technology.     A smartphone is a mobile phone that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a basic feature wireless phone. Smartphones typically combine mobile phone capabilities with capabilities previously found on separate devices. Some examples include GPS (global positioning system) navigation, memory players and camera capabilities. We believe this convergence of capabilities into smartphones has contributed to a decline in several other product categories. This convergence trend is likely to continue as smartphones evolve and as more consumers adopt smartphone technology.                19                  According to the Consumer Electronics Association (“CEA”), sales of consumer electronics are expected to remain strong, growing by more than 3% in 2011 to $186.4 billion due to the continued adoption of more portable digital products. In 2011, the CEA estimates that smartphone revenues will increase nearly 20% to more than $21 billion.     The innovation in certain mature consumer electronic product categories, such as DVD players, camcorders and audio products, has not been sufficient to maintain average selling prices. These mature products have become commoditized and have experienced price declines and reduced margins.     Business Strategy and Performance  Our business strategy is focused around three specific goals:         ·      Strengthen our financial position and flexibility            ·      Improve the quality of our operations, especially customer service            ·      Strengthen our product offering and revitalize and contemporize our brand        By taking a disciplined approach to cost control and focusing on profitable sales and the strength of our balance sheet, we have been able to make substantial progress toward all three goals.     Over the past four years, we improved our margins, returned excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases, and controlled our costs. At the same time, we continued to make operational improvements that reinforced our strategic themes of mobility, innovation, and service. In the third quarter of 2009, we added T-Mobile as a third national wireless carrier to our RadioShack-branded stores, positioning us to meet our customers’ desire for multi-carrier options and to develop more aggressively our position in the wireless market. In addition, we launched our new brand platform – The Shack ®  – that began to capture the attention of consumers and the marketplace.     We have continued to invest in strategic initiatives to drive our long-term success, including:         ·      Growing our wireless business by taking advantage of our multiple wireless carrier retail position, the strong product growth cycle, and the growth in penetration of smartphones            ·      Strengthening the offering in our non-wireless product platforms by improving our merchandising talent, transitioning to a more productive product assortment, adding more national brands, and increasing exposure of these categories in targeted advertising and marketing            ·      Maximizing our dealer and franchise operations by increasing our wireless offerings through these channels and developing a consistent brand experience            ·      Partnering with other retailers – such as Target – to provide wireless service offerings in their stores            ·      Improving our use of real estate and taking advantage of the current commercial real estate market by reevaluating our leases for improved terms or reduced costs            ·      Developing our international growth opportunities through our company-owned stores in Mexico        As previously disclosed, in February 2009 we signed a contract extension with Sam’s Club through March 31, 2011, with a transition period ending June 30, 2011, to continue operating wireless kiosks in certain Sam’s Club stores. As of December 31, 2010, we operated 417 of these kiosks. Accordingly, this transition will begin on April 1, 2011, and conclude on June 30, 2011, with the assignment to Sam’s Club of all kiosks operated by the Company in Sam’s Club stores.     In the third quarter of 2010 the Company signed a multi-year agreement with Target Corporation to operate wireless kiosks in certain Target stores. In August 2010, we began to roll out Target Mobile kiosks, with the objective of operating kiosks in the majority of Target stores nationwide by mid-2011.  As of December 31, 2010, the Company operated 850 Target Mobile kiosks, and it expects to operate kiosks in approximately 1,450 Target stores by June 30, 2011.     Thus, the Sam’s Club transition coincides with the expansion of our kiosk program with Target. We expect a decline in kiosks segment operating income -- reflecting the impact of ramping up the new Target Mobile kiosks and eliminating the Sam’s Club kiosks -- of approximately $10 million to $15 million in full-year 2011 compared to full-year 2010, with growth in kiosks segment operating income expected to resume in 2012 following completion of the Target Mobile kiosk rollout.                20                    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     2010 Summary  Net sales and operating revenues increased $196.7 million, or 4.6%, to $4,472.7 million when compared with last year. Comparable store sales increased 4.4%. This increase was driven by increased sales in our Sprint and AT&T postpaid wireless business, increased sales of prepaid wireless handsets and airtime, and increased sales of wireless accessories. These increases were partially offset by sales declines in digital-to-analog converter boxes, GPS products, netbooks, digital televisions and digital cameras. The inclusion of T-Mobile as a postpaid wireless carrier increased sales for the first nine months of 2010; however, T-Mobile sales decreased in the fourth quarter, when compared to the same period last year.     Gross margin decreased by 90 basis points from last year to 45.0%. Gross margin declined primarily due to a higher sales mix of lower margin wireless handsets and incremental promotional and clearance markdowns associated with seasonal sell-through and product transitions in non-wireless platforms.     Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense increased $46.8 million when compared with last year. This increase was driven by incentive compensation paid on increased wireless sales, additional employees to support our Target kiosk locations, and incremental advertising expense related to brand building in the second quarter of 2010. As a percentage of net sales and operating revenues, SG&A decreased by 50 basis points to 34.8%.     As a result of the factors above, operating income increased $6.0 million, or 1.6%, to $375.4 million when compared with last year.     Net income increased $1.1 million to $206.1 million when compared with last year. Net income per diluted share was $1.68 compared with $1.63 last year.     Adjusted EBITDA decreased $2.7 million, or 0.6%, to $459.6 million when compared with last year.        2010 COMPARED WITH 2009     Wireless Service Provider Settlement Agreement  The business terms of our relationships with our wireless service providers are governed by our wireless reseller agreements. These contracts are complex and include provisions determining our upfront commission revenue, net of chargebacks for wireless service deactivations; our acquisition and return of wireless handsets; and, in some cases, future residual revenue, performance targets and marketing development funds. Disputes occasionally arise between the parties regarding the interpretation of these contract provisions.     Certain disputes arose with one of the Company’s wireless service providers pertaining to upfront commission revenue for activations prior to July 1, 2010, and related chargebacks for wireless service deactivations. Negotiations regarding resolution of these disputes culminated in the signing of a settlement agreement in July 2010. In connection with the decision to settle these disputes, the Company considered the following: the timing of cash outflows and inflows in connection with the disputed upfront commission revenue and related chargebacks, and the estimated future residual revenue; the benefits of settling the disputes and agreeing to enter into good faith negotiations with the wireless service provider in the third quarter of 2010 to modify the commission and chargeback provisions of our wireless reseller agreement; and the risks associated with the ultimate realization of the estimated future residual revenue.     Key elements of the settlement agreement include the following:         ·      All disputes relating to upfront commission revenue for activations prior to July 1, 2010, and related chargebacks were settled.            ·      The wireless service provider agreed to pay $141 million to the Company on or before July 30, 2010.            ·      The Company and the wireless service provider agreed to enter into good faith negotiations in the third quarter of 2010 to modify the commission and chargeback provisions of our wireless reseller agreement.            ·      Beginning on July 1, 2010, the wireless service provider was no longer obligated to pay future residual revenue amounts to the Company for a period of time for customers activated on or before June 30, 2010. For the first six months of 2010, these residual revenue amounts averaged approximately $9 million per quarter. Based on this average, we would receive no residual revenue payments from this wireless service provider for eight quarters beginning with the third quarter of 2010 under the terms of the settlement agreement.        The effects of the settlement agreement have been reflected in net sales and operating revenues in the consolidated financial statements for 2010.     In the third quarter, we reached an agreement with this wireless service provider to modify the commission and chargeback provisions of our wireless reseller agreement. Based on the terms of the settlement agreement, the terms of the amended wireless reseller agreement, and the performance of our business with this wireless service                21                  provider, we do not believe that these events will have a material effect on our results of operations for future periods.     Net Sales and Operating Revenues  Consolidated net sales increased 4.6% or $196.7 million to $4,472.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 , compared with  $4,276.0  million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to a comparable store sales increase of  4.4%  in 2010. The increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by increased sales in our wireless platform, but was partially offset by decreased sales in our accessory, modern home and personal electronics platforms.     Consolidated net sales and operating revenues for our two reportable segments and other sales are as follows:                Year Ended December 31,        (In millions)       2010          2009          2008        U.S. RadioShack  company-operated  stores      $  3,808.2        $  3,650.9        $  3,611.1       Kiosks         271.6           250.0           283.5       Other  (1)         392.9           375.1           329.9       Consolidated net sales  and operating revenues      $  4,472.7        $  4,276.0        $  4,224.5                                                Consolidated net sales and  operating revenues  increase (decrease)         4.6  %        1.2  %        (0.6  %)    Comparable store sales  increase (decrease)  (2)         4.4  %        1.3  %        (0.6  %)          (1)    Net sales and operating revenues for 2010 and 2009 include the consolidation of our Mexican subsidiary.     (2)    Comparable store sales include the sales of U.S. and Mexico RadioShack company-operated stores as well as kiosks with more than 12 full months of recorded sales. Following their closure as Sprint-branded kiosks in August 2009, certain former Sprint-branded kiosk locations became multiple wireless carrier RadioShack-branded locations. At December 31, 2009, we managed and reported 111 of these locations as extensions of existing RadioShack company-operated stores located in the same shopping malls. For purposes of calculating our comparable store sales, we include sales from these locations for periods after they became extensions of existing RadioShack company-operated stores, but we do not include sales from these locations for periods while they were operated as Sprint-branded kiosks.          The following table provides a summary of our consolidated net sales and operating revenues by platform and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues. These consolidated platform sales include sales from our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores and kiosks, as well as other sales.                Consolidated Net Sales and Operating Revenues               Year Ended December 31,        (In millions)       2010          2009          2008        Wireless      $  2,128.2           47.6  %     $  1,634.3           38.2  %     $  1,388.5           32.9  %    Accessory  (1)         858.2           19.2           1,036.3           24.2           1,140.0           27.0       Modern home         516.6           11.5           585.3           13.7           556.8           13.2       Personal electronics         412.5           9.2           463.6           10.9           565.4           13.4       Power         222.0           5.0           225.3           5.3           243.1           5.7       Technical         179.5           4.0           181.3           4.2           184.5           4.4       Service         130.3           2.9           114.5           2.7           93.8           2.2       Other sales  (2)         25.4           0.6           35.4           0.8           52.4           1.2       Consolidated net sales and operating revenues      $  4,472.7           100.0  %     $  4,276.0           100.0  %     $  4,224.5           100.0  %          (1)    The sales decrease from 2009 to 2010 in the accessory platform includes a decrease in sales of digital converter boxes. Consolidated sales of converter boxes were $33.7 million and $170.1 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.     (2)    Other sales include outside sales from repair services and outside sales of our global sourcing operations and domestic and overseas manufacturing facilities.                     22                  U.S. RadioShack Company-Operated Stores Segment     The following table provides a summary of our net sales and operating revenues by platform and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues for the U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores segment.                Net Sales and Operating Revenues                Year Ended December 31,         (In millions)       2010          2009       2008               Wireless      $  1,784.0           46.8  %     $  1,342.1           36.8  %     $  1,070.7           29.7  %    Accessory         773.6           20.3           946.0           25.9           1,054.0           29.2       Modern home         421.3           11.1           489.8           13.4           483.7           13.4       Personal electronics         337.0           8.9           391.1           10.7           503.9           14.0       Power         198.9           5.2           204.7           5.6           227.3           6.3       Technical         164.6           4.3           167.3           4.6           170.9           4.7       Service         117.6           3.1           107.6           2.9           91.4           2.5       Other         11.2           0.3           2.3           0.1           9.2           0.2       Net sales and operating revenues      $  3,808.2           100.0  %     $  3,650.9           100.0  %     $  3,611.1           100.0  %         Sales in our wireless platform (includes postpaid and prepaid wireless handsets, commissions, residual income and communication devices such as scanners and GPS products) increased  32.9%  in 2010. This sales increase was driven by increased sales in our Sprint and AT&T postpaid wireless business and increased sales of prepaid wireless handsets. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of GPS products. The inclusion of T-Mobile as a postpaid wireless carrier increased sales for the first nine months of 2010; however, T-Mobile sales decreased in the fourth quarter, when compared to the same period last year.     Sales in our accessory platform (includes home entertainment, wireless, music, computer and video game accessories; media storage; power adapters; digital imaging products and headphones) decreased  18.2%  in 2010. This sales decrease was primarily driven by decreased sales of digital converter boxes and television antennas, but was partially offset by increased sales of wireless accessories. Consolidated sales of converter boxes were $33.7 million and $170.1 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Converter box sales have decreased since the transition to digital television occurred in June 2009. We expect sales of converter boxes to be minimal in 2011.     Sales in our modern home platform (includes home audio and video end-products, personal computing products, and residential telephones) decreased  14.0%  in 2010. This decrease was driven primarily by decreased sales of digital televisions and netbooks, but was partially offset by increased sales of laptops.     Sales in our personal electronics platform (includes digital cameras, digital music players, toys, satellite radios, video gaming hardware, camcorders, and general radios) decreased  13.8%  in 2010. This decrease was driven by sales declines in substantially all categories in this platform.     Sales in our power platform (includes general and special purpose batteries and battery chargers) decreased  2.8 % in 2010. This decrease was primarily driven by decreased sales of both general and special purpose batteries, but was partially offset by increased sales of battery chargers.     Sales in our technical platform (includes wire and cable, connectivity products, components and tools, and hobby products) decreased  1.6 % in 2010. This decrease was driven by decreased sales of connectivity products.     Sales in our service platform (includes prepaid wireless airtime, extended service plans, and bill payment revenue) increased  9.3%  in 2010. This increase was driven primarily by increased sales of prepaid wireless airtime.     Kiosks Segment     Kiosk sales consist primarily of handset sales, postpaid and prepaid commission revenue and related wireless accessory sales. Kiosk sales increased 8.6% or $21.6 million in 2010. This increase was driven primarily by new sales in our Target kiosks and increased sales in our Sam’s Club kiosks, but was partially offset by the closure of our Sprint-branded kiosk business. We closed our Sprint-branded kiosks in the third quarter of 2009.     As previously disclosed, in February 2009 we signed a contract extension with Sam’s Club through March 31, 2011, with a transition period ending June 30, 2011, to continue operating wireless kiosks in certain Sam’s Club stores. As of December 31, 2010, we operated 417 of these kiosks. Accordingly, this transition will begin on April 1, 2011, and conclude on June 30, 2011, with the assignment to Sam’s Club of all kiosks operated by the Company in Sam’s Club stores.                23                  Other Sales     Other sales include sales to our independent dealers, outside sales through our service centers, sales generated by our  www.radioshack.com  website and our Mexican subsidiary, sales to commercial customers, and outside sales of our global sourcing operations and manufacturing. Other sales increased $17.8 million or 4.7% in 2010. This sales increase was driven primarily by increased sales at our Mexican subsidiary and increased sales to our independent dealers, but was partially offset by decreased sales from  www.radioshack.com  and our global sourcing and manufacturing operations. Our Mexican subsidiary accounted for less than 5% of consolidated net sales and operating revenues in 2010.     Gross Profit  Consolidated gross profit and gross margin are as follows:             Year Ended December 31,        (In millions)       2010          2009          2008        Gross profit      $  2,010.6        $  1,962.5        $  1,922.7       Gross profit increase (decrease)         2.5  %        2.1  %        (5.1  %)                                             Gross margin         45.0  %        45.9  %        45.5  %      Consolidated gross profit and gross margin for 2010 were $2,010.6 million and 45.0%, respectively, compared with $1,962.5 million and 45.9%, respectively, in 2009, resulting in a 2.5% increase in gross profit dollars and a 90 basis point decrease in our gross margin.     The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily due to increased sales, but was partially offset by decreased gross margin. Gross margin declined primarily due to a higher sales mix of lower margin wireless handsets and incremental promotional and clearance markdowns associated with seasonal sell-through and product transitions in non-wireless platforms.     Selling, General and Administrative Expense  Our consolidated SG&A expense increased 3.1% or $46.8 million in 2010. This represents a 50 basis point decrease as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues compared to 2009.     The table below summarizes the breakdown of various components of our consolidated SG&A expense and its related percentage of total net sales and operating revenues.                Year Ended December 31,               2010          2009          2008                  Dollars          % of  Sales &  Revenues             Dollars          % of  Sales &  Revenues             Dollars          % of  Sales &  Revenues             (In millions)     Compensation      $  700.6           15.7  %     $  655.7           15.3  %     $  617.5           14.6  %    Rent and occupancy         288.3           6.4           289.7           6.8           292.6           6.9       Advertising         206.1           4.6           193.0           4.5           214.5           5.1       Other taxes (excludes income taxes)         101.8           2.3           102.0           2.4           87.9           2.1       Utilities         54.7           1.2           55.3           1.3           58.7           1.4       Insurance         48.8           1.1           47.5           1.1           55.0           1.3       Credit card fees         35.6           0.8           37.7           0.9           37.7           0.9       Professional fees         21.4           0.5           23.9           0.6           23.7           0.6       Repairs and maintenance         20.2           0.5           22.3           0.5           19.5           0.5       Licenses         13.2           0.3           11.5           0.3           12.4           0.3       Printing, postage and office supplies         7.5           0.2           8.1           0.2           8.1           0.2       Matching contributions to savings plans         5.6           0.1           6.0           0.1           6.5           0.2       Recruiting, training & employee relations         5.7           0.1           6.0           0.1           7.5           0.2       Travel         5.4           0.1           4.6           0.1           5.4           0.1       Warranty and product repair         2.2           --           2.7           0.1           4.2           0.1       Other         37.6           0.9           41.9           1.0           58.6           1.2                                                                                          $  1,554.7           34.8  %     $  1,507.9           35.3  %     $  1,509.8           35.7  %                  24                Compensation expense increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues. This increase was driven by incentive compensation paid on increased wireless sales and the hiring of additional employees to support our Target kiosk locations.     Advertising expense was higher in 2010 primarily due to incremental advertising related to brand building in the second quarter of 2010.     Depreciation and Amortization  The table below provides a summary of our total depreciation and amortization by segment.             Year Ended December 31,        (In millions)       2010          2009          2008        U.S. RadioShack  company-operated stores      $  45.4        $  45.8        $  52.9       Kiosks         2.3           3.2           5.8       Other         3.7           5.8           1.8       Unallocated         32.8           38.1           38.6       Total depreciation and  amortization      $  84.2        $  92.9        $  99.1         The table below provides an analysis of total depreciation and amortization.             Year Ended December 31,        (In millions)       2010          2009          2008        Depreciation and  amortization expense      $  76.5        $  83.7        $  87.9       Depreciation and  amortization included  in cost of products sold            7.7              9.2              11.2       Total depreciation and  amortization      $  84.2        $  92.9        $  99.1         Total depreciation and amortization for 2010 declined $8.7 million or 9.4%. Our depreciation expense has been trending lower over the past five years due to our lower level of capital expenditures during this time compared with a higher level of capital expenditures in 2005 and prior years.     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Impairment of long-lived assets was $4.0 million and $1.5 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2010, this amount was related primarily to underperforming U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores and certain test store formats. In 2009, these amounts were related primarily to underperforming U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores and kiosk locations.     Net Interest Expense  Consolidated net interest expense, which is interest expense net of interest income, was $ 39.3 million in both  2010  and 2009.     In 2010, interest expense primarily consisted of interest paid at the stated coupon rate on our outstanding notes, the non-cash amortization of the discount on our convertible notes, cash received on our interest rate swaps, and the non-cash change in fair value of our interest rate swaps. Interest expense decreased $ 2.2  million in  2010. This decrease was primarily driven by the reduced principal balance of our long-term notes due in May 2011 resulting from the September 2009 repurchase of $43.2 million of the principal amount of our notes and increased payments received on our interest rate swap contracts during 2010.   Non-cash interest expense was $15.2 million in 2010 compared with $13.7 million in 2009.     Interest income decreased $ 2.2  million in  2010 . This decrease was primarily due to lower average cash balances in the second half of 2010.     Income Tax Expense  Our effective tax rate for 2010 was 38.7%, compared with 37.6% for 2009. The 2010 effective tax rate was affected by the net reversal of approximately $1.2 million in previously unrecognized tax benefits, deferred tax assets and accrued interest due to the effective settlement of state income tax matters during the period. These discrete items lowered the effective tax rate by 0.4 percentage points.     The 2009 effective tax rate was affected by the net reversal of approximately $6.1 million in previously unrecognized tax benefits, deferred tax assets and accrued interest due to the effective settlement of state income tax matters during the period. These discrete items lowered the effective tax rate by 1.9 percentage points.        2009 COMPARED WITH 2008     Net Sales and Operating Revenues  Consolidated net sales increased 1.2% or $51.5 million to $4,276.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared with $4,224.5 million in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a comparable store sales increase of 1.3% in 2009. The increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by increased sales in our wireless and modern home platforms, but was partially offset by decreased sales in our accessory and personal electronics platforms.     U.S. RadioShack Company-Operated Stores Segment     Sales in our wireless platform increased 25.3% in 2009. This sales increase was driven by increased sales in our Sprint postpaid wireless business, the addition of T-Mobile as a postpaid wireless carrier, and increased sales of prepaid wireless handsets. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of GPS products.     Sales in our accessory platform decreased 10.2% in 2009. This sales decrease was primarily driven by decreased                25                  sales in digital-to-analog converter boxes, wireless accessories, imaging accessories, and media storage, but was partially offset by increased sales of television antennas. Consolidated sales of converter boxes were $170.1 million and $204.8 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in converter box sales occurred in the second half of the year after the transition to digital television occurred in June 2009.     Sales in our modern home platform increased 1.3% in 2009. In this platform we recorded sales gains in netbooks, digital televisions, and VoIP products, which were substantially offset by sales declines in laptops, residential telephones, and DVD players.     Sales in our personal electronics platform decreased 22.4% in 2009. This decrease was driven primarily by sales declines in digital cameras, digital music players, video game consoles, satellite radios, and toys.     Sales in our power platform decreased 9.9% in 2009. This decrease was primarily driven by decreased sales of both general and special purpose batteries. Our sales performance in this platform was negatively affected by the disruption during the transition process of the assortment to our Enercell brand.     Sales in our technical platform decreased 2.1% in 2009. We recorded an increase in sales of wire and cable products, which was more than offset by decreased sales across most of the other product categories in this platform.     Sales in our service platform increased 17.7% in 2009. This increase was driven primarily by increased sales of prepaid wireless airtime and extended service plans.     Kiosks Segment     Kiosk sales decreased 11.8% or $33.5 million in 2009. We realized a sales increase in our Sam’s Club business, which was offset by a reduced number of kiosk locations. This decrease in locations was partially due to the closure of underperforming Sprint-branded kiosk locations in the first half of 2009 and the closure of the remainder of our Sprint-branded kiosks in the third quarter. For more information regarding the reduction in kiosk outlets, see the Retail Locations table in Item 2 – “Properties” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Other Sales  Other sales increased $45.2 million or 13.7% in 2009. This sales increase was primarily attributable to the consolidation of our Mexican subsidiary for all of 2009, but was partially offset by decreased sales to our independent dealers. Our Mexican subsidiary accounted for less than 5% of consolidated net sales and operating revenues in 2009.     Gross Profit  Consolidated gross profit and gross margin for 2009 were $1,962.5 million and 45.9%, respectively, compared with $1,922.7 million and 45.5% in 2008, resulting in a 2.1% increase in gross profit dollars and a 40 basis point increase in our gross margin.     The improvement in gross margin was partially driven by improved product mix, combined with fewer markdowns as a result of more effective promotional productivity, inventory management and higher sell-through of seasonal products.     Selling, General and Administrative Expense  Our consolidated SG&A expense decreased 0.1% or $1.9 million in 2009. This represents a 40 basis point decrease as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues compared to 2008.     Compensation expense increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues. This increase was driven by more incentive compensation and the consolidation of our Mexican subsidiary for all of 2009.     Total rent and occupancy expense decreased from 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by reduced rent related to our amended headquarters lease and the closing of our Sprint-branded kiosks. These decreases were partially offset by the consolidation of our Mexican subsidiary for all of 2009.     Advertising expense decreased in 2009 primarily due to reduced spending in the second quarter of the year. While our advertising expense in the second half of the year was consistent with the same period last year, we shifted a significant portion of our advertising expenditures from product specific promotional activities to building awareness of our new brand creative platform, The Shack ® .     The increase in other taxes was partially driven by increased payroll taxes associated with increased compensation expense. Additionally, we recorded an $8.2 million sales and use tax benefit from the settlement of a sales tax issue in 2008.     Our insurance expense has decreased in recent years due to lower workers’ compensation costs. This has been the result of better claims experience during this time.     The decrease in other SG&A expense was primarily due to a $12.1 million non-cash charge recorded in connection with our amended headquarters lease in 2008.     Depreciation and Amortization  Total depreciation and amortization for 2009 declined $6.2 million or 6.3%. This decrease was primarily due to reduced  capital expenditures in recent years when compared with prior years.                26                   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Impairment of long-lived assets was $1.5 million and $2.8 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. These amounts were related primarily to underperforming U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores and kiosk locations.     Net Interest Expense  Consolidated net interest expense, which is interest expense net of interest income, was $39.3 million for 2009 compared with $20.3 million for 2008.     Interest expense primarily consists of interest paid on the stated coupon rate for our outstanding bonds, the non-cash amortization of discounts and premiums on our outstanding bonds, cash paid or received on our interest rate swaps, and the non-cash change in fair value of our interest rate swaps in 2009. Interest expense increased $9.2 million in 2009. This increase was primarily driven by increased interest expense related to our 2013 convertible notes. These notes were outstanding for twelve months in 2009 and four months in 2008. This increase was partially offset by increased payments received on our interest rate swap contracts in 2009 and the repurchase of $43.2 million of our notes due in May 2011. Non-cash interest expense was $13.7 million in 2009 compared with $5.0 million in 2008.     Interest income decreased $9.8 million in 2009. This decrease was due to a lower interest rate environment in 2009, but was partially offset by larger average cash balances in 2009.     Other Loss  During 2009 we recorded other loss of $1.6 million compared with other loss of $2.4 million in 2008. The 2009 loss was recognized in conjunction with the repurchase of a portion of our 2011 Notes. The 2008 loss represented losses related to our derivative exposure to Sirius XM Radio, Inc. warrants as a result of our fair value measurements of these warrants. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of these warrants was zero, and these warrants expired in the first quarter of 2009.     Income Tax Expense  Our effective tax rate for 2009 was 37.6% compared with 36.8% for 2008. The 2009 effective tax rate was affected by the net reversal of approximately $6.1 million in previously unrecognized tax benefits, deferred tax assets and accrued interest due to the effective settlement of state income tax matters during the period. These discrete items lowered the effective tax rate by 1.9 percentage points.     The 2008 effective tax rate was affected by the execution of a closing agreement with respect to a Puerto Rico income tax matter during the year, which resulted in a credit to income tax expense; this discrete item lowered the effective tax rate for 2008 by 1.0 percentage point. In addition, the 2008 effective tax rate was affected by the net reversal of approximately $4.1 million in unrecognized tax benefits, deferred tax assets and accrued interest related to the settlement of various state income tax matters and the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to our 2002 taxable year; this net reversal lowered the effective tax rate for 2008 by 1.4 percentage points.        RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  Refer to Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” under the section titled “New Accounting Standards” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.        LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     Cash Flow Overview     Operating Activities:  Cash provided by operating activities in 2010 was $155.0 million, compared with $245.8 million in 2009. Cash flows from operating activities are comprised of net income plus non-cash adjustments to net income and working capital components. Cash provided by net income plus non-cash adjustments to net income was $343.9 million and $333.7 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cash used in working capital components was $188.9 million and $87.9 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our cash used in working capital components in 2010 was driven by higher accounts receivable and inventory balances to support our increased wireless business and our Target kiosk expansion. Cash used in working capital components in 2010 was also driven by lower accrued expenses and current liabilities related to insurance, legal reserves and compensation.     Investing Activities:  Cash used in investing activities was $80.0 million and $80.8 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capital expenditures of $80.1 million in 2010 were consistent with last year. Capital expenditures primarily related to information system projects, Target Mobile kiosks, and our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores.     Financing Activities:  Net cash used in financing activities was $413.8 million in 2010 compared with $71.6 million in 2009. This increase was primarily driven by the repurchase of $398.8 million of our common stock in 2010 under our share repurchase program, compared with no repurchases in 2009.     Free Cash Flow:   Our free cash flow, defined as cash flows from operating activities less dividends paid and additions to property, plant and equipment, was $48.4 million in 2010, $133.5 million in 2009, and $157.7 million in 2008. The  decrease in free cash flow for 2010 was attributable to decreased cash flow from operating activities as described above.                27                   We believe free cash flow is a relevant indicator of our ability to repay maturing debt, change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that management believes will enhance shareholder value. The comparable financial measure to free cash flow under generally accepted accounting principles is cash flows from operating activities, which was $155.0 million in 2010, $245.8 million in 2009, and $274.6 million in 2008. We do not intend for the presentation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, nor do we intend to imply that free cash flow represents cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.     The following table is a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow.             Year Ended December 31,        (In millions)       2010          2009          2008        Net cash provided by  operating activities      $  155.0        $  245.8        $  274.6       Less:                                         Additions to property, plant  and equipment         80.1           81.0           85.6       Dividends paid         26.5           31.3           31.3                                                Free cash flow      $  48.4        $  133.5        $  157.7          SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY  As of December 31, 2010, we had $569.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our cash flows from operations and available cash and cash equivalents will adequately fund our operations, our capital expenditures, and our maturing debt obligations. Additionally, we had a credit facility of $325 million.     On January 4, 2011, we terminated this credit facility and entered into a new five-year, $450 million revolving credit agreement (“2016 Credit Facility”) with a group of lenders with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent.     As a condition of the 2016 Credit Facility, we were required to eliminate the restrictive covenants associated with our long-term notes due May 15, 2011 (as further defined below, the “2011 Notes”). On January 4, 2011, we transferred $318.1 million to the trustee for the 2011 Notes that will be used to pay principal and interest amounts due upon redemption of these notes. In connection with the deposit of these funds, the trustee acknowledged the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture as to the 2011 Notes, which had the effect of eliminating the restrictive covenants referred to above. This redemption is currently scheduled to take place on March 4, 2011. Any amounts remaining with the trustee after the redemption of the 2011 Notes will be returned to us.       The table below lists our credit commitments from various financial institutions at December 31, 2010.         (In millions)       Commitment Expiration per Period           Credit Commitments       Total Amounts Committed          Less Than  1 Year          1-3 Years          3-5 Years          Over  5 Years        Lines of credit  (1)      $  325.0        $  325.0        $  --        $  --        $  --       Standby letters of credit         --           --           --           --           --       Total commercial commitments      $  325.0        $  325.0        $  --        $  --        $  --              (1)    On January 4, 2011, we replaced this credit facility with a new five-year, $450 million credit facility. See the “Available Financing” section below for more information.           Available Financing:  As of December 31, 2010, we had $292.3 million in borrowing capacity available under our existing credit facility. We did not borrow under this facility during 2010, but we did arrange for the issuance of standby letters of credit totaling $32.7 million under the facility. This credit facility had customary terms and covenants, and we were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2010. The facility was scheduled to expire in May of 2011.     The 2016 Credit Facility expires on January 4, 2016. The new facility may be used for general corporate purposes and the issuance of letters of credit. The new facility is secured by substantially all of the Company’s inventory, accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents, and certain other personal property.     Borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facility are subject to a borrowing base of certain secured assets and bear interest, at our option, at a bank’s prime rate plus 1.25% to 1.75% or LIBOR plus 2.25% to 2.75%. The applicable rates in these ranges are based on the aggregate average availability under the facility.     The 2016 Credit Facility also contains a $150 million sub-limit for the issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit. Issued letters of credit will reduce the amount available under the facility. Letter of credit fees are 2.25%                28                  to 2.75% for standby letters of credit or 1.125% to 1.375% for commercial letters of credit.     We pay commitment fees to the lenders at an annual rate of 0.50% of the unused amount of the facility. No borrowings, other than the issuance of letters of credit totaling $32.8 million as of February 15, 2011, have been made under the 2016 Credit Facility.     The 2016 Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict certain payments, including dividends and share repurchases. Also, we will be subject to a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio if our unused amount under the facility is less than the greater of 12.5% of the maximum borrowing amount and $45.0 million.     We are generally free to pay dividends and repurchase shares as long as the current and projected unused amount under the facility is greater than 17.5% of the maximum borrowing amount and the minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is maintained. We may pay dividends and repurchase shares without regard to the Company's consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as long as the current and projected unused amount under the facility is greater than 75% of the maximum borrowing amount and cash on hand is used for the dividends or share repurchases.        CASH REQUIREMENTS     Capital Expenditures:   We anticipate that our capital expenditure requirements for 2011 will range from $100 million to $125 million. The nature of our capital expenditures is comprised of a base level of investment required to support our current operations and a discretionary amount related to our strategic initiatives. The base level of capital expenditures required to support our operations ranges from $40 million to $60 million. The remaining amount of anticipated capital expenditures relates to strategic initiatives as reflected in our annual plan. These capital expenditures are discretionary and, therefore, may not be spent if we decide not to pursue one or more of our strategic initiatives. U.S. RadioShack company-operated store remodels and relocations, Target kiosks, and information systems projects will account for the majority of our anticipated 2011 capital expenditures. Cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities will be used to fund future capital expenditure needs.     Seasonal Inventory Buildup:   Typically, our annual cash requirements for pre-seasonal inventory buildup range between $150 million and $250 million. The funding required for this buildup comes primarily from cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and operating revenues. Additionally, our 2016 Credit Facility could be utilized to fund the inventory buildup.     Contractual Obligations  The table below contains our known contractual commitments as of December 31, 2010.         (In millions)       Payments Due by Period           Contractual Obligations       Total Amounts Committed          Less Than  1 Year          1-3 Years          3-5 Years          Over  5 Years        Long-term debt obligations  (1)      $  682.8        $  306.8        $  375.0        $  1.0        $  --       Interest obligations         32.7           17.8           14.9           --           --       Operating lease obligations  (2)         562.9           196.7           233.8           99.2           33.2       Purchase obligations  (3)         291.8           268.4           19.4           4.0           --       Other long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet  (4)         93.0                       27.6           6.5           22.3       Total      $  1,663.2        $  789.7        $  670.7        $  110.7        $  55.5              (1)    For more information regarding long-term debt, refer to Note 5 – “Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.     (2)    For more information regarding lease commitments, refer to Note 13 – “Commitments and Contingencies” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.     (3)    Purchase obligations include our product commitments, marketing agreements and freight commitments.     (4)    Includes a $36.6 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the related balances have not been reflected in the ‘‘Payments Due by Period’’ section of the table.                  29                  2013 Convertible Notes:  In August 2008, we issued $375 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due August 1, 2013 (the “2013 Convertible Notes”), in a private offering. Each $1,000 of principal of the 2013 Convertible Notes is initially convertible, under certain circumstances, into 41.2414 shares of our common stock (or a total of approximately 15.5 million shares), which is the equivalent of $24.25 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events set forth under terms of the 2013 Convertible Notes. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock, up to the principal amount of the note. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, (the “excess conversion value”) may be paid in cash or in stock, at our option. Holders may convert their 2013 Convertible Notes into common stock on the net settlement basis described above at any time from May 1, 2013, until the close of business on July 29, 2013, or if, and only if, one of the following conditions has been met:         ·      During any calendar quarter, and only during such calendar quarter, in which the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the conversion price per share of common stock in effect on the last day of such preceding calendar quarter            ·      During the five consecutive business days immediately after any 10 consecutive trading day period in which the average trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2013 Convertible Notes was less than 98% of the product of the closing price of the common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date            ·      We make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or specified corporate transactions occur        The 2013 Convertible Notes were not convertible at the holders' option at any time during 2010 or 2009.     Holders who convert their 2013 Convertible Notes in connection with a change in control may be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. In addition, upon a change in control, liquidation, dissolution or delisting, the holders of the 2013 Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2013 Convertible Notes for 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. As of December 31, 2010, none of the conditions allowing holders of the 2013 Convertible Notes to convert or requiring us to repurchase the 2013 Convertible Notes had been met.     Concurrent with the issuance of the 2013 Convertible Notes, we entered into note hedge transactions with Citigroup and Bank of America whereby we have the option to purchase up to 15.5 million shares of our common stock at a price of $24.25 per share (the “Convertible Note Hedges”), and we sold warrants to the same financial institutions whereby they have the option to purchase up to 15.5 million shares of our common stock at a per share price of $36.60 (the “Warrants”). The Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants were structured to reduce the potential future share dilution associated with the conversion of the 2013 Convertible Notes. The Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants are separate contracts with the two financial institutions, are not part of the terms of the 2013 Convertible Notes, and do not affect the rights of holders under the 2013 Convertible Notes. A holder of the 2013 Convertible Notes does not have any rights with respect to the Convertible Note Hedges or Warrants.     The net proceeds retained by RadioShack as a result of the issuance of the 2013 Convertible Notes, the purchase of the Convertible Note Hedges, and the proceeds received from the issuance of the Warrants were approximately $319.2 million. We completed these transactions to secure a source of liquidity prior to the June 2009 expiration of our $300 million credit facility. On September 11, 2008, we terminated this credit facility.     For a more detailed description of the 2013 Convertible Notes, Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants, please see Note 5 – “Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities” and Note 6 – “Stockholders’ Equity” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.     Long-Term Notes:  On May 11, 2001, we issued $350 million of 10-year 7.375% notes due May 15, 2011, (the “2011 Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers under SEC Rule 144A. In August 2001, under the terms of an exchange offering filed with the SEC, we exchanged substantially all of these notes for a similar amount of publicly registered notes. The exchange resulted in substantially all of the notes becoming registered with the SEC and did not result in additional debt being issued. The annual interest rate on the notes is 7.375% per annum with interest payable on November 15 and May 15 of each year. The notes contain certain non-financial covenants.     In June and August 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with underlying notional amounts of debt of $100 million and $50 million, respectively, and both with maturities in May 2011. Our counterparty for these swaps is Citigroup. These swaps effectively convert a portion of our long-term fixed rate debt to a variable rate. For more information regarding our interest rate swaps, refer to Note 11 – “Derivative Financial Instruments” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.                30                  In September 2009, we completed a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of these notes. Upon expiration of the offer, $43.2 million of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the notes was validly tendered and accepted. We paid a total of $46.6 million, which consisted of the purchase price of $45.4 million for the tendered notes plus $1.2 million in accrued and unpaid interest, to the holders of the tendered notes.     On January 4, 2011, we announced our intention to redeem any and all outstanding 2011 Notes on March 4, 2011. See Note 15 - “Subsequent Events” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.     Operating Leases:   We use operating leases, primarily for our retail locations and our corporate campus, to lower our capital requirements.     Continuing Lease Obligations:  We have obligations under retail leases for locations that we assigned to other businesses. The majority of these lease obligations arose from leases for which CompUSA Inc. (“CompUSA”) assumed responsibility as part of its purchase of our Computer City, Inc. subsidiary in August 1998. Because the company that assumed responsibility for these leases has ceased operations, we may be responsible for rent due under the leases.     Following an announcement by CompUSA in February 2007 of its intention to close as many as 126 stores and an announcement in December 2007 that it had been acquired by Gordon Brothers Group, CompUSA’s stores ceased operations in January 2008. We may be responsible for rent due on a portion of the leases that relate to the closed stores. As of February 3, 2011, we had been named as a defendant in a total of 13 lawsuits from lessors seeking payment from us, 12 of which have been resolved.     Based on all available information pertaining to the status of these lawsuits, and after applying the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) guidance on accounting for contingencies, the balance of our accrual for these obligations was $2.4 million and $6.2 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We will continue to monitor this situation for new information on outstanding litigation and settlements, but we do not consider the amounts of these obligations, both individually and in the aggregate, to be material to our results of operations or financial position.     Capitalization  The following table sets forth information about our capitalization on the dates indicated.             December 31,               2010          2009           (Dollars in millions)       Dollars          % of Total  Capitalization          Dollars          % of Total  Capitalization        Short-term debt      $  308.0           20.8  %     $  --           --  %    Long-term debt         331.8           22.4           627.8           37.5       Total debt         639.8           43.2           627.8           37.5       Stockholders’  equity         842.5           56.8           1,048.3           62.5       Total capitalization      $  1,482.3           100.0  %     $  1,676.1           100.0  %      Our debt-to-total capitalization ratio increased in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to the repurchase of $398.8 million of our common stock in 2010.     Dividends:   We have paid common stock cash dividends for 24 consecutive years. On November 4, 2010, our Board of Directors declared an annual dividend of $0.25 per share. The dividend was paid on December 16, 2010, to stockholders of record on November 26, 2010. The dividend payment of $26.5 million was funded from cash on hand.     Share Repurchases:  In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with no expiration date authorizing management to repurchase up to $200 million of our common stock. During the third quarter of 2008, we repurchased 6.0 million shares or $110.0 million of our common stock under this program. As of December 31, 2008, $90.0 million was available for share repurchases under this program.     In August 2009, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million increase in this share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2009, $290 million of the total authorized amount was available for share repurchases under this program.     In August 2010, our Board of Directors approved an increase in this share repurchase program from $400 million to $610 million, with $500 million available for share repurchases under this program. In November 2010, we completed a $300 million accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) program that we entered into in August 2010, which is further discussed below. We repurchased 14.9 million shares under the ASR program. In addition, after the conclusion of the ASR program, we repurchased $98.6 million worth of shares in the open market, representing 4.9 million shares. As of December 31, 2010, $101.4 million of the total authorized amount was available for share repurchases under this program.                31                  Accelerated Share Repurchase Program:  As mentioned above, in August 2010, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program with two investment banks to repurchase shares of our common stock under our approved share repurchase program. On August 24, 2010, we paid $300 million to the investment banks in exchange for an initial delivery of 11.7 million shares to us. At the conclusion of the ASR program, we received an additional 3.2 million shares. The 14.9 million shares delivered to us were based on the average daily volume weighted average price of our common stock over a period beginning immediately after the effective date of the ASR agreements and ending on November 2, 2010.     Treasury Stock Retirement:  In December 2010, our Board of Directors approved the retirement of 45.0 million shares of our common stock held as treasury stock. These shares returned to the status of authorized and unissued.        OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  Other than the operating leases described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, transactions, or special purpose entities.        INFLATION  With the exception of increased energy costs in the first half of 2008, inflation has not significantly affected us over the past three years. We do not expect inflation to have a significant effect on our operations in the foreseeable future.        OTHER MATTERS  Separate from our wireless service provider settlement agreement in July 2010, we notified T-Mobile that they had breached their agreement with us. Under the agreement, T-Mobile has until March 21, 2011, to cure the breaches. In the event that T-Mobile is unable to cure the breaches, we have the right to terminate the agreement. The outcome of this action is uncertain and the ultimate resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business operations.        CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States. The application of GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements and is affected by management’s judgment and uncertainties. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current market trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant and reasonable at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. We continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.     In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are revenue recognition; inventory valuation; estimation of reserves and valuation allowances specifically related to insurance, tax and legal contingencies; valuation of long-lived assets and intangibles, including goodwill; and stock-based compensation.     We consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires difficult, subjective or complex judgments, and is material to the portrayal of our financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. The selection, application and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.     Revenue Recognition     Description     Our revenue is derived principally from the sale of name brand and private brand products and services to consumers. Revenue is recognized, net of an estimate for customer refunds and product returns, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.     Certain products, such as wireless telephone handsets, require the customer to use the services of a third-party service provider. The third-party service provider pays us an upfront commission for obtaining a new customer and, in some cases, a monthly recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the service provider and the customer. Our sale of an activated wireless telephone handset is the single event required to meet the delivery criterion for both the upfront commission and the recurring residual revenue. Upfront commission revenue, net of estimated wireless service deactivations, is generally recognized at the time an activated wireless telephone handset is sold to the customer at the point-of-sale. Recurring residual revenue is recognized as earned under the terms of each contract with the service provider, which is typically as the service provider bills its customer, generally on a monthly basis.                32                  Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate     Our revenue recognition accounting methodology requires us to make certain judgments regarding the estimate of future sales returns and wireless service deactivations. Our estimates for product refunds and returns, wireless service deactivations and commission revenue adjustments are based on historical information pertaining to these items. Based on our extensive history in selling activated wireless telephone handsets, we have been able to establish reliable estimates for wireless service deactivations. However, our estimates for wireless service deactivations can be affected by certain characteristics of and decisions made by our service providers. These factors include changes in the quality of their customer service, the quality and performance of their networks, their rate plan offerings, their policies regarding extensions of customer credit, and their wireless telephone handset product offerings. These factors add uncertainty to our estimates.     Effect if actual results differ from assumptions     We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate sales returns or wireless service deactivations during the past three fiscal years. We continue to update our estimate for wireless service deactivations to reflect the most recently available information regarding the characteristics of and decisions made by our service providers discussed above. If actual results differ from our estimates due to these or various other factors, the amount of revenue recorded could be materially affected. A 10% difference in our reserves for the estimates noted above would have affected net sales and operating revenues by approximately $3.3 million in 2010.     Inventory Valuation     Description     Our inventory consists primarily of finished goods available for sale at our retail locations or within our distribution centers and is recorded at the lower of average cost (which approximates FIFO) or market. The cost components recorded within inventory are the vendor invoice cost and certain allocated freight, distribution, warehousing and other costs relating to merchandise acquisition required to bring the merchandise from the vendor to the location where it is offered for sale.     Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate     Typically, the market value of our inventory is higher than its aggregate cost. Determination of the market value may be very complex and, therefore, requires a high degree of judgment. In order for management to make the appropriate determination of market value, the following items are commonly considered: inventory turnover statistics, current selling prices, seasonality factors, consumer trends, competitive pricing, performance of similar products or accessories, planned promotional incentives, technological obsolescence, and estimated costs to sell or dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions.     If the estimated market value, calculated as the amount we expect to realize, net of estimated selling costs, from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory, is determined to be less than the recorded cost, we record a provision to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item to its net realizable value.     Effect if actual results differ from assumptions     We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves during the past three fiscal years, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to estimate our inventory valuation reserves. Differences between management estimates and actual performance and pricing of our merchandise could result in inventory valuations that differ from the amount recorded at the financial statement date and could also cause fluctuations in the amount of recorded cost of products sold. If our estimates regarding market value are inaccurate or changes in consumer demand affect certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may be exposed to material losses or gains in excess of our established valuation reserve. We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our inventory valuation reserves. However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves.     Estimation of Reserves and Valuation Allowances for Self-Insurance, Income Taxes, and Litigation Contingencies     Description     The amount of liability we record for claims related to insurance, tax and legal contingencies requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We are insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation, property and other liability claims, with deductibles up to $1.0 million per occurrence. This insurance coverage limits our exposure for any catastrophic claims that result in liability in excess of the deductible. We also have a self-insured health program administered by a third-party covering the majority of our employees that participate in our health insurance programs. We estimate the amount of our reserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reporting period. This estimate is based on historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other factors we deem relevant.                33                  We are subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities related to income tax, sales and use tax, personal property tax, and other forms of taxation. These audits examine our tax positions, timing of income and deductions, and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions. Our accounting for tax estimates and contingencies requires us to evaluate tax issues and establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable tax exposures. Depending on the nature of the tax issue, we could be subject to audit over several years; therefore, our estimated reserve balances might exist for multiple years before an issue is resolved by the taxing authority.     We are involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated with employment and other matters. Our accounting for legal contingencies requires us to estimate the probable losses in these matters. This estimate has been developed in consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies.     Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate     Our liabilities for insurance, tax and legal contingencies contain uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with these items. We use our history and experience, as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims, in evaluating the amount of liability we should record. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate. These revisions could materially affect our results of operations and financial position or liquidity.     Effect if actual results differ from assumptions     We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate our insurance reserves during the past three fiscal years, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions for these items. However, a 10% change in our insurance reserves at December 31, 2010, would have affected net income by approximately $4.3 million. As of December 31, 2010, actual losses had not exceeded our expectations. Additionally, for claims that exceed our deductible amount, we record a gross liability and corresponding receivable representing expected recoveries, since we are not legally relieved of our obligation to the claimant.     Although we believe that our insurance, tax and legal reserves are based on reasonable judgments and estimates, actual results could differ, which may expose us to material gains or losses in future periods. These actual results could materially affect our effective tax rate, earnings, deferred tax balances and cash flows in the period of resolution.     Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles, including Goodwill     Description     Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, such as insufficient cash flows or plans to dispose of or sell long-lived assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives. The carrying amount is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying amount is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. We estimate fair value based on projected future discounted cash flows. Impairment losses, if any, are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs. The carrying value of the asset is adjusted to the new carrying value, and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded. Additionally, if it is determined that the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased, the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new existing carrying value of the asset and the new remaining useful life. Our policy is to evaluate long-lived assets for impairment at a store level for retail operations.     We have acquired goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets related to business acquisitions. The original valuation of these intangible assets is based on estimates of future profitability, cash flows and other judgmental factors. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We review our goodwill and other intangible asset balances on an annual basis, during the fourth quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset might exceed their fair value. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset or a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss for this difference.     Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate     Our impairment loss calculations for long-lived assets contain uncertainties because they require us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows, strategic plans, useful lives and assumptions about market performance. We also apply judgment in the selection of a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in our current business model.     Our impairment loss calculations for intangible assets and goodwill contain uncertainties because they require us to estimate fair values related to these assets. We estimate                34                  fair values based on various valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and other comparable market analyses. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require us to make judgments and assumptions regarding future profitability, industry factors, planned strategic initiatives, discount rates and other factors.     Effect if actual results differ from assumptions     We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodologies we use to assess impairment loss for long-lived assets, intangible assets, or goodwill during the past three fiscal years, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use in calculating these impairment losses. However, if actual results or performance of certain business units are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges, which could be material to our results of operations.     The total value of our goodwill and intangible assets at December 31, 2010, was $41.9 million. Of this amount, $37.8 million related to goodwill from the purchase of RadioShack de Mexico. Based on our most recent review of goodwill impairment, we noted that the fair values of our reporting units were substantially greater than their carrying values.     Stock-Based Compensation     Description     We have historically granted certain stock-based awards to employees and directors in the form of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock and deferred stock units. See Note 2 - “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 7 - “Stock-Based Incentive Plans” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our stock-based compensation programs.     At the date an award is granted, we determine the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period, which typically is the period over which the award vests. The restricted stock and deferred stock units are valued at the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options with only service conditions is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair value of stock options with service and market conditions is valued utilizing a lattice model with Monte Carlo simulations.     Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate     The Black-Scholes-Merton and lattice models require management to apply judgment and use highly subjective assumptions, including expected option life, volatility of stock prices, and employee forfeiture rate. We use historical data and judgment to estimate the expected option life and employee forfeiture rate, and use historical and implied volatility when estimating the stock price volatility. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.     Effect if actual results differ from assumptions     We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodologies used to record stock-based compensation during the past three years. While the assumptions that we develop are based on our best expectations, they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions and employee behavior that are outside of our control. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used, the stock-based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock-based compensation. Additionally, if actual employee forfeitures significantly differ from our estimated forfeitures, we may have an adjustment to our financial statements in future periods. A 10% change in our stock-based compensation expense in 2010 would have affected our net income by approximately $1.0 million. </div>       FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS  Matters discussed in our MD&A and in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical and may be identified by the use of words such as “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “potential” or similar words. These matters include statements concerning management’s plans and objectives relating to our operations or economic performance and related assumptions. We specifically disclaim any duty to update any of the information set forth in this report, including any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are made based on management’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future events and, therefore, involve a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management cautions that forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.              35                   ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.     At December 31, 2010, the only derivative instruments that materially increased our exposure to market risks for interest rates, foreign currency rates, commodity prices or  other market price risks were interest rate swaps, which serve as an economic hedge on our long-term debt. We do not use derivatives for speculative purposes. Refer to Note 11 – “Derivative Financial Instruments” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.      Our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in short-term interest rates. Interest rate risk exists with respect to our net investment position at December 31, 2010, of $312.1 million, consisting of fluctuating short-term investments of $462.1 million and offset by $150 million of indebtedness which, because of our interest rate swaps, effectively bears interest at short-term floating rates. A hypothetical change of 100 basis points in the interest rate applicable to this floating-rate net exposure would result in a change in annual net interest expense of $3.1 million and an approximate $0.4 million change to the fair value of our interest rate swaps, which would also affect net interest expense. This hypothesis assumes no change in the principal or investment balance.     We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our purchase of inventory from manufacturers located in China and other areas outside of the U.S. Our purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars; however, the strengthening of the Chinese currency, or other currencies, against the U.S. dollar could cause our vendors to increase the prices of items we purchase from them. It is not possible to estimate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our purchases of this inventory. We are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations related to our Mexican subsidiary, which accounted for less than 5% of consolidated net sales and operating revenues in 2010.        ITEM 8.
