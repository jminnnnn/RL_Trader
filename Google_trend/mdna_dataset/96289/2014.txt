ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (“MD&A”).     This MD&A section discusses our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, risk management practices, critical accounting policies and estimates, and certain factors that may affect our future results, including economic and industry-wide factors. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A above.     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY     Strategic Turnaround Plan  In February 2013 we hired a new Chief Executive Officer to lead a turnaround of the business by focusing on an initial set of strategic initiatives (“Strategic Plan”):         ·      Reposition our brand  to reignite our customer base and connect to a new generation of shoppers through a modernized and relevant brand position.            ·      Revamp our product assortment  to focus on relevant categories and higher-margin private brands.            ·      Reinvigorate our store experience  through the use of high-touch, interactive content in strategic locations and the use of key design and aesthetic elements on a cost-effective basis.            ·      Increase operational efficiency  by evaluating our retail operations, supply chain, and corporate functions and reengineering our processes to emphasize efficiencies.            ·      Increase our financial  flexibility by providing the necessary capital and liquidity to fund the turnaround of the business. Refer to Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion.        The implementation of these strategic initiatives will continue throughout 2014.     2013 Summary  Net sales and operating revenues decreased $397.0 million, or 10.4%, to $3,434.3 million when compared with last year. This decrease was primarily driven by an 8.8% decrease in comparable store sales. We experienced soft sales in many of our product categories. Areas showing sales growth were prepaid wireless, portable speakers, music accessories, and AC adaptors.     Gross profit decreased by $298.2 million, or 20.3%, to $1,172.2 million when compared with last year. This decrease was primarily driven by our lower revenue and our lower gross margin rate. The gross margin rate decreased from last year by 4.3 percentage points to 34.1%. This was a result of: a change in sales mix towards higher-priced and lower gross margin rate smartphones; an inventory write off of $46.6 million in the third quarter associated with product we have removed from our assortment; and more aggressive sales promotions such as aggressive discounts, clearance events, and customer coupons.     Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense decreased $12.4 million, or 0.9%, when compared with last year. The decrease in SG&A expense was driven primarily by fewer stores in operation during 2013 versus 2012, and by lower severance costs in 2013 when compared to 2012 primarily due to severance paid in 2012 to our former Chief Executive Officer and other corporate headquarters staff reductions. These decreases were partially offset by increased professional fees and increased self-insurance costs related to workers compensation and theft losses.     As a result of the factors above, we incurred an operating loss of $344.0 million, compared with an operating loss of $25.0 million last year. Operating income for our U.S. company-operated stores segment was $73.8 million, compared with $337.7 million last year.     Loss from continuing operations was $392.0 million, or $3.89 per diluted share, in 2013, compared with a loss from continuing operations of $110.8 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, in 2012.     Update on Postpaid Wireless Business  The combination of the following factors at our U.S. company-operated stores contributed to the substantial decrease in consolidated gross profit over the past two years:         ·      Total postpaid units sold decreased by 23% in 2013 and decreased by 20% in 2012            ·      The average cost per unit sold increased by 14.3% in 2013 and increased by 36% in 2012            ·      The average revenue per unit sold increased by 7% in 2013 and increased 19% in 2012        The decrease in the number of postpaid units sold at our U.S. company-operated stores was primarily driven by lower than anticipated adoption of new handsets.     The increase in the average revenue per postpaid unit was primarily driven by a change in our sales mix towards higher-priced smartphones, partially offset by an increase in commissions repaid to wireless service providers related to customers whose wireless handsets were deactivated from a wireless network. This deactivation took place either because they could not afford to, or chose not to, pay the monthly payments for wireless service associated with their smartphones. For further discussion of our accounting for these service deactivations, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” later in this MD&A.     Discontinued Operations  We ceased operating all of our Target Mobile centers prior to March 31, 2013, and since then have concluded that the cash flows from these centers were eliminated from our ongoing operations. Therefore, the results of these operations, net of income taxes, have been presented as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented.          19             Capital Transactions  During 2013 we took a number of actions regarding our liquidity:         ·      We repaid $286.9 million remaining aggregate principal amount of our 2013 convertible notes            ·      In December we borrowed $300 million in secured term loans and repaid $175 million of debt            ·      Also in December we closed on a new $535 million asset-based revolving credit facility that matures in December 2018 (“2018 Credit Facility”) to replace our previous $450 million asset-based revolving credit facility        Liquidity Outlook  As of December 31, 2013, we had $179.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $535.7 million at December 31, 2012. Additionally, we had a credit facility of $535 million with availability of $374.5 million as of December 31, 2013. This resulted in a total liquidity position of $554.3 million at December 31, 2013.     We experienced losses of $400.2 million and $139.4 million in 2013 and 2012. In 2013 our net cash provided by operating activities was $35.8 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $43.0 million in 2012.     We currently use our 2018 Credit Facility to provide letters of credit to a limited number of vendors. Based on our forecast for 2014, we anticipate that we will continue to use part of our availability under the credit facility for letters of credit and other corporate purposes.     As we execute the strategic turnaround plan and move through 2014, we will be tightly managing our cash and monitoring our liquidity position. We have implemented a number of initiatives to conserve our liquidity position including activities such as reducing our capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending and selling surplus property. Many of the aspects of the plan involve management’s judgments and estimates that include factors that could be beyond our control and actual results could differ from our estimates. These and other factors could cause the strategic turnaround plan and the proposed store closure program to be unsuccessful which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.     Store Closure Program : On March 4, 2014, along with our fourth quarter earnings release, we announced that we intend to close up to 1,100 underperforming stores. This program was driven by a comprehensive review of the existing store base and selection of stores based upon historical and projected financial performance, lease termination costs, and impact to the market and nearby stores. This proposed store closure program is expected to preserve liquidity by avoiding operating losses and generating cash by liquidating inventory in those stores. This will be partially offset by lease termination payments and liquidation costs. This program resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of fixed assets in these stores of $11.2 million and an inventory write down of $10.1 million, reflected in the 2013 financial statements. The proposed store closure program is subject to the consent of the lenders  under our 2018 Credit Agreement and 2018 Term Loan. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining consent, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations through 2014.     We have considered the impact of our financial projections on our liquidity analysis and have evaluated the appropriateness of the key assumptions in our forecast such as sales, gross profit and SG&A expenses. We have analyzed our cash requirements, including our inventory position, other working capital changes, capital expenditures and borrowing availability under our credit facility. Based upon these evaluations and analyses, we expect that our anticipated sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our obligations through 2014.     If our results fall below our expectations, we may use the liquidity provided by the availability on our credit facility or  take additional actions that would be outside the ordinary course of business. Other actions could include: raising additional capital by issuing debt or equity, further reducing our capital expenditures, reducing inventory levels, closing additional stores, reducing our employee headcount, or selling one or more subsidiaries.     For further discussion of our liquidity, please see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” later in this MD&A.     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     2013 COMPARED WITH 2012     Net Sales and Operating Revenues  Consolidated net sales and operating revenues are as follows:          Year Ended December 31,     (In millions)    2013        2012        2011      U.S. RadioShack  company-operated stores     $     3,094.9             $     3,456.5             $     3,663.3          Other         339.4                  374.8                  368.8           Consolidated net sales  and operating revenues     $     3,434.3             $     3,831.3             $     4,032.1                                                             Consolidated net sales and  operating revenues  decrease           (10.4)    %             (5.0)    %             (4.0)    %      Comparable store sales  (1)  decrease          (8.8)    %             (4.5)    %             (3.2)    %           (1)    Comparable store sales include the sales of U.S. and Mexico RadioShack company-operated stores with more than 12 full months of recorded sales.       Product Platform Consolidation     To reflect more closely how we manage our merchandise and product assortment, we have consolidated our product platform reporting structure into two platforms:  mobility and retail.          20             These platforms include the following product categories:     Mobility:   The mobility platform includes postpaid and prepaid wireless handsets, commissions, residual income, prepaid wireless airtime, e-readers, and tablet devices. Our wireless accessories and tablet accessories, which were previously included in our signature platform, are now also included in this platform.     Retail:   Our retail platform includes our remaining consumer electronics product categories and related accessories; batteries and power products; and technical products. This platform now also consists of products that were previously included in our signature and consumer electronics platforms, except wireless accessories and tablet accessories, which are now included in the mobility platform. The following table provides a summary of our consolidated net sales and operating revenues by platform and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to our current presentation.                 Consolidated Net Sales and Operating Revenues             Year Ended December 31,     (In millions)        2013        2012        2011     Mobility  (1)        $     1,799.7                  52.4     %        $     2,008.6                  52.4     %        $     2,014.8                  50.0     %     Retail             1,612.2                  46.9                  1,794.0                  46.8                  1,992.1                  49.4          Other sales  (2)             22.4                  0.7                  28.7                  0.8                  25.2                  0.6          Consolidated net sales and operating revenues        $     3,434.3                  100.0     %        $     3,831.3                  100.0     %        $     4,032.1                  100.0     %            (1)    The aggregate amounts of upfront commission revenue and residual income received from wireless service providers and recorded in this platform were $851.1 million, $1,029.6 million and $1,233.1 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.     (2)    Other sales include outside sales from repair services and outside sales of our global sourcing operations and domestic and overseas manufacturing facilities. We closed our overseas manufacturing facility in June 2011.       U.S. RadioShack Company-Operated Stores Segment     The following table provides a summary of our net sales and operating revenues by platform and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues for the U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores segment.                                                                                                                   U.S. RadioShack Company-Operated Stores Segment             Net Sales and Operating Revenues             Year Ended December 31,     (In millions)        2013        2012        2011     Mobility        $     1,706.2                  55.1     %        $     1,923.0                  55.6     %        $     1,935.3                  52.8     %     Retail             1,388.7                  44.9                  1,533.5                  44.4                  1,728.0                  47.2          Net sales and operating revenues        $     3,094.9                  100.0     %        $     3,456.5                  100.0     %        $     3,663.3                  100.0     %       Sales in our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores segment decreased $361.6 million or 10.5% in 2013. These decreases in sales were driven by decreased sales in our mobility and retail platforms. Additionally, we operated  98  fewer stores at December 31, 2013, than we did at December 31, 2012, which contributed to a decrease in consolidated sales and affected the sales results for each platform discussed below.     Sales in our mobility platform (which includes postpaid and prepaid wireless handsets, commissions and residual income, prepaid wireless airtime, e-readers, tablet devices, wireless accessories, and tablet accessories) decreased  11.3%  in 2013. This decrease in sales was primarily driven by decreased sales in our postpaid wireless business, which were partially offset by increased sales in our prepaid wireless business. Comparable store sales in this platform decreased 9.0% in 2013.     The sales decrease in our postpaid wireless business was driven by a decrease in the number of postpaid units sold, which was partially offset by an increase in the average revenue per unit sold. The decrease in the number of postpaid wireless handsets sold was primarily driven by decreased unit sales in our postpaid wireless business.     The increase in the average revenue per postpaid unit was primarily driven by a change in our sales mix towards higher-priced smartphones, which was partially offset by an increase in commissions repaid to wireless service providers related to wireless handset deactivations. See the executive summary of this MD&A for further discussion of these wireless handset deactivations.     Sales in our retail platform (which includes our remaining consumer electronics product categories and related accessories; batteries and power products; and technical products) decreased 9.4% in 2013. This sales decrease was primarily driven by decreased sales of laptop computers, batteries, internet telephone devices, home entertainment accessories, digital music players, headphones, and GPS devices. These sales decreases were partially offset by increased sales of portable speakers and sales of Apple Lightning compatible cables and adaptors. Comparable store sales in this platform decreased 8.5% in 2013.     Other Sales     Amounts in other sales reflect our business activities that are not separately reportable, including sales to our independent dealers, sales generated by our Mexican subsidiary and our  www.radioshack.com  website, sales to commercial customers, and sales to other third parties through our global sourcing operations. Each of these business activities accounted for less than 5% of our consolidated net sales and operating revenues in 2013. Other sales decreased $35.4 million, or 9.4%, when compared with last year. This sales decrease was driven primarily by sales decreases to our independent dealers and at radioshack.com.          21             Gross Profit  Consolidated gross profit and gross margin are as follows:                                                            Year Ended December 31,     (In millions)    2013        2012        2011     Gross profit    $     1,172.2             $     1,470.4             $     1,722.4          Gross profit decrease         (20.3)    %             (14.6)    %             (8.9)    %                                                      Gross margin rate         34.1     %             38.4     %             42.7     %       Gross profit decreased by $298.2 million, or 20.3%, to $1,172.2 million when compared with last year. This decrease was primarily driven by our decreased revenue and our decreased gross margin rate. Gross margin rate decreased by 4.3 percentage points from last year to 34.1%. The decrease in our consolidated gross margin rate was a result of: a change in sales mix towards higher-priced and lower gross margin rate smartphones; inventory valuation losses associated with our transition to an improved merchandise assortment; more aggressive sales promotions such as aggressive discounts, clearance events, and customer coupons; and inventory write downs related to our proposed store closure program.     Selling, General and Administrative Expense  Our consolidated SG&A expense decreased 0.9%, or $12.4 million, in 2013. SG&A as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues increased 3.9 percentage points when compared with 2012. This percentage point increase was a result of our decrease in net sales and operating revenues in 2013. The table below summarizes the breakdown of various components of our consolidated SG&A expense and their related percentages of total net sales and operating revenues.                Year Ended December 31,             2013        2012        2011                     % of                % of                % of     (In millions)        Dollars        Revenues        Dollars        Revenues        Dollars        Revenues     Compensation        $     594.6                  17.3     %        $     618.1                  16.1     %        $     621.0                  15.4     %     Rent and occupancy             249.1                  7.3                  252.3                  6.6                  261.5                  6.5          Advertising             176.2                  5.1                  175.8                  4.6                  203.1                  5.0          Other             387.5                  11.3                  373.6                  9.8                  389.1                  9.7                  $     1,407.4                  41.0     %        $     1,419.8                  37.1     %        $     1,474.7                  36.6     %       The decrease in SG&A expense was driven by the fact that we operated fewer stores in 2013 than in 2012, and by $8.5 million in severance costs recognized in 2012 in connection with the departure of our Chief Executive Officer combined with the termination of employment of certain corporate headquarters support staff. The increase in Other SG&A was driven by increased professional fees and increased self-insurance costs related to workers compensation and theft losses. This increase was partially offset by the receipt of $5.3 million from a non-merchandise vendor as settlement of a dispute and a $2.4 million gain on the sale of a building.     Depreciation and Amortization  The table below provides a summary of our total depreciation and amortization by segment.                                                           Year Ended December 31,     (In millions)    2013        2012        2011      U.S. RadioShack  company-operated stores     $     29.9             $     31.8             $     37.9          Other         4.4                  3.8                  4.0          Unallocated         36.1                  38.7                  36.2            Total depreciation and  amortization from  continuing operations      $     70.4             $     74.3             $     78.1            The table below provides an analysis of total depreciation and amortization.                                                            Year Ended December 31,     (In millions)    2013        2012        2011      Depreciation and  amortization expense     $     61.4             $     65.9             $     70.6            Depreciation and  amortization included  in cost of products sold           9.0                  8.4                  7.5            Total depreciation and  amortization from  continuing operations      $     70.4             $     74.3             $     78.1            The decreasing trend in depreciation expense from 2011 to 2013 was driven by lower capital expenditures in 2012 and 2013, combined with increased long-lived asset impairments during these periods.     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill  Impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill was $47.4 million in 2013 compared with $9.7 million in 2012.     U.S. RadioShack Company-Operated Stores:  Impairments for long-lived assets held and used in certain stores were $23.3 million in 2013, compared with $9.7 million in 2012. The 2012 amounts included a goodwill impairment charge of $3.0 related to our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores reporting unit. The remaining increases were primarily driven by increases in the number of stores that were evaluated for impairment during the periods because of their decreased operating results. If our operating results do not improve, we will continue to incur a similar or higher amount of long-lived asset impairments for U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores in future periods.          22             Net Interest Expense  Consolidated net interest expense, which is interest expense net of interest income, was $50.1 million in 2013, compared with $52.6 million in  2012 .     In 2013 and 2012, interest expense consisted primarily of interest paid at the stated coupon rate on our outstanding notes, the non-cash amortization of the discounts on our long-term debt, and interest paid on our term loans. Interest expense decreased $ 2.2  million in  2013. This decrease was driven by the decreased average amount of long-term debt outstanding during 2013. Non-cash interest expense was $7.3 million in 2013 compared with $16.3 million in 2012.     Interest income increased $0.3 million in 2013. This increase was driven by $1.0 million of interest income received in 2013 related to a federal excise tax refund, which was partially offset by decreased interest income due to our decreased average amount of cash and cash equivalents in 2013.     Income Tax Expense  Our effective tax rate for 2013 was a positive 3.2%, compared with a negative 41.7% for 2012. The 2013 effective tax rate was affected by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and the reversal of interest accrued thereon in the amount of $21.0 million, primarily related to the effective settlement of certain federal and state income tax matters. This income tax benefit was partially offset by state and foreign income taxes recognized in certain jurisdictions, interest accrued with respect to our unrecognized tax benefits, and a valuation allowance established against the net deferred tax assets of our foreign subsidiary, RadioShack de Mexico. See Note 10 – “Income Taxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our 2013 income tax expense and valuation allowance.     2012 COMPARED WITH 2011     Net Sales and Operating Revenues  Net sales and operating revenues decreased $200.8 million, or 5.0%, to $3,831.3 million in 2012 when compared with 2011. This decrease was primarily driven by a 4.5% decrease in comparable store sales.     U.S. RadioShack Company-Operated Stores Segment     Sales in our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores segment decreased $206.8 million or 5.6% in 2012.     Sales in our mobility platform decreased  0.6%  in 2012. This decrease in sales was primarily driven by decreased sales in our postpaid wireless business. This decrease was substantially offset by increased sales of wireless accessories, tablet devices and tablet accessories.     The sales decrease in our postpaid wireless business was driven by a decrease in the number of postpaid units sold, which was partially offset by an increase in the average revenue per unit sold. The decrease in the number of postpaid wireless handsets sold was primarily driven by decreased unit sales in our Sprint and AT&T postpaid wireless businesses.     Some of the factors contributing to our lower unit sales were changes in Sprint’s customer and credit models and the discontinuation of Sprint’s early upgrade program for certain customers that began in mid-2011; higher sales in the third quarter of 2011 related to a special wireless handset promotion; the soft postpaid market due to consumer anticipation of the iPhone 5 launch; and inventory supply constraints during the initial iPhone 5 launch period.     The increase in the average revenue per postpaid unit was primarily driven by a change in our sales mix towards higher-priced smartphones, which was partially offset by an increase in commissions repaid to wireless service providers related to wireless handset deactivations. See the executive summary of this MD&A for further discussion of these wireless handset deactivations.     Sales in our retail platform decreased 11.3% in 2012. This sales decrease was driven by sales declines in laptop computers, cameras, music players, GPS devices, home entertainment accessories, televisions, and personal computer accessories. The decrease in sales for many of these categories has been driven by the migration of the capabilities of these products into smartphones. These sales decreases were partially offset by increased sales of headphones.     Other Sales     Amounts in other sales reflect our business activities that are not separately reportable, including sales to our independent dealers, sales generated by our  www.radioshack.com  website, and sales at our Mexican subsidiary. Each of these business activities accounted for less than 5% of our consolidated net sales and operating revenues in 2012. Other sales increased slightly in 2012, when compared with 2011. Our sales increased at our Mexican subsidiary due to new store openings, but this increase was substantially offset by decreased sales to our U.S. independent dealers. Additionally, we recognized $3.0 million of franchise fee revenue in the third quarter of 2012 related to the opening of our first franchised stores in Southeast Asia.     Gross Profit  Consolidated gross profit and gross margin for 2012 were $1,470.4 million and 38.4%, respectively, compared with $1,722.4 million and 42.7%, respectively, in 2011, resulting in a 14.6% decrease in gross profit dollars and a 4.3 percentage point decrease in our gross margin. These decreases were primarily driven by decreased gross profit of the postpaid wireless business in our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores.          23             The decrease in gross profit dollars of the postpaid wireless business in our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores was the result of decreases in 2012 in the number of units sold and in the average gross profit dollars per unit sold, when compared with 2011. Average gross profit dollars per unit sold decreased because our average cost per unit increased from last year at a higher rate than the increase in our average revenue per unit. The increase in average cost per unit was driven by the change in our sales mix towards higher cost smartphones such as the Apple iPhone and Android-based smartphones.     The decrease in our consolidated gross margin rate was a result of the decrease in the gross margin rate of the postpaid wireless business in our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores. The decrease in the gross margin rate of our postpaid wireless business was driven by a change in our sales mix towards lower-margin smartphones and a decrease in the average gross profit dollars per unit sold.     When excluding the postpaid wireless business, the gross margin rate for the balance of our business was comparable to 2011.     Selling, General and Administrative Expense  Our consolidated SG&A expense decreased 3.7%, or $54.9 million, in 2012. SG&A as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues increased by 0.5 percentage points when compared with 2011.     The decrease in SG&A expense was driven by decreased advertising expense, decreased rent and occupancy expense, and decreased compensation expense in the second half of 2012. Additionally, SG&A in 2012 was lower due to a one-time $23.4 million charge in 2011 related to our transition from T-Mobile to Verizon and a one-time $9.5 million charge in 2011 related to the closure of our Chinese manufacturing plant. These decreases were partially offset by severance costs of $8.5 million in connection with the departure of our Chief Executive Officer combined with the termination of employment of certain corporate headquarters support staff in the third quarter of 2012.     We announced on September 25, 2012, that our Board of Directors and Mr. James F. Gooch had agreed that Mr. Gooch would step down from his position as Chief Executive Officer and as a director of the Company, effective immediately. Under Mr. Gooch’s employment agreement, he was entitled to a specified cash payment and the accelerated vesting of certain stock awards. During the third quarter ended September 30, 2012, we recorded $5.6 million of employee separation charges in connection with Mr. Gooch’s departure. This included a cash charge of $4.0 million and a non-cash charge of $1.6 million related to the accelerated vesting of stock awards.     During the third quarter ended September 30, 2012, we recorded $2.9 million of employee separation charges in connection with the termination of the employment of approximately 150 employees, who worked primarily at our corporate headquarters.     Depreciation and Amortization  Total depreciation and amortization from continuing operations for 2012 declined $3.8 million or 4.9%.     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill  Impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill was $9.7 million in 2012 compared with $3.1 million in 2011.     U.S. RadioShack Company-Operated Stores:  I mpairments for long-lived assets held and used in certain stores were $6.7 million in 2012 compared with $3.1 million in 2011. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in the number of stores that were evaluated for impairment throughout 2012 because of their decreased operating results.     Goodwill Impairment:   For the first half of 2012, we experienced a significant decline in the market capitalization of our common stock, which was driven primarily by lower than expected operating results. Our market capitalization was lower than our consolidated net book value for much of this period. We determined that these facts were an indicator that we should conduct an interim goodwill impairment test in the third quarter.     After reviewing our reporting units, we determined that the fair value of our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores reporting unit could not support its $3.0 million of goodwill due to our lower market capitalization. This resulted in a $3.0 million impairment charge that was included in our operating results for the third quarter of 2012. Our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores reporting unit is comprised of our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores operating segment, our overhead and corporate expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments, and all of our interest expense.     Net Interest Expense  Consolidated net interest expense, which is interest expense net of interest income, was $52.6 million in 2012, compared with $43.7 million in  2011 .     In 2012 and 2011, interest expense consisted primarily of interest paid at the stated coupon rate on our outstanding notes, the non-cash amortization of the discounts on our long-term debt, and interest paid on our term loans. Interest expense increased $ 7.7  million in  2012. This increase was driven by the increased average amount of long-term debt outstanding during 2012. Non-cash interest expense was $16.3 million in 2012 compared with $17.0 million in 2011.     Income Tax Expense  Our effective tax rate for 2012 was a negative 41.7%, compared with a positive 37.6% for 2011. The 2012 effective tax rate was affected by a valuation allowance in the amount of $62.7 million that we established to reduce our U.S. deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was partially offset by an income tax benefit related to our current year operating loss. See Note 10 – “Income Taxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our 2012 income tax expense and valuation allowance.          24                The 2011 effective tax rate was affected by the realization of job retention credits generated pursuant to the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act. These credits lowered the effective tax rate by 1.0 percentage points.     RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  None.     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     Cash Flow Overview     Operating Activities:  Cash provided by operating activities in 2013 was $35.8 million, compared with cash used in operating activities of $43.0 million in 2012. Our cash flows from operating activities are comprised of net loss plus non-cash adjustments to net loss and the net changes in assets and liabilities. The amounts of cash provided by net loss plus non-cash adjustments to net loss were negative $250.6 million and $59.9 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in net loss plus non-cash adjustments was primarily driven by our increased net loss in 2013.     The amount of cash provided by the net changes in assets and liabilities was $286.4 million in 2013, compared with cash used by the net changes in assets and liabilities of $102.9 million in 2012. The increase in cash provided by the net changes in assets and liabilities in 2013 was primarily driven by cash provided by our decreased accounts receivable and inventory balances at December 31, 2013. The decrease in our accounts receivable balance in 2013 was driven by the decrease in our postpaid wireless business and the collection of a tax refund in 2013. The decrease in our inventory balance in 2013 was primarily due to the discontinuation of our Target Mobile segment and reduced inventories at our Mexican subsidiary.     Investing Activities:  The amounts of cash used in investing activities were $78.2 million and $94.2 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. This decrease was driven by decreased capital expenditures in 2013, which were partially offset by an increase in our restricted cash balance. For further discussion of our restricted cash, see “Cash Requirements” later in this MD&A. Capital expenditures were $42.3 million in 2013 compared with $67.8 million in 2012. This decrease was a result of our efforts to focus our capital spending on our U.S. stores to high-impact, cost-efficient initiatives, as well as reduced capital spending at our Mexican subsidiary related to fewer new store openings in 2013. Capital expenditures primarily related to our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores and information system projects in 2013 and 2012.     Financing Activities:  Net cash used in financing activities was $313.5 million in 2013 compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $81.2 million in 2012. Our net cash used in financing activities in 2013 was due to the repayment of $461.9 million of long-term debt. This was partially offset by $256.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. Additionally, our changes in cash overdrafts resulted in a $108.3 million use of cash.     Our net cash provided by financing activities in 2012 was primarily due to the $175.0 million of new borrowings. These borrowings were partially offset by the purchase of $88.1 million principal amount of our 2013 convertible notes and our dividend payments of $24.9 million.     Free Cash Flow:   Our free cash flow, defined as cash flows from operating activities less dividends paid and additions to property, plant and equipment, was negative $6.5 million in 2013, negative $135.7 million in 2012, and $86.2 million in 2011. The increase in free cash flow for 2013 was attributable to cash provided by the net changes in our assets and liabilities described above.     We believe free cash flow is a relevant indicator of our ability to repay maturing debt, change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that management believes will enhance shareholder value. See “Liquidity Outlook” in the executive summary of this MD&A for further discussion of our sources of liquidity and our cash requirements in future periods. The comparable financial measure to free cash flow under generally accepted accounting principles is net cash flows provided by or used in operating activities. Net cash flows provided by operating activities was $35.8 million in 2013, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $43.0 million in 2012 and cash provided by operating activities of $217.9 million in 2011. We do not intend for the presentation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, nor do we intend to imply that free cash flow represents cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.     The following table is a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow.                                                            Year Ended December 31,     (In millions)    2013        2012        2011       Net cash  provided by (used in)  operating activities      $     35.8             $     (43.0)            $     217.9          Less:                                                  Additions to property, plant  and equipment          42.3                  67.8                  82.1          Dividends paid         --                 24.9                  49.6          Free cash flow    $     (6.5)            $     (135.7)            $     86.2                   25             SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY  As of December 31, 2013, we had $179.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $535.7 million as of December 31, 2012. The table below lists our credit commitments from various financial institutions at December 31, 2013.                 Commitment Expiration per Period             Total Amounts        Less Than                        Over     (In millions)        Committed        1 Year        1-3 Years        3-5 Years        5 Years     Lines of credit  (1)        $     535.0             $     --            $     --            $     535.0             $     --         Total commercial commitments        $     535.0             $     --            $     --            $     535.0             $     --                (1)    At December 31, 2013 our maximum availability for revolving borrowings was $429.5 million. No revolving borrowings have been made under the facility, and letters of credit totaling $55.0 million had been issued as of December 31, 2013, resulting in $374.5 million of availability for revolving borrowings.       2018 Credit Facility:   In December 2013, we entered into a five-year, $585 million asset-based credit agreement (“2018 Credit Agreement”) with a group of lenders with General Electric Capital Corporation as administrative and collateral agent. The 2018 Credit Agreement consists of a $535 million asset-based revolving credit line (“2018 Credit Facility”) and a $50 million asset-based term loan (“2018 Credit Agreement Term Loan”). The 2018 Credit Agreement expires in December 2018. The 2018 Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes and the issuance of letters of credit.     Obligations under the 2018 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by all of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries except Tandy Life Insurance Company. The 2018 Credit Agreement is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets, including a first priority lien on current assets, and a second priority lien on fixed assets, intellectual property, and the equity interests of our direct and indirect subsidiaries.     Revolving borrowings under the 2018 Credit Facility bear interest at our choice of a bank’s prime rate plus 1.0% to 1.5% or LIBOR plus 2.0% to 2.5%. The applicable rates in these ranges are based on the aggregate average unused availability under the facility. The 2018 Credit Facility also contains a $150 million sub-limit for the issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit. The issuance of letters of credit reduces the amount available under the facility. Letter of credit fees range from 2.0% to 2.5%. We pay commitment fees to the lenders at an annual rate of 0.5% of the unused amount of the facility.     The availability of credit under the 2018 Credit Facility is limited at any time to the lesser of $535 million and the amount of the revolving borrowing base at such time, in each case, less the principal amount of loans and letters of credit then-outstanding under the 2018 Credit Facility. The revolving borrowing base is based on percentages of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory and is subject to certain reserves. In addition, the revolving borrowing base is reduced by a minimum availability block equal to approximately 10% of the revolving borrowing base. The borrowing capacity is reduced by $35 million if the revolving borrowing base is less than $150 million.     If at any time the outstanding revolving borrowings and term loans under the 2018 Credit Facility exceed the revolving borrowing base, we will be required to repay an amount equal to such excess. If we or any of our subsidiaries that are guarantors of our obligations under the 2018 Credit Agreement sell assets on which the lenders under the 2018 Credit Agreement have a first priority lien (other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business), we must use the net proceeds from the sale to repay amounts outstanding under the 2018 Credit Agreement.     As of December 31, 2013, our maximum availability for revolving borrowings under the 2018 Credit Facility was $429.5 million. As of December 31, 2013, no revolving borrowings had been made under the facility, and letters of credit totaling $55.0 million had been issued, resulting in $374.5 million of remaining availability for revolving borrowings under the 2018 Credit Facility.     The 2018 Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, the occurrence of which could result in the acceleration of our obligation to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the agreement.     The 2018 Credit Agreement includes covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability to:         ·      Incur additional debt, including guarantees;            ·      Make acquisitions, loans or investments;            ·      Pay dividends or repurchase our common stock;            ·      Create liens on our property;            ·      Change the nature of our business;            ·      Dispose of assets, including in connection with store closures;            ·      Amend or terminate certain material agreements;            ·      Engage in sale and leaseback transactions; and            ·      Consolidate or merge with or into other companies or sell all or substantially all our assets.        At December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with these covenants.     CASH REQUIREMENTS     Capital Expenditures:   The nature of our capital expenditures is comprised of a base level of investment required to support our current operations and a discretionary amount related to our strategic initiatives. Any remaining amount of capital expenditures relates to strategic initiatives as reflected in our annual plan. These capital expenditures are discretionary and, therefore, may not be spent if we decide not to pursue one or more of our strategic initiatives. We estimate that our capital expenditures for 2014 will be approximately $50 million based on our operating performance during the year. U.S. RadioShack company-operated store remodels and relocations and information systems projects will account for the majority of our anticipated 2014 capital expenditures. The funding required for capital expenditures will be from cash and cash equivalents, any cash generated from operating activities, and our 2018 Credit Facility.          26             Restricted Cash:  Restricted cash totaled $66.0 million at December 31, 2013, and is included in other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. This cash is pledged as collateral for standby and trade letters of credit. We were required to pledge this cash as collateral in connection with the closing of our 2018 Credit Agreement. Subsequent to December 31, 2013, we have withdrawn this cash and have provided letters of credit issued under our 2018 Credit Facility for a portion of the withdrawn cash.     Seasonal Inventory Buildup:   Our expected annual cash requirements for pre-seasonal inventory buildup from August to November range between $100 million and $150 million. The funding required for this buildup will be from cash and cash equivalents, any cash generated from operating activities, and our 2018 Credit Facility.     Operating Leases:   We use operating leases, primarily for our retail locations and our corporate campus, to lower our capital requirements.     Contractual Obligations   The table below contains our known contractual commitments as of December 31, 2013.                                                                                                    Payments Due by Period                     Less Than                        More than     (In millions)        Total        1 Year        1-3 Years        3-5 Years        5 Years     Long-term debt obligations  (1)        $     626.4             $     1.1             $     0.3             $     300.0             $     325.0          Interest obligations             272.4                  53.7                  106.0                  104.5                  8.2          Operating lease obligations  (2)             588.9                  200.4                  253.5                  96.8                  38.2          Purchase obligations  (3)             260.5                  255.2                  5.3                  --                 --         Other long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet  (4)             152.8                  --                 21.7                  7.7                  123.4          Total contractual commitments        $     1,901.0             $     510.4             $     386.8             $     509.0             $     494.8                 (1)    For more information regarding long-term debt, refer to Note 5 – “Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.     (2)    For more information regarding lease commitments, refer to Note 13 – “Commitments and Contingencies” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.     (3)    Purchase obligations primarily include our product commitments and marketing agreements.     (4)    These long-term liabilities reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet represent contractual obligations for which we could reasonably estimate the timing of cash payments. The remaining non-current liabilities reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet did not represent contractual obligations for future cash payments.       In 2013 we entered into a $50 million secured term loan and a $250 million secured term loan. Both of these loans are due in December 2018. In connection with these borrowings, we repaid $175 million aggregate principal amount of existing secured term loans. Additionally, we repaid the remaining $286.9 million of our 2.5% convertible notes in 2013. For more information regarding our long-term debt, refer to Note 5 – “Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Capitalization  The declaration of dividends, the dividend rate, and the amount and timing of share repurchases are at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, and plans for future dividends and share repurchases may be revised by the Board of Directors at any time. We did not pay any dividends during 2013. We do not currently intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.     The following table sets forth information about our capitalization on the dates indicated.                                                                           December 31,         2013        2012                 % of                % of     (Dollars in millions)    Dollars        Total        Dollars        Total     Short-term debt    $     1.1                  0.1     %        $     278.7                  20.2     %     Long-term debt         613.0                  74.7                  499.0                  36.3          Total debt         614.1                  74.8                  777.7                  56.5           Stockholders'  equity          206.4                  25.2                  598.7                  43.5          Total capitalization    $     820.5                  100.0     %        $     1,376.4                  100.0     %          Dividends:   We paid a dividend of $0.125 per share in the first and second quarters of 2012 and an annual dividend of $0.50 per share in 2011.   Our dividend payments totaled $24.9 million and $49.6 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, and were funded from cash on hand. On July 25, 2012, we announced that we were suspending our dividend.     2011 Share Repurchase Program:  In October 2011 our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with no expiration date authorizing management to repurchase up to $200 million of our common stock to be executed through open market or private transactions. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we paid $11.9 million to purchase approximately 0.9 million shares of our common stock in open market purchases. As of December 31, 2011, there was $188.1 million available for share repurchases under this program. We announced on January 30, 2012, that we had suspended further share repurchases under this program.          27             2008 Share Repurchase Program:  During the second quarter of 2011, we paid $101.4 million to purchase 6.3 million shares of our common stock in open market purchases. This completed our purchases under our 2008 share repurchase program.     OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  Other than the operating leases described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, transactions, or special purpose entities.     INFLATION  Inflation has not significantly affected us over the past three years. We do not expect inflation to have a significant effect on our operations in the foreseeable future.     CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States. The application of GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements and is affected by management’s judgment and uncertainties. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current market trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant and reasonable at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. We continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.     In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are revenue recognition; inventory valuation; estimation of reserves and valuation allowances specifically related to insurance, tax and legal contingencies; valuation of long-lived assets and goodwill; and stock-based compensation.     We consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires difficult, subjective or complex judgments, and is material to the portrayal of our financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. The selection, application and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.     Revenue Recognition     Description     Our revenue is derived principally from the sale of name brand and private brand products and services to consumers. Revenue is recognized, net of an estimate for customer refunds and product returns, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.     Certain products, such as wireless telephone handsets, require the customer to use the services of a third-party wireless service provider. The wireless service provider pays us an upfront commission for obtaining a new customer or upgrading an existing customer and, in some cases, a monthly recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the service provider and the customer. For certain new customers the upfront commission revenue is repaid to the wireless service provider if the wireless handset is subsequently deactivated from the wireless network during a specified period. Our sale of an activated wireless handset is the single event required to meet the delivery criterion for both the upfront commission and the recurring residual revenue. Upfront commission revenue, net of estimated wireless service deactivations, is recognized at the time an activated wireless handset is sold to the customer at the point-of-sale. Recurring residual revenue, which is not fixed and determinable at the point of sale, is recognized as earned under the terms of each contract with the wireless service provider, which is typically as the wireless service provider bills its customer, generally on a monthly basis.     Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate     Our revenue recognition accounting methodology requires us to make certain judgments regarding the estimate of future sales returns and wireless service deactivations. Our estimates for product refunds and returns, wireless service deactivations and commission revenue adjustments are based on historical information pertaining to these items. Based on our extensive history in selling activated wireless handsets, we have been able to establish reliable estimates for wireless service deactivations. However, our estimates for wireless service deactivations can be affected by certain characteristics of and decisions made by our service providers. These factors include changes in the quality of their customer service, the quality and performance of their networks, their rate plan offerings, their policies regarding extensions of customer credit, and their wireless handset product offerings. These factors add uncertainty to our estimates.     Effect if actual results differ from assumptions     We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate sales returns or wireless service deactivations during the past three fiscal years. We continue to update our estimate for wireless service deactivations to reflect the most recently available information regarding the characteristics of and decisions made by our service providers discussed above. If actual results differ from our estimates due to these or various other factors, the amount of revenue recorded could be materially affected. A 10% difference in our reserves for the estimates noted above would have affected net sales and operating revenues by approximately $2.5 million in 2013.          28             Inventory Valuation     Description     Our inventory consists primarily of finished goods available for sale at our retail locations or within our distribution centers and is recorded at the lower of cost - on a first-in first-out basis - or market. The cost components recorded within inventory are the vendor invoice cost, which is net of vendor allowances, and certain allocated freight, distribution, warehousing and other costs relating to merchandise acquisition required to bring the merchandise from the vendor to the location where it is offered for sale.     Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate     Typically, the market value of our inventory is higher than its aggregate cost. Determination of the market value may be very complex and, therefore, requires a high degree of judgment. In order for management to make the appropriate determination of market value, the following items are commonly considered: inventory turnover statistics, current selling prices, seasonality factors, consumer trends, competitive pricing, performance of similar products or accessories, planned promotional incentives, technological obsolescence, and estimated costs to sell or dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions.     If the estimated market value, calculated as the amount we expect to realize, net of estimated selling costs, from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory, is determined to be less than the recorded cost, we record a provision to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item to its net realizable value.     Effect if actual results differ from assumptions     We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves during the past three fiscal years, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to estimate our inventory valuation reserves. Differences between management estimates and actual performance and pricing of our merchandise could result in inventory valuations that differ from the amount recorded at the financial statement date and could also cause fluctuations in the amount of recorded cost of products sold. If our estimates regarding market value are inaccurate or changes in consumer demand affect certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may be exposed to material losses or gains in excess of our established valuation reserve. We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our inventory valuation reserves. However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves.     Estimation of Reserves and Valuation Allowances for Self-Insurance, Income Taxes, and Litigation Contingencies     Description     The amount of liability or valuation allowance we record related to insurance claims, tax positions, and legal contingencies requires us to make judgments about the amount of expense that will ultimately be incurred or the realization of certain assets.     We are insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation, property and other liability claims, with deductibles up to $1.0 million per occurrence. This insurance coverage limits our exposure for any catastrophic claims that result in liability in excess of the deductible. We also have a self-insured health program administered by a third-party covering the majority of our employees that participate in our health insurance programs. We estimate the amount of our reserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reporting period. This estimate is based on historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, actuarial assumptions, and other factors we deem relevant.     We are subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities related to income tax, sales and use tax, personal property tax, and other forms of taxation. These audits examine our tax positions, timing of income and deductions, and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions. Our accounting for tax estimates and contingencies requires us to evaluate tax issues and establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of the probability of realizing these tax exposures. Depending on the nature of the tax issue, we could be subject to audit over several years; therefore, our estimated reserve balances might exist for multiple years before an issue is resolved by the taxing authority.     We record a valuation allowance to reduce a deferred tax asset if based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. We evaluate our deferred income taxes quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required by considering available evidence, including historical and projected taxable income and tax planning strategies. Any deferred tax asset subject to a valuation allowance is still available to us to offset future taxable income, subject to annual limitations in the event of an “ownership change” under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We will adjust a previously established valuation allowance if we change our assessment of the amount of deferred income tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized.     We are involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated with employment and other matters. Our accounting for legal contingencies requires us to estimate the probable losses in these matters. These estimates have been developed in consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies.          29             Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate     Our liabilities for insurance, tax and legal contingencies contain uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with these items. We use our history and experience, as well as the specific circumstances surrounding these claims, in evaluating the amount of liability we should record. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate. These revisions could materially affect our results of operations and financial position or liquidity.     Effect if actual results differ from assumptions     We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate our insurance, tax, or legal contingencies reserves during the past three fiscal years, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions for these items. However, a 10% change in our insurance reserves at December 31, 2013, would have affected net income by approximately $4.0 million. As of December 31, 2013, actual losses had not exceeded our estimates. Additionally, for claims that exceed our deductible amount, we record a gross liability and corresponding receivable representing expected recoveries, since we are not legally relieved of our obligation to the claimant.     Although we believe that our insurance, tax and legal reserves are based on reasonable judgments and estimates, actual results could differ, which may expose us to material gains or losses in future periods. These actual results could materially affect our effective tax rate, earnings, deferred tax balances and cash flows in the period of resolution.     Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill     Description     Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, such as insufficient cash flows or plans to dispose of or sell long-lived assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives. The carrying amount is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying amount is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. We estimate fair value based on projected future discounted cash flows. Impairment losses, if any, are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs. The carrying value of the asset is adjusted to the new carrying value, and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded. Additionally, if it is determined that the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased, the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new existing carrying value of the asset and the new remaining useful life. Our policy is to evaluate long-lived assets for impairment at a store level for retail operations.     We have acquired goodwill related to business acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We review our goodwill balances on an annual basis, during the fourth quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit might exceed its fair value. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss for this difference.     Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate     Our impairment loss calculations for long-lived assets contain uncertainties because they require us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows, strategic plans, useful lives and assumptions about market performance. We also apply judgment in the selection of a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in our current business model.     Our impairment loss calculations for goodwill contain uncertainties because they require us to estimate fair values of our reporting units. We estimate fair values based on various valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and comparable market analyses. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require us to make judgments and assumptions regarding future profitability, industry factors, planned strategic initiatives, discount rates and other factors.     Effect if actual results differ from assumptions     We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodologies we use to assess impairment loss for long-lived assets or goodwill during the past three fiscal years, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use in calculating goodwill impairment. If actual results or performance of certain business units are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges, which could be material to our results of operations. For example, if the profitability of our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores segment does not increase from our 2013 level, there could be a material increase in the impairment of long-lived assets at certain of our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores in future periods. Also, if the actual results or performance of our Mexican subsidiary are not consistent with our projections, estimates and assumptions, there could be additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods.     The total value of our goodwill at December 31, 2013, was $12.7 million. Of this amount, $12.2 million related to goodwill from the purchase of RadioShack de Mexico after an impairment charge of $23.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.     We did a multi-year projection based upon our normal annual planning process for the upcoming year during the fourth quarter of 2013. Due to the less than anticipated operating results of the Mexican subsidiary in the fourth quarter of 2013 and a review of operations in our normal planning process for the upcoming year, the projected operating results of our Mexican subsidiary for 2014 were reduced and the timing of a planned expansion was delayed to future years. The result of these actions was a significant reduction in sales and gross profits in our multi-year projection which was the primary factor in the calculation that determined the fair value of the goodwill of the Mexican subsidiary was less than the carrying amount in step 1 of the two-step impairment test.  In step 2, the fair value was allocated to assets and liabilities to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill. The result of this process calculated the implied fair value of the goodwill of the Mexican subsidiary to be less than the carrying value and an impairment charge was recorded.          30                Stock-Based Compensation     Description     We have historically granted certain stock-based awards to employees and directors in the form of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock and deferred stock units. See Note 2 - “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 8 - “Stock-Based Incentive Plans” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our stock-based compensation programs.     At the date an award is granted, we determine the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period, which typically is the period over which the award vests. The restricted stock and deferred stock units are valued at the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options with only service conditions is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair value of stock options with service and market conditions is valued utilizing a binomial lattice model with Monte Carlo simulations.     Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate     The Black-Scholes-Merton and lattice models require management to apply judgment and use subjective assumptions, including expected option life, volatility of stock prices, and employee forfeiture rate. We use historical data and judgment to estimate the expected option life and employee forfeiture rate, and use historical and implied volatility when estimating the stock price volatility. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.     Effect if actual results differ from assumptions     We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodologies used to record stock-based compensation during the past three years. While the assumptions that we develop are based on our best expectations, they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions and employee behavior that are outside of our control. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used, the stock-based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock-based compensation. Additionally, if actual employee forfeitures significantly differ from our estimated forfeitures, we may have an adjustment to our financial statements in future periods. A 10% change in our stock-based compensation expense in 2013 would have affected our net income by approximately $0.7 million.     FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS  Matters discussed in our MD&A and in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical and may be identified by the use of words such as “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “potential” or similar words. These matters include statements concerning management’s plans and objectives relating to our operations or economic performance and related assumptions. We specifically disclaim any duty to update any of the information set forth in this report, including any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are made based on management’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future events and, therefore, involve a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management cautions that forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.     ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.     At December 31, 2013, we held no derivative instruments that materially increased our exposure to market risks for interest rates, foreign currency rates, commodity prices or other market price risks.     Our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in short-term interest rates. Interest rate risk exists with respect to our cash equivalents of $124.4 million and our $300 million of term loans that bear interest at variable rates, in each case at December 31, 2013. A hypothetical 1% increase in short-term interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in annual net interest expense of approximately $1.3 million. Short-term liquid investments at variable interest rates currently yield less than 1% on an annualized basis. A hypothetical decrease of short-term interest rates to zero would result in virtually no corresponding change in annual net interest expense. This hypothetical example assumes no change in the proportionate relationship between our cash equivalent balance and the amount of our variable interest rate debt.     We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our purchase of inventory from manufacturers located in China and other areas outside the U.S. Our purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars, and any weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Chinese currency, or other currencies, could cause our vendors to increase the prices of items we purchase from them. It is not possible to estimate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our purchases of this inventory. We are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations related to our Mexican subsidiary, which accounted for less than 5% of our consolidated net sales and operating revenues in 2013.          31             ITEM 8.
