ITEM 7 .MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIALCONDITION AND             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (“MD&A”).   This MD&Asection discusses our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition,risk management practices, critical accounting policies, and estimates andcertain factors that may affect our future results, including economic andindustry-wide factors. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with ourconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, included in thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1Aabove.   OVERVIEW  Highlights relatedto the year ended December 31, 2008, include:       ·      Net sales and      operating revenues decreased $27.2 million, or 0.6%, to $4,224.5 million      when compared with last year. Comparable store sales decreased 0.6% as      well. This decrease was driven by lower sales in the fourth quarter      primarily due to the global credit crisis and economic downturn, but was      substantially offset by sales gains during the first nine months of the      year. We recorded sales of approximately $200 million in digital-to-analog      television converter boxes and significant sales increases      in AT&T postpaid wireless handsets, video gaming products and      accessories, laptop computers, and prepaid wireless handsets. We recorded      sales declines in Sprint Nextel postpaid wireless handsets, digital music      players and toys.             ·      Gross margin      decreased 210 basis points to 45.5% from last year. This decrease was      primarily driven by increased sales of lower margin products such as      digital-to-analog television converter boxes, video gaming products and      accessories, and laptop computers, as well as a continued shift away from      higher-rate new activations to lower-rate existing customer upgrades in      our postpaid wireless business.             ·      Selling,      general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense decreased $28.7 million to      $1,509.8 million when compared with last year. This decrease was driven in      part by lower compensation expense. Other factors included decreased rent      expense for our corporate headquarters for the last half of the year and      an $8.2 million sales and use tax benefit from the settlement of a sales      tax issue. Additionally, SG&A expense for 2007 included an $8.5      million charge for employee separation packages. As a percentage of net      sales and operating revenues, SG&A declined 50 basis points to      35.7%.             ·      As a result      of the factors above, operating income decreased $59.9 million, or 15.7%,      to $322.0 million when compared with lastyear.             ·      Net income      decreased $44.4 million to $192.4 million when compared with last year.      Net income per diluted share was $1.49 compared with $1.74 last      year.                  21            RESULTSOF OPERATIONS   NET SALES ANDOPERATING REVENUES   Consolidated net salesdecreased  0.6 % or $ 27.2  million to $ 4,224.5  million for the year endedDecember 31, 2008 , compared with  $ 4,251.7  million in2007. This decrease was primarily due to a comparable store sales decline of 0.6 %  in 2008. Thedecrease in comparable store sales was primarily caused by decreased sales inour personal electronics and modern home platforms, but was offset by increasedsales in our accessory platform.   Consolidated netsales and operating revenues for our two reportable segments and other sales areas follows:                   Year Ended      December 31,         (In      millions)       2008          2007          2006         U.S.      RadioShack company-operated stores      $  3,611.1        $  3,637.7        $  4,079.8        Kiosks         283.5           297.0           340.5        Other      sales         329.9           317.0           357.2        Consolidated      net sales and operating revenues      $  4,224.5        $  4,251.7        $  4,777.5                                                     Consolidated      net sales and operating  revenues decrease         0.6  %        11.0  %        6.0  %     Comparable      store sales decrease  (1)         0.6  %        8.2  %        5.6  %            (1)    Comparable      store sales include the sales of U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores      and kiosks with more than 12 full months of recorded  sales.

While wehave recorded sales gains related to our AT&T postpaid wireless business andprepaid wireless handsets, these gains were substantially offset by declines inthe Sprint Nextel postpaid wireless business and, to a lesser extent, sales ofGPS devices.   Sales in ouraccessory platform (includes home entertainment, wireless, music, computer,video game and GPS accessories; media storage; power adapters; digital imagingproducts and headphones) increased  15.0%  in 2008. Thisincrease was driven by sales of digital-to-analog television converterboxes. The sales of the converter boxes are a result of the pending transitionof full-power television broadcast signals in the United States frombroadcasting in analog format to broadcasting only in digital format. Thistransition is scheduled to take place in the second quarter of 2009 and weexpect a decrease in the sales of these units in the second half of the year. Wealso experienced sales gains in video game accessories in 2008. This increasewas partially offset by decreases in wireless, music, and imaging accessoriessales.   Sales in ourpersonal electronics platform (includes digital cameras, digital music players,toys, satellite radios, video gaming hardware, camcorders, general radios, andwellness products) decreased  17.5%  in 2008. Thisdecrease was driven primarily by sales declines in digital music players, toys,and satellite radios, but was partially offset by increased sales of video gameconsoles.   Sales in our modernhome platform (includes residential telephones, home audio and videoend-products, direct-to-home (“DTH”) satellite systems, and computers) decreased 7.4%  in 2008.This decrease was primarily the result of declines in sales of DVD players andrecorders, cordless telephones, and flat panel televisions, but was partiallyoffset by increased sales of laptop computers.   Sales in our powerplatform (includes general and special purpose batteries and battery chargers)decreased  3.6 %in 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of decreased sales of certainspecial purpose and general purpose batteries.   Sales in ourtechnical platform (includes wire and cable, connectivity products, componentsand tools, as well as hobby and robotic products) decreased  1.2 % in2008.   Sales in ourservice platform (includes prepaid wireless airtime, extended service plans andbill payment revenue) decreased  4.2%  in 2008. Thisdecrease was driven primarily by declines in bill payment revenue and sales ofextended service plans, but was partially offset by increased sales of prepaidwireless airtime.         23            Kiosks   Kiosk sales consistprimarily of handset sales, postpaid and prepaid commission revenue and relatedwireless accessory sales. Kiosk sales decreased  4.5 % or $ 13.5  million in 2008.This sales decrease was driven primarily by a decline in the number of ourSprint Nextel branded kiosks, but was partially offset by sales gains at ourSam’s Club kiosks. Our contract to operate Sprint Nextel kiosks expires in Juneof 2009. We are currently in discussion with Sprint Nextel to renew thiscontract, but the ultimate resolution is unknown at this time. The possibleoutcomes include renewing the contract under the same terms and conditions,modifying the contract, or ceasing operations.   InFebruary 2009, we signed a contract extension through March 31, 2011, with atransition period ending June 30, 2011, with Sam’s Club to continue operatingkiosks in certain Sam’s Club locations. As part of the terms of the contractextension, we will assign the operation of 66 kiosk locations to Sam’s Club byJuly 2009. Upon the execution of this agreement, Sam’s Club had the right toassume the operation of approximately 25 kiosk locations. Based on certainperformance metrics, Sam’s Club could acquire the right to assume approximately25 additional kiosk locations in 2010. The total number of locations assumed bySam’s Club, for any reason, may not exceed 51 kiosk locations during term of thecontract.   OtherSales   Other sales includesales to our independent dealers, outside sales through our service centers,sales generated by our  www.radioshack.com  Web siteand our Mexican subsidiary, sales to commercial customers, and outside sales ofour global sourcing operations and manufacturing. Other sales increased  $12. 9  million or  4.1 %  in 2008. This salesincrease was driven primarily by increased sales at our RadioShack.com Web siteand the recognition of 100% of the sales for RadioShack de Mexico in the monthof December. If we had owned 100% of RadioShack de Mexico for all of 2008, wewould have recognized a total of approximately $120 million in net sales andoperating revenues for the year. Sales to independent dealers did notsignificantly change from 2007.   GROSSPROFIT   Consolidated grossprofit and gross margin are as follows:                   Year Ended      December 31,         (In      millions)       2008          2007          2006         Gross      profit      $  1,922.7        $  2,025.8        $  2,129.4        Gross profit      decrease         5.1  %        4.9  %        6.1  %                                                  Gross      margin         45.5  %        47.6  %        44.6  %        Consolidated grossprofit and gross margin for 2008 were $1,922.7 million and 45.5%, respectively,compared with $2,025.8 million and 47.6% in 2007, resulting in a 5.1% decreasein gross profit dollars and a 210 basis point decrease in our grossmargin.   This decrease wasprimarily driven by increased sales of lower margin products such asdigital-to-analog television converter boxes, video gaming products andaccessories, and laptop computers, as well as a product shift away fromhigher-rate new activations to lower-rate existing customer upgrades in ourpostpaid wireless business. Gross margin was also negatively impactedby lower average selling prices in GPS and media storage and by aggressivepricing required in our wireless platform in the first quarter to respond to amore competitive market environment.   Additionally, the2007 gross margin was favorably impacted by refunds for federaltelecommunications excise taxes we recorded in 2007. A portion of these refundstotaling $18.8 million was recorded as a reduction to cost of products sold,which accounted for a 44 basis point increase in our gross margin. See Note 13 –“Federal Excise Tax” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for adiscussion of the impact of the federal telecommunications excisetax.          24            SELLING, GENERALAND ADMINISTRATIVE (“SG&A”) EXPENSE   Our consolidatedSG&A expense decreased 1.9% or $28.7 million in 2008. This represents a 50basis point decrease as a percentage of net sales and operating revenuescompared to 2007.   The table belowsummarizes the breakdown of various components of our consolidated SG&Aexpense and its related percentage of total net sales and operatingrevenues.                    Year Ended      December 31,                   2008          2007          2006                            %      of                   %      of                   %      of                            Sales      &                   Sales      &                   Sales      &         (In      millions)       Dollars          Revenues          Dollars          Revenues          Dollars          Revenues         Payroll and      commissions      $  617.5           14.6  %     $  638.6           15.0  %     $  798.2           16.7  %     Rent         300.9           7.1           304.7           7.2           312.1           6.5        Advertising         214.5           5.1           208.8           4.9           216.3           4.5        Other taxes      (excludes  income taxes)         87.9           2.1           103.0           2.4           121.2           2.5        Utilities and      telephone         58.7           1.4           61.4           1.4           64.7           1.4        Insurance         55.0           1.3           58.1           1.4           62.8           1.3        Credit card      fees         37.7           0.9           37.8           0.9           40.1           0.8        Professional      fees         26.3           0.6           19.1           0.4           49.2           1.0        Licenses         12.4           0.3           12.7           0.3           13.2           0.3        Repairs and      maintenance         11.2           0.3           10.9           0.3           11.7           0.3        Printing,      postage and office  supplies         8.1           0.2           9.6           0.2           11.7           0.3        Recruiting,      training &  employee relations         6.9           0.2           6.8           0.2           12.3           0.3        Stock      purchase and  savings plans         6.5           0.2           7.2           0.2           11.1           0.2        Travel         5.4           0.1           5.2           0.1           8.3           0.2        Warranty and      product repair         4.2           0.1           5.1           0.1           7.1           0.1        Other         56.6           1.2           49.5           1.2           70.7           1.5                                                                                                  $  1,509.8           35.7  %     $  1,538.5           36.2  %     $  1,810.7           37.9  %         Payroll andcommissions expense decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales andoperating revenues. This decrease was partially driven by lower incentivecompensation paid to store and corporate personnel and fewer employees in ourkiosk operation, distribution centers, and at our corporate headquarters.Additionally, in 2007 we reduced our accrued vacation liability by $14.3 millionin connection with the modification of our employee vacation policy and recordedan $8.5 million charge for employee separation charges.   Rent expensedecreased primarily due to lower rent expense associated with our corporateheadquarters for the second half of 2008. See below for furtherdiscussion.   The decrease inother taxes was partially driven by reduced payroll taxes associated with thedecreased compensation expense. Additionally, we recorded an $8.2 million salesand use tax benefit from the settlement of a sales tax issue.   The increase inother SG&A was primarily due to a $12.1 million non-cash charge recorded inconnection with our amended headquarters lease. See below for furtherdiscussion.   Corporate Headquarters’ AmendedLease:  In June 2008, Tarrant County College District (“TCC”) announcedthat it had purchased from Kan Am Grund Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH (“Kan Am”)the buildings and real property comprising our corporate headquarters in FortWorth, Texas, which we had previously sold to Kan Am and then leased for aperiod of 20 years in a sale and lease-back transaction in December2005.         25            Inconnection with the above sale to TCC, we entered into an agreement with TCC toconvey certain personal property located in the corporate headquarters andcertain real property located in close proximity to the corporate headquartersin exchange for an amended and restated lease to occupy a reduced portion of thecorporate headquarters for a shorter time period. The amended and restated leaseagreement provides for us to occupy approximately 40% of the corporateheadquarters complex for a primary term of three years with no rental paymentsrequired during the term.  The agreement also provides for a renewaloption on approximately half of this space for an additional two years at marketrents.   This agreementresulted in a non-cash net charge to other SG&A of $12.1 million for thesecond quarter of 2008. This net amount consisted of a net loss of $2.8 millionrelated to the assets conveyed to TCC and a $9.3 million charge to reduce areceivable for economic development incentives associated with the corporateheadquarters to its net realizable value.   DEPRECIATION ANDAMORTIZATION   The table belowgives a summary of our total depreciation and amortization bysegment.                   Year Ended      December 31,         (In      millions)       2008          2007          2006         U.S.      RadioShack company-operated stores      $  52.9        $  53.4        $  58.2        Kiosks         5.8           6.3           10.2        Other         1.8           1.7           2.3        Unallocated         38.8           51.3           57.5        Total      depreciation and amortization      $  99.3        $  112.7        $  128.2           The table belowprovides an analysis of total depreciation and amortization.                   Year Ended      December 31,         (In      millions)       2008          2007          2006         Depreciation      and amortization expense      $  88.1        $  102.7        $  117.5        Depreciation      and amortization included in  cost of products sold         11.2           10.0           10.7        Total      depreciation and amortization      $  99.3        $  112.7        $  128.2           Total depreciationand amortization for 2008 declined $13.4 million or 11.9%. This decrease wasprimarily due to reduced capital expenditures in 2006 and 2007 when comparedwith prior years.   IMPAIRMENT OFLONG-LIVED ASSETS AND OTHER CHARGES   Impairment oflong-lived assets and other charges was $2.8 million and $2.7 million for 2008and 2007, respectively. These amounts were related primarily to our SprintNextel kiosk operations and underperforming U.S. RadioShack company-operatedstores. We recorded this amount based on the remaining estimated future cashflows related to these specific stores. It was determined that the net bookvalue of many of the stores' long-lived assets was not recoverable. For thestores with insufficient estimated cash flows, we wrote down the associatedlong-lived assets to their estimated fair value.   NET INTERESTEXPENSE   Consolidatedinterest expense, net of interest income, was $15.3 million for 2008 versus$16.2 million for 2007, a decrease of $0.9 million or 5.6%.   Interest expensedecreased $8.9 million to $29.9 million in 2008 from $38.8 million in 2007. Thisdecrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates on our floating ratedebt exposure resulting from our interest rate swaps. Due to the implementationof FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible DebtInstruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion,” for our convertiblenotes, we will recognize additional non-cash interest expense of $14 million forthe year ended December 31, 2009.         26            Interest incomedecreased $8.0 million to $14.6 million in 2008 from $22.6 million in 2007. Thisdecrease was primarily due to a lower interest rate environment. Additionally,we recorded interest income related to the federal telecommunications excise taxrefund of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2008 and $1.4 million in thefirst nine months of 2007.   OTHER (LOSS)INCOME   During 2008 werecorded a loss of $2.4 million compared with income of $0.9 million in 2007.These amounts represent unrealized losses and gains related to our derivativeexposure to Sirius XM Radio, Inc. warrants as a result of our fair valuemeasurements of these warrants. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of thesewarrants was zero.   INCOME TAXPROVISION   Our effective taxrate for 2008 was 36.8% compared to 35.4% for 2007. The 2008 effective tax ratewas impacted by the execution of a closing agreement with respect to a PuertoRico income tax issue during the year, which resulted in a credit to income taxexpense. This discrete item lowered the effective tax rate for 2008 by 95 basispoints. In addition, the 2008 effective tax rate was impacted by the netreversal of approximately $4.1 million in unrecognized tax benefits, deferredtax assets and accrued interest related to the settlement of various stateincome tax issues and the expiration of the statute of limitations with respectto our 2002 taxable year. This net reversal lowered the effective tax rate for2008 by 137 basis points. The 2007 effective tax rate was impacted by the netreversal in June 2007 of approximately $10.0 million in unrecognized taxbenefits, deferred tax assets and accrued interest. Refer to Note 9 – “IncomeTaxes” of our consolidated financial statements for additional information. This$10.0 million reversal lowered our effective tax rate 273 basis points for theyear ended December 31, 2007.   Acquisitionof RadioShack de Mexico   InDecember 2008, we acquired the remaining interest (slightly more than 50%) ofour Mexican joint venture - RadioShack de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. - with GrupoGigante, S.A.B. de C.V. We now own 100% of this subsidiary which consists of 200RadioShack-branded stores and 14 dealers throughout Mexico. The purchase pricewas $44.7 million which consisted of $42.0 million in cash paid and transactioncosts, net of cash acquired, plus $2.7 million in assumed debt. The acquisitionwas accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance withSFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.” The purchase price allocation resulted inan excess of purchase price over net tangible assets acquired of $35.2 million,all of which was attributed to goodwill. The goodwill will not be subject toamortization for book purposes but rather an annual test for impairment. Thepremium we paid in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired was basedon the established business in Mexico and our ability to expand our business inMexico and possibly other countries. The goodwill will not be deductible for taxpurposes. Results of the acquired business have been included in our operationsfrom December 1, 2008, and were immaterial. If we had owned 100% of RadioShackde Mexico for all of 2008, we would have recognized approximately $100 millionin additional net sales and operating revenues.   2007COMPARED WITH 2006   2006 RESTRUCTURINGREVIEW   Due to negativetrends that developed in our business during calendar year 2005, we announced arestructuring program on February 17, 2006, that contained four keycomponents:       ·      Update our      inventory          ·      Focus on our      top-performing U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores, while closing 400      to 700 U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores, and aggressively relocate      other U.S. RadioShack company-operatedstores          ·      Consolidate      our distribution centers          ·      Reduce our      overhead costs       Through December31, 2006, we conducted a liquidation of certain inventory during the summer andfall of 2006, and replaced underperforming merchandise with new faster-movingmerchandise. During the         27            summer of 2006, wealso focused on our top-performing stores and completed the closure of 481underperforming stores, reducing the number of retail employees in connectionwith these closures. Additionally, we consolidated our distribution centers inthe fall of 2006. Management also reduced our cost structure, including ouradvertising spend rate and our workforce within our corporate headquarters. Anumber of other cost reductions were implemented. As of December 31, 2006, weconsidered our restructuring program to be substantially complete.   The 2006restructuring affects comparability in certain areas of this MD&A discussionand is discussed where necessary.   See “FinancialImpact of Restructuring Program” below for a discussion of the financial impactof our 2006 restructuring program.   NET SALES ANDOPERATING REVENUES   Consolidated net salesdecreased 11.0% or $525.8 million to $4,251.7 million in 2007 , from  $4,777.5  million in2006. This decrease was primarily due to a comparable store sales decline of 8.2%  in additionto the closure of 481 U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores during June andJuly 2006 as part of our 2006 restructuring. Approximately 290 of the 481 storeswere closed in July 2006, with a majority of the remainder closed in the lasthalf of June 2006. The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily causedby a decline in our wireless and personal electronics platformsales.   U.S.RadioShack Company-Operated Stores   Toassist in comparability, the revenue discussion presented below primarilyanalyzes results excluding the stores closed in 2006.   Excluding theeffects of the 2006 store closures, sales in our wireless platform decreased13.7% in 2007. This decrease was primarily driven by a decline in postpaidwireless sales for our two main wireless carriers. We believe that these salesdeclines were the result of increased wireless competition, a challengingwireless industry environment, and a shift to prepaid handsets and correspondingservice plans. This decrease, however, was partially offset by increased salesof GPS products, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2007, and prepaidwireless handset sales. Including the effects of the 2006 store closures,wireless platform sales decreased 15 .7% .   Excluding theeffects of the 2006 store closures, sales in our accessory platform decreased2 .3%  in 2007.This decrease was primarily the result of declines in wireless and homeentertainment accessory sales, but partially offset by increases in mediastorage and imaging accessories sales. Including the effects of the 2006 storeclosures, accessory platform sales decreased  5.7% .   Excluding theeffects of the 2006 store closures, sales in our personal electronics platformdecreased  11.7% in 2007. This decrease was driven primarily by sales declines in satelliteradios and digital music players, but was partially offset by increased sales ofvideo gaming products. Including the effects of the 2006 store closures,personal electronics platform sales decreased  13.7% .   Excluding theeffects of the 2006 store closures, sales in our modern home platform decreased5.7 % in  2007.This decrease was the result of sales declines in residential telephones, andDVD players and recorders, offset by increased sales of laptop computers, PCperipherals, and flash drives. Including the effects of the 2006 store closures,modern home platform sales decreased 8.3 % .   Excluding theeffects of the 2006 store closures, sales in our power platform decreased5.6 %  in 2007.This sales decline was the result of decreased sales of general purpose andspecial purpose telephone batteries. Including the effects of the 2006 storeclosures, power platform sales decreased 8 .6% .   Excluding theeffects of the 2006 store closures, sales in our technical platform decreased 2.2%  in 2007.This sales decline was due primarily to a decrease in sales of robotic kits,metal detectors and tools, partially offset by an increase in audio cable sales.Including the effects of the 2006 store closures, technical platform salesdecreased 6 .9% .         28            Excluding theeffects of the 2006 store closures, sales in our service platform decreased2 .6%  in 2007.Prepaid airtime sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2007; however,this gain was more than offset by decreases in bill payment revenue. Includingthe effects of the 2006 store closures, service platform sales decreased 4 .9% .Other revenuedecreased $4.0 million or 22.9% in 2007 due in part to the 2006 store closuresand to a decline in store repair revenue.   Kiosks   Kiosk salesdecreased 12.8% or $43.5 million in 2007. While this decrease is partiallyattributable to fewer kiosk locations compared to the prior year, we believethat this sales decline was primarily the result of increased wirelesscompetition, a challenging wireless industry environment, and a customer shiftto prepaid handsets which are generally priced lower than postpaidhandsets.   OtherSales   Other sales in 2006included sales of our now closed Canadian company-operated stores. Other saleswere down  $40.2 million or 11.3 % in 2007. This sales decrease was primarily due to the sale or closure of fiveservice centers late in the second quarter of 2006, fewer dealer outlets in2007, and a decline in product sales to the remaining dealers.   GROSSPROFIT   Consolidated grossprofit and gross margin for 2007 were $2,025.8 million and 47.6%, respectively,compared with $2,129.4 million and 44.6% in 2006 resulting in a 4.9% decrease ingross profit dollars and a 300 basis point increase in our grossmargin.   The decrease ingross profit for 2007 was the result of a decline in net sales and operatingrevenues primarily due to a comparable store sales decrease and store closuresassociated with our 2006 restructuring. Our 2007 gross margin increasedprimarily due to an improvement in our inventory management and a shift inproduct mix. In addition, refunds of $14.0 million and $5.2 million for federaltelecommunications excise taxes were recorded in the first and fourth quartersof 2007, respectively. A portion of these refunds totaling $18.8 million wasrecorded as a reduction to cost of products sold, which accounted for a 44 basispoint increase in our gross margin. See Note 13 – “Federal Excise Tax” for adiscussion of the impact of the federal telecommunications excisetax.   SELLING, GENERALAND ADMINISTRATIVE (“SG&A”) EXPENSE   Our consolidatedSG&A expense decreased 15.0% or $272.2 million in 2007. This represents a170 basis point decrease as a percentage of net sales and operating revenuescompared to 2006.   Payroll andcommissions expense decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales andoperating revenues. This decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in ourcorporate support staff, a reduction of store personnel from store closures in2006, and better management of store labor hours. Additionally, compensationincluded an $8.5 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2007 associatedwith the reduction of approximately 280 corporate support employees, while theyear ended December 31, 2006, included employee separation charges ofapproximately $16.1 million connected with the 2006 restructuring. Furthermore,our accrued vacation was reduced $14.3 million in 2007 in connection with themodification of our employee vacation policy during 2007.   Rent expensedecreased in dollars, but increased as a percent of net sales and operatingrevenues. The rent decrease was primarily driven by store closures from our 2006restructuring.   Advertising expensedecreased in dollars, but increased as a percent of net sales and operatingrevenues. This decrease was primarily due to a change in our media strategy, aswe changed the mix of media used in our advertising program from television tomore radio and newspaper usage, as well as reduced sponsorshipprograms.   Professional feesdecreased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues.The decrease relates to a decline in our use of consultants and lower feesincurred as a result of our defense         29            ofcertain class action lawsuits during 2006, as well as prior year recognition of$5.1 million of the $8.8 million charge to establish a legal reserve for thesettlement of these lawsuits. See Note 12 – “Commitments and Contingencies” inthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of theselawsuits.   DEPRECIATION ANDAMORTIZATION   Total depreciationand amortization for 2007 declined $15.5 million or 12.1%. This decrease wasprimarily due to the closure of stores and acceleration of depreciation as partof our 2006 restructuring, as well as a reduction in our capital expendituresduring 2007. Additionally, the 2007 decline within the kiosk segment was theresult of an impairment recorded during the third quarter of 2006.   IMPAIRMENT OFLONG-LIVED ASSETS AND OTHER CHARGES   During 2007, werecorded impairment charges for long-lived assets related primarily to ourSprint Nextel kiosk operations and U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores of$2.7 million. We recorded this amount based on the remaining estimated futurecash flows related to these specific stores. It was determined that the net bookvalue of many of the stores' long-lived assets was not recoverable. For thestores with insufficient estimated cash flows, we wrote down the associatedlong-lived assets to their estimated fair value.   InFebruary 2006, as part of our restructuring program, our board of directorsapproved the closure of 400 to 700 U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores.During the first half of 2006, we identified the stores for closure andsubsequently performed the impairment test. Based on the remaining estimatedfuture cash flows related to these specific stores, it was determined that thenet book value of some of the stores' long-lived assets to be held for use wasnot recoverable. For the stores with insufficient estimated cash flows, we wrotedown the associated long-lived assets to their estimated fair value, resultingin a $9.2 million impairment loss related to our U.S. RadioShackcompany-operated store segment. By July 31, 2006, we had closed 481 specificstores under the restructuring program; there were no additional closures underthis program for the remainder of the year.   Also, we purchasedcertain assets from Wireless Retail, Inc. during the fourth quarter of 2004 for$59.6 million, which resulted in the recognition of $18.6 million of goodwilland a $32.1 million intangible asset related to a five-year agreement with Sam’sClub to operate wireless kiosks in approximately 540 Sam’s Club locationsnationwide. These assets relate to our kiosk segment. As a result of continuedcompany and wireless industry growth challenges, together with changes in oursenior leadership team during the third quarter of 2006 that resulted in arefocus on allocation of capital and resources towards other areas of ourbusiness, we determined that our long-lived assets, including goodwillassociated with our kiosk operations, were impaired. We performed impairmenttests on both the long-lived assets associated with our Sam’s Club agreement,including the intangible asset relating to the five-year agreement, and theaccompanying goodwill.   With respect to thelong-lived tangible and intangible assets, we compared their carrying valueswith their estimated fair values using a discounted cash flow model, whichreflected our lowered expectations of wireless revenue growth and the ceasedexpansion of our kiosk business, and determined that the intangible assetrelating to the five-year agreement was impaired. This assessment resulted in a$10.7 million impairment charge to the intangible asset related to our kiosksegment in 2006. The remaining intangible balance is being amortized over theremaining life of the Sam’s Club agreement, which was originally scheduled toexpire in September 2009.   With respect to thegoodwill of $18.6 million, we estimated the fair value of the Sam’s Clubreporting unit using a discounted cash flow model similar to that used in thelong-lived asset impairment test. We compared it with the carrying value of thereporting unit and determined that the goodwill was impaired.  As thecarrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, we thencompared the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with thecarrying amount of goodwill. This resulted in an $18.6 million impairment ofgoodwill related to our kiosk segment in 2006.         30            Additionally, basedon historical and expected cash flows for U.S. RadioShack company-operatedstores and kiosks, we recorded an impairment charge of $4.6 million related toproperty and equipment and an impairment charge of $1.2 million related togoodwill.These 2006 impairment charges, aggregating $44.3 million, were recordedwithin impairment of long-lived assets and other charges in the accompanyingConsolidated Statement of Income.   NET INTERESTEXPENSE   Consolidatedinterest expense, net of interest income, was $16.2 million for 2007 versus$36.9 million for 2006, a decrease of $20.7 million or 56%.   Interest expensedecreased 12% to $38.8 million in 2007 from $44.3 million in 2006. This decreasewas attributable to lower average outstanding debt, which was partially offsetby rising interest rates on our floating rate debt exposure.   Interest incomeincreased 205% to $22.6 million in 2007 from $7.4 million in 2006. This increasewas due to a higher average investment balance for 2007, as well as higheraverage investment rates. Additionally, we recorded $2.6 million of interestincome related to federal telecommunications excise tax refunds during 2007. SeeNote 13 – “Federal Excise Tax” for a discussion of the impact of the federaltelecommunications excise tax.   OTHER INCOME(LOSS)   In2007, we recognized a net gain of $0.9 million relating to our derivativeexposure to Sirius. During the third quarter of 2007, we modified the expecteddate at which we would settle the warrants, resulting in a $2.4 millionunrealized gain, which was offset by mark-to-market losses of $1.5 millionduring the year, compared to a loss of $5.9 million for the year ended December31, 2006.   Additionally, in2006 we had a $2.7 million loss related to an other than temporary impairment ofother investments.   INCOME TAXPROVISION   Our effective taxrate for 2007 was 35.4% compared to 34.1% in 2006. The 2007 effective tax ratewas impacted by the net reversal in June 2007 of approximately $10.0 million inunrecognized tax benefits, deferred tax assets and accrued interest. Refer toNote 9 – “Income Taxes” of our consolidated financial statements for additionalinformation. This $10.0 million reversal lowered our effective tax rate 273basis points for the year ended December 31, 2007. Furthermore, the effectivetax rate for 2006 was primarily affected by the tax benefit associated withinventory donations occurring in the quarter ended June 30, 2006. During thesecond quarter of 2006, we donated approximately $20 million in inventory tocharitable organizations in a manner that provided us with a tax deduction inexcess of the inventory cost. The entire tax benefit attributable to thischaritable donation deduction is reflected in the effective tax rate for thesecond quarter of 2006.   RECENTLYISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   Refer to Note 2 –“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” under the section titled “RecentlyIssued Accounting Pronouncements” in the Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements.   CASHFLOW AND LIQUIDITY   Asummary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities isoutlined in the table below.                   Year Ended      December 31,         (In      millions)       2008          2007          2006         Operating      activities      $  274.6        $  379.0        $  314.8        Investing      activities         (124.3  )        (42.0  )        (79.3  )     Financing      activities         154.8           (299.3  )        12.5                 31            CashFlow – Operating Activities   Cash flows fromoperating activities provide us with the majority of our liquidity. Cashprovided by operating activities in 2008 was $274.6 million, compared with$379.0 million and $314.8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash flowsfrom operating activities are comprised of net income plus non-cash adjustmentsto net income and working capital components. Cash provided by net income plusnon-cash adjustments to net income was $339.5   million, $358.9million, and $ 230.7  million for2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Cash used in working capital components was$64.9 million in 2008 compared with cash provided by working capital componentsof $20.1 million and $84.1 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively.   CashFlow – Investing Activities   Cash used ininvesting activities was $124.3 million, $42.0 million, and $79.3 million in2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The 2008 increase was primarily the resultof our $42.0 million acquisition of RadioShack de Mexico and $85.6 million incapital expenditures for our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores andinformation system projects. We anticipate that our capital expenditurerequirements for 2009 will range from $75 million to $100 million. U.S.RadioShack company-operated store remodels and relocations, as well asinformation systems projects, will account for the majority of our anticipated2009 capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2008, we had $814.8 million incash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents and cash generated fromoperating activities will be used to fund future capital expenditureneeds.   CashFlow – Financing Activities   Cash provided byfinancing activities was $154.8 million and $12.5 million for 2008 and 2006,respectively, compared to cash used of $299.3 million in 2007. The cash providedby financing activities in 2008 was primarily driven by the issuance of our 2013convertible notes and associated hedge and warrant transactions. We used cash of$111.3 million and $208.5 million to repurchase our common stock during 2008 and2007, respectively. The 2007 stock repurchases were partially funded by $81.3million received from stock option exercises. The balance of capital torepurchase shares was obtained from cash generated from operations.Additionally, we paid off our $150.0 million ten-year unsecured note payablewhich matured in September 2007.   FreeCash Flow   Our free cash flow,defined as cash flows from operating activities less dividends paid andadditions to property, plant and equipment, was $157.7 million in 2008, $300.9million in 2007, and $189.9 million in 2006. The decrease in free cash flow for2008 was attributable to lower earnings, more cash used in working capital, andincreased capital expenditures.   Webelieve free cash flow is a relevant indicator of our ability to repay maturingdebt, change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that managementbelieves will enhance shareholder value. The comparable financial measure tofree cash flow under generally accepted accounting principles is cash flows fromoperating activities, which was $274.6 million in 2008, $379.0 million in 2007,and $314.8 million in 2006. We do not intend for the presentation of free cashflow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to be considered in isolation or as asubstitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.   The following tableis a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cashflow.                   Year Ended      December 31,         (In      millions)       2008          2007          2006         Net cash      provided by operating activities      $  274.6        $  379.0        $  314.8        Less:                                          Additions to property, plant and      equipment         85.6           45.3           91.0        Dividends paid         31.3           32.8           33.9                                                     Free cash      flow      $  157.7        $  300.9        $  189.9                 32            CAPITALSTRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION   Weconsider our capital structure and financial condition to be strong. We had$814.8 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2008, for ourfunding needs. Additionally, we have available to us a $325 million bankcredit facility. As of December 31, 2008, we had no borrowings under this creditfacility.   DebtObligations   Convertible Notes:  In August2008, we issued $375 million principal amount of convertible senior notes dueAugust 1, 2013, (the “Convertible Notes”) in a private offering. Each $1,000 ofprincipal of the Convertible Notes is initially convertible, under certaincircumstances, into 41.2414 shares of our common stock (or a total ofapproximately 15.5 million shares), which is the equivalent of $24.25 per share,subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events set forth underterms of the Convertible Notes. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder thecash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock, up to theprincipal amount of the note. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any,(the “excess conversion value”) may be paid in cash or in stock, at our option.Holders may convert their Convertible Notes into common stock on the netsettlement basis described above at any time from May 1, 2013, until the closeof business on July 29, 2013, or if, and only if, one of the followingconditions occurs:       ·      During any      calendar quarter, and only during such calendar quarter, if the closing      price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30      consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding      calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the conversion price per share of common      stock in effect on the last day of such preceding calendar      quarter          ·      During the      five consecutive business days immediately after any 10 consecutive      trading day period in which the average trading price per $1,000 principal      amount of Convertible Notes was less than 98% of the product of the      closing price of the common stock on such date and the conversion rate on      such date          ·      We make      specified distributions to holders of our common stock or specified      corporate transactions occur       Concurrent with theissuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into note hedge transactions withCiti and Bank of America whereby we have the option to purchase up to 15.5million shares of our common stock at a price of $24.25 per share (the“Convertible Note Hedges”), and we sold warrants to the same financialinstitutions whereby they have the option to purchase up to 15.5 million sharesof our common stock at a per share price of $36.60 (the “Warrants”). TheConvertible Note Hedges and Warrants were structured to reduce the potentialfuture share dilution associated with the conversion of the Convertible Notes.The Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants are separate contracts with the twofinancial institutions, are not part of the terms of the Convertible Notes, anddo not affect the rights of holders under the Convertible Notes. A holder of theConvertible Notes does not have any rights with respect to the Convertible NoteHedges or Warrants.   The net proceedsretained by RadioShack as a result of the issuance of the Convertible Notes, thepurchase of the Convertible Note Hedges, and the proceeds received from theissuance of the Warrants were approximately $319.2 million. We completed thesetransactions to secure a source of liquidity in preparation for our $300 millioncredit facility expiring in June of 2009. On September 11, 2008, we terminatedthis credit facility.   For a more detaileddescription of the Convertible Notes, Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants,please see Note 5 – “Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities” and Note 6 –“Stockholders’ Equity” in the Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements.   Long-Term Notes:  On May 11,2001, we issued $350 million of 10-year 7.375% notes in a private offering toqualified institutional buyers under SEC Rule 144A. The annual interest rate onthe notes is 7.375% per annum with interest payable on November 15 and May 15 ofeach year. The notes contain certain non-financial covenants and mature on May15, 2011. In August 2001, under the terms of an exchange offering filed with theSEC, we exchanged substantially all of these notes for a similar amount ofpublicly registered notes. The exchange resulted in substantially all of thenotes becoming registered with the SEC and did not result in additional debtbeing issued.         33            InJune and August 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements withunderlying notional amounts of debt of $100 million and $50 million,respectively, and both with maturities in May 2011. Our counterparty for theseswaps is Citi. These swaps effectively convert a portion of our long-term fixedrate debt to a variable rate. We entered into these agreements to balance ourfixed versus floating rate debt portfolio to continue to take advantage of lowershort-term interest rates. Under these agreements, we have contracted to pay avariable rate of LIBOR plus a markup and to receive a fixed rate of 6.95% forthe swap entered into in 2001 and 7.375% for the swaps entered into in 2003. Wehave designated these agreements as fair value hedging instruments. We recorded$6.7 million in other non-current assets, net at December 31, 2008, and $1.5million in other non-current liabilities at December 31, 2007, for the fairvalue of these agreements and adjusted the carrying value of the related debt bythe same amounts.   InAugust 1997 we filed a $300 million debt shelf registration statement. In August1997, we issued $150 million of 10-year unsecured long-term notes under thisshelf registration. The interest rate on the notes was 6.95% per annum withinterest payable on September 1 and March 1 of each year. These notes containedcustomary non-financial covenants. In September 2007, our $150 million ten-yearunsecured note payable came due. Upon maturity, we paid off the $150 millionnote payable utilizing our available cash and cash equivalents. During the thirdquarter of 2001, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with anunderlying notional amount of $110.5 million. This interest rate swap agreementexpired in conjunction with the maturity of the note payable.   Medium-Term Notes:  We alsoissued, in various amounts and on various dates from December 1997 throughSeptember 1999, medium-term notes totaling $150 million under the shelfregistration described above. At December 31, 2007, $5 million of these notesremained outstanding with an interest rate of 6.42%; they contained customarynon-financial covenants. As of December 31, 2007, there was no availabilityunder this shelf registration. In January 2008, the remaining $5 million of themedium-term notes payable came due, and was paid off utilizing our availablecash and cash equivalents.   AvailableFinancing   Credit Facilities:  At December31, 2008, we had $325 million borrowing capacity available under our existingcredit facility. This facility expires in May of 2011.   Asmentioned above, on September 11, 2008, we terminated our $300 million creditfacility which was set to expire in June of 2009. This facility was no longerrequired due to the issuance of our Convertible Notes as discussedabove.   Our $325 millioncredit facility provides us a source of liquidity. This facility is provided bya syndicate of lenders with a majority of the facility provided by Wells Fargo,Citi, and Bank of America. As of December 31, 2008, there were no outstandingborrowings under this credit facility, nor were any of our facilities utilizedduring 2008. Interest charges under our facilities are derived using a baseLIBOR rate plus a margin which changes based on our credit ratings. Our banksyndicated credit facility has customary terms and covenants, and we were incompliance with these covenants at December 31, 2008.   Impactof 2008 Global Credit Crisis and Economic Downturn   During the lastfour months of 2008, a combination of economic factors created an extremelyadverse environment for the retail industry. These factors included volatilityin the capital markets, increased costs associated with issuing debtinstruments, and limited or no access to those markets for many companies andconsumers. These credit market conditions, the general downturn in the U.S.economy, and consumer sentiment as reflected in record low measurements of TheConference Board Consumer Confidence Index™ during the fourth quarter of 2008contributed to a significant reduction in consumer spending during the fourthquarter as compared to 2007 and other recent years.   Our c onsolidated net salesdecreased  7.7 % or $ 105.6  million to $ 1,258.7  million for the  fourth quarter ,compared with  $ 1,364.3  million in2007. Consolidated gross profit decreased 13.9% or $84.9 million to $526.3million for the fourth quarter, compared with $611.2 million in 2007. Whilethese declines were significant, we were able to generate $96.5 million inpre-tax income and $99.3 million of net cash provided by operating activitiesduring the fourth quarter.         34            Ifthe current economic conditions persist or worsen, it could have an adverseimpact on our business and on the financial condition of some of our customers,wireless and other service providers, and merchandise suppliers. Although wehave not experienced a material increase in customer bad debts ornon-performance by suppliers or service providers, current market conditionsincrease the probability that we could experience losses from customer,supplier, or service provider defaults.   Ifa scenario as described above occurred, it could cause the rating agencies tolower our credit ratings, thereby increasing our borrowing costs, or evencausing a further reduction in or elimination of our access to debt and/orequity markets.   Wedo not have any debt maturities until 2011 and, as discussed above, ourliquidity needs are generally met through cash provided by operations and ourcash on hand. If we need additional funds, we can draw on our credit facilityexpiring in 2011.   Capitalization   The following tablesets forth information about our capitalization on the datesindicated.                   December      31,                   2008          2007            (Dollars in      millions)         Dollars          % of Total      Capitalization            Dollars          % of Total      Capitalization         Current      debt      $  39.3           2.5  %     $  61.2           5.2  %     Long-term      debt         732.5           46.1           348.2           29.5          Total      debt         771.8           48.6           409.4           34.7        Stockholders’      equity         817.3           51.4           769.7           65.3        Total      capitalization      $  1,589.1           100.0  %     $  1,179.1           100.0  %        Our debt-to-totalcapitalization ratio increased in 2008 from 2007, due to the issuance of $375million of Convertible Notes.   DebtRatings   Below are theagencies’ ratings by category, as well as their respective current outlook forthe ratings, as of February 5, 2009.              Rating      Agency           Rating           Outlook                    Standard and      Poor’s           BB           Stable                    Moody's           Ba1           Stable                    Fitch           BB           Negative              OnAugust 11, 2008, Standard and Poor’s revised their outlook to stable fromnegative and affirmed our BB corporate credit and senior unsecured ratings. Theremaining ratings and outlooks are consistent with those reported in our AnnualReport on Form 10-K for the calendar year ended December 31, 2007, and wereaffirmed by Moody’s and Fitch on August 11, 2008, and August 7, 2008,respectively.   Factors that couldimpact our future credit ratings include free cash flow and cash levels, changesin our operating performance, the adoption of a more aggressive financialstrategy, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumerelectronics industries, continued sales declines in comparable stores, ourfinancial position and changes in our business strategy. If further downgradesoccur, they will adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowingcosts, access to debt capital markets, vendor financing terms and future newstore occupancy costs. Due to improvements in liquidity, we terminated ourcommercial paper program during the third quarter of 2007.   Dividends   Wehave paid common stock cash dividends for 22 consecutive years. On November 6,2008, our Board of Directors declared an annual dividend of $0.25 per share. Thedividend was paid on December 17,         35            2008, tostockholders of record on November 28, 2008. The dividend payment of $31.3million was funded from cash on hand.   OperatingLeases   Weuse operating leases, primarily for our retail locations and our corporatecampus, to lower our capital requirements.   ShareRepurchases   InFebruary 2005, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program withno expiration date authorizing management to repurchase up to $250 million ofour common stock in open market purchases. During 2008, we repurchasedapproximately 0.1 million shares or $1.4 million of our common stock under thisprogram. During 2007, we repurchased 8.7 million shares or $208.5 million of ourcommon stock under this program. As of December 31, 2008, there were no furthershare repurchases authorized under this program.   InJuly 2008, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with noexpiration date authorizing management to repurchase up to $200 million of ourcommon stock. During the third quarter of 2008, we repurchased 6.0 millionshares or $110.0 million of our common stock under this plan. As of December 31,2008, there was $90.0 million available for share repurchases under thisplan.   SeasonalInventory Buildup   Typically, ourannual cash requirements for pre-seasonal inventory buildup range between $200million and $400 million. The funding required for this buildup comes primarilyfrom cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and operating revenues. Wehad $814.8 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2008, as aresource for our funding needs. Additionally, borrowings may be utilized to fundthe inventory buildup as described in “Available Financing” above.   Contractualand Credit Commitments   The followingtables, as well as the information contained in Note 5 - "Indebtedness andBorrowing Facilities" to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, providea summary of our various contractual commitments, debt and interest repaymentrequirements, and available credit lines.   The table belowcontains our known contractual commitments as of December 31, 2008.

(2)    Includes a      $46.1 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits. We are not able to      reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the      liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore the related      balances have not been reflected in the ‘‘Payments Due by Period’’ section      of the table.       For moreinformation regarding long-term debt and lease commitments, refer to Note 5 –“Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities” and Note 12 – Commitments andContingencies”, respectively, of our Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements.         36            The table belowcontains our credit commitments from various financialinstitutions.

(“CompUSA”) as part of its purchase of our ComputerCity, Inc. subsidiary in August 1998.   Following anannouncement in February 2007 of its intentions to close as many as 126 storesand an announcement in December 2007 that they had been acquired by GordonBrothers Group, CompUSA stores ceased operations in January 2008.  Aportion of the closed stores represents locations where we may be liable for therent payments on the underlying lease.  To date, we have been named asdefendants in a total of eleven lawsuits from lessors seeking payment fromus.   Based on allavailable information pertaining to the status of these leases, and afterapplying the provisions set forth within SFAS No. 5, “Accounting forContingencies,” and FIN 14, “Reasonable Estimation of a Loss – an Interpretationof SFAS No. 5,” during the fourth quarter of 2007, we established an accrual of$7.5 million, recorded in current liabilities. In the first quarter of 2008, weincreased our accrual to $9.0 million, reflecting our revised estimate based onfurther developments.  We are continuing to monitor this situation andwill update our accrual as more information becomes available.   FINANCIALIMPACT OF 2006 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM   Asdiscussed previously, our 2006 restructuring program, as originally stated inFebruary 2006, contained four key components:       ·      Update our      inventory          ·      Focus on our      top-performing U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores, while closing 400      to 700 U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores and aggressively relocate      other U.S. RadioShack company-operatedstores          ·      Consolidate      our distribution centers          ·      Reduce our      overhead costs       Store Closures:  As of December31, 2006, we had closed 481 stores as a result of our restructuring program. Ourdecision to close these stores was made on a store-by-store basis, and there wasno geographic concentration of closings for these stores. For these closedstores, we recognized a charge in 2006 of $9.1 million to SG&A for futurelease obligations and negotiated buy-outs with landlords. A lease obligationreserve was not recognized until a store had been closed or when a buy-outagreement had been reached with the landlord. Regarding the 481 stores we closedas a result of the restructuring program during the year ended December 31,2006, we recorded an impairment charge of $9.2 million related to the long-livedassets associated with certain of these stores. It was determined that the netbook value of several of the stores' long-lived assets was not recoverable basedon the remaining estimated future cash flows related to these specific stores.We also recognized $2.1 million in accelerated depreciation associated withclosed store assets for which the useful lives had been changed due to the storeclosures.   Inconnection with these store closures, we identified 601 retail employees whosepositions were terminated by December 31, 2006. These employees were paidseverance, and some earned retention bonuses if they remained employed untilcertain agreed-upon dates. The development of a reserve for these costs began onthe date that the terms of severance benefits were established and communicatedto the employees, and the reserve was recognized over the minimum retentionperiod. As of December 31, 2006, $3.8 million had been recognized in SG&A asretention and severance benefits for store         37            employees, with$3.6 million in benefits paid to that date. Additionally, as part of our storeclosure activities, we incurred and recognized in SG&A $6.1 million inexpenses in 2006 primarily in connection with fees paid to outside liquidatorsand for close-out promotional activities for the 481 stores.   All storesidentified for closure under the restructuring program were closed as of July31, 2006. Additionally, we continue to negotiate buy-out agreements with ourlandlords; however, remaining lease obligations of $0.8 million still existed atDecember 31, 2008. There is uncertainty as to when, and at what cost, we willfully settle all remaining lease obligations.   Distribution Center Consolidations: We closed a distribution center located in Southaven, Mississippi, andsold a distribution center in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2006. During theyear ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a lease obligation charge inSG&A in the amount of $2.0 million on the lease of the Southavendistribution center and a gain of $2.7 million on the sale of the Charlestondistribution center. We also incurred a $0.5 million charge related to severancefor approximately 100 employees.  Additionally, there were $0.4million in other expenses.   Service Center Operations:  Weclosed or sold five service center locations during the year ended December 31,2006, resulting in the elimination of approximately 350 positions. We recognizedcharges to SG&A of $1.2 million and $0.9 million related to leaseobligations and severance, respectively. This severance obligation was paid asof December 31, 2006. Additionally, there were $0.1 million in otherexpenses.   Overhead Cost Reductions: Management conducted a review of our cost structure to identify potentialsources of cost reductions. In connection with this review, we made decisions tolower these costs, including reducing our advertising spend rate in connectionwith adjustments to our media mix. During the year ended December 31, 2006, wereduced our workforce by approximately 514 positions, primarily within ourcorporate headquarters. We recorded charges to SG&A for termination benefitsand related costs of $11.9 million, of which $6.4 million had been paid as ofDecember 31, 2006. During 2007, severance payments totaling $5.0 million werepaid, leaving an accrued severance balance of $0.7 million as of December 31,2007.   Inventory Update:  We replacedunderperforming merchandise with new, faster-moving merchandise. We recorded apre-tax charge to cost of products sold of approximately $62 million during thefourth quarter of 2005, as a result of both our normal inventory review processand the inventory update aspect of our restructuring program.   The following tablesummarizes the activity related to the 2006 restructuring program from February17, 2006, through December 31, 2007:                                     Asset          Accelerated                           (In      millions)       Severance          Leases          Impairments          Depreciation          Other          Total         Total charges      for 2006      $  16.1        $  12.3        $  9.2        $  2.1        $  4.9        $  44.6                                                                                         Total spending      for 2006,  net of amounts realized  from sale of fixedassets         (10.4  )        (8.5  )           --              --           (4.6  )        (23.5  )        Total non-cash      items         --           0.9           (9.2  )        (2.1  )        (0.2  )        (10.6  )     Accrual at      December 31,  2006         5.7           4.7           --           --           0.1           10.5                                                                                         Total spending      for 2007         (5.0  )        (3.9  )        --           --           (0.1  )        (9.0  )                                                                                      Additions for      2007         --           1.4           --           --           --           1.4        Accrual at      December 31,  2007      $  0.7        $  2.2        $  --        $  --        $  --        $  2.9           Wemade cash payments during 2008 in the amount of $2.1 million.

OFF-BALANCESHEET ARRANGEMENTS   Other than theoperating leases described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet financingarrangements, transactions, or special purpose entities.   INFLATION   With the exceptionof increased energy costs in 2007 and the first half of 2008, inflation has notsignificantly impacted us over the past three years. We do not expect inflationto have a significant impact on our operations in the foreseeablefuture.   CRITICALACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   Our consolidatedfinancial statements are prepared in accordance with generally acceptedaccounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States. The application of GAAPrequires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values ofassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reportedamount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and the relateddisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The use of estimates ispervasive throughout our financial statements and is affected by managementjudgment and uncertainties. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are basedon historical experience, current market trends and other factors that webelieve to be relevant and reasonable at the time the consolidated financialstatements are prepared. We continually evaluate the information used to makethese estimates as our business and the economic environment change. Actualresults may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptionsor conditions.   Inthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe our significantaccounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financialstatements. The accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical arerevenue recognition; inventory valuation under the cost method; estimation ofreserves and valuation allowances specifically related to insurance, tax andlegal contingencies; valuation of long-lived assets and intangibles, includinggoodwill; and stock-based compensation.   Weconsider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requiresdifficult, subjective or complex judgments, and is material to the portrayal ofour financial condition, changes in financial condition or results ofoperations. The selection, application and disclosure of our critical accountingpolicies and estimates have been reviewed by the Audit and Compliance Committeeof our Board of Directors.   Revenue Recognition:  Ourrevenue is derived principally from the sale of name brand and private brandproducts and services to consumers. Revenue is recognized, net of an estimatefor customer refunds and product returns, when persuasive evidence of anarrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, thesales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonablyassured.   Certain products,such as wireless telephone handsets, require the customer to use the services ofa third-party service provider. In most cases, the third-party service providerpays us a fee or commission for obtaining a new customer, as well as a monthlyrecurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the serviceprovider and the customer. Fee or commission revenue, net of a reserve forestimated service deactivations, is generally recognized at the time thecustomer is accepted as a subscriber of a third-party service provider, whilethe residual revenue is recognized on a monthly basis.   Estimated productrefunds and returns, service plan deactivations, residual revenue and commissionrevenue adjustments are based on historical information pertaining to theseitems. If actual results differ from these estimates due to various factors, theamount of revenue recorded could be materially affected. A 10% difference in ourreserves for the estimates noted above would have affected net sales andoperating revenues by approximately $2.6 million in 2008.   Inventory Valuation:  Ourinventory consists primarily of finished goods available for sale at our retaillocations or within our distribution centers and is recorded at the lower ofaverage cost (which         39            approximates FIFO)or market. The cost components recorded within inventory are the vendor invoicecost and certain allocated external and internal freight, distribution,warehousing and other costs relating to merchandise acquisition required tobring the merchandise from the vendor to the point-of-sale.   Typically, themarket value of our inventory is higher than its aggregate cost. Determinationof the market value may be very complex and, therefore, requires a high degreeof judgment. In order for management to make the appropriate determination ofmarket value, the following items are commonly considered: inventory turnoverstatistics, current selling prices, seasonality factors, consumer trends,competitive pricing, performance of similar products or accessories, plannedpromotional incentives, technological obsolescence, and estimated costs to sellor dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions.   Ifthe estimated market value, calculated as the amount we expect to realize, netof estimated selling costs, from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory,is determined to be less than the recorded cost, we record a provision to reducethe carrying amount of the inventory item to its net realizable value.Differences between management estimates and actual performance and pricing ofour merchandise could result in inventory valuations that differ from the amountrecorded at the financial statement date and could also cause fluctuations inthe amount of recorded cost of products sold.   Ifour estimates regarding market value are inaccurate or changes in consumerdemand affect certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may be exposed tomaterial losses or gains in excess of our established valuationreserve.   Estimation of Reserves and ValuationAllowances:  The amount of liability we record for claims related toinsurance, tax and legal contingencies requires us to make judgments about theamount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We use our history andexperience, as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims, inevaluating the amount of liability we should record. As additional informationbecomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our variousclaims and revise our estimates as appropriate. These revisions could materiallyimpact our results of operations and financial position orliquidity.   Weare insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation, property andother liability claims, with deductibles up to $1.0 million per occurrence. Thisinsurance coverage limits our exposure for any catastrophic claims that mayarise above the deductible. We also have a self-insured health programadministered by a third-party covering the majority of our employees thatparticipate in our health insurance programs. We estimate the amount of ourreserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reportingperiod. This estimate is based on historical claims experience, demographicfactors, severity factors, and other factors we deem relevant. A 10% change inour insurance reserves at December 31, 2008, would have affected net income byapproximately $5.7 million. As of December 31, 2008, actual losses had notexceeded our expectations. Additionally, for claims that exceed our deductibleamount, we record a gross liability and corresponding receivable representingexpected recoveries, since we are not legally relieved of our obligation to theclaimant.   Weare subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign taxauthorities related to income tax, sales and use tax, personal property tax, andother forms of taxation. These audits examine our tax positions, timing ofincome and deductions, and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions.As part of our evaluation of these tax issues, we establish reserves in ourconsolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable taxexposures. Effective January 1, 2007, we began recognizing uncertain income taxpositions based on our assessment of whether the tax position was more likelythan not to be sustained on audit, as set forth within FASB Interpretation No.48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASBStatement No. 109.” Depending on the nature of the tax issue, we could besubject to audit over several years; therefore, our estimated reserve balancesmight exist for multiple years before an issue is resolved by the taxingauthority.   Additionally, weare involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated withemployment and other matters. A reserve has been established based on our bestestimate of the probable losses in these matters. This estimate has beendeveloped in consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel and is basedupon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies.         40            Although we believethat our tax and legal reserves are based on reasonable judgments and estimates,actual results could differ, which may expose us to material gains or losses infuture periods. These actual results could materially affect our effective taxrate, earnings, deferred tax balances and cash flows in the period ofresolution.   Valuation of Long-Lived Assets andIntangibles, including Goodwill:  Long-lived assets, such as property andequipment, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstancesindicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, such as negative cashflows or plans to dispose of or sell long-lived assets before the end of theirpreviously estimated useful lives. The carrying amount is considered notrecoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected toresult from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carryingamount is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amountby which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. We estimate fair value based onprojected future discounted cash flows.   Impairment losses,if any, are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs. The carryingvalue of the asset is adjusted to the new carrying value, and any subsequentincreases in fair value are not recorded. Additionally, if it is determined thatthe estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased, theperiodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new carrying value of theasset.   The impairmentcalculation requires us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cashflows, strategic plans, useful lives and discount rates. If actual results arenot consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed toadditional impairment charges, which could be material to our results ofoperations.   Wehave acquired goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assetsrelated to business acquisitions. The original valuation of these intangibleassets is based on estimates for future profitability, cash flows and otherjudgmental factors. We review our goodwill and other intangible asset balanceson an annual basis, during the fourth quarter, and whenever events or changes incircumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill or an intangible assetmight exceed their current fair value.   The determinationof fair value is based on various valuation techniques such as discounted cashflow and other comparable market analyses. These valuation techniques require usto make estimates and assumptions regarding future profitability, industryfactors, planned strategic initiatives, discount rates and other factors. Ifactual results or performance of certain business units are different from ourestimates, we may be exposed to an impairment charge related to our goodwill orintangible assets. The total value of our goodwill and intangible assets atDecember 31, 2008, was $38.8 million.   Stock-Based Compensation : Wehave historically granted certain stock-based awards to employees and directorsin the form of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restrictedstock and deferred stock units. See Note 2 - “Summary of Significant AccountingPolicies” and Note 7 - “Stock-Based Incentive Plans” for a more completediscussion of our stock-based compensation programs.   Atthe date that an award is granted, we determine the fair value of the award andrecognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period, whichtypically is the period over which the award vests. The restricted stock anddeferred stock units are valued at the fair market value of our stock on thedate of grant. The fair value of stock options with only service conditions isestimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair value ofstock options with service and market conditions is valued utilizing a latticemodel with Monte Carlo simulations. The Black-Scholes-Merton and lattice modelsrequire management to apply judgment and use highly subjective assumptions,including expected option life, expected volatility, and expected employeeforfeiture rate. We use historical data and judgment to estimate the expectedoption life and the employee forfeiture rate, and use historical and impliedvolatility when estimating the stock price volatility.   While theassumptions that we develop are based on our best expectations, they involveinherent uncertainties based on market conditions and employee behavior that areoutside of our control. If actual results are not consistent with theassumptions used, the stock-based compensation expense reported in our financialstatements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of thestock-based compensation. Additionally, if actual employee forfeituressignificantly differ from our estimated forfeitures,         41            wemay have an adjustment to our financial statements in future periods. A 10%change in our stock-based compensation expense in 2008 would have affected ournet income by approximately $1.3 million.   FACTORSTHAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS   Matters discussedin MD&A and in other parts of this report include forward-looking statementswithin the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A ofthe Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements arestatements that are not historical and may be identified by the use of wordssuch as “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “potential” orsimilar words. These matters include statements concerning management’s plansand objectives relating to our operations or economic performance and relatedassumptions. We specifically disclaim any duty to update any of the informationset forth in this report, including any forward-looking statements.Forward-looking statements are made based on management’s current expectationsand beliefs concerning future events and, therefore, involve a number ofassumptions, risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors described inItem 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Managementcautions that forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actualresults could differ materially from those expressed or implied in theforward-looking statements.   ITEM 7A . QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUTMARKET RISK.   AtDecember 31, 2008, the only derivative instruments that materially increased ourexposure to market risks for interest rates, foreign currency rates, commodityprices or other market price risks were the interest rate swaps noted in ourMD&A. We do not use derivatives for speculative purposes.   Our exposure tointerest rate risk results from changes in short-term interest rates. Interestrate risk exists with respect to our net investment position at December 31,2008, of $597.8 million, consisting of fluctuating short-term investments of$747.8 million and offset by $150 million of indebtedness which, because of ourinterest rate swaps, effectively bears interest at short-term floating rates. Ahypothetical increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the interest rateapplicable to this floating-rate net exposure would result in a change in annualnet interest expense of $6.0 million. This hypothesis assumes no change in theprincipal or investment balance.   ITEM 8 . FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY
