ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ("MD&A").  RadioShack is primarily a retailer of consumer electronics and services. We seek to  differentiate   ourselves  from  our  various  competitors  by  focusing  on dominating cost-effective solutions to meet everyone's routine electronics needs and  families'  distinct  electronics  wants.  This  strategy  allows us to take advantage of the unique opportunities provided by our extensive retail presence, specially-trained  sales staff and  relationships  with  reputable  vendors.  We believe this strategy  provides us with the  opportunity  to increase our market share in the highly  competitive  consumer  electronics  area.  In addition,  we continue  to focus on methods  to reduce  the costs of goods  sold and  selling, general and administrative expense. Furthermore, we believe that, by focusing on opportunities such as innovative products, new markets,  licensing opportunities and  creative  distribution  channels,  we  can  ultimately  generate  increased financial returns for our shareholders over the long term.  This section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K  discusses  certain  factors that may affect our future results  (including  economic and industry-wide  factors), our critical accounting  policies and estimates,  the results of our operations, our liquidity and financial condition, and our risk management practices.  FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS Matters  discussed  in  MD&A  and  in  other  parts  of  this  document  include forward-looking  statements  within the meaning of the federal  securities laws. These matters include  statements  concerning  management's plans and objectives relating to our operations or economic performance and related  assumptions.  We specifically  disclaim  any duty to update any of the  information  set forth in this  document,   including  any  forward-looking  statements.   Forward-looking statements  are made based on  management's  current  expectations  and  beliefs concerning  future  events  and,  therefore,  involve  a  number  of  risks  and uncertainties.  Management  cautions  that  forward-looking  statements  are not guarantees,  and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results of operations or financial  condition to differ include,  but are not necessarily limited to, the following factors.  General Business Factors  o    Changes in the national or regional U.S. economic conditions, including,      but not limited to, recessionary or inflationary trends, level of the      equity markets, consumer credit availability, interest rates, consumers'      disposable income and spending levels, job security and unemployment, and      overall consumer confidence; o    changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity exerted by      current competitors and potential new competition from both retail stores      and alternative methods or channels of distribution, such as e-commerce,      telephone shopping services and mail order; o    the inability to attract, retain and grow an effective management team in a      dynamic environment or changes in the cost or availability of a suitable      workforce to manage and support our service-driven operating strategies; o    any potential tariffs imposed on products that we import from China, as      well as the potential strengthening of China's currency against the U.S.      dollar; o    continuing terrorist activities in the U.S., as well as the international      war on terrorism; o    the disruption of international, national or regional transportation      systems; o    the lack of availability or access to sources of inventory; o    changes in the financial markets that would reduce or eliminate access to      longer term capital or short-term credit availability; o    the imposition of new restrictions or regulations regarding the products      and/or services we sell or changes in tax rules and regulations applicable      to us; o    the occurrence of severe weather events or natural disasters, which could      significantly damage or destroy outlets or prohibit consumers from      traveling to our retail locations, especially during the peak winter      holiday season; o    increases in ocean freight rates; and o    the inability to timely manufacture or receive Asian shipments due to the      potential emergence of a disease, including SARS.  RadioShack Specific Factors  o    The inability to successfully execute our strategy to dominate      cost-effective solutions to meet everyone's routine electronics needs and      families' distinct electronics wants; o    the failure to differentiate ourselves as an electronics specialty retailer      in the U.S. marketplace; o    the inability to create, maintain or renew profitable contracts or execute      business plans with providers of third-party branded products and with      service providers relating to cellular and PCS telephones; o    the presence or absence of new services or products and product features in      the merchandise categories we sell and unexpected changes in our actual      merchandise sales mix; o    the inability to collect the level of anticipated residual income,      subscriber acquisition fees and rebates for products and third-party      services offered by us;   o    the existence of contingent lease obligations related to our discontinued      retail operations arising from an assignee's or a sub-lessee's failure to      fulfill its lease commitments, or from our inability to identify suitable      sub-lessees for vacant facilities; o    the inability to successfully identify and analyze emerging growth      opportunities in the areas of strategic business alliances, licensing      opportunities, new markets, alternative sales channels, and innovative      products; o    the inability to successfully identify and enter into relationships with      developers of new technologies or the failure of these new technologies to      be adopted by the market; and o    any reductions or changes in the growth rate of the wireless industry and      changes in the wireless communications industry dynamics, including both      consolidation and the effects of number portability.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of our  consolidated  financial  statements  requires us to make estimates that affect the reported values of assets,  liabilities,  revenues and expenses.  Our estimates are based on  historical  experience  and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which  form  the  basis  for  our  conclusions.   We  continually  evaluate  the information  used to make  these  estimates  as our  business  and the  economic environment  changes. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements.  Note 2 to the consolidated  financial statements includes a summary of our most significant  accounting  policies,  but the accounting  policies and estimates we consider most critical are as follows:  Revenue Recognition: Our revenue is derived principally from the sale of private label and  third-party  branded  products and services to consumers.  Revenue is recognized,  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product  returns,  when delivery has occurred or services have been  rendered,  the sales price is fixed or determinable,  and  collectibility is reasonably  assured.  Certain products, such as wireless handsets and satellite systems, require the customer to use the services of a  third-party  service  provider.  In most cases,  the  third-party service  provider will pay us a fee or commission  for obtaining a new customer, as  well  as  a  monthly  recurring  residual  amount  based  upon  the  ongoing arrangement  between the service  provider and the  customer.  Fee or commission revenue,  net of estimated service  disconnects,  is generally recognized at the time the customer is accepted as a subscriber of a third-party service provider. Residual  income is  recognized  as earned under the terms of each contract with the service  provider,  which is  typically  as the service  provider  bills its customer, generally on a monthly basis. Material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if actual returns, sales, fee or commission  revenue  adjustments  exceed or are different  from our estimates or assumptions.  Additionally, we offer repair service (i.e., non-warranty) contracts on products sold.  These contracts  generally  provide extended service coverage for periods ranging from 12 to 60 months.  We offer these  contracts in all but three states on behalf of an unrelated third-party obligor. We are not considered the primary obligor on these  contracts.  In these  circumstances,  our share of  commission revenue  is  recognized  as income  at the time the  contract  is sold.  For the contracts offered in the three states where we are the primary obligor, revenues from the sale of these  contracts  are  recognized  ratably over the term of the contracts. Costs directly related to the sale of such contracts are deferred and charged to cost of products sold proportionately as the revenues are recognized. A loss is  recognized on extended  service  contracts if the sum of the expected costs of  providing  services  pursuant  to the  contracts  exceeds  the related unearned revenue.  Receivables:  We record receivables based on the amount of revenue recognized as described above. Our receivables  primarily  consist of amounts due from certain vendors,  third-party  service  providers,   dealer/franchisees  and  commercial customers. The carrying amount of the receivables is continually evaluated based on  the  likelihood  of  collection.  An  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  is established  for estimated  losses  resulting from the inability of our vendors, third-party  service  providers,   and  both   dealer/franchise  and  commercial customers  to make  their  required  payments.  Factors  such as these  parties' creditworthiness,  payment terms, historical results and economic conditions are considered   when   making   these   decisions.   If  any  of   these   parties' creditworthiness deteriorates beyond our expectations, or if any of their actual defaults  exceed our historical  experience,  such that actual  collections  are different from their recorded amounts,  material charges to our selling, general and administrative expenses could be required.  Inventory:  Inventory  is  our  largest  asset  class.  Our  inventory  consists primarily  of finished  goods and is recorded at the lower of cost (based on the average cost method) or market.  We make estimates  regarding the carrying value of our inventory on an  item-by-item  basis.  If the amount we expect to receive from the sale of the  inventory is less than its cost, we write down the cost of the  inventory to its  estimated  realizable  value based on  assumptions  about future  demand and  market  conditions.  If actual  market  conditions  are less favorable  than those  projected  by  management,  or if  unexpected  changes in technology affect demand for certain products,  we could be exposed to losses on the recorded amounts in inventory in excess of our established reserves.   Accrued  Expenses:  The amount of liability we record for claims related to self insurance,  warranty and pending litigation  requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We use our past history and  experience,  as well as  other  specific  circumstances  surrounding  these claims,  in  evaluating  the  amount  of  liability  that we should  record.  As additional  information  becomes  available,  we assess the potential  liability related to our various  claims and revise our  estimates as  appropriate.  These revisions  could  materially  impact our  results of  operations  and  financial position.  Income Taxes:  We are subject to income taxes in many  jurisdictions,  including the U.S.,  states and  localities,  and abroad.  We must first  determine  which revenues  and  expenses  should be included in each  taxing  jurisdiction.  This process  involves the  estimation of our actual  current tax exposure,  together with the assessment of temporary  differences resulting from differing treatment of income or expense  items for tax and  accounting  purposes.  We establish tax reserves in our  consolidated  financial  statements  based on our estimation of current tax exposures. If we prevail in tax matters for which reserves have been established  or we are  required  to settle  matters  in  excess of  established reserves,  our  effective  tax rate for a particular  period could be materially affected.  Temporary  differences arising from differing treatment of income and expense items for tax and financial  reporting  purposes  result in deferred tax assets and  liabilities  that are recorded on our balance  sheet.  If our actual results  differ  from  estimated  results or if we adjust our  estimates  in the future such that we would not expect to realize all or part of our net  deferred tax assets, we may need to establish a valuation  allowance against our deferred tax assets, which could also materially affect our effective tax rate.  OVERVIEW OF 2003 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Management  reviews  a  number  of key  indicators  to  evaluate  our  financial performance, including:    o        net sales and operating revenues,    o        gross margin,    o        selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense, and    o        operating margin.  For 2003,  RadioShack's net sales and operating revenues increased 1.6%, and our gross margin improved to 49.8% of our 2003 net sales. Our SG&A expense decreased to 37.4% of our 2003 net sales,  helping to  increase  our  operating  margin to 10.4%.  In managing our business,  management uses various metrics for company  operated stores,  including  average tickets per store and average sales per ticket.  See the table below for a summary of these statistics for the years indicated.                                       2003        2002        2001                                    ---------   ---------   --------- Average tickets per store per day     72          73          71 Average sales per ticket            $30.77      $29.40      $30.41  For a more detailed  discussion of our financial  performance,  please  continue reading our MD&A,  Consolidated  Financial  Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  RETAIL OUTLETS The table below shows our retail  locations  broken down between  company stores and  dealer/franchise  outlets.  While the  dealer/franchise  outlets  represent approximately 27% of RadioShack's  total retail locations,  our sales of product to  dealer/franchisees  are less than 10% of our  total net sales and  operating revenues (see "Results of Operations" below).

We had a 2% increase in comparable  company store sales.  These increases were  primarily the result of a 14.3% increase in wireless  department sales,  partially  offset by a decline in sales  within  the home  entertainment department.  These  sales  increases  were  possible  because of an  increase in average store volume,  despite a decrease in 2003 of 40 company  stores,  net of store  openings.  We expect a sales gain for 2004 as discussed in further detail below.  Sales to our dealer/franchise  outlets, in addition to retail support operations and other sales,  were down $31.1 million for 2003, or a decrease of 9.4%,  when compared to 2002.  Sales to our  dealer/franchise  outlets remain  substantially less than 10% of our total sales.  Retail support  operation sales are generated primarily  from outside  sales of our repair  centers,  RadioShack  Installation Services  ("RSIS"),  and domestic and  overseas  manufacturing.  The decrease in retail support  operations  sales from 2002 to 2003  primarily  resulted from an overall decline in our RSIS commercial  business,  the closure of several of our manufacturing  facilities in the third quarter of 2003,  and the sale of RSIS in September  2003. We expect 2004 sales from  dealer/franchise  and retail support operations  to  underperform,  compared  to the 2004  sales  performance  of the Company as a whole.   Sales in the  wireless  communication  department,  which is made up of wireless handsets (including related services),  accessories,  and wireless services such as prepaid  airtime and bill payments,  increased 14.3% in dollars and increased as a percentage of total sales to 34.9% in 2003 compared to 31.0% in 2002.  This sales increase was due primarily to an increase in the average  selling price of our wireless handsets, resulting from our continued emphasis on national carrier service and product offerings with desirable product features and content,  such as color  screens and cameras.  In addition,  sales  increases in both  wireless services and  accessories  contributed  to this  increase.  We believe our plans featuring new technologies,  sales promotions,  and carrier  compensation models will result in wireless sales increases for 2004.  Sales  in  the  wired  communication  department,   which  includes  residential telephones,  answering machines and other related telephony products,  decreased 9.5% in dollars and  decreased as a  percentage  of total sales to 7.4% in 2003, compared to 8.3% in 2002. These decreases were primarily the result of a decline in 2003 sales of the "Telezapper," a call screening product,  although they were partially offset by sales increases of cordless phones. We anticipate that sales in this  department  will be down  for  2004,  compared  to 2003,  as  customers continue to migrate to more advanced technologies.  Sales in the  radio  communication  department  decreased  4.8% in  dollars  and decreased  slightly as a percentage of total sales to 2.5% in 2003,  compared to 2.6% in 2002.  The decrease in this  department  was  primarily  the result of a decrease in Family Radio Service ("FRS"), two-way radio sales, scanner sales and communication accessories,  partially offset by a sales increase in GPS devices. We believe sales in this  department  will be  approximately  the same for 2004, compared to 2003.  Sales in the home entertainment department, which consists of all home audio and video  end-products  and accessories,  including DTH hardware and  installation, decreased 13.7% in dollars and decreased as a percentage of total sales to 15.9% in 2003 compared to 18.7% in 2002.  These decreases were primarily  attributable to a  decline  in sales of  satellite  dishes  and  their  related  installation services, as well as a decrease in home entertainment accessory sales. The sales decrease was partially offset by increased sales of DVD players and televisions. We anticipate that sales in the home  entertainment  department will be down for 2004, compared to 2003.  Sales in the computer  department,  which  includes  desktop,  laptop,  handheld computers  and related  accessories,  in  addition  to digital  cameras and home networking products, decreased slightly in dollars and decreased as a percentage of total sales to 9.8% in 2003 compared to 10.0% in 2002.  These  decreases were primarily  the  result  of a  planned  decrease  in  sales of  desktop  CPUs and monitors, substantially offset by increased sales of digital cameras, camcorders and  related  accessories,  as well as home  networking  products  and  computer accessories.  We expect that sales in the computer  department  will increase in 2004, compared to 2003.  Sales in the power and technical  department  increased  slightly in dollars and remained at 13.6% of total sales for both 2003 and 2002. This sales increase was primarily due to increased  sales of general and special  purpose  batteries and power  inverters,  but was  partially  offset  by  decreased  sales  of bulk and packaged wire, as well as decreases for technical parts and tools. We anticipate that sales will increase in this department in 2004, compared to 2003.  Sales in the personal electronics,  toys and personal audio department increased slightly in dollars and remained at 12.6% of total sales for both 2003 and 2002. The increase in this department was due primarily to micro radio-controlled cars and related accessories not available in the first nine months of 2002 and, to a lesser extent,  sales of wellness  products sold under our  LifeWise(TM)  brand. Also, increased sales of personal audio products had a positive impact for 2003, resulting from increases in national  security threats and the conflict in Iraq. These  increases  were  substantially  offset  by  decreased  sales of  personal electronics, excluding wellness products, and educational toys. We believe sales in this department will be approximately the same for 2004, compared to 2003.  GROSS PROFIT  Gross profit for 2003 was $2,315.7  million or 49.8% of net sales and  operating revenues,  compared  with  $2,238.3  million or 48.9% of net sales and operating revenues in 2002,  resulting  in a 3.5%  increase in gross profit and a 90 basis point increase in our gross profit  percentage.  These  increases over the prior year were primarily due to the following:  We  experienced  over $40.0  million in benefit from our supply chain vendor and strategic pricing initiatives. In connection with these initiatives, we utilized on line reverse auctions,  realized more favorable terms from vendors,  improved the impact of markdowns,  priced our products more  appropriately,  and utilized other techniques and incentives to optimize gross profit.  We also improved our merchandise mix within  departments by increasing the sales mix for many of our higher margin products, while managing the mix down for many lower margin products.   We  anticipate  that gross  profit as a  percentage  of net sales and  operating revenues will continue to improve for 2004, when compared to 2003, due primarily to the planned  enhancement  of our  current  sales mix  towards  higher  margin products such as computer accessories, batteries, wellness and digital products. Also, the impact of additional supply chain management initiatives, particularly in vendor  relations and  end-of-life  inventory  management,  should  provide a positive impact.

The dollar  increase for 2003 was primarily due to a $23.9 million increase in payroll and commissions and a $13.4 million  increase  in  advertising,   partially  offset  by  the  $29.0  million litigation charge in 2002 related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit in California.  Payroll  expense  increased  by $23.9  million  to  $751.9  million  in 2003 and increased  0.3  percentage  points to 16.2%  percent of net sales and  operating revenues in 2003, compared to 15.9% in 2002. The increase in both dollars and as a percentage  of total sales was due  primarily to an increase in incentive  pay based on  increased  earnings,  as well as the 2.4%  increase in company  retail sales. We expect payroll expense to increase in 2004.  Advertising  expense  increased  $13.4  million in 2003 to $254.4  million  from $241.0 million in 2002 and increased 0.2 percentage  points to 5.5% of net sales and operating revenues in 2003, compared to 5.3% in 2002.  Rent expense  increased by $5.2 million to $250.1  million in 2003, but remained the same as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues of 5.4% in both 2003 and  2002.  The  dollar  increase  was  due  primarily  to  lease  renewals  and relocations at higher rates,  as well as a slight  increase in the average store size. The percent of net sales remained the same due to fewer company stores and our continued rent reduction efforts.  We expect a similar increase in 2004 rent for the same reasons described for 2003.   Insurance  expense  increased  $10.5 million to $81.5 million in 2003 from $71.0 million in 2002 and increased as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues to 1.8% in 2003,  compared to 1.6% in 2002.  Substantially  all of our insurance expense  relates  to our  self-insurance  programs.  We  maintain  reserves  for self-insurance  liabilities  related to our group  medical and casualty  losses, which include general and product liability and workers'  compensation.  In some cases,  risks are  insured  through  outside  carriers  for  losses in excess of self-insured amounts.  These reserves are adjusted to reflect estimates based on historical  experience,  estimated  claims  incurred but not yet  reported,  the impact  of risk  management  programs,  and the  estimated  effect  of  external factors.   As  of  December  31,  2003,  actual  losses  had  not  exceeded  our expectations.  In 2004,  we expect SG&A expense to increase  slightly in dollars,  but decrease slightly as a percentage of net sales and operating  revenues,  due to increased sales volume and a continued focus on leveraging our fixed expense base.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  Depreciation  and amortization  expense  decreased $2.7 million dollars to $92.0 million and remained at 2.0% of net sales and  operating  revenues for both 2003 and 2002. We expect  depreciation and amortization  expense to increase slightly in 2004,  due to  depreciation  increases  associated  with new store  fixtures, capitalized  software related to inventory  management,  and information systems projects.  GAIN ON CONTRACT TERMINATION  There was no gain on contract  termination in 2003. For information on the prior year gain on contract  termination,  see the discussion  below under the section titled "2002 Compared with 2001."  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  There was no impairment of long-lived  assets in 2003.  For  information  on the prior year impairment of long-lived  assets,  see the discussion below under the section titled "2002 Compared with 2001."  NET INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $22.9  million for 2003 versus $34.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $11.5 million or 33.4%.  Interest expense  decreased to $35.7 million in 2003 from $43.4 million in 2002. This  decrease  was  primarily  the result of a reduction  in the  average  debt outstanding throughout 2003. In addition, our interest rate swap instruments and the   capitalization  of  $2.6  million  of  interest  expense  related  to  the construction of our new corporate  campus also lowered overall  interest expense for the year ended  December  31,  2003,  when  compared  to the same prior year period.  Interest income increased over 42% to $12.8 million in 2003 from $9.0 million in 2002, primarily as a result of a $5.6 million increase in interest received from tax  settlements  in 2003,  as  compared  to 2002.  Interest  income,  including accretion of discount as applicable,  earned on the amounts  outstanding  during the three years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, was as follows:                                 Year Ended December 31,                             ----------------------------- (In millions)                 2003      2002       2001 - -------------               --------  --------   -------- CompUSA note receivable     $  --     $  --      $  6.1 Other (includes short-term  investment interest)         12.8       9.0        6.9                             --------  --------   -------- Total interest income       $ 12.8    $  9.0     $ 13.0                             ========  ========   ========  Interest expense,  net of interest income, is expected to decrease in 2004, when compared to 2003.  OTHER INCOME, NET  On July 28,  2003,  we  received  payment of $15.7  million  resulting  from the favorable  settlement  of a lawsuit we had  previously  filed.  We recorded this settlement in the third quarter of 2003 as other income of $10.7 million, net of legal expenses of $5.0 million paid as a result of the lawsuit.  On September  10, 2003, we sold our  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  AmeriLink  Corp. ("AmeriLink"),   also   referred  to  as  RSIS,   to  INSTALLS  inc,  LLC  in  a cash-for-stock sale,  resulting in a loss of $1.8 million,  based on AmeriLink's book value, which was recorded in other income.  For the year ended  December 31, 2003,  we received and recorded  income of $3.1 million  owed to us under a tax sharing  agreement  with  O'Sullivan  Industries Holdings, Inc.  ("O'Sullivan"),  compared to $33.9 million received and recorded in the  corresponding  prior  year  period.  In the second  quarter of 2002,  we received and recorded  income of $27.7 million in partial  settlement of amounts owed  to us  under  this  tax  sharing  agreement  that  was the  subject  of an arbitration  dispute with O'Sullivan.  This partial settlement followed a ruling in our favor by the  arbitration  panel.  Future  payments under the tax sharing agreement will vary based on the level of  O'Sullivan's  future earnings and are also dependent on O'Sullivan's  overall financial  condition and ability to pay. There can be no assurances  that future  payments will be received under the tax sharing agreement each quarter,  nor can we give any assurances as to the amount of payment that may be received each quarter.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  Our  provision for income taxes  reflects an effective  income tax rate of 36.9% for 2003 and 38.0% for 2002.  The decrease in the  effective  tax rate for 2003, when compared to 2002, was the result of a favorable tax  settlement  related to prior year tax matters.  We anticipate that the effective tax rate for 2004 will be approximately 38.0%.  2002 COMPARED WITH 2001  NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES  Sales  decreased  approximately  4.2% to $4,577.2  million in 2002 from $4,775.7 million in 2001.  This  decrease was  primarily the result of a 38.7% decline in sales to our dealer/franchise  outlets in 2002, mainly due to the decline in DTH unit sales. In addition,  we also had a 1% decrease in comparable  company store sales due primarily to the decline of DTH unit sales and desktop computers,  but offset by sales increases in wireless handsets and related  accessories.  Retail support  operations,  service plans and other sales decreased 26.2% from 2001 to 2002  primarily  as a  result  of a $19.1  million  decrease  in  2002  domestic manufacturing  sales  due to  large  Verizon  fixture  sales in 2001 and a $15.2 million  decrease  in RSIS  sales as a  result  of our  exit  from the  national commercial  installation  business  at the end of 2001.  Sales  in the  wireless communication department increased 9.4% in dollars and increased to 31.1% of our total  sales in 2002  from  27.2% in 2001.  This  sales  increase  was due to an increase in sales of wireless  handsets and accessories  which resulted from our emphasis on national  carrier  offerings  with  desirable  product  features and content,  such as color screens,  photo capability and Internet access. Sales in the wired  communication  department  decreased  1.0% in dollars  and  increased slightly as a  percentage  of our total sales to 8.3% in 2002 from 8.0% in 2001. Increased sales of cordless  telephones were more than offset by decreased sales of corded telephones. Sales in the radio communication department decreased 8.7% in dollars and decreased  slightly as a percentage of our total sales to 2.6% in 2002 from 2.8% in 2001. The decrease in this department was primarily the result of a decrease in Family Radio Service ("FRS") and CB radio sales,  scanner sales and  communication  accessories,  partially  offset by a sales  increase  in GPS devices.  Sales in the home entertainment  department decreased 23.7% in dollars and  decreased as a percentage of our total sales to 18.7% in 2002 from 23.5% in 2001. Substantially all of the dollar decrease was attributable to a decrease in sales of satellite dishes and related installations. This decrease was partially offset by  increased  sales of DVD  players.  Sales in the  computer  department decreased  0.9% in dollars and  increased as a percentage  of our total sales to 10.0% in 2002 from 9.6% in 2001.  These sales dollars were maintained  primarily due to an increase in laptop computers,  computer accessories and digital camera sales, offset by a decline in unit sales of desktop CPUs and monitors.  Sales in the power and  technical  department  increased  0.8% in  dollars  and also as a percentage  of our  total  sales  to  13.6% in 2002  from  13.0% in 2001.  These increases were primarily due to increased  sales of general and special  purpose batteries,  partially  offset by decreased  sales of bulk and packaged  wire and technical  parts.  Sales in the personal  electronics,  toys and personal  audio department  increased 2.6% in dollars,  as well as increasing as a percentage of our total sales to 12.6% in 2002 from 11.8% in 2001,  due primarily to increased sales of micro radio  controlled  cars and related  accessories,  in addition to unique giftables.  GROSS PROFIT  Gross  profit in 2002 was $2,238.3  million or 48.9% of net sales and  operating revenues,  compared  with  $2,296.8  million or 48.1% of net sales and operating revenues  in  2001.  Gross  profit  decreased  $58.5  million  or 2.5% in  2002, primarily as a result of a 4.2%  decrease in net sales and  operating  revenues. Despite this  decrease in gross  profit  dollars,  the gross  profit  percentage increased from 48.1% to 48.9% in 2002, due primarily to an increase in the gross profit percentage in the home entertainment  department and, to a lesser extent, increases in both the power and technical and computer departments' gross profit percentages.  Our gross  profit  percentage  increase  was  partially  offset by reductions in both the wireless and wired departments' gross profit percentages, compounded by the increase in the wireless communication department's percent of total retail sales.  The reduction in gross profit dollars was partially  offset by a decrease  in the total  sales mix  attributable  to the home  entertainment department,  which has a lower gross profit  percentage than our overall average gross profit percentage,  as well as an increase in gross profit dollars for the power  and  technical  department.  Additionally,  the gross  profit  percentage improved for our retail support operations in 2002.   SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  Our SG&A  expense  increased  0.9% in dollars and  increased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to 37.8% for the year ended December 31, 2002, from 35.9% for the year ended  December  31, 2001.  The dollar  increase for 2002 was primarily due to a $29.0 million  litigation charge related to the settlement of a class  action  lawsuit in  California  and a $6.0  million  charge to our 1996 restructuring  reserve as a result of the bankruptcy of a sub-lessee in a former Incredible Universe store site. A $14.6 million increase in our rent expense and lower overall  sales in 2002 also  contributed  to a higher SG&A expense  ratio. This was partially  offset by a $7.6 million charge for store closing costs from 2001, which did not reoccur in 2002.  Payroll expense decreased by $12.3 million to $728.0 million in 2002, but increased  slightly as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to 15.9% in 2002,  compared to 15.5% in 2001. The decrease in dollars was due primarily to our reduction in headcount during the third quarter of 2001.  Rent expense  increased by $14.6 million to $244.9 million in 2002 and increased as a percent of net sales and operating  revenues to 5.4% in 2002 from 4.8% in  2001.  These  increases  were  due  primarily  to  lease  renewals  and relocations at higher rates,  as well as a slight  increase in the average store size. Advertising expense decreased $12.9 million in 2002 to $241.0 million from $253.9  million  in 2001,  while  remaining  at 5.3% of net sales and  operating revenues  during both 2002 and 2001. The dollar decrease was due primarily to an increase in advertising  contributions  from our various vendors and third-party service providers. Insurance expense increased $10.4 million to $71.0 million in 2002 from  $60.6  million  in 2001 and  increased  as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to 1.6% in 2002, compared to 1.3% in 2001. As of December 31, 2002,   actual  losses   regarding   insurance   claims  had  not  exceeded  our expectations.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  Depreciation and amortization  expense  decreased $13.6 million dollars to $94.7 million and decreased as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues to 2.0% in 2002 from 2.3% in 2001.  These  decreases were primarily  attributable to the elimination of goodwill amortization related to RSIS, as well as the sale of our corporate headquarters, during the fourth quarter of 2001.  GAIN ON CONTRACT TERMINATION  RadioShack  and  Microsoft  mutually  agreed  during  2002  to  terminate  their agreement  and settle the  remaining  commitments  each had to one another.  The termination  of this agreement took effect at the start of the fourth quarter of 2002, upon satisfaction of several  contractual  obligations.  The net financial result was an $18.5 million gain (principally  cash received),  driven primarily by the settlement of a multi-year obligation Microsoft had to connect our stores with broadband capabilities.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  AmeriLink  was  acquired  in 1999 to  provide us with  residential  installation capabilities for the technologies and services offered in our retail stores.  As a result of continued  difficulties in the DTH business and a refocus during the fourth quarter on our satellite installation  strategy,  together with a revised cash flow projection for our overall installation  business,  we determined that the remaining long-lived assets associated with RSIS were impaired.  We compared the  carrying  value of these  long-lived  assets  with  their  fair  value  and determined that the remaining  goodwill balance of $8.1 million was impaired and we, therefore,  recorded an impairment charge of this amount in the accompanying 2002  Consolidated  Statement of Income.  As of December 31, 2002,  there was no remaining goodwill balance on our balance sheet relating to RSIS.  LOSS ON SALE OF ASSETS  In the fourth  quarter of 2001,  we sold and leased  back most of our  corporate headquarters  at a loss of $44.8  million.  In June  2001,  we  received  $123.6 million  for the  settlement  of the  Computer  City,  Inc.  purchase  price and settlement of the $136.0 million note which was received in connection  with the sale of Computer City,  Inc. in 1998.  Thus, we incurred an additional loss from the sale of Computer City, Inc. of $12.4 million.  EMPLOYEE SEPARATION AND OTHER COSTS  During  the third  quarter of 2001,  as part of our effort to control  operating costs, we incurred approximately $13.5 million in charges related to a reduction of our  labor  force,  primarily  for  early  retirements  and  involuntary  and voluntary employee  severance.  In addition,  during the fourth quarter of 2001, $4.8 million in charges were incurred relating to the closure of RSIS's national commercial  installation  business.  These  costs were  primarily  comprised  of severance   costs,   write-offs   of  certain  fixed  assets  and  future  lease commitments.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $34.4  million for 2002 versus $37.8 million for 2001.  Interest expense  decreased to $43.4 million in 2002 from $50.8 million in 2001, primarily as a result of a reduction in the average debt outstanding  throughout 2002.  In addition,  our interest  rate swap  instruments  also lowered  overall interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2002, when compared to the same prior year period.  Interest income decreased almost 31% to $9.0 million in 2002 from $13.0 million in 2001, due primarily to CompUSA's early payment of its note to us in June 2001, which eliminated the associated interest income.  OTHER INCOME, NET  In the second quarter of 2002, we received payments and recorded income of $27.7 million  in  partial  settlement  of  amounts  owed to us  under  a tax  sharing agreement  that was the subject of an arbitration  which  commenced in July 1999 and was styled Tandy Corporation and T.E. Electronics,  L.P. vs. O'Sullivan. The arbitration ruling requires  O'Sullivan to comply with the tax sharing agreement that was entered into by the parties at the time of O'Sullivan's  initial public offering.  During the second half of 2002,  we received two payments  totaling $6.2 million relating to quarterly payments under the tax sharing agreement with O'Sullivan.  PROVISION FOR LOSS ON INTERNET-RELATED INVESTMENT  During  the  second  quarter  of 2000,  we made a $30.0  million  investment  in Digital:Convergence  Corporation  ("DC"), a privately-held  Internet  technology company.  In the first quarter of 2001,  we concluded  that our  investment  had experienced a decline in value that, in our opinion,  was other than  temporary. This  conclusion  was based on DC's  inability to secure  sufficient  additional funding or to complete an initial public  offering.  As such, we recorded a loss provision equal to our initial investment.  DC subsequently filed for bankruptcy on March 22, 2002.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  Our  provision for income taxes  reflects an effective  income tax rate of 38.0% for 2002 and 42.8% for 2001. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2002 when compared to 2001 was the result of the 2001  impairment of RSIS goodwill,  which was not deductible for tax purposes and caused the increased  effective tax rate in 2001.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2001,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting  for Asset  Retirement  Obligations,"  which is effective for fiscal years  beginning  after  June 15,  2002.  SFAS  No.  143  establishes  financial accounting  and  reporting   standards  for  obligations   associated  with  the retirement of tangible  long-lived  assets and the associated  asset  retirement costs.  We adopted SFAS No. 143 effective  January 1, 2003, and made no material adjustments  to our  consolidated  financial  statements  as a  result  of  this adoption.  In June 2002,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,  "Accounting  for Costs  Associated with Exit or Disposal  Activities."  SFAS No. 146 addresses  significant  issues relating to the recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities,  including restructuring activities, and nullifies the  guidance  in  Emerging  Issues  Task  Force  Issue  No.  94-3,   "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)."  The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal  activities  initiated  after December 31, 2002.  Retroactive  application of SFAS No. 146 is prohibited  and, accordingly, liabilities recognized prior to the initial application of SFAS No. 146 should  continue to be accounted for in  accordance  with EITF 94-3 or other applicable  preexisting  guidance.  We adopted SFAS No. 146 effective January 1, 2003, and made no material adjustments to our consolidated  financial statements as a result of this adoption.  In April 2003,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 149,  "Amendment  of  Statement  133 on Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities."  SFAS  No.  149  amends  and clarifies  accounting for derivative  instruments,  including certain derivative instruments  embedded in other contracts,  and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts  entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, for hedging relationships  designated after June 30, 2003, and to certain preexisting  contracts.  We adopted SFAS No. 149 effective July 1, 2003, and made no material  adjustments to our consolidated  financial statements as a result of this adoption.  In May 2003,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,  "Accounting  for Certain  Financial Instruments  with  Characteristics  of Both  Liabilities  and Equity,"  which is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. SFAS No. 150 establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for how an issuer   classifies   and   measures   certain   financial    instruments   with characteristics  of both  liabilities  and  equities.  We  adopted  SFAS No. 150 effective  June 1, 2003, and made no material  adjustments  to our  consolidated financial statements as a result of this adoption.  In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 is effective for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The  disclosure  requirements  were  effective for certain  guarantees existing  at  December  31,  2002,  and expand  the  disclosures  required  by a guarantor about its obligations under a guarantee.  FIN 45 also requires that we recognize  guarantees  entered into or modified  after  December 31, 2002,  as a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in the issuance of the guarantee.  We adopted FIN 45 on January 1, 2003, its effective date, and, aside from the required  disclosure  provisions,  made no material  adjustments to our consolidated financial statements as a result of this adoption.  In January 2003, the FASB issued  Interpretation 46,  "Consolidation of Variable Interest  Entities - An  Interpretation  of ARB No.  51." FIN 46 is  intended to clarify the application of ARB No. 51, "Consolidated  Financial  Statements," to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the  characteristics of a controlling  financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance  its  activities  without  additional  subordinated  financial support.  For  those  entities,  a  controlling  financial  interest  cannot  be identified  based on an  evaluation  of  voting  interests  and may be  achieved through  arrangements  that do not involve voting  interests.  The consolidation requirement of FIN 46 is effective immediately to variable interests in variable interest  entities  ("VIEs")  created or obtained after January 31, 2003. FIN 46 also sets forth certain disclosures  regarding interests in VIEs that are deemed significant,  even if consolidation is not required.  In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46 (revised  December  2003),  "Consolidation  of  Variable  Interest Entities" (FIN 46R),  which delayed the effective date of the  application to us of FIN 46 to  non-special  purpose VIEs acquired or created  before  February 1, 2003, to the interim  period ending on March 31, 2004,  and provided  additional technical  clarifications to implementation  issues. We have determined that FIN 46 does not apply to our  dealer/franchise  outlets and we do not expect to make material adjustments to our consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of this Interpretation.  In November 2002,  the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 02-16,  "Accounting for Consideration  Received from a Vendor by a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor's  Products)." EITF 02-16 provides guidance on how cash consideration received by a customer  from a vendor  should be  classified  in the  customer's statement of income. EITF 02-16 is effective prospectively for new arrangements, including  modifications of existing  arrangements,  entered into after December 31, 2002. We adopted EITF 02-16 effective  January 1, 2003, and made no material adjustments  to our  consolidated  financial  statements  as a  result  of  this adoption.  In November 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-10,  "Application of EITF Issue No. 02-16,  `Accounting  by a Customer  (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration  Received from a Vendor,' by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers." EITF 03-10 provides guidance on how cash consideration  received by a customer  from a vendor should be classified in the customer's  statement of income.  EITF 03-10 is effective  prospectively for new arrangements,  including  modification  of existing  arrangements,  entered into after  December 31, 2003. We adopted EITF 03-10  effective  January 1, 2004, and made no material  adjustments  to our  consolidated  financial  statements  as a result of this adoption.  CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY A summary of cash flows from  operating,  investing and financing  activities is outlined in the table below.                                 Year Ended December 31,                             ---------------------------- (In millions)                 2003      2002      2001 - -------------               --------  --------  -------- Operating activities        $ 651.9   $ 521.6   $ 775.8 Investing activities         (188.9)    (99.0)     (2.3) Financing activities         (274.8)   (377.5)   (502.8)  In 2003,  cash flows  provided  by  operating  activities  was  $651.9  million, compared to $521.6 million and $775.8 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively.  During  the year ended  December  31,  2003,  changes  in  accounts  receivable, consisting  primarily  of amounts due from our various  vendors and  third-party service providers,  provided $17.2 million in cash, compared to $68.2 million in the prior year.  Cash  provided by accounts  receivable in 2003 and 2002 was the result  of  reductions   of  vendor  and  service   provider   receivables   and dealer/franchise  receivables,  due to increased  collections and lower sales of satellite television hardware.  During the year ended December 31, 2003,  changes in inventory  provided  $202.3 million in cash,  compared  to a $21.4  million  cash  usage  during  2002.  The decrease in  inventory  since  December 31, 2002,  was  primarily  the result of supply chain initiatives, including a greater focus on reducing weeks-of-supply.  Typically,  our annual cash  requirements  for pre-seasonal  inventory  build-up range between $200.0 million and $400.0 million.  The funding  required for this build-up comes primarily from cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and operating  revenues.  We had $634.7  million in cash and cash  equivalents as of December 31, 2003, as a resource for our funding  needs.  Additional  capital is available  under our $600.0 million dollar  commercial  paper program,  which is supported  by a bank  credit  facility  that could be  utilized in the event the commercial  paper  market is  unavailable  to us. We  currently  do not  expect, however, the commercial paper market to become unavailable to us or that we will have to  utilize  the  credit  facility.  As of  December  31,  2003,  we had no commercial paper outstanding or other utilization of our credit facility.  During  the year  ended  December  31,  2003,  $118.7  million  less in cash was provided by accounts  payable  due to lower  inventory  levels than in the prior year. Additionally,  $29.6 million more in cash was provided by accrued expenses and $12.7  million  more in cash was provided by reduced  income taxes  payable, compared to the prior year.  Cash used in investing activities in 2003 was $188.9 million,  compared to $99.0 million  and  $2.3  million  used  in  2002  and  2001,  respectively.   Capital expenditures were $189.6 million in 2003, compared to $106.8 million in 2002 and $139.2 million in 2001.  Capital  expenditures for 2003 increased over the prior two years,  primarily due to the construction of our new corporate campus, while capital  expenditures for both 2002 and 2001 were primarily for our retail store expansions and remodels and upgrades of information systems. We also had capital expenditures  relating  to retail  stores and  information  systems in 2003.  In addition,  we purchased land costing $18.3 million in 2001 for our new corporate headquarters  building. We anticipate that our capital expenditure  requirements for 2004 will be approximately  $300.0 million. The $110.0 million increase over 2003  primarily  relates to our new corporate  headquarters.  Store remodels and relocations and updated  information  systems account for the almost half of the balance of our anticipated 2004 capital expenditures.  See further discussion of our new facilities below in the section titled "Capital  Structure and Financial Condition."  As of December  31,  2003,  we had $634.7  million in cash and cash equivalents. These cash and cash equivalents, along with cash generated from our net sales and  operating  revenues and, if necessary,  both our  short-term  and long-term financing facilities, are available to fund future capital expenditure needs.  Cash used in financing activities was $274.8 million in 2003, compared to $377.5 million  and  $502.8  million  in 2002 and 2001,  respectively.  We used  $286.2 million for the  repurchase  of our common stock in 2003 and $329.9  million and $308.3 million for the repurchase of our common and preferred  stock in 2002 and 2001,  respectively.  Repurchases  of common  stock  were  made  under our share repurchase and employee stock programs.  See the further discussion of our stock repurchase programs below in the section titled "Capital Structure and Financial Condition." The 2003, 2002 and 2001 stock  repurchases  were partially funded by $51.5 million, $49.6 million and $53.7 million, respectively,  received from the sale of treasury stock to employee  benefit plans and, to a lesser extent,  from stock option exercises. The balance of capital to repurchase shares was obtained from cash generated from operations. We received $32.3 million from the sale and lease-back of our corporate technology center building during the second quarter of  2002.  This  transaction  was  recorded  as a  financing  obligation  due to responsibilities which we retain during the lease period. Dividends paid, net of tax, in 2003,  2002 and 2001 amounted to $40.8 million,  $39.8 million and $43.7 million, respectively.  Our free cash  flow,  defined  as cash  flows  from  operating  activities  less dividends  paid and  additions  to  property,  plant and  equipment,  was $421.5 million in 2003,  compared to $375.0 million in 2002. This increase in free cash flow,  when  compared  to the  prior  year,  was  the  result  of  supply  chain initiatives,  including a greater focus on reducing  inventory  weeks-of-supply. The  increase  was  partially  offset by the  increase  in capital  expenditures related  to  our  new  corporate   campus.  We  expect  free  cash  flow  to  be approximately  $70.0 million in 2004. The decrease from 2003 is based  primarily on the timing of capital  expenditures for our new corporate  headquarters;  the majority of which we  originally  thought  would have been  included in our 2003 capital expenditures. The major portion of our new corporate campus expenditures will now be part of our 2004 capital  expenditures.  After 2004, we anticipate a return to a more  historical  free cash flow  level of $200.0  million to $250.0 million, annually.  We believe free cash flow is an  appropriate  indication  of our ability to fund share  repurchases,  repay maturing debt, change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that management  believes will enhance  shareholder  value.  The comparable  financial  measure  to  free  cash  flow  under  generally  accepted accounting principles is cash flows from operating activities, which were $651.9 million  in 2003,  compared  to $521.6  million  in 2002.  We do not  intend the presentation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial  measure,  to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The following table is a reconciliation of cash flows from operating  activities to free cash flow.                                                  Year Ended December 31,                                               --------------------------- (In millions)                                   2003      2002      2001 - -------------                                 --------  --------  -------- Net cash provided by operating activities      $651.9    $521.6    $775.8 Less:   Additions to property, plant and equipment    189.6     106.8     139.2   Dividends paid                                 40.8      39.8      43.7                                               --------  --------  -------- Free cash flow                                 $421.5    $375.0    $592.9                                               ========  ========  ========   CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Management  considers our financial  structure and condition  solid. At December 31, 2003,  total  capitalization  was  $1,388.0  million,  consisting  of $618.7 million of debt and $769.3 million of equity,  which resulted in a debt-to-total capitalization  ratio of 44.6%,  compared to 46.3% for the  corresponding  prior year period.  The ratio decreased from the prior year due to a smaller  increase in debt of $8.6  million,  compared  to a larger  increase  in  equity  of $41.2 million from 2002.  Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 39.0% at December 31, 2003,  compared to 43.6% at December 31,  2002,  and 39.0% at December 31, 2001. The decrease in 2003 was due to the decrease in long-term  debt,  as some of the notes moved to the short-term debt classification as current maturities.  Our debt is considered investment grade by the rating agencies. On May 20, 2003, Fitch  changed  our senior  unsecured  debt from "A-" to  "BBB+."  Below are the agencies' latest ratings by category.                                                        Standard                 Category                Moody's      and Poor's      Fitch                 --------                -------      ----------      -----                 Senior unsecured debt    Baa1            A-           BBB+                 Commercial paper         P-2             A-2          F2  Our  senior  unsecured  debt  primarily  consists  of two  issuances  of 10-year long-term notes and an issuance of medium-term notes.  We  have a  $300.0  million  debt  shelf  registration  statement  which  became effective in August 1997. As of December 31, 2003, there was no availability for further debt issuances under this shelf registration.  In August 1997, we issued $150.0  million  of  10-year   unsecured   long-term   notes  under  this  shelf registration.  The interest  rate on the notes is 6.95% per annum with  interest payable on September 1 and March 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 1998. These notes are due September 1, 2007.  We also  issued,  in various  amounts and on various  dates from  December  1997 through  September  1999,  medium-term  notes totaling  $150.0 million under the shelf registration.  At December 31, 2003, $44.5 million of these notes remained outstanding.  The interest rates at December 31, 2003, for the outstanding $44.5 million  medium-term notes ranged from 6.42% to 7.35% and had a weighted average coupon rate of 7.19%. These notes have maturities ranging from 2004 to 2008.  On May 11, 2001, we issued  $350.0  million of 10-year 7 3/8% notes in a private offering to initial purchasers who offered the notes to qualified  institutional buyers under SEC Rule 144A. The annual  interest rate on the notes is 7.375% per annum with interest  payable on November 15 and May 15 of each year.  Payment of interest on the notes  commenced on November  15, 2001,  and the notes mature on May 15, 2011. In August 2001, under the terms of an exchange offering filed with the SEC, we exchanged  substantially  all of these notes for a similar amount of publicly registered notes. Because no additional debt was issued in the exchange offering, the net effect of this exchange was that no additional debt was issued on August 3, 2001, and  substantially  all of the notes are now registered  with the SEC.  During the third  quarter of 2001,  we entered into several  interest  rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million and maturities  ranging from 2004 to 2007. In June and August 2003, we entered into additional  interest rate swap agreements with underlying  notional amounts of debt of $100.0 million and $50.0 million,  respectively,  with  maturities in May 2011. We entered into these  agreements to effectively  convert a portion of our long-term  fixed rate debt to a variable rate.  Under these  agreements,  we have  contracted to pay a variable  rate of LIBOR plus a markup and to receive  fixed rates  ranging  from 6.950% to 7.375%.  We have  designated  these  agreements  as fair value hedging instruments.  At December 31, 2003, we recorded an amount in other assets,  net, of $4.5 million (its fair value) for the swap  agreements  and adjusted the fair value of the related debt by the same amount. The effect of these agreements was a reduction in our interest  expense of $7.8 million during 2003,  when compared to the  fixed  rates.  At  current  interest  rates,  we expect  this  favorable condition to reoccur in 2004.  We have short-term debt such as commercial  paper issuances and uncommitted bank loans  available to supplement our short-term  financing  needs.  The commercial paper and  short-term  seasonal bank debt have a typical  maturity of 90 days or less.  The amount of commercial  paper that can be  outstanding  is limited to a maximum of the unused  portion of our $600  million  bank  syndicated  revolving credit facility described in more detail below.   In the second quarter of 2003, we replaced our existing  $300.0 million  364-day revolving  credit  facility  and amended  our $300.0  million  five-year  credit facility.  These facilities' maturity dates are June 2004 for the $300.0 million 364-day revolving credit facility and June 2007 for the $300.0 million five-year revolving  credit facility.  The terms of these revolving credit  facilities are substantially  similar  to  the  previous  facilities.  These  revolving  credit facilities will support any future commercial paper borrowings and are otherwise available  for our general  corporate  purposes.  We  anticipate  replacing  our 364-day  revolving  credit  facility  in June  2004  with a new  364-day  credit facility with similar terms. As of December 31, 2003,  there were no outstanding borrowings  under  these  credit  facilities.  Our  outstanding  debt  and  bank syndicated credit facilities have customary financial covenants.  We use  operating  leases,  primarily  for our  retail  locations,  distribution centers and corporate headquarters, to lower our capital requirements.  Management  believes  that our  present  ability to borrow is  greater  than our established  credit  lines  and  long-term  debt in  place.  However,  if market conditions change and sales were to dramatically decline or we could not control operating costs, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Additionally, if a scenario as described  above  occurred,  it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit  ratings,  thereby  increasing  our  borrowing  costs,  or even causing a  reduction  in or  elimination  of our  access to debt  and/or  equity markets.  We repurchased  9.9 million shares of our common stock for $251.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, under our combined share repurchase programs.  We  intend  to  execute  share  repurchases  from  time to time in order to take advantage of attractive  share price levels,  as determined by  management.  The timing and terms of the transactions depend on market conditions,  our liquidity and  other  considerations.  On  February  20,  2003,  our  Board  of  Directors authorized  a new  repurchase  program  for 15.0  million  shares,  which was in addition to our 25.0 million share repurchase  program that was completed during the second quarter of 2003. At February 18, 2004,  there were 8.9 million shares available to be repurchased under the 15.0 million share repurchase  program. We anticipate that we will repurchase,  under our authorized  repurchase  programs, between  $200.0  million and $250.0 million of our common stock during 2004. The 15.0 million share  repurchase  program has no expiration date and allows shares to be  repurchased  in the open  market.  The funding  required  for these share repurchase  programs will come from cash  generated from net sales and operating revenues and cash and cash equivalents.  Under the programs  described above, we will also repurchase  shares in the open market to offset the sales of shares to our employee benefit plans.  On December 11, 2003,  our Board of Directors  approved the  retirement  of 45.0 million shares of our common stock held as treasury stock. These shares returned to the status of authorized and unissued. See our 2003 Consolidated Statement of Stockholders' Equity for additional details of this transaction.  On October 10, 2002,  our Board of  Directors  approved  the  conversion  of our RadioShack  Series B convertible  preferred stock, held by the RadioShack 401(k) Plan, to RadioShack  common stock  effective  December 31, 2002. On December 31, 2002,  0.1  million  shares  of  this  preferred  stock,  representing  all  the outstanding Series B convertible  preferred stock, were converted to 5.1 million shares of our common stock in accordance  with their terms.  The preferred stock was held by the RadioShack 401(k) Plan to fund RadioShack  contributions to plan participants.  In the  fourth  quarter  of 2001 and the  second  quarter  of 2002,  we sold our corporate headquarters  buildings. We are now constructing a new headquarters in Fort  Worth,  Texas.  We entered  into  sale-leaseback  agreements  in which our existing corporate headquarters' land and buildings were sold and leased back to us. These  arrangements  should  provide us with the necessary time to construct our new  headquarters,  which we  expect to be  completed  by the end of 2004 or early 2005. Currently, we plan to finance our new corporate  headquarters,  with total  construction  costs  estimated to be $200.0 million during 2003 and 2004, with  cash  flows  from  operations  and,  if  needed,  existing  cash  and cash equivalents.  The  following  tables,  as  well  as  the  information  contained  in  Note 7 - "Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities" to our "Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements," provide a summary of our various contractual commitments,  debt and interest repayment requirements, and available credit lines.

The  majority of these  contingent  liabilities relate to various  lease  obligations  arising from leases that were assigned to CompUSA,  Inc. as part of the sale of our  Computer  City,  Inc.  subsidiary  to CompUSA,  Inc. in August 1998. In the event CompUSA or the other  assignees,  as applicable, are unable to fulfill their obligations, we would be responsible for rent due under the leases.  Our rent exposure  from the  remaining  undiscounted lease  commitments  with no  projected  sublease  income is  approximately  $183 million.  However,  we have no  reason  to  believe  that  CompUSA  or the other assignees will not fulfill their obligations  under these leases;  consequently, we do not believe there will be a material  impact on our  financial  statements from any fulfillment of these commitments.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Other than the operating  leases described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, transactions, or special purpose entities.  INFLATION Inflation has not significantly impacted us over the past three years. We do not expect  inflation  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  our  operations  in the foreseeable future,  unless international events substantially affect the global economy.  ITEM 7A.   QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  At December 31, 2003, we did not have any derivative instruments that materially increase  our  exposure to market risks for  interest  rates,  foreign  currency rates,  commodity  prices or other market  price risks,  other than the interest rate swaps noted in MD&A. We do not use derivatives for speculative purposes.  Our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in  short-term  interest rates.  Interest  rate risk exists with respect to our net  investment of $266.4 million,  comprised of fluctuating  short-term investments of $566.4 million and offset by $300.0  million of  indebtedness  which,  because of the interest rate swaps  discussed in MD&A,  effectively  bears  interest at  short-term  floating rates.  A  hypothetical  increase  of 100  basis  points  in the  interest  rate applicable  to this  floating-rate  net  exposure  would result in a decrease in annual net interest expense of $2.7 million.  This assumption  assumes no change in the net principal balance.   We also  manage  our  portfolio  of fixed rate debt to reduce  our  exposure  to interest  rate  changes.  The fair  value of our fixed  rate  long-term  debt is sensitive  to interest  rate  changes.  Interest  rate  changes  would result in increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt due to differences  between market interest rates and rates at the inception of the debt  obligation.  Based on a  hypothetical  immediate  100 basis point  increase  in  interest  rates at December  31,  2003 and 2002,  the fair value of our fixed rate  long-term  debt would  decrease  $28.7  million  and  $32.9  million,  respectively.  Based on a hypothetical  immediate 100 basis point  decrease in interest  rates at December 31,  2003 and  2002,  the fair  value of our fixed  rate  long-term  debt  would increase by $30.6 million and $35.4  million,  respectively.  Regarding the fair value of our fixed rate debt,  changes in  interest  rates have no impact on our consolidated financial statements.  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
