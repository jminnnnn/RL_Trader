ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ("MD&A").  FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS Matters  discussed  in  MD&A  and  in  other  parts  of  this  document  include forward-looking  statements  within the meaning of the federal  securities laws. This includes statements  concerning  management's plans and objectives relating to  our   operations   or  economic   performance   and   related   assumptions. Forward-looking  statements are made based on management's  current expectations and beliefs concerning future events and,  therefore,  involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  Management cautions that forward-looking  statements are not guarantees and actual results could differ  materially  from those  expressed or implied in the  forward-looking  statements.  Important factors that could cause our actual results of operations or financial  condition to differ include,  but are not necessarily limited, to the following factors.  General Business Factors o    Changes in the national or regional U.S. economic conditions, including,      but not limited to, recessionary trends, level of the equity markets,      consumer credit availability, interest rates, inflation, consumers'      disposable income and spending levels, job security and unemployment, and      overall consumer confidence; o    continuing terrorist activities in the U.S., as well as the international      war on terrorism; o    the disruption of international, national or regional transportation      systems; o    changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity exerted by      current competitors and potential new competition from both retail stores      and alternative methods or channels of distribution, such as e-commerce,      telephone shopping services and mail order; o    the lack of availability or access to sources of inventory; o    changes in the financial markets that would reduce or eliminate access to      longer term capital or short-term credit availability; o    the inability to attract, retain and grow an effective management team in a      dynamic environment or changes in the cost or availability of a suitable      work force to manage and support our service-driven operating strategies; o    the imposition of new restrictions or regulations regarding the sale of      products and/or services we sell or changes in tax rules and regulations      applicable to us; o    the occurrence of severe weather events or natural disasters, which could      destroy outlets or prohibit consumers from traveling to our retail      locations, especially during the peak winter holiday season;  RadioShack Specific Factors o    the failure to differentiate ourselves as an electronics specialty retailer      in the U.S. marketplace; o    the inability to successfully execute our solutions strategy to dominate      cost-effective solutions to meet everyone's routine electronics needs and      families' distinct electronics wants; o    the inability to successfully execute our strategic initiatives, including      our Anchor, Participatory and Opportunistic ("APOS") business model and      emerging sales channels strategies, as well as new business arrangements      which may be formed with other retailers, distributors and third-party      service providers; o    the inability to maintain profitable contracts or execute business plans      with providers of third-party branded products and with service providers      relating to cellular and PCS telephones and direct-to-home ("DTH")      satellite programming; o    the presence or absence of new services or products and product features in      the merchandise categories we sell and unexpected changes in our actual      merchandise sales mix; o    the inability to collect the level of anticipated residual income,      subscriber acquisition fees and rebates for products and third-party      services offered by us; o    the inability to successfully maintain our business arrangements, including      those with Compaq, DIRECTV, DISH Network, Thomson/RCA, Sprint, and Verizon      Wireless; o    contingent lease obligations relating to our discontinued retail operations      arising from a sub-lessee's failure to fulfill its lease commitments; or o    the inability to establish and implement our internal and external supply      chain initiatives.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of our  consolidated  financial  statements  requires us to make estimates that affect the reported values of assets,  liabilities,  revenues and expenses.  Our estimates are based on  historical  experience  and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which  form  the  basis  for  our  conclusions.   We  continually  evaluate  the information  used to make  these  estimates  as our  business  and the  economic environment  changes. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements,  but the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are as follows:  Revenue Recognition: Our revenue is derived principally from the sale of private label and  third-party  branded  products and services to consumers.  Revenue is recognized,  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product  returns,  when delivery has occurred or services have been  rendered,  the sales price is fixed or determinable,  and  collectibility is reasonably  assured.  Certain products, such as wireless phones and satellite  systems,  require the customer to use the services of a  third-party  service  provider.  In most cases,  the  third-party service  provider will pay us a fee or commission  for obtaining a new customer, as  well  as  a  monthly  recurring  residual  amount  based  upon  the  ongoing arrangement  between the service  provider and the  customer.  Fee or commission revenue,  net of estimated service  disconnects,  is generally recognized at the time the customer is accepted as a subscriber of a third-party service provider. Residual  income is  recognized  as earned under the terms of each contract with the service  provider,  which is  typically  as the service  provider  bills its customer.  Different  revenues would have been recorded if we had made different assumptions or evaluations.  Material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if actual returns, sales, fee or commission revenue adjustments exceed our estimates.  Additionally,  our retail  operations offer repair service (i.e.,  non-warranty) contracts on products sold. These contracts  generally  provide extended service coverage for periods  ranging from 12 to 60 months.  We offer these contracts in all but three states on behalf of an unrelated  third-party  obligor. We are not considered the primary obligor on these contracts.  In these circumstances,  our share of commission  revenue is recognized as income at the time the contract is sold.  For the  contracts  offered in the three  states where we are the primary obligor,  revenues from the sale of these contracts are recognized  ratably over the term of the contracts.  Costs directly related to the sale of such contracts are  deferred  and  charged  to cost of  products  sold  proportionately  as the revenues are recognized.  A loss is recognized on extended service  contracts if the sum of the expected  costs of providing  services  pursuant to the contracts exceeds the related unearned revenue.  Receivables:  We record receivables based on the amount of revenue recognized as described  above.  Our receivables  are primarily  comprised of amounts due from certain  vendors,   third-party   service  providers,   dealer/franchisees   and commercial  customers.  The carrying  amount of the  receivables  is continually evaluated  based on the  likelihood  of  collection.  An allowance  for doubtful accounts is established for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our vendors,  third-party  service  providers and  customers to make their  required payments.  Factors  such as  these  parties'  creditworthiness,  payment  terms, historical  results and economic  conditions  are  considered  when making these decisions.  The actual  collection of  receivables  could be different  from our recorded value. If any of these parties'  creditworthiness  deteriorates  beyond our  expectations,  or if any of their  actual  defaults  exceed our  historical experience,  material  charges  could be  required to our  selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Inventory:  Inventory  is our largest  asset class.  Our  inventory is primarily comprised of finished goods and is recorded at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method.  We make estimates  regarding the carrying value of our inventory on an item-by-item  basis. If the amount we expect to receive from the sale of the  inventory  is less  than its  cost,  we write  down the cost of the inventory to its estimated  realizable  value based on assumptions  about future demand and market  conditions.  If actual market  conditions  are less favorable than those  projected by  management,  or if  unexpected  changes in  technology affect demand for certain  products,  we could be exposed to losses in excess of our established reserves.  Accrued  Expenses:  The amount of liability we record for claims related to self insurance,  warranty and pending litigation  requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We use our past history and  experience,  as well as  other  specific  circumstances  surrounding  these claims,  in evaluating  the amount of liability  that we should  record.  Actual results  may  be  materially  different  from  these  estimates.  As  additional information becomes available,  we assess the potential liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates as  appropriate.  Such  revisions  could materially impact our results of operations and financial position.  Income Taxes:  We are subject to income taxes in many  jurisdictions,  including the U.S.,  states and  localities,  and abroad.  We must first  determine  which revenues  and  expenses  should be included in each  taxing  jurisdiction.  This process  involves the  estimation of our actual  current tax exposure,  together with the assessment of temporary  differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and  accounting  purposes.  These  differences in the timing of deductions  result in deferred tax assets and  liabilities  that are recorded on our balance sheet. If different judgments had been used, our tax liability could have been materially different. If we prevail in matters for which accruals have been  established  or are  required to settle  matters in excess of  established accruals,  our  effective  tax rate for a particular  period could be materially affected. Furthermore, if our actual results differ from estimated results or if we adjust our  estimates  in the future such that we would not expect to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, we may need to establish a valuation allowance  against our  deferred  tax assets,  also  potentially  impacting  our effective tax rate.  RETAIL OUTLETS The table  below shows our retail  locations  broken  down  between  company and dealer/franchise  outlets. While the dealer outlets represent  approximately 28% of the RadioShack locations,  sales to  dealer/franchisees  are less than 10% of our total net sales and operating revenues (see "Results of Operations" below).

This  decrease was  primarily the result of a 35.3% decline in sales to our dealer/franchise  outlets in 2002, mainly due to the decline in DTH unit sales. In addition,  we also had a 1% decrease in comparable  company store sales due primarily to the decline of DTH unit sales and desktop computers,  but offset  by  sales  increases  in  wireless  handsets  and  related  accessories. Additionally, the number of company stores decreased slightly due to the closure of 127 Cool Things @ Blockbuster test stores in early 2002,  despite the opening of 34 company stores, net of store closures.  We expect a sales gain for 2003 as discussed in further detail below.  Retail  support  operations  sales are  generated  from the outside sales of our retail  support  operations,  consisting  primarily of  RadioShack  Installation Services ("RSIS"), repair centers, and domestic and overseas manufacturing.  The 34.7%  decrease in retail support  operations  sales from 2001 to 2002 primarily resulted from a $19.1 million decrease in 2002 domestic manufacturing sales, due to large  Verizon  fixture sales in 2001,  and a $15.2 million  decrease in RSIS sales as a result of our exit from the national commercial installation business at the end of 2001.  Sales in the  wireless  communication  department,  which is made up of wireless handsets (including related services),  accessories,  and wireless services such as prepaid airtime and bill payments, increased 9.4% in dollars and increased to 31.3% of our total retail sales in 2002 from 27.7% in 2001.  This sales increase was due to an increase  in sales of  wireless  handsets  and  accessories  which resulted from our emphasis on national carrier  offerings with desirable product features and  content,  such as color  screens,  photo  capability  and Internet access.  Although we have previously experienced sales gains in this department, we realize that the overall wireless industry is experiencing a slow-down in net new customer activations. While there is no assurance that we can maintain these sales gain levels, we believe our plans, if executed  successfully,  will result in wireless sales increases.  Sales  in  the  wired  communication  department,   which  includes  residential telephones,  answering machines and other related telephony products,  decreased 1.1% in dollars and increased slightly as a percentage of our total retail sales to 8.5% in 2002 from 8.3% in 2001.  Increased sales of cordless  telephones were more than offset by decreased sales of corded telephones. We anticipate sales in this department will be relatively stable in 2003.  Sales in the  radio  communication  department  decreased  8.6% in  dollars  and decreased  slightly as a  percentage  of our total  retail sales to 2.7% in 2002 from 2.8% in 2001. The decrease in this department was primarily the result of a decrease in Family Radio Service  ("FRS") and CB radio sales,  scanner sales and communication accessories,  partially offset by a sales increase in GPS devices. We believe that this  department will experience a small sales gain in 2003 over the prior year due to the  anticipated  introduction of new models in the second half of the year.  Sales in the home entertainment department, which consists of all home audio and video  end-products  and accessories,  including DTH hardware and  installation, decreased  23.9% in dollars and  decreased as a  percentage  of our total retail sales to 19.0% in 2002  from  24.2%  in 2001.  Substantially  all of the  dollar decrease was attributable to a decrease in sales of satellite dishes and related installations.  This  decrease was  partially  offset by increased  sales of DVD players.  We expect that  satellite dish sales will continue to decline in 2003, but at a reduced rate,  as compared to the prior year.  We  anticipate  that the other  categories  within the home  entertainment  department will have gains to offset this  decline,  resulting  in overall flat sales in this  department  for 2003.  Sales in the computer  department,  which  includes  desktop,  laptop,  handheld computers  and related  accessories,  in  addition  to digital  cameras and home networking products, decreased slightly in dollars and increased as a percentage of our  total  retail  sales to 10.2% in 2002  from  9.9% in 2001.  These  sales dollars  were  maintained  primarily  due to an  increase  in laptop  computers, computer accessories and digital camera sales, offset by a decline in unit sales of desktop CPUs and  monitors.  We expect that sales in the computer  department will  increase  in  2003,  driven  by  sales of the  products  discussed  above, particularly  digital  cameras  and  related  accessories,  with  this  increase partially offset by a planned decrease in sales of desktop computers.  Sales in the power and technical  department increased 0.8% in dollars and also as a  percentage  of our total retail sales to 13.9% in 2002 from 13.3% in 2001. These  increases  were  primarily due to increased  sales of general and special purpose batteries, partially offset by decreased sales of bulk and packaged wire and technical parts. We anticipate a slight sales increase in this department in 2003.  Sales in the personal electronics,  toys and personal audio department increased 2.5% in dollars, as well as increasing as a percentage of our total retail sales to 12.8% in 2002 from 12.1% in 2001,  due primarily to increased  sales of micro radio controlled cars and related accessories,  in addition to unique giftables. We expect  that  sales in this  department  will  continue  to grow in 2003 as a result of our  additional  name brand  product  offerings  and our product line increases in these areas.  GROSS PROFIT  Gross profit for 2002 was $2,238.3  million or 48.9% of net sales and  operating revenues,  compared  with  $2,296.8  million or 48.1% of net sales and operating revenues  in  2001.  Gross  profit  decreased  $58.5  million  or 2.5% in  2002, primarily as a result of a 4.2%  decrease in net sales and  operating  revenues. Despite this  decrease in gross  profit  dollars,  the gross  profit  percentage increased from 48.1% to 48.9% in 2002, due primarily to an increase in the gross profit percentage in the home entertainment  department and, to a lesser extent, increases in both the power and technical and computer departments' gross profit percentages.Our  gross  profit  percentage  increase  was  partially  offset  by reductions in both the wireless and wired departments' gross profit percentages, compounded by the increase in the wireless communication department's percent of total retail sales.  The reduction in gross profit dollars was partially  offset by a  decrease  in the  total  retail  sales  mix  for  the  home  entertainment department,  which has a lower gross profit  percentage than our overall average gross profit percentage,  as well as an increase in gross profit dollars for the power  and  technical  department.  Additionally,  the gross  profit  percentage improved for our retail  support  operations in 2002.  We anticipate  that gross profit as a percentage of net sales and  operating  revenues will improve by the end of 2003, when compared to 2002, enhanced by sales mix changes towards higher margin products,  such as computer  accessories,  batteries,  toys, and personal audio and electronics,  and also enhanced by improved efficiencies realized from supply  chain  management  initiatives,  particularly  in vendor  relations  and end-of-life inventory management.

The dollar  increase for 2002 was primarily due to a $29.0 million  litigation charge related to the settlement of a class  action  lawsuit in  California  and a $6.0  million  charge to our 1996 restructuring  reserve as a result of the bankruptcy of a sub-lessee in a former Incredible Universe store site. A $14.6 million increase in our rent expense and lower overall  sales in 2002 also  contributed  to a higher SG&A expense  ratio. This was partially  offset by a $7.6 million charge for store closing costs from 2001, which did not reoccur in 2002.  Payroll  expense  decreased  by $12.3  million to $728.0  million  in 2002,  but increased  slightly as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to 15.9% in 2002,  compared to 15.5% in 2001.  The decrease in dollars was due  primarily to our reduction in headcount during the third quarter of 2001.  Rent expense  increased by $14.6 million to $244.9 million in 2002 and increased as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues  to 5.4% in 2002 from 4.8% in 2001.  These  increases were due primarily to lease renewals and  relocations at higher rates,  as well as a slight increase in the average store size. We expect a similar increase in 2003 rent for the same reasons described for the 2002 rent increase.  Advertising  expense  decreased  $12.9  million in 2002 to $241.0  million  from $253.9  million in 2001,  while  remaining at 5.3%  percentage of net sales and operating  revenues  during  both 2002 and 2001.  The  dollar  decrease  was due primarily to an increase in advertising  contributions  from our various vendors and third-party service providers.  Insurance  expense  increased  $10.4 million to $71.0 million in 2002 from $60.6 million in 2001 and increased as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues to 1.6% in 2002,  compared to 1.3% in 2001.  Substantially  all of our insurance expense  relates  to our  self-insurance  programs.  We  maintain  reserves  for self-insurance  liabilities  related to our group  medical and casualty  losses, which include general and product liability and workers'  compensation.  In some cases,  risks are  insured  through  outside  carriers  for  losses in excess of self-insured amounts.  These reserves are adjusted to reflect estimates based on historical experience, estimated claims incurred but not reported, the impact of risk management  programs and the estimated  effect of external  factors.  As of December 31, 2002,  actual losses had not exceeded our  expectations.  We expect insurance expense to continue to increase in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and  operating  revenues  due to the rising  health  care costs in the U.S., in addition to increases in premiums  resulting from the recent  terrorist activities.  In 2003,  we expect SG&A expense to increase  slightly in dollars,  but decrease slightly as a percentage  of net sales and  operating  revenues due to increased sales volume.   DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  Depreciation and amortization  expense  decreased $13.6 million dollars to $94.7 million and decreased as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues to 2.0% in 2002 from 2.3% in 2001.  These  decreases are primarily  attributable  to the elimination   of  goodwill   amortization   related  to  AmeriLink   Corporation ("AmeriLink),  as well as the  sale of our  corporate  headquarters  during  the fourth  quarter of 2001.  We expect  depreciation  and  amortization  expense to increase slightly in 2003, due to depreciation  increases  associated with store fixtures and  capitalized  software  related to inventory  management  and other information systems projects.  GAIN ON CONTRACT TERMINATION  RadioShack  and  Microsoft  mutually  agreed  during  2002  to  terminate  their agreement  and settle the  remaining  commitments  each had to one another.  The termination  of this agreement took effect at the start of the fourth quarter of 2002, upon satisfaction of several  contractual  obligations.  The net financial result was an $18.5 million gain (principally  cash received),  driven primarily by the settlement of a multi-year obligation Microsoft had to connect our stores with broadband capabilities.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  As a result of continued  difficulties  in the DTH business and a refocus during the fourth  quarter on our  satellite  installation  strategy,  together  with a revised  cash  flow  projection  for  our  overall  installation   business,  we determined  that the  remaining  long-lived  assets  associated  with  RSIS were impaired.  We compared the carrying value of these long-lived  assets with their fair value and determined  that the remaining  goodwill  balance of $8.1 million was impaired and we, therefore,  recorded an impairment charge of this amount in the accompanying 2002 Consolidated Statement of Income. As of December 31, 2002, there was no remaining  goodwill  balance on our balance sheet relating to RSIS. See the discussion  below under the section titled "2001 Compared With 2000" for further discussion of the RSIS business.  LOSS ON SALE OF ASSETS  There  were no losses on the sale of assets in 2002.  For  information  on prior year losses,  see the  discussion  below under the section titled "2001 Compared With 2000."  EMPLOYEE SEPARATION AND OTHER COSTS  There were no employee  separation or other costs in 2002.  For  information  on prior year employee  separation and other costs,  see the discussion below under the section titled "2001 Compared With 2000."  NET INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $34.4  million for 2002 versus $37.8 million for 2001.  Interest expense  decreased to $43.4 million in 2002 from $50.8 million in 2001. This  decrease  was  primarily  the result of a reduction  in the  average  debt outstanding  throughout  2002. In addition,  our interest rate swap  instruments also lowered overall interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2002, when compared to the same prior year period.  Interest income decreased almost 31% to $9.0  million in 2002 from $13.0  million in 2001,  due  primarily  to CompUSA's early  payment  of its  note  to us on  June  22,  2001,  which  eliminated  the associated interest income.  Interest income,  including  accretion of discount as applicable,  earned on the amounts  outstanding  during the three years ended  December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000 was as follows:                                  Year Ended December 31,                              ------------------------------ (In millions)                  2002       2001       2000 - -------------                --------   --------   -------- CompUSA note receivable      $  --      $  6.1     $ 12.9 Other (includes short-term Investment interest)            9.0        6.9        4.9                              --------   --------   -------- Total interest income        $  9.0     $ 13.0     $ 17.8                              ========   ========   ========  Interest  expense,  net of interest income,  is expected to be flat during 2003, when compared to 2002.  OTHER INCOME  In the second quarter of 2002, we received payments and recorded income of $27.7 million  in  partial  settlement  of  amounts  owed to us  under  a tax  sharing agreement  that was the subject of an arbitration  which  commenced in July 1999 and was styled Tandy  Corporation  and T.E.  Electronics,  L.P.  vs.  O'Sullivan Industries  Holdings,  Inc.  ("O'Sullivan").  The  arbitration  ruling  requires O'Sullivan  to comply with the tax sharing  agreement  that was entered  into by theparties at the time of O'Sullivan's initial public offering.  During the second half of 2002,  we received two payments  totaling $6.2 million relating to quarterly  payments under the tax sharing agreement with O'Sullivan. Future payments will vary based on the level of O'Sullivan's future earnings. In the near term,  we expect that the  quarterly  payments  to us will  approximate those received to date; however,  these payments are dependent upon O'Sullivan's overall financial  condition and ability to pay.  Consequently,  there can be no assurances  that we will receive timely each payment that may be due to us under the tax sharing agreement.  PROVISION FOR LOSS ON INTERNET-RELATED INVESTMENT  There were no losses on Internet-related investments in 2002. For information on prior year losses on  Internet-related  investments,  see the  discussion  below under the section titled "2001 Compared With 2000."  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  Our  provision for income taxes  reflects an effective  income tax rate of 38.0% for 2002 and 42.8% for 2001. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2002 when compared to 2001 was the result of the 2001  impairment of RSIS goodwill,  which was not deductible for tax purposes and caused the increased  effective tax rate in 2001. For further  information,  see the  discussion  below under the section titled "2001 Compared With 2000." We anticipate  that the effective tax rate for 2003 will be approximately 38.0%.  2001 COMPARED WITH 2000  NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES  Sales decreased  slightly to $4,775.7  million in 2001 from $4,794.7  million in 2000.  This  decrease  was  primarily  the  result of a decline  in sales to our dealer/franchise  outlets  in  2001,  partially  offset  by  a  1%  increase  in comparable  company  store sales and the opening of 18 new stores,  net of store closures.  Sales in the wireless  communication  department  increased  14.5% in dollars and increased to 27.7% of total retail sales in 2001 from 24.3% in 2000. This sales  increase  was due to an  increase  in sales of  wireless  phones and accessories,  offset  somewhat by a decrease in prepaid  wireless  airtime.  The wired communication department, which includes residential telephones, answering machines and other related  telephony  products,  decreased  8.7% in dollars and decreased  as a  percentage  of total  retail sales to 8.3% in 2001 from 9.1% in 2000.  The decrease in this  department  was  primarily  the result of declining sales of residential telephones,  and was partially offset by increased sales of telephone  accessories.  The radio  communication  department  decreased 8.5% in dollars and decreased as a percentage of total retail sales to 2.8% in 2001 from 3.1% in 2000.  The decrease in this  department  was  primarily  the result of a decrease in CB radio and scanner sales. The home entertainment department, which consists of all home audio and video  products,  including  DTH  satellites  and installation  services,  decreased  slightly in dollars and as a  percentage  of total retail sales to 24.2% in 2001 from 24.4% in 2000. This dollar decrease was primarily  attributable  to a decrease in sales of satellite  dishes,  which was partially offset by increased sales of video and cable accessories. The computer department,  which  includes not only  computers  and related  accessories,  but narrow and broadband  connectivity,  as well as home  automation and networking, decreased  16.3% in dollars and  decreased as a percentage of total retail sales to 9.9% in 2001 from 11.9% in 2000. These decreases were primarily  attributable to a 26%  decline  in unit  sales of CPUs  and an 11%  decrease  in the  average selling price of CPUs from the prior year.  The power and  technical  department increased 2.0% in dollars and increased slightly as a percentage of total retail sales to 13.3% in 2001 from 13.1% in 2000. These increases were primarily due to increased sales of special purpose batteries. The personal electronics, toys and personal audio department  decreased 5.4% in dollars, as well as decreasing as a percentage  of total  retail  sales to 12.1%  in 2001  from  12.8% in 2000,  due primarily to decreased sales of toys and giftables.  GROSS PROFIT  Gross  profit in 2001 was $2,296.8  million or 48.1% of net sales and  operating revenues,  compared  with  $2,369.6  million or 49.4% of net sales and operating revenues in 2000. Gross profit for 2001 was reduced by a $26.2 million charge in the fourth  quarter for a write-down of  non-strategic  inventory  product lines which we intend to exit. In addition, the decline in the gross profit percentage from 49.4% to 48.1% was affected by a decrease in the wired  communication gross margin.  This gross profit  decrease was  partially  offset by a decrease in the total  retail  sales mix for the  computer  department,  which has a lower gross margin  than our overall  average  gross  margin,  as well as an increase in the computer  department  gross  profit  percentage.  Increases  in the gross profit percentage for the wireless  communication and power and technical  departments, coupled  with an increase in the  departments'  gross profit  percentages,  also favorably affected the overall gross profit percentage.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  Our SG&A  expense  increased  5.0% in dollars and  increased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to 35.9% for the year ended December 31, 2001, from 34.1% for the year ended December 31, 2000.  This 1.8 percentage  point increase in the SG&A  percentage  in 2001 was  primarily  attributable  to an increase in advertising expense during 2001, without  proportional sales growth. An increase in the rent expense in 2001 also contributed to the SG&A expense increase.  Payroll  expense  decreased  by $8.4  million  to  $740.3  million  in 2001  and decreased  as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues  to 15.5% in 2001, compared to 15.6% in 2000.  These decreases were due primarily to a reduction in our labor force during 2001 and reduced  incentive pay resulting from a decrease in operating  income.  Advertising  expense  increased  $26.8  million to $253.9 million  and  increased  to 5.3% as a  percentage  of net  sales  and  operating revenues in 2001, compared to $227.1 million and 4.7% of sales in 2000. Both the dollar and  percentage  point  increases  were due  primarily  to a decrease  in advertising  contributions  from our  various  vendors and  third-party  service providers and, to a lesser extent,  an increase in TV commercials.  Rent expense increased by $15.1 million to $230.3  million in 2001 and increased as a percent of net sales and operating  revenues to 4.8% in 2001 from 4.5% in 2000. The rent increase was partially due to new company store openings throughout the year, as well  as the  addition  of the  Cool  Things  @  Blockbuster  test  stores.  The relocation of existing stores to larger locations, as well as a renewal of store leases at higher rates, also contributed to the rent expense increase.  Bad debt expense  increased by $10.9  million to $14.5 million in 2001 and increased as a percentage  of net sales  and  operating  revenues  to 0.3% in 2001 from 0.1% in 2000.  The bad debt  increase was  primarily  related to both  bankruptcies  and uncollected accounts  receivable,  as well as the write-off of a note receivable from Digital:Convergence Corporation ("DC"). Store closing costs of $7.6 million in  2001  relate  to the  closure  of 35  underperforming  stores  prior  to the expiration of their leases.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  Depreciation and amortization  expense  increased $1.0 million dollars to $108.3 million and increased as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues to 2.3% in 2001  from  2.2%  in  2000.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  AmeriLink,  also  known  as  RSIS,  was  acquired  in  1999 to  provide  us with residential installation  capabilities for the technologies and services offered in our retail stores. Since its acquisition,  RSIS has incurred operating losses and negative cash flows.  In 2000 and in 2001, we attempted to  restructure  and reorganize  RSIS, but due to the overall  slowdown in the economy and the market decline for professionally  installed home Internet connectivity services,  RSIS continued to report  losses.  During the fourth  quarter of 2001,  we prepared a revised  analysis of estimated  future cash flows for RSIS, which indicated that its  long-lived  assets were impaired.  The carrying value of RSIS's  long-lived assets  (principally  goodwill and fixed assets) exceeded the discounted present value of the estimated  future cash flows by  approximately  $37.0  million.  An impairment  of  goodwill  for that  amount  was  recorded  and  included  in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income.  Our   test    concept    with    Blockbuster    to    introduce   a   RadioShack "store-within-a-store"  at Blockbuster locations did not provide sufficient cash flows to  recover  our  investment  in  fixtures  and  other  fixed  assets.  An impairment  loss of $2.8  million was  recorded  for those assets in 2001 and is included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  LOSS ON SALE OF ASSETS  In the fourth  quarter of 2001,  we sold and leased  back most of our  corporate headquarters  at a loss of $44.8 million.  On June 22, 2001, we received  $123.6 million for the  settlement of the purchase  price and  settlement of the $136.0 million note which was received in  connection  with the sale of Computer  City, Inc. in 1998.  Thus,  we incurred an  additional  loss from the sale of Computer City, Inc. of $12.4 million.  EMPLOYEE SEPARATION AND OTHER COSTS  During  the third  quarter of 2001,  as part of our effort to control  operating costs, we incurred approximately $13.5 million in charges related to a reduction of our  labor  force,  primarily  for  early  retirements  and  involuntary  and voluntary employee  severance.  In addition,  during the fourth quarter of 2001, $4.8 million in charges were incurred relating to the closure of RSIS's national commercial  installation  business.  These  costs were  primarily  comprised  of severance   costs,   write-offs   of  certain  fixed  assets  and  future  lease commitments.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $37.8  million for 2001 versus $36.1 million for 2000.  Interest expense decreased to $50.8 million in 2001, from $53.9 million in 2000. This  decrease  was  primarily  the result of a  decrease  in the  average  debt outstanding  throughout  2001.  Interest  income  decreased  almost 27% to $13.0 million in 2001 from $17.8  million  in 2000,  due  primarily  to  repayment  of various notes  receivable  associated  with our exit of other retail  formats in previous years.  PROVISION FOR LOSS ON INTERNET-RELATED INVESTMENT  During the second  quarter of 2000, we made a $30.0 million  investment in DC, a privately-held  Internet  technology  company.  In the first quarter of 2001, we concluded that our  investment  had  experienced a decline in value that, in our opinion,  was other than temporary.  This conclusion was based on DC's inability to secure  sufficient  additional  funding  or to  complete  an  initial  public offering. As such, we recorded a loss provision equal to our initial investment. DC subsequently filed for bankruptcy on March 22, 2002.       PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  The provision for income taxes  reflects an effective tax rate of 42.8% for 2001 and 38.0% for  2000.  The  increase  in the  effective  tax rate in 2001 was the result  of the  impairment  of RSIS  goodwill  discussed  above,  which  was not deductible for tax purposes.  IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In August  2001,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards ("SFAS") No. 143,  "Accounting for Asset  Retirement  Obligations,"  which is effective for fiscal years  beginning after June 15, 2002. SFAS No. 143 establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for obligations  associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the  associated  asset  retirement  costs.  We  adopted  SFAS No. 143 effective  January 1, 2003.  We do not believe the standard will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.  On June 28, 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal  Activities."  SFAS No. 146 addresses  significant  issues relating to the recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities,  including restructuring activities, and nullifies the guidance in Emerging  Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 94-3,  "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)."  The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal  activities  initiated  after December 31, 2002.  Retroactive  application of SFAS No. 146 is prohibited  and, accordingly, liabilities recognized prior to the initial application of SFAS No. 146 should  continue to be accounted for in  accordance  with EITF 94-3 or other applicable  preexisting  guidance.  We adopted SFAS No. 146 effective January 1, 2003. We do not believe the standard will have a material  adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.  In December  2002,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and  Disclosure."  This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation,"  to provide  alternative  methods of transition  for a voluntary  change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee  compensation.  In addition,  this Statement amends the disclosure  requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent  disclosures about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results.  We adopted the disclosure  requirements of SFAS No. 148 effective December 31, 2002, and we made no material adjustments as a result of this adoption.  In December 2002, the FASB issued  Interpretation  No. ("FIN") 45,  "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure  Requirements for Guarantees,  Including Guarantees of Indebtedness  of Others." FIN 45 is effective for guarantees  issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements were effective for the year ended  December 31,  2002,  and expand the  disclosures  required by a guarantor about its obligations under a guarantee.  FIN 45 also requires that we recognize guarantees  entered into or modified after December 31, 2002, as a liability for the fair value of the  obligation  undertaken in the issuance of the  guarantee. FIN 45 became  effective  January 1, 2003. We do not believe the  interpretation will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.  In January 2003,  the FASB issued FIN 46,  "Consolidation  of Variable  Interest Entities - An Interpretation  of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 addresses  consolidation by business   enterprises   of  variable   interest   entities  that  have  certain characteristics.   The  consolidation   requirement  of  FIN  46  is  applicable immediately to variable  interest entities created or obtained after January 31, 2003.  For variable  interest  entities  acquired  before  February 1, 2003, the consolidation  requirement  of FIN 46 is applicable to us as of July 1, 2003. We believe  the  adoption  of  FIN  46  will  not  have a  material  impact  on our consolidated financial statements.  In November 2002,  the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 02-16,  "Accounting for Consideration  Received from a Vendor by a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor's  Products)." EITF 02-16 provides guidance on how cash consideration received by a customer  from a vendor  should be  classified  in the  customer's statement of income. EITF 02-16 is effective  prospectively for new arrangements entered into after  December 31, 2002 and income  statements  for prior  periods presented should be reclassified to comply with its consensus.  We are analyzing the  provisions  of EITF 02-16 as they relate to our  accounting  policies.  The impact,  if any, of  compliance  with the  consensus  on EITF 02-16 has not been determined at this time.  CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY                              Year Ended December 31,                         ------------------------------- (In millions)              2002       2001       2000 - -------------            --------   --------   -------- Operating activities     $ 521.6    $ 775.8    $ 116.5 Investing activities       (99.0)      (2.3)    (134.0) Financing activities      (377.5)    (502.8)     (16.4)  In 2002, cash flow provided by operating activities was $521.6 million, compared to $775.8 million and $116.5 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively.  At December 31, 2002, changes in accounts  receivable,  consisting  primarily of amounts due from our various vendors and third party service providers, provided $68.2  million in cash during  2002,  when  compared to $165.8  million from the prior year.  Cash  provided by accounts  receivable  in 2002 and 2001 was due to further   reductions   of  vendor   and   service   provider   receivables   and dealer/franchise  receivables  as a result of an increase in  collections  after increases in such balances in 2000.  At December 31, 2002,  changes in  inventory  used $21.4  million in cash during 2002,  compared to $213.9 million of cash provided  during 2001. The increase in inventory  since  December 31, 2001,  was  primarily  the result of increases in laptop computers,  home theater-in-a-box  systems, and televisions,  as sales of these  products were less than  anticipated.  These  increases in inventory were partially offset by a reduction in wireless handsets.  Typically,  our annual cash  requirements  for pre-seasonal  inventory  build-up range between $200.0 million and $400.0  million.  The funding  required by this build-up comes primarily from cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and operating  revenues.  We had $446.5  million in cash and cash  equivalents as of December 31, 2002, as a resource for our funding  needs.  Additional  capital is available  under our $600.0 million dollar  commercial  paper program,  which is supported  by a bank  credit  facility  which could be utilized in the event the commercial  paper  market is  unavailable  to us. We  currently  do not  expect, however, that the commercial paper market would be unavailable to us and that we would have to utilize the credit  facility.  As of December 31, 2002,  we had no commercial paper outstanding or utilization of our credit facility.  Additionally,  during the year ended  December 31, 2002,  $118.8 million more in cash was  provided by changes in accounts  payable,  when  compared to the prior year period, due primarily to more favorable vendor terms.  Cash used in investing  activities in 2002 was $99.0  million,  compared to $2.3 million and $134.0 million used in 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Our cash usage in investing  activities was higher in 2002 than 2001,  primarily because of the $123.6 million we received  during the second quarter of 2001 for the settlement of the  purchase  price of Computer  City and  settlement  of the CompUSA  note. Capital  expenditures were $106.8 million in 2002, compared to $139.2 million in 2001 and  $119.6  million in 2000.  Capital  expenditures  for these  years were primarily  for  our  retail  store  expansions  and  remodels  and  upgrades  of information  systems.  In  addition,  we  purchased  land  in  2001  for our new corporate headquarters building, which totaled $18.3 million. We anticipate that our  capital  expenditure  requirements  for 2003 will be  approximately  $210.0 million to $230.0  million.  The $100.0  million  increase  over 2002  primarily relates to our new  corporate  headquarters.  See further  discussion of the new facilities,  below  in the  section  titled  "Capital  Structure  and  Financial Condition."  Store  remodels and  relocations  and updated  information  systems account for the balance of our  anticipated  2003  capital  expenditures.  As of December 31, 2002,  we had $446.5  million in cash and cash  equivalents.  These cash and cash  equivalents,  along  with cash  generated  from our net sales and operating  revenues  and,  if  necessary,  both  our  short-term  and  long-term financing facilities, are available to fund future capital expenditure needs.  Cash used in financing activities was $377.5 million in 2002, compared to $502.8 million  and  $16.4  million  in 2001 and  2000,  respectively.  We used  $329.9 million,  $308.3 million and $400.6 million for the repurchase of our common and preferred  stock in 2002,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Repurchases  of common stock were made under our share repurchase and employee stock plans. See further discussion of our stock repurchase programs below in the section titled "Capital Structure and Financial  Condition." The 2002,  2001 and 2000 stock  repurchases were  partially  funded by $49.6  million,  $53.7  million  and  $66.3  million, respectively,  received from the sale of treasury  stock to employee stock plans and to a lesser  extent from stock option  exercises.  The balance of capital to repurchase shares was obtained from cash generated from operations. We purchased all of  Microsoft's  preferred  units in  RadioShack.com  LLC for $88.0  million during the third quarter of 2001.  We also received  $32.3 million from the sale and lease-back of our corporate technology  center  building  during the second quarter of 2002. This transaction was recorded as a financing  obligation due to responsibilities which we retain during the lease period. Dividends paid, net of tax, in 2002,  2001 and 2000 amounted to $39.8 million,  $43.7 million and $44.7 million,   respectively.   The  long-term  notes  we  issued  in  2001  provided approximately  $346.1  million in cash,  the majority of which was used to repay short-term  debt. In 2000, the increase in short-term debt was used primarily to fund  increases  in  accounts  receivable,   stock  repurchases  and  additional inventory.  Our free  cash  flow,  defined  as cash  flow  from  operating  activities  less dividends  paid and  additions  to  property,  plant and  equipment,  was $375.0 million in 2002,  compared to $592.9  million in 2001. We believe free cash flow is an  appropriate  indication  of  the  corporation's  ability  to  fund  share repurchases, repay maturing debt, change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that  management  believes  will  enhance  shareholder  value.  The 2002 decrease in free cash flow,  compared to 2001,  was due primarily to an increase in the 2002 working  capital  components,  principally  inventory,  as described above. We expect free cash flow to be approximately  $200.0 to $250.0 million in 2003. The anticipated  decrease in free cash flow from 2002 to 2003 is primarily related to the increase in 2003 capital expenditures noted above. The comparable financial  measure  to free cash  flow  under  GAAP is cash flow from  operating activities,  which was $521.6  million  and $775.8  million  for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.   The  following  table  is a  reconciliation  of  cash  provided  from  operating activities to free cash flow.                                                    Year Ended December 31,                                              ------------------------------ (In millions)                                  2002       2001       2000 - -------------                                --------   --------   -------- Net cash provided by operating activities    $ 521.6    $ 775.8    $ 116.5 Less:   Additions to property, plant and equipment   106.8      139.2      119.6   Dividends paid                                39.8       43.7       44.7                                              --------   --------   -------- Free (negative free) cash flow               $ 375.0    $ 592.9    $ (47.8)                                              ========   ========   ========  CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Management  considers our financial  structure and condition  solid. At December 31, 2002,  total  capitalization  was  $1,355.4  million,  consisting  of $627.3 million of debt and $728.1  million of equity and  resulting in a  debt-to-total capitalization  ratio of 46.3%,  which was equal to the prior year debt-to-total capitalization  ratio.  The ratio  remained  the same as the  prior  year due to proportional decreases in debt of $43.6 million and equity of $50.0 million from 2001.  Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 43.6% at December 31, 2002,  compared to 39.0% at December 31,  2001,  and 18.2% at December 31, 2000. This increase in 2002 was due to the  financing  obligation  resulting  from the sale  and  lease-back  of our  corporate  technology  center  building  and  the reduction of equity.  Our debt is considered  investment grade by the rating  agencies.  There were no changes to our debt ratings  during the year.  Below are their latest ratings by category.                                                Standard            Category              Moody's     and Poor's     Fitch            --------              -------     ----------     -----            Medium-term notes      Baa1           A-           A-            ESOP senior notes      Baa1           A-           A-            Commercial paper       P-2            A-2          F2  Our debt primarily  consists of  medium-term  notes and two issuances of 10-year long-term notes.  We  have a  $300.0  million  Debt  Shelf  Registration  Statement  ("1997  Shelf Registration")  which became effective in August 1997. In August 1997, we issued $150.0  million  of  10-year  unsecured  long-term  notes  under the 1997  Shelf Registration.  The interest  rate on the notes is 6.95% per annum with  interest payable on September 1 and March 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 1998. These notes are due September 1, 2007.  We also  issued,  in various  amounts and on various  dates from  December  1997 through September 1999, medium-term notes totaling $150.0 million under the 1997 Shelf Registration.  At December 31, 2002, $64.5 million of these notes remained outstanding.  The interest rates at December 31, 2002, for the outstanding $64.5 million  medium-term notes ranged from 6.13% to 7.35% and had a weighted average coupon rate of 6.86%.  These notes have maturities ranging from 2003 to 2008. As of  December  31,  2002,  there  was  no  availability  under  this  1997  Shelf Registration.  On May 11, 2001, we issued  $350.0  million of 10-year 7 3/8% notes in a private offering to initial purchasers who offered the notes to qualified  institutional buyers under SEC Rule 144A. The annual  interest rate on the notes is 7.375% per annum with interest  payable on November 15 and May 15 of each year.  Payment of interest on the notes  commenced on November  15, 2001,  and the notes mature on May 15, 2011. In August 2001, under the terms of an exchange offering filed with the SEC, we exchanged  substantially  all of these notes for a similar amount of publicly registered notes. Because no additional debt was issued in the exchange offering, the net effect of this exchange was that no additional debt was issued on August 3, 2001, and  substantially  all of the notes are now registered  with the SEC.  During the third  quarter of 2001,  we entered into several  interest  rate swap agreements, with maturities ranging from 2004 to 2007, to manage our exposure to interest  rate  movements by  effectively  converting a portion of our long-term fixed rate debt to variable rates.  We entered into these  agreements to balance our debt  portfolio by changing  from all fixed  interest  rates to a mixture of fixed and floating interest rates,  thereby taking advantage of lower short-term rates.  The notional amount of the interest rate swaps subject to variable rates is $150.0 million. Under these agreements,  we have contracted to pay a variable rate based upon LIBOR and to receive fixed rate  payments  ranging from 6.95% to 7.35%. We have designated the agreements as fair value hedging  instruments.  At December 31, 2002, we recorded an asset in other  assets,  net, of $15.4 million (its fair  value) for the swap  agreements  and  adjusted  the fair value of the related debt by the same amount.  The effect of these agreements was a reduction in our interest  expense of $5.1 million during 2002, when compared to the fixed rates. At current interest rates, we expect this favorable  condition to reoccur in 2003.  From time to time, we utilize short-term debt such as commercial paper issuances and uncommitted  bank loans to supplement our short-term  financing  needs.  The commercial  paper and the short-term  seasonal bank debt have a typical maturity of 90 days or less.  The amount of commercial  paper that can be  outstanding is limited to a maximum of the unused  portion of our $600 million bank  syndicated revolving credit facility described in more detail below.  In the second  quarter of 2002,  we replaced  our existing  $600.0  million bank syndicated credit facilities with new bank syndicated  credit  facilities,  also totaling  $600.0  million.  These  facilities  are comprised of a $300.0 million 364-day  revolving  credit  facility  maturing in June 2003 and a $300.0 million five-year  revolving  credit facility  maturing in June 2007. The terms of these revolving  credit   facilities  are   substantially   similar  to  the  previous facilities.  The  new  revolving  credit  facilities  will  support  any  future commercial  paper  borrowings  and  are  otherwise  available  for  our  general corporate  purposes.  We  anticipate  replacing  our  364 day  revolving  credit facility  which  matures  in June 2003 with a new 364 day credit  facility  with similar terms.  As of December 31, 2002,  there were no  outstanding  borrowings under these credit facilities.  We use  operating  leases,  primarily  for our  retail  locations,  distribution centers and corporate  headquarters,  to lower our capital  requirements.  Other than these  operating  leases,  we do not have any  off-balance  sheet financing arrangements  or  transactions,  arrangements  or  relationships  with  "special purpose  entities." Our outstanding debt and bank syndicated  credit  facilities have customary financial covenants.  Management  believes  that our  present  ability to borrow is  greater  than our established  credit  lines  and  long-term  debt in  place.  However,  if market conditions changed and sales were to be dramatically  reduced or operating costs could  not be  controlled,  our cash  flows  and  liquidity  could  be  reduced. Additionally,  if a scenario as  described  above  occurred,  it could cause the rating  agencies to lower our credit ratings,  thereby  increasing our borrowing costs,  or even causing a reduction in or elimination of our access to debt and/or equity markets.  We  repurchased  10.7 million  shares of our common stock for $275.0 million for the year  ended  December  31,  2002,  under our  existing  25.0  million  share repurchase program.  In connection with our share repurchase program,  our Board of Directors  authorized us to enter into both equity  forwards and put options, with  expiration  dates no later than  December  31,  2002,  covering  up to 4.0 million  shares of our common  stock;  consequently,  there were no  outstanding equity forward instruments or put options at December 31, 2002.  We may continue to execute share  repurchases from time to time in order to take advantage of attractive  share price levels,  as determined by  management.  The timing and terms of the transactions depend on market conditions,  our liquidity and  other  considerations.  On  February  20,  2003,  our  Board  of  Directors authorized  a new  repurchase  program  for  15.0  million  shares,  which is in addition to our existing 25.0 million share repurchase  program. At February 20, 2003, there were 18.6 million shares  available to be repurchased  under the two repurchase programs. We anticipate that we will repurchase, under our authorized repurchase  programs,  between  $200.0  million and $250.0 million of our common stock during 2003.  This new program has no expiration date and allows shares to be  repurchased  in the open  market.  The  funding  required  for  these  share repurchase  programs will come from cash  generated from net sales and operating revenues and cash and cash equivalents.  Under our programs  described above, we will also repurchase  shares in the open market to offset the sales of shares to our employee stock plans.  On October 10, 2002,  our Board of  Directors  approved  the  conversion  of our RadioShack  Series B convertible  preferred stock, held by the RadioShack 401(k) Plan, to RadioShack  common stock  effective  December 31, 2002. On December 31, 2002,  0.1  million  shares  of  this  preferred  stock,  representing  all  the outstanding  Series B convertible  preferred stock were converted to 5.1 million shares of our  common  stock.  The  preferred  stock was held by the  RadioShack 401(k) Plan to fund RadioShack contributions to plan participants.  In  the  fourth  quarter of  2001 and  the  second  quarter of 2002, we sold our corporate  headquarters buildings and we are now constructing a new headquarters in Fort Worth,  Texas.  We entered into  sale-leaseback  agreements in which our existing corporate headquarters' land and buildings were sold and leased back to us. These  arrangements  should  provide us with the necessary time to construct our new  headquarters,  which we  expect to be  completed  by the end of 2004 or early 2005. Currently, we plan to finance our new corporate  headquarters,  with construction  costs estimated to total $200.0 million during 2003 and 2004, with cash from operations and, if needed, existing cash and cash equivalents.  The  following  tables,  as  well  as  the  information  contained  in  Note 7 - "Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities" to our "Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements," provide a summary of our various contractual commitments,  debt and interest repayment requirements, and available credit lines.

The  majority of these  contingent  liabilities relate to various  lease  obligations  arising from leases that were assigned to CompUSA,  Inc. as part of the sales of our Computer  City,  Inc.  subsidiary  to CompUSA,  Inc. in August 1998. In the event CompUSA or the other  assignees,  as applicable, are unable to fulfill their obligations, we would be responsible for rent due under the leases.  Our rent exposure  from the  remaining  undiscounted lease  commitments  with no  projected  sublease  income is  approximately  $214 million.  Moreover,  we have no  reason to  believe  that  CompUSA  or the other assignees will not fulfill their obligations  under these leases;  consequently, we do not believe there will be a material impact on our financial statements.  INFLATION Inflation has not significantly impacted us over the past three years. We do not expect  inflation  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  our  operations  in the foreseeable future, unless world events substantially affect the global economy.  ITEM 7a.   QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  At December 31, 2002, we did not have any derivative instruments that materially increased  our  exposure to market risks for interest  rates,  foreign  currency rates,  commodity  prices or other market  price risks,  other than the interest rate swaps noted in MD&A. We do not use derivatives for speculative purposes.  Our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in  short-term  interest rates.  Interest  rate risk exists with respect to our net  investment of $248.3 million,  comprised of fluctuating  short-term investments of $398.3 million and offset by $150.0  million of  indebtedness  which,  because of the interest rate swaps  discussed in MD&A,  effectively  bears  interest at  short-term  floating rates. In the future, an unfavorable  change of 100 basis points in the interest rate applicable to this  floating-rate  net exposure could result in an increase in annual net  interest  expense of $2.5  million.  This  assumption  assumes no change in the net principal balance.  We also  manage  our  portfolio  of fixed rate debt to reduce  our  exposure  to interest  rate  changes.  The fair  value of our fixed  rate  long-term  debt is sensitive  to interest  rate  changes.  Interest  rate  changes  would result in increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt due to differences  between market interest rates and rates at the inception of the debt  obligation.  Based on a  hypothetical  immediate  100 basis point  increase  in  interest  rates at December  31,  2002 and 2001,  the fair value of our fixed rate  long-term  debt would  decrease  for  both  years  by $32.9  million,  respectively.  Based on a hypothetical  immediate 100 basis point  decrease in interest  rates at December 31,  2002 and  2001,  the fair  value of our fixed  rate  long-term  debt  would increase by $35.4 million and $35.6  million,  respectively.  Regarding the fair value of our fixed rate debt,  changes in  interest  rates have no impact on our consolidated financial statements.   ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
