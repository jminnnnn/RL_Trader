ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND          FINANCIAL CONDITION.  FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS     Tandy Corporation ("Tandy" or "Company") participates in a highly competitive industry that is characterized by aggressive  pricing  practices.  In developing strategies to achieve continued  increases in sales and operating  profits,  the Company  anticipates  customer  demand  in  managing  its  product  transitions, inventory levels, and distribution  cycles. Due to rapid technological  advances affecting  personal  computer  and  consumer   electronic  product  cycles,  the Company's  operating  results could be adversely  affected should the Company be unable to  anticipate  product  cycle and/or  customer  demand  accurately.  The Company's  ability to achieve  targeted sales and earnings levels depends upon a number of competitive  and market factors  including,  without  limitation,  the Company's  ability to open new stores in accordance with its plans,  real estate market  fluctuations,  interest rate fluctuations,  dependence on manufacturers' product  development and changes in tax rules and regulations  applicable to the Company.     The regulatory and trade environment in which the Company operates is subject to risk and  uncertainty.  As a large importer of consumer  electronic  products from Asia,  unfavorable trade imbalances or the failure of Congress to approve a "Most Favored Nations" status to The People's Republic of China could negatively affect  the  Company.  As a result of the  Telecommunications  Act of 1996,  the deregulated   telecommunications   market   will   continue   to  present   both opportunities and increased  competition for the provision of  telecommunication equipment and service to consumers (see "Net Sales and Operating Revenues" for a discussion of RadioShack's telecommunications alliance).     With the exception of historical  information,  the matters  discussed herein contain forward-looking  statements that involve risks and uncertainties and are indicated  by  words  such as  "anticipates",  "expects",  "believes",  "plans", "could", and similar words and phrases. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, economic conditions  including consumer  installment debt levels and interest  rate  fluctuations,  shifts in  consumer  electronic  product  cycles, technological  advances or a lack  thereof,  consumer  demand for  products  and services,  competitive products and pricing, availability of products, inventory risks due to shifts in market demand,  the regulatory and trade  environment and other risks indicated in filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  STOCK SPLIT     On August 21, 1997, the Company's Board of Directors  declared a two-for-one split of Tandy common stock,  payable on September 22, 1997.  All  references to the number of shares of common stock issued or  outstanding,  per share  prices, cash  dividends and income per common share amounts in  Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition have been adjusted to reflect the split on a retroactive basis.

Consolidated  net sales and operating  revenues  decreased  14.5% to $5,372.2 million in 1997 from  $6,285.5  million in 1996,  attributable  to Tandy's store closure plan  announced in December  1996. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company showed a 2.0% comparable store sales increase.  RadioShack - ----------    RadioShack's  overall sales for 1997 increased 3.7% to $3,215.7  million from $3,101.1  million  in 1996,  adjusted  for  stores  closed  under the 1996 store closure plan,  due to positive same store sales gains and the opening of 108 new stores,  net of RadioShack store closures.  RadioShack's  comparable store sales increase  was 1.9% for the year ended  December 31,  1997,  driven  primarily by increased sales of wireless communication and telephone products (see below).      The accompanying  table summarizes  RadioShack's  sales breakdown by class of products and their related percentage to total RadioShack sales:                                             Percent of RadioShack Sales                                                     Year Ended                                                     December 31,                                       ----------------------------------------- Class of Products                       1997            1996             1995 - -----------------                     --------        --------         -------- Electronic parts, accessories  and specialty equipment                  30.4%           30.9%            30.1% Communications                            27.5            24.4             24.5 Audio/Video                               16.8            18.0             18.1 Personal electronics and seasonal         11.6            12.4             13.1 Personal computers, peripherals,  software and accessories                 10.5            11.8             11.5 Repair services, extended service  contracts and other                       3.2             2.5              2.7                                       --------        --------         --------                                          100.0%          100.0%           100.0%                                       ========        ========         ========     Electronic parts,  accessories and specialty  equipment,  the largest product category of RadioShack's sales mix, remained relatively  consistent in 1997 when compared with the prior two years.       The  communications  category  increased  to 27.5% of sales  from 24.4% and 24.5% in fiscal years 1996 and 1995, respectively. This category, which includes wireless  communications  such  as  cellular  and  PCS  telephones  as  well  as residential telephones,  answering machines,  pagers and other related telephony products,  benefited  from  the  successful  rollout  of  the  Sprint  Store  at RadioShack in September  1997. This program was initiated in September 1996 when the Company, through its RadioShack division,  entered into a telecommunications alliance  with Sprint  Communications  Company L.P.,  Sprint  United  Management Company    (collectively,    "Sprint"),    and    Sprint    PCS.    Through    a "store-within-a-store"  concept located in approximately 6,500 company-owned and RadioShack   dealer   outlets,   customers   have  access  to  a  full   service communications  information  center that offers,  where  available,  Sprint long distance, local and wireless phone service,  Internet access and paging, as well as SpreeSM  pre-paid  phone cards and phone  equipment.  RadioShack  is also the exclusive   retailer  of   Sprint(R)   branded   residential   telephones.   The communications  category is expected to continue to increase as a percentage  of RadioShack's total sales in 1998.     Sales of audio and  video  products  declined  to 16.8% of sales in 1997 from 18.0% and  18.1% in  fiscal  years  1996 and  1995,  respectively,  due to lower consumer  demand for these  products  and the  heightened  level of  competition within the industry.  Offsetting the decline in audio and video sales was a 7.0% increase  in 1997 of  "direct-to-home"  system  sales,  despite a  substantially reduced average selling price of digital satellite systems ("DSS").     Personal  electronics  and seasonal  products  decreased to 11.6% of sales in 1997 from 12.4% and 13.1% in 1996 and 1995,  respectively,  due  primarily to an overall  shift in the product mix to  communications;  management  expects  this trend to continue in fiscal year 1998. The decreases  since 1995 are also due to sales  declines in products  such as portable  radios,  boomboxes  and  cassette products,  which are  indicative  of lower  general  consumer  demand  for these products.     Personal  computer sales  decreased as a percentage of total sales despite an overall  unit gain for 1997.  The  average  1997  selling  price on desktop  and notebook  computers  fell  17.8% and 7.7%,  respectively,  from the 1996  annual average  selling  price.  On  January  28,  1998,  the  Company  announced  that RadioShack  had  signed a letter of intent  for a  multi-year  retail  sales and service  agreement with Compaq  Computer  Corporation  ("Compaq").  A definitive agreement  was signed with Compaq on February  25, 1998.  Under this  agreement, Compaq will replace IBM as the sole supplier of personal  computers sold through RadioShack   retail   outlets.   Compaq   computers   will  be  marketed  via  a "store-within-a-store"  concept similar to the Sprint Store at RadioShack.  Most company-owned  stores and many of the RadioShack dealer/franchise outlets should be retrofitted by the end of the third quarter of 1998.     The repair services,  extended service contracts and other category increased in 1997 due to an increase in residual income received from  RadioShack's  third party providers of  communication  and  direct-to-home  products,  as well as an increase in income from prepaid  cellular air time.  RadioShack  earns  residual income  on sales of  Sprint  long  distance  services,  sales of  direct-to-home programming and sales of many wireless products.  Additionally, RadioShack earns commissions  from  cellular  carriers for  activating  customers  with  cellular service.   Computer City - -------------    Computer  City,  Inc.'s  ("CCI  or  "Computer  City")  overall  sales in 1997 increased 10.6% to $1,903.7 million from $1,721.6 million in 1996,  adjusted for the 21 stores closed  pursuant to the 1996 store closure plan.  Computer  City's comparable  store sales increased 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 1997. The overall sales increase was primarily  attributable  to positive same store sales plus revenues generated by 14 new stores opened in 1996.     In  stores  open at least  one  year,  sales of  personal  computers  were up slightly in 1997 due to a  significant  increase in direct  sales to  corporate, education and government customers.  This increase was offset by the decrease in the  annual  average  selling  price of retail  desktop  computers,  which  fell approximately  15.0% from the 1996 annual  average  selling  price.  To a lesser extent,  a  decrease  in sales of non-DOS  machines  in 1997 also  impacted  the personal  computers sales  increase.  Computer City is in the process of rolling out a "build-to-order"  program,  which allows retail and corporate customers to order a  custom-configured  personal  computer  and have it shipped  directly to their home or office within a few days.     Product  categories  which  experienced  sales  and  unit  increases  in 1997 included  scanners,  which  benefited  from both  lower  selling  prices and new technology,  as well as notebook computers which experienced a large increase in both sales dollars and unit sales.  Sales of software,  accessories and supplies also  experienced  positive  sales growth in 1997 as Computer City continued its focus on sales to experienced users.     In stores open at least one year,  sales of extended  service plans increased approximately  24.0% over the prior year,  attributable to Computer City's focus on this area in 1997.  CCI  management  plans to  continue  its focus in 1998 on sales of services,  including  extended  service  plans,  software  training and technical support.  GROSS PROFIT       Gross  profit for the Company was $2,014.3  million,  or 37.5% of net sales and operating  revenues,  in fiscal 1997,  compared with  $2,022.4  million,  or 32.2%, in fiscal year 1996. This increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales and operating  revenues was primarily  due to  RadioShack  accounting  for 59.9% of the Company's  total sales and operating  revenues in fiscal year 1997, compared to 49.3% in fiscal year 1996, which occurred as a result of the closure of the Incredible  Universe  stores in early 1997 and, to a lesser  extent,  the closure of 21 Computer City stores at December 31, 1996. Excluding stores in the 1996 closure plan and excluding the 1996 fourth  quarter lower of cost or market inventory  impairment,  the slight decline in the Company's  gross profit margin from  38.8% in 1996 to  38.4%  in 1997  resulted  primarily  from the fact  that RadioShack's  1997  percentage  sales  increase  was less than  Computer  City's percentage  sales increase.  Computer City has an inherently  lower gross margin than RadioShack.     RadioShack's  gross profit as a percentage  of total net sales and  operating revenue increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 1997 versus 1996, due to a positive shift within RadioShack's product offerings to increased cellular  and telecommunication sales, as a percent of sales, and was further  enhanced by decreased  sales of lower  margin  personal  computers  (see  table on "Class of Products" above).     Computer City's gross profit for continuing  stores as a percent of net sales and operating  revenues increased 0.9 percentage points in 1997 when compared to fiscal year 1996 due to improvement in inventory management,  increased sales of higher margin  accessories  and software and an increase in the ratio of service revenues to total  revenues.  Service  revenues  typically  have a higher  gross margin than  merchandise  sales. CCI management will continue its focus in these areas in 1998.    SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ("SG&A")     The accompanying  table below summarizes the breakdown of various  components of the Company's  consolidated  SG&A and their  related  percentage of sales and operating revenues.

The higher  SG&A  percentage  is due  primarily  to RadioShack which became a larger percentage of Tandy's  consolidated  operations during 1997 (see "Gross Profit" above).  RadioShack  operates at higher relative SG&A levels than consolidated Tandy  Corporation.  Excluding those stores in the 1996 store closure plan,  SG&A as a percentage of sales would have  approximated 29.5%  for the year  ended  December  31,  1997.  See  "Provision  for  Business Restructuring" below.     Although  payroll and  commissions  expense for 1997  decreased in dollars in comparison with 1996, this cost increased as a percentage of sales and operating revenues from 12.1% in 1996 to 13.7% in 1997,  due to the increase in RadioShack sales as a percentage of total sales and  operating  revenues  described  above. RadioShack  has  inherently  higher  salary  expense  as  a  ratio of percent to sales and  operating  revenues when  compared to the total  Company.  RadioShack payroll expense  increased in dollars and as a percentage of RadioShack sales in 1997  from  1996 due to  increased  staffing  at the store  level.  This  dollar increase  is  expected  to  continue  in 1998;  however,  payroll  expense  as a percentage of sales is expected to remain  consistent  with 1997.  Computer City payroll  expense as a percentage of Computer City sales  increased  from 1996 to 1997 due to the addition of new stores, added headcount in the direct sales area and a realignment of support staff from Tandy Corporation to Computer City.     Advertising  expense decreased,  both in dollars and as a percentage of sales and operating  revenues,  in the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1996. This decrease over the prior year is primarily the result of reductions in Incredible  Universe  advertising  in 1997 due to stores closed pursuant to the 1996 restructuring  plan. Computer City had a substantial increase in vendor  participation in its advertising  campaigns in 1997 compared to 1996.  Somewhat  offsetting  these  decreases was a slight dollar increase in advertising  expense at RadioShack to promote the Sprint  "store-within-a-store" concept, which was launched in September 1997. RadioShack advertising expense as a percentage of sales in 1997 remained constant with 1996. In 1998,  advertising dollars  are  expected  to be  comparable  to 1997,  with the  exception  of the expenses associated with the prior year Sprint marketing launch.     Rent expense  increased as a percentage of sales to 4.1% in 1997 from 3.8% in 1996.  This increase is related to a decrease in the number of Computer City and Incredible  Universe  stores which have lower rent  expense as a  percentage  of sales than the Company as a whole.  Rent  expense in dollars  decreased  in 1997 from 1996 due to Incredible  Universe and Computer City store closures  pursuant to the 1996 restructuring  plan. Rent expense for RadioShack remained consistent with the prior year in dollars and decreased  slightly as a percentage of sales. Rent expense in dollars for RadioShack and Computer City is expected to increase in 1998 due to new store openings.     Fees paid for  promotional  accounts such as "zero  interest for six months", which  are  classified  as  credit  card fees in the  accompanying  SG&A  table, decreased  as a result of the  closure  of the  Incredible  Universe  stores and decreased  usage by  RadioShack  during  1997.  Credit  card fees  expense  also includes fees associated with third party bank credit cards.     Other SG&A  expenses, which include  repair, maintenance, travel and returned checks, as well as other miscellaneous expenses and other income, decreased both as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues and in dollars when compared to fiscal year ended December 31, 1996. Increases in other income were primarily attributable to the receipt of $9.0 million,  pre-tax, of income from O'Sullivan Industries (see "Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit Reimbursement Agreement" below) and non-recurring gains of $4.7 million recorded on repayment of the note receivable from InterTAN,  Inc. ("InterTAN") (see "Relations with InterTAN" below) and $3.0 million on sale of certain  assets.  These  increases  were offset by additional restructuring expense of the $11.6 million related to store closings pursuant to the 1996 store closure plan.  NET INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)     The accompanying  table below summarizes the breakdown of interest income and interest expense:                                                     Year Ended                                                    December 31,                                      -------------------------------------- (In millions)                          1997            1996           1995 - -------------                        --------        --------       ------- Interest income:  Credit card operations              $     --        $     --     $    18.5  InterTAN notes receivable,   including accretion of discount         5.4             6.7           8.3  AST note receivable,   including accretion of discount          --             2.6           4.9  Fry's Electronics notes receivable       3.3              --            --  IRS settlements                          1.0             0.3           6.2  Other interest income                    3.5             3.4           4.4                                      --------        --------      --------   Total interest income                  13.2            13.0          42.3  Interest expense                        (46.1)          (36.4)        (33.7)                                      --------        --------     --------- Net interest income (expense)        $  (32.9)       $  (23.4)    $     8.6                                      ========        ========     =========     Net interest expense was $32.9 million for 1997 versus $23.4 million in 1996. Interest expense increased in 1997 as the Company continued  purchasing treasury stock (see "Capital  Structure and Financial  Condition" below) and continued to fund store  expansion.  Interest  expense  also  increased  during 1997 when the Company refinanced existing short-term indebtedness (average maturity of 90 days or less) by issuing $150.0 million of ten-year  unsecured notes,  resulting in a moderately  higher interest rate when compared to the short-term  financing used in 1996.     Interest  income relating to the InterTAN notes decreased in 1997 as InterTAN made the scheduled  principal payments on the note balances.  The remaining note was repaid in December  1997 and, as such,  the Company  will no longer  receive interest income from InterTAN in 1998 (see "Relations with InterTAN"  below). In addition,  the  AST  Research,  Inc.  ("AST")  note  was  repaid  in  1996  and, accordingly,  the Company no longer received interest income from this source in 1997  (see  "AST  Securities"  below).  Interest  income  relating  to the Fry's Electronics,  Inc. and its affiliates  ("Fry's") notes receivables resulted from the 1997 sale of assets and real estate of six Incredible  Universe  stores.  At December 31, 1997,  the Company held  multiple  notes  receivable  from Fry's of approximately  $75.3  million with varying  maturities  ranging from one to five years and varying  interest rates ranging from  approximately  5.9% to 6.7%. The Company expects interest income related to the Fry's notes to increase  slightly during 1998 (see "Provision for Business Restructuring" below).     Net interest expense is not expected to change  materially during 1998, based on the existing interest rate environment.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES     The  provision  for income taxes  reflects an effective tax rate of 38.5% for fiscal  year  1997,  compared  to an  effective  tax  benefit  of 37.1%  for the comparable  period in fiscal  year 1996.  The  fiscal  1997  effective  tax rate differed from the fiscal 1996  effective tax rate  primarily  because the fiscal 1996 tax rate  included  foreign  income  taxes  which were  incurred on foreign income despite the overall loss incurred by the Company.  FISCAL 1996 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1995 - ------------------------------------- NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES     Consolidated  net sales and  operating  revenues  increased  7.6% to $6,285.5 million  in 1996 from  $5,839.1  million in 1995.  The  increase  was  primarily attributable to two factors:  (1) the addition of 111 RadioShack  stores (net of closures)  and 14  Computer  City  stores  during  1996 and (2) the  incremental addition of a full year's  revenue  related to stores  opened  during 1995 whose total 1995 revenue reflected a partial year.     For the year ended December 31, 1996,  the Company  showed a 2.3%  comparable store  sales  decline,  which  was  the  result  of all  divisions  experiencing comparable sales declines during the year.  Although RadioShack same store sales declined less than 1%,  Incredible  Universe was down 4.2% and Computer City was down 4.9%. These declines were indicative of the heightened level of competition within the industry and lower  consumer  demand  which  negatively  impacted the consumer  electronics  industry  as a whole.  This lower  demand  was  primarily attributed  to higher  consumer  debt levels and the lack of new  products  with significant technological advances.  RadioShack - ----------    RadioShack  sales for 1996 increased less than 2.0% to $3,101.1  million from $3,044.1 million, adjusted for stores in the 1996 store closure plan. Electronic parts,  accessories and specialty equipment,  including batteries,  remained the single largest product category of RadioShack's  sales mix,  increasing to 30.9% of sales  from  30.1% in 1995.  Communications  and  audio/video  sales  dollars increased  slightly  in 1996,  while the  percentage  of total sales for each of these  categories  remained  relatively   consistent  with  1995.  The  personal electronics and seasonal  product  category,  which includes  portable radio and cassette  products,  declined  as a  percentage  of  sales  from  1996 to  1995, principally  due to lower  consumer  demand and  heightened  competition  in the industry.     The average 1996 selling price on desktop  computers  and notebook  computers rose  32.9%  and  18.5%,  respectively,  over the 1995  average  selling  price, contributing to the increase in the personal  computer  category as a percent of total sales from 1995 to 1996.  This  increase in selling  price,  however,  was offset by a decline in system units sold.  Repair  income  experienced  a slight decline in 1996,  contributing  to the slight  decrease in the repair  services, extended  service  contracts and other category as a percent of total sales from 1995 to 1996.  Computer City - -------------    Computer City sales in 1996 increased 22.7% to $1,721.6 million from $1,402.8 million in 1995,  adjusted for the stores  closed  under the 1996 store  closure plan.  This  increase was the result of opening 30 new  Computer  City stores in 1995.  The 21 closed  Computer  City stores  announced  in the  Company's  store closure plan in December 1996  generated  revenues of $359.1 million in 1996 and $376.4 million in 1995.  Incredible Universe - -------------------    Incredible  Universe  sales  increased  22.4% to $908.5  million in 1996 from $742.0 million in 1995. This increase was the result of opening eight new stores in fiscal year 1995.  GROSS PROFIT     Gross profit for the Company as a percentage of sales  declined from 35.5% in 1995 to 32.2% in 1996. The Company's  gross profit margin for 1996 was adversely affected by  approximately  $91.4  million of lower of cost or market  inventory writedowns  and  related  costs  primarily  associated  with  the  restructuring announced in December 1996.  Excluding  these  charges,  the gross profit margin would have been 33.6% for 1996.  The decrease in gross profit  margin from 35.5% to 33.6% (as adjusted) reflected the effect of Tandy's lower gross margin retail formats.  During  calendar  year 1996,  Computer  City and  Incredible  Universe represented  47.6% of net sales and  operating  revenues as compared to 43.2% of the 1995 net sales and operating revenues.  Continuing Computer City sales would have  approximated  35.3% of 1996 total sales,  after giving  effect to the 1996 store closure plan. Furthermore,  the Company's gross profit margin for calendar year 1996,  excluding  stores in the closure  plan and the 1996  fourth  quarter lower of cost or market inventory impairment, would have approximated 38.8%. See "Provision for Business Restructuring" below.     During 1996,  RadioShack's gross margin was up slightly when compared to 1995 due to the relative  stability of product mix as a percentage  of overall  sales from 1995 to 1996. Excluding lower of cost or market writedowns  associated with store closures,  Computer City's gross margin decreased  slightly in 1996 due to competitive forces which existed in the computer retail industry and the lack of introduction in 1996 of new products with significant technological advances.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES     The Company's  SG&A, as a percentage of sales and operating  revenues for the year ended  December 31,  1996,  declined to 28.0% from 28.2% for the year ended December 31, 1995. The lower SG&A percentage reflected the lower costs, relative to net sales and operating revenues,  of Computer City and Incredible  Universe, which  operate at lower  relative  costs than  consolidated  Tandy  Corporation. Excluding  those stores in the 1996 store closure plan,  SG&A as a percentage of sales would have approximated 29.7% versus 28.0% for the year ended December 31, 1996. See "Provision for Business Restructuring" below.     Payroll  and  commissions  expense  remained   relatively   consistent  as  a percentage of net sales and operating  revenues  between 12.1% in 1996 and 12.0% in  1995.  As of  December  31,  1996,  the  Company  had  approximately  48,400 employees,  which included  approximately  8,500 temporary  retail employees who were hired for the Christmas selling season.     Advertising  costs  for 1996  decreased  as a  percentage  of net  sales  and operating  revenue  to 4.1%  from  4.4%  due to  nonrecurring  1995  promotional expenses  relating  to the grand  opening of 30  Computer  City stores and eight Incredible Universe stores during 1995. RadioShack's 1996 advertising expense as a percentage of sales remained consistent with 1995.     Rent expense increased slightly as a percentage of sales to 3.8% in 1996 from 3.7% in 1995 due to the increase in the number of Computer  City and  Incredible Universe stores over the prior year.     The 1996  expenses  of the credit  operations  were  eliminated  in 1996 as a result of the sale of the private label credit card portfolios.  The sale of the portfolio also impacted  interest income (see discussion  below).  Commencing in 1995, the Company  receives fees from an unrelated  third party financier of its private  label  credit  card  portfolio  balance  for the  generation  of normal interest-bearing  accounts, and pays a fee for the generation of special purpose promotional  accounts,  such  as  "zero  interest  for six  months".  Incredible Universe and Computer City utilized these  promotions  frequently in fiscal 1996 and the fees are classified as credit card fees in the  accompanying  SG&A table above.     Other SG&A expenses,  which include repair,  maintenance,  travel,  and other miscellaneous  expenses had, in total,  remained  relatively  consistent between 3.1% and 3.0% of sales during 1996 and 1995.  NET INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)     Net interest expense was $23.4 million for 1996 versus net interest income of $8.6 million for 1995. The reversal to a net interest  expense  position in 1996 was primarily  attributable  to the sale of the  Company's  private label credit card  portfolios  to a third  party in the fourth  quarter of 1994 and the first quarter of 1995 (see "Sale of Credit Operations" below for further information).     Interest  expense  grew  from  1995  to  1996 as a  result  of the  Company's increased  usage of short-term  borrowing  facilities,  including  seasonal bank credit lines and commercial paper facilities, as excess funds from the 1995 sale of credit operations were fully utilized. The use of these facilities was higher during  1996 as the  Company  continued  to retire  long-term  debt,  fund store expansion and execute the share repurchase program.     Interest  income relating to the InterTAN notes and the AST note decreased in 1996 as  scheduled  principal  payments  were  received  by the  Company.  Other interest  income  relates  primarily to cash  equivalents of the Company and was higher in 1995 than in 1996 due to increased cash equivalents resulting from the sale of the credit card portfolios.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES     The  effective  tax benefit rate that  resulted  from the  Company's net loss position  was  37.1% for the year  ended  December  31,  1996,  compared  to the effective tax rate of 38.3% for the year ended  December 31, 1995. The effective tax rate for 1996 changed from 1995 due primarily to foreign  income taxes which were incurred on foreign income in 1996 despite the overall loss incurred by the Company.  NEW COMPUTER CITY STRATEGY    On June 26, 1997, the Company organized a new subsidiary, CCI, and thereafter conveyed to it certain related assets and liabilities of the Company's  Computer City  division.  On July 17,  1997,  Eureka  Venture  Partners  III LLP, a Texas limited  liability  partnership  ("Eureka"),   entered  into  a  Stock  Purchase Agreement with the Company (the "Stock Purchase  Agreement") to acquire 19.9% of the outstanding common stock of CCI for a total purchase price of $24.9 million, payable  in cash (1% of the  purchase  price)  and a note  (99% of the  purchase price)  issued by Eureka.  The note is secured only by the common  shares of CCI held by Eureka. Accordingly,  this transaction has not been recognized as a sale for accounting purposes and Tandy continues to consolidate 100% of CCI's results of  operations.  The note bears  interest at 8.0% per annum and is payable on or before July 17,  2002.  Pursuant to the terms of the Stock  Purchase  Agreement, Eureka and its principals  provided a new senior  management  team for CCI. This new management team consists of Nathan Morton,  CCI Chief Executive  Officer and Co-Chairman,  Avery  More,  CCI Vice  Chairman,  and  Robert  Boutin,  CCI Chief Financial  Officer,  all of whom are  principals of Eureka.  John V. Roach,  the Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of the  Company,  serves  as the other Co-Chairman of CCI and as its President. Eureka, on July 17, 1997, also acquired a warrant to purchase an additional 20.1% of the outstanding common stock of CCI for $31.4  million  payable in cash (at least 10% of the  purchase  price) and a note (not more than 90% of the purchase price) issued by Eureka. This warrant is exercisable upon either the attainment of certain financial performance goals by CCI or upon the date CCI is  established  as an  independent  entity as  defined pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement.       In  connection  with the creation of CCI, the Company  assigned to CCI, and CCI assumed, the Company's  obligations under a $125.0 million subordinated note payable  bearing  8.0%  interest.  The note is due in July  2002 to Trans  World Electronics,  Inc., a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Tandy.  This subordinated note represents  certain  liabilities  of the Company  allocable to its Computer City division that were assumed by CCI.  Computer City currently has a $150.0 million bank line of credit of which $30.0 million is  outstanding at December 31, 1997. This line of credit is fully  guaranteed by Tandy through December 31, 1998 (see Note 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial  Statements").  CCI will use the line of credit primarily for internal working capital  requirements.  In January 1998,  CCI also began  working  with two  investment  banks to raise  additional equity as a part of a strategy for CCI to reach independent status. There can be no assurance, however, that any such independence will occur.     Eureka has the option to require the Company to  repurchase  all shares owned by Eureka and the warrant in the event that it is exercisable  but  unexercised, upon payment of certain amounts, as provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement, if certain  financial  performance  goals  are  met by CCI and  the  CCI  Board  of Directors does not approve the establishment of CCI as an independent  entity by means of one or more transactions.  Additionally, prior to CCI being established as an  independent  entity,  the Company has the right to  reacquire  all of the shares  of CCI  owned  by  Eureka,  and  the  warrant  in the  event  that it is exercisable, but unexercised,  upon payment of certain amounts, as determined by defined formulas pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement.     Sales and operating  revenues,  operating losses, and restructuring and other charges  (before  interest  and taxes) for CCI for each of the three years ended December 31 are presented below:                                            1997          1996          1995                                         --------      --------      --------   Sales and operating revenues          $1,903.7      $2,080.5      $1,779.2   Operating loss                           (14.9)        (47.2)        (20.3)   Restructuring and other charges             --         (54.2)           --     As described  more fully in  "Provision  for Business  Restructuring"  below, during the fourth quarter of 1996 Tandy elected to close 21 unprofitable stores. CCI  recognized  a  pre-tax   restructuring  charge  aggregating  $14.8  million associated  with  these  closings.   The  charges  related  primarily  to  lease obligations and employee termination  expenses.  CCI also recognized  impairment charges  pursuant  to  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" ("FAS 121")  aggregating  $18.7 million during 1996 and lower of cost or market impairments  aggregating  approximately  $20.7 million related to inventory  liquidated at the affected stores.  Additionally,  the new management team at CCI has taken and will  continue  to take  certain  actions to  increase revenues and achieve  profitability.  These actions include  increasing  service revenues  which  typically  have a higher gross margin than  merchandise  sales, increasing  direct sales to  corporations,  government and education  customers, creating   a   build-to-order   program   which   allows   customers   to  order custom-configured  personal  computers,  and  developing the ability to purchase products  on-line via the  Internet.  Management  of CCI and Tandy  believe that these actions will result in improved operating performance;  however, there can be no assurance that increased sales and profitability will be achieved.  Should these actions fail to increase sales and achieve  operating  profit,  management may be required to close  additional  stores,  sell certain assets or take other measures deemed necessary to achieve improved operating performance.  PROVISION FOR BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING    In  1996,  Tandy  initiated  certain  restructuring  programs  affecting  its Incredible  Universe and  Computer  City stores and its  remaining  McDuff store operations.  These  restructuring  programs  were  undertaken as a result of the highly competitive  environment in the electronics  industry.  The components of the restructuring charge and an analysis of the reserves are outlined in a table in Note 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements".     The  Company  recorded a pre-tax  charge of $25.5  million  during the second quarter  of  1996  related  to  an  Incredible  Universe  restructuring  program announced in May 1996. The charge related primarily to future lease obligations, disposition  of fixed assets,  and certain  termination  costs  associated  with employees.  This program included an overhead reduction plan, the closing of two stores  in the  second  quarter  of 1996 due to  inadequate  sales  volumes  and non-recoverable costs incurred with certain real estate sites held for new store development.  The Company also recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $136.6 million in the fourth quarter of 1996 related to the closing of the remaining 53 McDuff  stores,  exiting the  Incredible  Universe  business  (consisting  of 17 remaining open stores), and the closure of 21 unprofitable Computer City stores. The fourth quarter charges related primarily to lease  obligations,  real estate costs,  employee  termination  expenses  and  contract  cancellation  costs.  In association  with  the 1996  restructurings,  the  Company  also  recognized  an impairment  charge of $112.8 million pursuant to FAS 121 (see discussion  below) and lower of cost or market impairments aggregating  approximately $91.4 million primarily  related to inventory  that was  liquidated  at the  affected  stores. Inventory  impairment charges were recognized in the Consolidated  Statements of Income as an increase in cost of sales in 1996 (see  "Gross  Profit"  discussion above).     In January 1997,  the Company closed the respective 53 McDuff and 21 Computer City stores.  The sale of the real estate of six Incredible  Universe stores and related  fixed  assets and  inventory  to Fry's was  concluded  in July 1997 for approximately  $21.5 million in cash and $97.4 million in notes  receivable with no material gain or loss  recognized  upon the sale.  At December 31, 1997,  the notes  receivable  balance was $75.3  million.  The interest  rates on the notes range from  approximately 5.9% to 6.7% with maturity dates ranging from one year to five years. The sales of seven additional  Incredible Universe locations were completed  during  July  and  August  1997 for  $81.2  million  in  cash,  notes receivable and marketable  securities,  the securities  having been subsequently sold for cash.  Again,  no material gain or loss was recognized upon the sale of the assets. The note receivable  approximated $0.9 million at December 31, 1997. The lease was terminated on another  location during the fourth quarter of 1997, leaving five locations remaining at December 31, 1997.     As of March 18,  1998,  signed  agreements  existed to sell the  building and leasehold  improvements  on  two  other  Incredible  Universe  locations  and to sublease  the  land  at one of  these  locations,  subject  to  obtaining  final approvals  and  permits.   Management   anticipates  that  the  three  remaining Incredible  Universe locations will be sold,  subleased or the leases terminated with the lessors by the third quarter of 1998, based on signed letters of intent obtained by the Company and/or negotiations currently in process; however, there can be no assurance  that such  planned  disposals  or lease  terminations  will occur.     Sales and  operating  revenues  and  operating  losses of the  stores  closed pursuant to the restructuring plans are shown below for each year ended December 31 (unaudited):           (In millions)                         1997        1996        1995          -------------                       --------    --------    --------           Sales and operating revenues        $  164.6    $1,403.4    $1,318.0          Operating loss (1)                     (30.1)     (114.4)      (62.3)  (1) The  operating  loss for 1997  excludes a reserve  estimate  recorded in the     fourth  quarter of 1997 of an  additional  $11.6  million  relating to store     closings  pursuant  to the  1996  store  closure  plan.  The  $11.6  million     provision is included in selling,  general and administrative expense in the     accompanying 1997 Consolidated Statements of Income.     Although no significant  additional  provisions are expected in 1998 relating to the 1996  restructuring,  unexpected  delays in the  closing  of real  estate sales, among other factors,  may result in additional  charges.  Management does not  anticipate  any  significant  revenue or operating loss in 1998 from stores closed pursuant to the 1996 restructuring plan.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS    Upon adoption of FAS 121 in the first quarter of 1996, the Company recognized an initial non-cash  impairment loss of  approximately  $26.0 million to conform with this  statement,  primarily  as a result of grouping  long-lived  assets at their  lowest level of cash flows to  determine  impairment  as required by this statement.  Fair value was principally  determined  based upon estimated  future discounted cash flows (before interest) related to each group of assets.     The Company  recognized an  additional  non-cash  impairment  charge of $86.8 million  in the fourth  quarter of 1996  primarily  related to the  disposal  of certain  long-lived assets pursuant to its restructuring plan (see Note 6 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements").  These assets principally related to the  Incredible  Universe,  Computer City and McDuff stores that were part of the store  closure  plan,  and  certain  foreign  real  estate.  Fair  value was principally determined by quoted market prices.  AST SECURITIES    On July 12,  1996,  the  Company  received  $60.0  million  in cash and $30.0 million in AST common  stock as final  payment of a $90.0  million  note payable from AST to the Company.  The Company's  original cost basis  approximated $6.67 per share.     During the fourth quarter of 1996,  the Company  recognized a pre-tax loss of $7.0 million on the stock because the decline in the price was  determined to be other than temporary.  The $7.0 million loss was charged to selling, general and administrative  expenses in the  accompanying  1996  Consolidated  Statements of Income.     During August 1997,  the Company sold the remaining  4,413,594  shares of AST common  stock  under a tender  offer from  Samsung  for total  proceeds of $23.8 million.  A gain of $1.3  million  was  recognized  on the sale  which  has been included as a reduction to SG&A expense in the  accompanying  1997  Consolidated Statements of Income.

NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS    In June 1997, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (the "FASB") issued Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting  Comprehensive  Income" ("FAS 130") and Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an  Enterprise  and Related  Information"  ("FAS 131"),  which are effective for fiscal years  beginning  after December 15, 1997. The Company will adopt FAS 130 and FAS 131 in the first  quarter  of 1998.  Also,  the  American  Institute  of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 98-1,  "Accounting for the Costs of Computer  Software  Developed or Obtained  for Internal  Use" ("SOP 98-1"),  which is effective for fiscal years  beginning after December 15, 1998. The Company's current policy falls within the guidelines of SOP 98-1.  SALE OF CREDIT OPERATIONS    In December 1994, the Company sold its Computer City and Incredible  Universe private  label  credit card  portfolios  to SPS  Transaction  Services,  Inc., a majority-owned  subsidiary of Dean Witter,  Discover and Company  ("SPS").  As a result of the  transaction,  Tandy received cash of $85.8 million at the time of the sale,  and a deferred  payment of $179.8  million  during 1995.  The Company discounted  the  deferred   payment  by  5.0%  to  yield   interest   income  of approximately $3.5 million over the twelve month payout period.     On March 30, 1995, the Company  completed the sale, at net book value, of the RadioShack  and  Tandy  Name  Brand  private  label  credit  card  accounts  and substantially all related accounts receivable to Hurley State Bank, a subsidiary of SPS. As a result of the  transaction,  Tandy received  $342.8 million in cash and a  deferred  payment  of $49.4  million.  All of the  deferred  payment  was received in 1995, except for $2.1 million, which was received in 1996.  TAX SHARING AND TAX BENEFIT REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT    Pursuant to the Company's Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit Reimbursement Agreement (the "Agreement") with O'Sullivan Industries ("O'Sullivan"), a former subsidiary of Tandy,  the Company  receives  payments  from  O'Sullivan  approximating  the federal tax benefit that O'Sullivan realizes from the increased tax basis of its assets  resulting from the initial public  offering  completed in February 1994. The higher tax basis increases  O'Sullivan's  tax deductions  and,  accordingly, reduces  income taxes payable by  O'Sullivan.  For the years ended  December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company recognized income of $5.8 million, $0.2 million and $1.3 million, net of tax, respectively, under this Agreement. These payments will  continue  to be made over a 15-year  time period and are  contingent  upon O'Sullivan's  level of earnings  from year to year.  The income is recorded as a reduction of selling,  general and  administrative  expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY                                           Year Ended                                           December 31,                              -------------------------------------- (In millions)                  1997           1996           1995 - -------------                --------       --------       -------- Operating activities         $  320.3       $  307.5       $  673.0 Investing activities            (63.9)        (112.9)        (180.3) Financing activities           (272.0)        (216.6)        (554.8)     Tandy's cash flow and liquidity,  in  management's  opinion,  remains strong. During the year ended December 31, 1997,  cash provided by operations was $320.3 million as compared to $307.5  million for the year ended  December 31, 1996 and $673.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1995.     Cash flow  from  operations  before  working  capital  changes  increased  to approximately $392.7 million in 1997 from $258.3 million in 1996 due to improved operating  performance.  Working  capital  components used $72.4 million in cash flow from  operations  in 1997,  due  primarily  to a decrease in other  current liabilities  of  $209.6  million,  related,  for the  most  part,  to  resulting expenditures   associated  with  the   restructuring   activity.   Substantially offsetting the decreased cash flow from  expenditures  related to  restructuring was a decrease in  inventory,  which  generated  $163.8  million in cash flow in 1997, of which $106.0 million  related to the liquidation of inventory at closed Incredible Universe stores. Additionally, Computer City inventory decreased over the prior  year due to better  inventory  management  and,  to a lesser  extent, inventory  liquidations  at closed  Computer City stores.  RadioShack  inventory increased  $37.7 million  compared to 1996 due primarily to increased  telephony inventory--both PCS and residential hardware.     In 1996, working capital components  generated $49.2 million of positive cash flow to operations,  with current  liabilities  generating $38.1 million of this increase.  In 1996,  inventory for  RadioShack  and related  support  operations decreased  approximately $30.0 million,  while during the same period,  Computer City and  Incredible  Universe  inventories  (prior to  restructuring  reserves) increased approximately $30.1 million. These year-to-year inventory fluctuations offset one  another,  resulting  in no material  net cash  effect for 1996.  The increased cash flow from  operations for 1995 compared to 1996 was the result of nonrecurring  cash flows generated in 1995 related to the cash received from the sale of the credit card  portfolios,  which  approximated  $342.8  million,  and collection of the deferred payment amount from SPS of $179.8 million.     Investing  activities  used $63.9  million in cash flow in 1997  compared  to $112.9 million in 1996 and $180.3  million in 1995,  primarily  attributable  to reduced capital expenditures.  Capital expenditures  approximated $118.4 million in 1997 as  compared  to $174.8  million  and  $226.5  million in 1996 and 1995, respectively.  Capital  expenditures  for 1997 were used  primarily  for  retail expansion and upgrading  information systems.  Capital expenditures for 1996 and 1995 were used primarily for retail expansion, upgrading information systems and headquarter   building   renovations.   Management   anticipates   that  capital expenditure  requirements  for 1998 will  approximate  $100.0 to $110.0 million, excluding  Computer City, and will consist  primarily of RadioShack future store expansions and refurbishments,  reconfiguration of selected distribution centers and  updated  information  systems  as  well  as  other  miscellaneous   capital expenditures.  These  expenditures  will be funded primarily from cash flow from operations. CCI management anticipates capital expenditure requirements for 1998 to approximate $50.0 to $60.0 million, related primarily to information systems, new store openings and store remodels.     Investing  activities  also  included cash proceeds of $12.7 million from the sale of plant,  property and equipment  related to the sale of various corporate assets. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment in 1995 resulted primarily  from  sale-leaseback  transactions  which  netted the  Company  $37.6 million in cash. In August 1997, the Company sold its remaining 4,413,594 shares of AST common stock for approximately $23.8 million. The stock had been received in 1996 as a partial  payment on a note receivable from AST. The cash portion of payments on the AST note  receivable  amounted to $60.0 million in 1996 and $6.7 million in 1995.  In December  1997,  the Company  received  $20.9  million from InterTAN  as  final  repayment  on its  note  receivable  (see  "Relations  with InterTAN" below).     Cash used by financing  activities  was $272.0  million in 1997,  compared to $216.6 million and $554.8 million in 1995.  Purchases of treasury stock required cash of $425.6  million,  $232.9  million and $502.2  million in 1997,  1996 and 1995,  respectively.  See "Capital Structure and Financial  Condition" below for further information on the Company's stock repurchase program. Sales of treasury stock to the Tandy Stock Plan generated cash of $35.2 million, $39.4 million and $44.6 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  Dividends paid, net of tax, in 1997,  1996 and 1995  amounted  to $48.2  million,  $52.5  million  and $63.0 million,  respectively. As a result of the Company calling for the redemption of its  $2.14  Depositary  Shares  of  the  Company's  Series  C  Preferred  Equity Redemption Convertible Stock ("PERCS") in March 1995, the Company eliminated its annual  dividend  payment  to the  PERCS  shareholders  of  approximately  $32.0 million.  The Company plans to fund common and Series B (Tandy  Employees  Stock Ownership Plan,  "TESOP") preferred stock dividends with available cash and cash flow from operations.       In 1997, the Company  increased its short-term  debt over the prior year by $43.6  million,  net of the  reduction  due to  utilization  of  $150.0  million long-term debt to retire  short-term debt. The Company's  additional  short-term debt  in 1997  was  used  for  general  working  capital  requirements,  capital expenditures, the share repurchase program and the repayment of $28.5 million of current  maturities on  outstanding  medium-term  notes.  The Company's  primary source  of  short-term  debt,  for which  borrowings  and  repayments  have been presented  net in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Cash  Flows,  consists  of short-term  seasonal bank debt and commercial  paper,  which have  maturities of less than 90 days. The Company increased its long-term debt by $149.8 million in 1997,  primarily  through the issuance of $150.0 million of long-term debt under the Company's  $300.0  million Debt Shelf  Registration  Statement (see "Capital Structure and Financial Condition" below). Proceeds from this offering were used to  refinance  existing   short-term   indebtedness.   Repayments  of  long-term borrowings during 1997 primarily  consisted of the repayment of $28.5 million of medium-term notes.     Following  are the  current  credit  ratings for Tandy,  which are  generally considered investment grade:                                                  Standard           Duff &      Category                     Moody's      and Poor's          Phelps      --------                     -------      ----------          ------      Medium-Term Notes             Baa2           A-                 A-      ESOP Senior Notes             Baa2           A-                 N/A      Commercial Paper              P-2            A-2                D-1  CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION    The Company's  balance sheet and financial  condition  continue to be strong. The  Company's  available  borrowing  facilities  as of  December  31,  1997 are detailed in Note 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements".     On March  3,  1997,  the  Company  announced  that  its  Board  of  Directors authorized management to purchase an additional 10.0 million shares, as adjusted to reflect the  two-for-one  split,  of its common stock  through the  Company's existing share repurchase  program.  The share repurchase  program was initially authorized in December 1995 and increased in October 1996 and was  undertaken as a result of management's  view of the economic value of the Company's stock. The share increase for 1997 brings the total authorization to 30.0 million shares of which 21.0  million  shares  totaling  $529.2  million had been  purchased as of December 31, 1997.  Approximately  11.9 million shares were  repurchased in 1997 for $333.1  million.  These purchases are in addition to the shares required for employee plans which are purchased  throughout the year. Purchases will continue to be made in 1998 in the open market,  but possibly to a lesser  extent than in 1997,  and it is expected that funding of the program will come from excess free cash flow.     The revolving credit backup facility to Tandy's  commercial paper program was renewed  during the second  quarter of 1997.  This  facility  is composed of two agreements:  a one-year  facility for $200.0  million  expiring  June 1998 and a five-year  facility for $300.0 million expiring in June 2001.  Annual commitment fees for the facilities  are 0.07% of the $200.0 million  facility per annum and 0.10% of the $300.0 million  facility per annum,  respectively,  whether used or unused.     The total  debt-to-capitalization ratio was 33.6% at December 31, 1997, 22.3% at December  31,  1996 and 17.1% at  December  31,  1995.  This  increase in the debt-to-capitalization  ratio in 1997 and 1996  results  primarily  from Tandy's share repurchase program.     On March 3, 1997, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the filing of a $300.0 million Debt Shelf Registration Statement (the "Registration  Statement") with the Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("S.E.C.").  The Company filed the Registration Statement with the S.E.C. in May 1997, which was declared effective on August 6, 1997. On August 19, 1997,  the Company  issued $150.0 million of 10 year unsecured notes under the Registration Statement.  The interest rate on the notes is 6.95% per annum with  interest  payable on  September  1 and March 1 of each year, commencing on March 1, 1998. The notes are due September 1, 2007. The proceeds were used to refinance existing short-term indebtedness.     In December 1997, the Company issued $4.0 million in medium-term  notes under the remaining $150.0 million of the Registration  Statement. An additional $45.0 million of medium-term  notes were issued in January 1998.  Tandy's  medium-term notes  outstanding  at December  31, 1997 under the current and  previous  shelf registrations  totaled $30.0  million  compared to $54.5 million at December 31, 1996. The interest rates at December 31, 1997 for the outstanding  $30.0 million in  medium-term  notes  ranged from 6.31% to 8.63%,  with the  weighted  average coupon rates being 8.2% and 8.5% at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.     Management  believes that the Company's present borrowing capacity is greater than the established  credit lines and long-term debt in place.  Management also believes that the Company's cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents and its available  borrowing  facilities  are more than adequate to fund planned store expansion,  to meet debt service and dividend requirements and to fund its share repurchase program.  INFLATION    Inflation  has not  significantly  impacted  the Company  over the past three years.  Management  does not expect  inflation to have a  significant  impact on operations in the  foreseeable  future unless  global  situations  substantially affect the world economy.  RELATIONS WITH INTERTAN    InterTAN,  the former  foreign  retail  operations of Tandy,  was spun off to Tandy  stockholders  as a tax-free  dividend in fiscal 1987.  Summarized  in the tables below are the notes and other  receivables  due from InterTAN at December 31, 1997 and 1996, as well as the income  components  generated from  operations relative to InterTAN for each of the three years ended  December 31, 1997,  1996 and 1995.

("Trans World"), a subsidiary of  Tandy,  reached  an  agreement  with  InterTAN's  banking  syndicate  to buy approximately  $42.0  million of  InterTAN's  debt at a  negotiated,  discounted price. The debt purchased from the banks was restructured into a seven-year note with  interest  of 8.64%  (the  "Series  A" note).  Trans  World  also  provided approximately  $10.0  million in working  capital and trade  credit to InterTAN. Interest  on the  working  capital  loan (the  "Series B" note) of 8.11% was due semiannually  beginning  February  25,  1994  until the note was paid in full in 1996. On December 30, 1997,  InterTAN  repaid the gross amount of the "Series A" note in full.  In  consideration  for the  extension of credit,  Trans World had received  five-year warrants  exercisable for approximately  1,450,000 shares of InterTAN  common stock.  The warrants were returned to InterTAN in December 1997 upon  repayment of the "Series A" note.  Due to the  repayment of the "Series A" note in 1997,  the Company  will no longer  receive  interest  income or have an accretion  of discount  from  InterTAN.  The Company  recognized  a gain of $4.7 million upon retirement of the "Series A" note.     Under the terms of a merchandise  agreement  reached with InterTAN in October 1993, as amended, InterTAN may purchase, on payment terms, certain products sold or secured by Tandy. A&A International,  Inc. ("A&A"), a subsidiary of Tandy, is and will continue to be the exclusive  purchasing agent for products originating in Asia for InterTAN.  A&A receives commission income for this service.  License agreements,  as amended, also provide a royalty payable to Tandy, which began in the September 1995 quarter.  YEAR 2000    The Company's  management  recognizes  the need to ensure its  operations and relationships  with  vendors  and  other  third  parties  will not be  adversely impacted by software  processing errors arising from calculations using the year 2000 and beyond ("Year  2000").  Like many  companies,  a significant  number of Tandy's computer applications and systems require modification over the next two years in order to render these systems compliant with the Year 2000.     Tandy is using a combination of internal and external resources to assess and make the  needed  changes  to its many  different  information  systems  such as mainframe applications and communications systems, among others. Since beginning the  project  in  1995,  the  Company  has  modified,  or is in the  process  of modifying,  over 50% of the specialized  software programs used in the Company's business.  The  remaining  programs are expected to be modified and completed in 1998 and early 1999. Management  anticipates total expenditures  associated with the Year 2000  internal  modifications  to range from $8.0 to $12.0 million over the  life  of  the  project.   As  required  by  generally  accepted  accounting principles, these costs are expensed as incurred.     Additionally,  in the normal course of business, the Company has made capital investments in certain third party software systems and  applications  purchased to address the retail and  operational  needs of the  business.  These  systems, which include a new point-of-sale  system and financial reporting system,  among others,  have been  certified as Year 2000  compliant by the vendors and will be installed prior to 2000.     The  Company  has,  and will  continue  to  communicate  with its  suppliers, financial institutions and others with which it does business to coordinate Year 2000  conversions.  Progress  reports  on the Year 2000  project  are  presented periodically to the Company's Board of Directors.     Although  there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete all of the modifications in the required time frame, or that the Company will be able to identify all Year 2000 issues before problems  manifest  themselves;  in management's opinion, the Company is taking adequate action to address Year 2000 issues and does not expect the financial  impact of being Year 2000 compliant to be  material  to the  Company's  consolidated  financial  position,  results  of operations or cash flows.
