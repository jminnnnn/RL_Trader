ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS ("MD&A").  FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS Matters discussed in MD&A include forward-looking  statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. This includes statements concerning management's plans and  objectives  relating to our  operations or economic  performance  and related assumptions.  Forward-looking  statements are made based on management's expectations  and beliefs  concerning  future events and,  therefore,  involve a number of risks and  uncertainties.  Management  cautions  that  forward-looking statements are not guarantees  and actual results could differ  materially  from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.  Important factors that could cause our actual  results of  operations  or  financial  condition to differ include, but are not necessarily limited to:  o    changes in national or regional U.S. economic  conditions,  including,  but      not limited to, recessionary trends, consumer credit availability, interest      rates,  inflation,  consumers'  disposable income and spending levels,  job      security and unemployment, and overall consumer confidence; o    continuing  terrorist  activities  in the  U.S.,  as well as the  resulting      international war on terrorism; o    the disruption of nationwide or regional transportation systems; o    changes  in the  amount  and  degree of  promotional  intensity  exerted by      current  competitors and potential new competition  from both retail stores      and alternative  methods or channels of  distribution,  such as e-commerce,      telephone shopping services and mail order; o    the inability to successfully execute our strategic initiatives,  including      our strategic  business units and emerging sales  channels,  as well as new      alliances  which may be formed with other retailers and third party service      providers; o    the presence or absence of new services or products and product features in      the  merchandise  categories we sell and  unexpected  changes in our actual      merchandise sales mix; o    the inability to maintain  profitable  contracts or execute  business plans      with providers of third party branded  products and with service  providers      relating  to  cellular  and  PCS  telephones  and  direct-to-home   ("DTH")      satellite programming; o    the inability to collect the level of anticipated residual income, consumer      acquisition  fees and rebates for products and third party services offered      by us; o    the inability to successfully  maintain our strategic alliances,  including      those with Compaq,  DIRECTV, DISH Network,  Microsoft,  RCA, Sprint, and/or      Verizon Wireless; o    the lack of availability or access to sources of inventory; o    changes in  the financial  markets that would reduce or eliminate access to      longer term capital or short-term credit availability; o    the inability to attract, retain and grow an effective management team in a      dynamic  environment or changes in the cost or  availability  of a suitable      work force to manage and support our service-driven operating strategies; o    the imposition of new  restrictions  or  regulations  regarding the sale of      products  and/or  services we sell or changes in tax rules and  regulations      applicable to us; o    the  adoption  rate and market  demand for  high-speed  Internet  and other      Internet-related  services;  or o    the  occurrence of severe  weather  events which  prohibit  consumers  from      travelling  to our retail  locations,  especially  during  the peak  winter      holiday season.    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of our  consolidated  financial  statements  requires us to make estimates  that affect the reported value of assets,  liabilities,  revenues and expenses.  Our estimates are based on  historical  experience  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,  the results of which  form the  basis  for our  conclusions.  We  continually  evaluate  the information  used to make  these  estimates  as our  business  and the  economic environment  changes. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements,  but the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are as follows:  Revenue  Recognition - Revenue is recognized when product  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,  net of an estimate for returned  goods. We sell certain  products,  such as wireless phones and satellite systems that customers need in order to use the services of our strategic partners.  In most cases, our strategic  partner  will pay us a fee or  commission  for  obtaining  their  new customer,  as well as a  recurring  monthly  residual  which is a portion of the customer's monthly fee with our strategic partner.  Both the fee and the monthly residual are recorded as revenue.  To determine  the proper amount of revenue to record, we evaluate the contract terms, historical results and trends of service provider customer deactivations, non-activations and special pricing agreements, as well as any promotions or other  incentives.  In addition to determining  the proper amount to record,  we must also determine the appropriate  classification within the financial statements.  Different revenues would have been recorded if we had made different assumptions or evaluations.  Receivables - We record  receivables  based on the amount of revenue  recognized for a particular transaction. Our receivables are primarily comprised of amounts due from strategic partners,  commercial customers and  dealer/franchisees.  The carrying  amount  of the  receivables  is  continually  evaluated  based  on the likelihood of collection.  An allowance for doubtful accounts is established for estimated  losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Factors such as customer  creditworthiness,  payment terms, historical results and economic conditions are considered when making these decisions.  The actual collection of receivables could be different from our recorded value.  Inventory - Inventory  is our largest  asset class.  Our  inventory is primarily comprised of finished goods and is recorded at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method.  We make estimates  regarding the carrying value of our inventory on an item-by-item  basis. If the amount we expect to receive from the sale of the  inventory  is less  than its  cost,  we write  down the cost of the inventory to its realizable  value.  If actual market  conditions at the time of sale are less favorable than expected,  additional inventory  write-downs may be required.  Accruals - The amount of  liability  we record  for  claims  such as  insurance, warranty and pending  litigation  claims requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We use our past history and experience,  as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims in evaluating the amount of liability that we should record.  Actual results may be different from these estimates.  Income Taxes - We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions, including the U.S., states and localities,  and abroad. We must first determine which revenues and  expenses  should be  included  in each taxing  jurisdiction.  This  process involves the  estimation of our actual  current tax exposure,  together with the assessment of temporary  differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting  purposes.  These differences in the timing of deductions result in deferred tax assets and  liabilities  that are recorded on our balance sheet.  If different  judgments had been used, our tax liability could have been different.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  2001 COMPARED WITH 2000 - -----------------------  NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES  Sales decreased  slightly to $4,775.7  million in 2001 from $4,794.7  million in 2000.  This  decrease  was  primarily  the  result of a decline  in sales to our dealer/franchise  outlets  in 2001,  partially  offset by a slight  increase  in comparable  company-owned  store sales and the opening of 18 new stores,  net of store closures. We expect a comparable store sales gain for 2002.  During 2001, we reorganized  our marketing and  merchandising  departments  into three product groups which we call Strategic Business Units ("SBU").  These SBUs relate  to  our  position  of  "Connecting   People,"  "Connecting  Places"  and "Connecting  Things"  in  the  consumer  electronics  marketplace.   A  detailed explanation of each unit is provided below. Each SBU is responsible for specific products  and  third  party  relationships.  These  SBUs  work  with  our  brand management,  sales channels and support groups,  which together allow RadioShack to  target  the  right  customer  through  the  right  sales  channel  with  the appropriate support.  Each SBU is designed to find more  efficient  and  convenient  ways to serve our sales  channels.  In  addition  to our  5,127  company-owned  stores  and  2,119 dealer/franchise  outlets,  our existing and emerging sales channels include the www.radioshack.com  Web site and catalog operations,  as well as a sophisticated outbound and inbound telephone call center.  The  Connecting  People  SBU  consists  of  the  wireless  communication,  wired communication and radio communication  departments.  The wireless  communication department  includes  products such as wireless  handsets and cigarette  lighter adapters,  in addition to prepaid  wireless refill  services and residuals.  The wired  communication  products department includes products like cordless phones and phone cords,  plus prepaid long distance cards.  Products such as FRS radios and  scanners  are part of the radio  communication  department.  Our  strategic alliances for the Connecting People SBU include both Sprint and Verizon.   The Connecting Places SBU has two departments, home entertainment and computers. The home entertainment department includes audio and video products and services such as DTH  satellite  systems,  residuals,  installation  services,  DVDs  and accessories.   The  computer   department   includes   personal   computers  and accessories,  hand-held  computers,  Internet devices and services.  This SBU is responsible  for our strategic  alliances  with Compaq,  DIRECTV,  DISH Network, Microsoft and Thomson.  The  Connecting  Things SBU includes the  accessories,  batteries  and technical departments,  as well as the personal  electronics,  seasonal and portable audio departments.  Products  include AC and DC power  adapters,  general  and special purpose batteries,  wire and connectors,  toys and radio control cars, giftables and personal portable audio.  The following  table  summarizes  our new retail sales  breakdown by SBU and SBU departments as a percent of total retail sales (excluding outside sales from our retail support operations):                                        Percent of RadioShack Retail Sales                                             Year Ended December 31,                                 ------------------------------------------------                                      2001             2000             1999                                 --------------   --------------   -------------- Connecting People   Wireless communication             27.4%            24.5%            24.7%   Wired communication                 8.2              9.0             10.5   Radio communication                 2.9              3.2              4.2                                 --------------   --------------   --------------                                      38.5             36.7             39.4                                 --------------   --------------   -------------- Connecting Places   Home entertainment                 23.4             23.7             18.6   Computers                           9.8             11.8             11.3                                 --------------   --------------   --------------                                      33.2             35.5             29.9                                 --------------   --------------   -------------- Connecting Things   Accessories, batteries and    technical                         15.2             14.9             16.8   Personal electronics,    seasonal and portable audio       11.3             12.0             13.2                                 --------------   --------------   --------------                                      26.5             26.9             30.0                                 --------------   --------------   -------------- Service plans, repair and   other                               1.8              0.9              0.7                                 --------------   --------------   --------------                                     100.0%           100.0%           100.0%                                 ==============   ==============   ==============  Connecting People Strategic  Business Unit: Sales in the wireless  communication department,  which includes cellular and PCS telephones and accessories, as well as the  related  residuals  and prepaid  airtime  services,  increased  12.7% in dollars and  increased  to 27.4% of total  retail  sales in 2001,  from 24.5% in 2000. This sales increase was due to an increase in sales of wireless phones and accessories,  plus related  residuals,  offset somewhat by a decrease in prepaid wireless airtime. The wired communication department, which includes residential telephones,  answering machines and other related telephony products,  decreased 9.1% in dollars and  decreased as a percentage  of total retail sales to 8.2% in 2001 from 9.0% in 2000. The decrease in this department was primarily the result of  declining  sales of  residential  telephones,  and was  partially  offset by increased sales of telephone  accessories.  The radio  communication  department decreased 8.0% in dollars and decreased as a percentage of total retail sales to 2.9% in 2001,  from 3.2% in 2000. The decrease in this  department was primarily the result of a decrease in CB radio and scanner sales.  The  Connecting  People SBU is expected to increase sales for 2002, primarily driven by increases in the wireless communication department.  Connecting Places Strategic  Business Unit: The home  entertainment  department, which consists of all home audio and video  products,  including DTH satellites, installation  services  and  related  residuals,  decreased  1.0% in dollars and decreased  slightly as a percentage  of total retail sales to 23.4% in 2001 from 23.7% in 2000. This dollar decrease was primarily  attributable to a decrease in sales of satellite  dishes,  which was  partially  offset by increased  sales of video and cable accessories.  The computer  department,  which includes not only computers and related  accessories,  but narrow and broadband  connectivity,  as well as home automation and networking, decreased 16.5% in dollars and decreased as a percentage of total retail sales to 9.8% in 2001, from 11.8% in 2000. These decreases were primarily attributable to a 26% decline in unit sales of CPUs and an 11% decrease in the average  selling  price of CPUs from the prior year.  The  Connecting  Places SBU is expected to have a sales decrease for 2002,  primarily due to lower sales of computer CPUs and DTH satellite systems.  Connecting  Things  Strategic  Business  Unit:  The  accessories,  batteries and technical departments increased 2.2% in dollars and increased as a percentage of total retail sales to 15.2% in 2001,  from 14.9% in 2000.  These  increases were primarily due to increased sales of batteries and, to a lesser extent, increased AC adapter and wireless charger  accessories  sales.  The personal  electronics, seasonal and portable audio  departments  decreased 4.9% in dollars,  as well as decreasing  as a percentage of total retail sales to 11.3% in 2001 from 12.0% in 2000,  due primarily to decreased  sales of toys and  giftables.  The Connecting Things SBU is expected to have a sales  increase  in 2002,  primarily  driven by accessories, batteries and digital audio products.  GROSS PROFIT  2001 gross  profit  was  $2,296.8  million  or 48.1% of net sales and  operating revenues,  compared  with  $2,369.6  million or 49.4% of net sales and operating revenues in 2000. Gross profit for 2001 was reduced by a $26.2 million charge in the fourth  quarter for a write-down of  non-strategic  inventory  product lines which we intend to exit.  Excluding  this  charge,  gross profit would have been 48.6% of net sales and  operating  revenues.  The  decline  in the gross  profit percentage  from  49.4%  to  48.6%  was  due  to  a  decrease  in  the  wireless communication gross margin,  coupled with this department's increase in sales as a percent of total sales.  This gross profit decrease was partially  offset by a decrease in the total retail sales mix for the computer department,  which has a lower gross margin than our overall average gross margin, as well as an increase in the gross profit  percentage  for the  accessories,  batteries  and technical departments.  Management  anticipates that gross profit,  as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues,  will increase during 2002, when compared to 2001, enhanced by sales mix changes and an expected increase in residual income.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  The  table  below  summarizes  the  breakdown  of  various   components  of  our consolidated  selling,  general  and  administrative  ("SG&A")  expense  and its related percentage of total sales and operating revenues.

This 1.8 percentage  point increase in the SG&A  percentage  in 2001 was  primarily  attributable  to an increase in advertising expense during 2001, without  proportional sales growth. An increase in the rent expense in 2001 also contributed to the SG&A expense increase.   Payroll  expense  decreased  by $8.4  million  to  $740.3  million  in 2001  and decreased  as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues  to 15.5% in 2001, compared to 15.6% in 2000.  These decreases were due primarily to a reduction in our labor force during 2001 and reduced  incentive pay resulting from a decrease in operating  income.  Advertising  expense  increased  $26.8  million to $253.9 million  and  increased  to 5.3% as a  percentage  of net  sales  and  operating revenues in 2001, compared to $227.1 million and 4.7% of sales in 2000. Both the dollar and  percentage  point  increases  were due  primarily  to a decrease  in advertising  contributions  from our various alliance  partners and, to a lesser extent,  an increase in TV commercials.  Rent expense increased by $15.1 million to $230.3  million in 2001 and increased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to 4.8% in 2001 from 4.5% in 2000.  The rent increase was partially due to new company-owned store openings throughout the year, as well as the addition of the Cool Things @ Blockbuster test stores.  The relocation of existing stores to larger locations,  as well as a renewal of store leases at higher rates, also contributed to the rent expense  increase.  Bad debt expense  increased by $10.9 million to $14.5  million in 2001 and increased as a percentage of net sales and operating  revenues to 0.3% in 2001 from 0.1% in 2000. The bad debt increase was primarily related to both bankruptcies and uncollected accounts  receivable,  as well as a note receivable from  Digital:Convergence  Corporation.  Store closing costs of $7.6 million in 2001 relate to the closure of 35 underperforming stores prior to the  expiration  of their  leases.  In 2002,  we expect SG&A expense to increase slightly in dollars, but decrease slightly as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues due to increasing sales volume.  DEPRECIATION  Depreciation and amortization  expense  increased $1.0 million dollars to $108.3 million and increased as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues to 2.3% in 2001 from 2.2% in 2000. We expect  depreciation and  amortization  expense to decrease in 2002. This expected decrease is the result of the  sale-leaseback of our corporate  headquarters  and the January 1, 2002,  adoption of SFAS No. 142, "Accounting  for  Goodwill  and  Other  Intangible   Assets,"  which  eliminates amortization of goodwill.  LOSS ON SALE OF ASSETS  In the fourth  quarter of 2001,  we sold and leased  back most of our  corporate headquarters  at a loss of $44.8  million.  On June 22, 2001 we received  $123.6 million for the  settlement of the purchase  price and  settlement of the $136.0 million note which was received in  connection  with the sale of Computer  City, Inc. in 1998.  Thus,  we incurred an  additional  loss from the sale of Computer City, Inc. of $12.4 million.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  AmeriLink Corporation,  also known as RadioShack Installation Services ("RSIS"), was acquired in 1999 to provide us with  residential  installation  capabilities for the  technologies  and  services  offered  in our retail  stores.  Since its acquisition, RSIS has incurred operating losses and negative cash flows. In 2000 and in 2001, we attempted to  restructure  and  reorganize  RSIS, but due to the overall  slowdown  in the  economy  and the lag in the market for home  Internet connectivity  services,  RSIS  continued  to report  losses.  During  the fourth quarter of 2001,  we prepared a revised  analysis of its  estimated  future cash flows,  which indicated that its long-lived  assets were impaired.  The carrying value of RSIS's  long-lived  assets  (principally  goodwill  and  fixed  assets) exceeded the  discounted  present  value of the  estimated  future cash flows by approximately  $37.0  million.  An  impairment  of goodwill  for that amount was recorded and included in the accompanying 2001 Consolidated Statement of Income. The  remaining  balance of RSIS's  goodwill is $8.1  million,  which will now be subject to future impairment analyses.  Our   strategic   alliance   with   Blockbuster   to   introduce  a   RadioShack "store-within-a-store"  at Blockbuster locations did not provide sufficient cash flows to  recover  our  investment  in  fixtures  and  other  fixed  assets.  An impairment  loss of $2.8  million was  recorded  for those assets in 2001 and is included in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income.  EMPLOYEE SEPARATION AND OTHER COSTS  During  the third  quarter of 2001,  as part of our effort to control  operating costs, we incurred approximately $13.5 million in charges related to a reduction of our  labor  force,  primarily  for  early  retirements  and  involuntary  and voluntary  employee  severance.  In addition,  during the fourth  quarter,  $4.8 million in charges  were  incurred  relating to the  closure of RSIS's  national commercial  installation  business.  These  costs  are  primarily  comprised  of severance   costs,   write-offs   of  certain  fixed  assets  and  future  lease commitments.  Costs incurred which impact  continuing  activities  were excluded from this charge.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $37.8  million for 2001 versus $36.1 million for 2000.  Interest expense decreased to $50.8 million in 2001, from $53.9 million in 2000. This  decrease  was  primarily  the result of a  decrease  in the  average  debt outstanding  throughout  2001.  Interest  income  decreased  almost 27% to $13.0 million in 2001 from $17.8  million  in 2000,  due  primarily  to  repayment  of various notes  receivable  associated  with our exit of other retail  formats in previous years.  Interest income earned,  including  accretion of discount if applicable,  on the amounts  outstanding  during the three years ended  December 31, 2001,  2000 and 1999 was as follows:                                      Year Ended December 31,                           -------------------------------------------- (In millions)                 2001            2000            1999 - -------------             ------------    ------------    ------------ CompUSA                      $  6.1          $ 12.9          $ 12.9 Fry's                           0.2             0.9             2.9 Other (includes short- term investment interest)       6.7             4.0             4.6                           ------------    ------------    ------------ Total interest income        $ 13.0          $ 17.8          $ 20.4                           ============    ============    ============  Interest expense, net of interest income, is expected to be up during 2002, when compared to 2001.  PROVISION FOR LOSS ON INTERNET-RELATED INVESTMENT  During  the  second  quarter  of 2000,  we made a $30.0  million  investment  in Digital:Convergence  Corporation,  a privately-held Internet technology company. In the first quarter of 2001, we believed that our investment had  experienced a decline in value that, in our opinion, was other than temporary. This belief was due to the  uncertainty  surrounding  Digital:Convergence's  ability  to  secure sufficient  additional  funding or to complete an initial  public  offering.  As such, we recorded a loss provision equal to our initial investment.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  The provision for income taxes  reflects an effective tax rate of 42.8% for 2001 and 38.0% for 2000. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2001 is the result of the impairment of RSIS goodwill  discussed above, which is not deductible for tax purposes.  We anticipate  that the effective tax rate will be  approximately 38.0% in 2002.    2000 COMPARED WITH 1999 - -----------------------  NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES                                        Percent of RadioShack Retail Sales                                             Year Ended December 31,                                         ------------------------------                                             2000             1999                                         -------------    ------------- Communications                              27.9%            29.3% Electronic parts, accessories and   specialty equipment                       24.8             27.2 Audio and video                             22.5             17.1 Personal electronics and seasonal            8.6              9.4 Personal computers and peripherals           8.7              8.7 Services, residuals and other                7.5              8.3                                         -------------    -------------                                            100.0%           100.0%                                         =============    =============   Our overall  sales  increased  16.2% to $4,794.7  million in 2000 from  $4,126.2 million in 1999, due primarily to a 10.9% comparable  company-owned  store sales gain and the opening of 22 new stores,  net of store  closures.  The  comparable store sales  increase was due  primarily to  increased  sales of  communications products and sales of audio and video  equipment,  which  includes DTH satellite systems and services.  The  communications  category  decreased  1.4  percentage points  of total  retail  sales in 2000  primarily  due to the  audio  and video category becoming a larger percentage of total retail sales. Sales of electronic parts,  accessories and specialty  equipment  decreased 2.4 percentage points of total  retail  sales in 2000,  despite a 5% sales  gain.  Sales in the audio and video  category  increased 5.4  percentage  points in 2000, due primarily to the June 2000 launch of The RCA Digital  Entertainment  Center at  RadioShack  and a significant  increase  in DTH  satellite  system and  services  sales.  Personal electronics and seasonal products  decreased 0.8 percentage points of the retail sales  mix in  2000,  due  primarily  to an  overall  shift in the  product  mix described above. Sales of personal computers and peripherals were unchanged as a percent of the retail sales mix in 2000,  despite a 12% unit sales gain in CPUs, and had a 15% dollar  sales gain for the year.  Sales in the  services and other category,  which  includes  residual  income,  as well as  income  from  prepaid wireless airtime, repair services and extended service contracts,  decreased 0.8 percentage points as a percent of the retail sales mix in 2000. This increase in sales was  primarily  due to an increase in residual  income  received  from our third party providers of wireless communications,  offset by a decrease in sales of prepaid  wireless  airtime.  Sales in the  services and other  category  also decreased due to the reclassification of RadioShack.com sales from this category to the appropriate product categories in 2000. In 2000, we earned  approximately $104.0 million of residual income, compared to $63.0 million in 1999.  GROSS PROFIT  Gross profit was $2,369.6  million or 49.4% of net sales and operating  revenues in 2000,  compared  with  $2,083.5  million or 50.5% of net sales and  operating revenues in 1999. This gross profit  percentage  decrease was partially due to a shift within our product  offerings to  increased  sales of third party  branded audio and video products,  primarily DTH satellite  systems,  which have a lower gross margin than our overall gross margin. To a lesser degree, the gross profit percentage decrease was due to a decrease in the wireless  communications  gross margin. The decrease was further impacted by increased sales to dealer/franchise stores,  which  have a lower  gross  margin  percentage  than  sales  to  retail customers. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in residual income, which has 100%  gross  margin,  as well as by an  increase  in the gross  profit percentages  for both the  personal  computer and  peripherals  category and the parts, accessories and specialty equipment category.    SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  Our SG&A expense  increased  9.1%,  but  decreased as a percent of net sales and operating  revenues to 34.1% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 36.2% for the year ended December 31, 1999. This 2.1 percentage point decrease in the SG&A percentage  was due  primarily to the favorable  effect of our  increased  sales during 2000.  Payroll  expense  increased  by $54.8  million to $748.7  million  in 2000,  but decreased  as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues  to 15.6% in 2000, compared to 16.8% in 1999.  This dollar increase was due primarily to our retail store  expansions  and  increases in personnel,  commissions,  bonuses and other incentives  resulting  from  strong  comparable  store sales and  profits.  Rent expense  increased  in dollars by $9.7  million to $215.2  million in 2000,  but decreased as a percent of net sales and operating  revenues to 4.5% in 2000 from 5.0% in  1999.  The  rent  increase  was due  primarily  to new  store  openings throughout the year, as well as lease renewals at slightly higher rates. The 0.5 percentage point decrease was due primarily to the favorable effect of increased comparable  stores  sales on the expense  rate  structure.  Advertising  expense increased  $27.2 million in dollars,  but decreased as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues to $227.1 million and 4.7% of sales in 2000,  compared to $199.9 million and 4.8% of sales in 1999. The dollar  increase was due primarily to a shift in advertising from print to television advertising. In addition, the decrease as a  percentage  of sales and  operating  revenues  reflects the sales leverage gained from our sales increase.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $36.1  million for 2000 versus $16.8 million for 1999.  Interest expense increased to $53.9 million in 2000, from $37.2 million in 1999. This  increase  was  primarily  the result of an increase  in our  average  debt outstanding  throughout  2000,  due to share  repurchases  and our investment in inventory,  as well as to an increase in short-term interest rates when compared to the prior year. Interest income decreased almost 13% to $17.8 million in 2000 from  $20.4  million in 1999,  due  primarily  to  repayment  of  various  notes receivable associated with our liquidation of other retail formats.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  The provision for income taxes  reflects an effective tax rate of 38.0% for both 2000 and 1999.  IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued SFAS No. 142,  "Accounting for Goodwill  and  Other  Intangible  Assets"  ("FAS  142"),  in  July  2001,  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets.  FAS 142  became  effective  for all  fiscal  quarters  of fiscal  years beginning  after December 15, 2001.  Among other things,  FAS 142 eliminates the amortization  of  goodwill,  but  requires  an  annual  review  of the  possible impairment of goodwill. We adopted FAS 142 effective January 1, 2002.  The Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued SFAS No. 144,  "Accounting for the  Impairment  of  Long-Lived  Assets"  ("FAS 144"),  in October  2001,  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for impairment and disposition of long-lived assets (except  unidentifiable  intangibles),  including discontinued operations.  FAS 144 became  effective for all financial  statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning after December 15, 2001 and,  generally,  its provisions are to be applied  prospectively.  We adopted FAS 144 effective  January 1, 2002 and are analyzing the provisions, as they relate to our accounting policies. The impact, if any, of this adoption has not been determined at this time.  CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY                                               Year Ended December 31,                                 ------------------------------------------------ (In millions)                        2001             2000             1999 - -------------                   --------------   --------------   -------------- Operating activities              $  775.8         $  116.5         $  561.6 Investing activities                  (2.3)          (134.0)          (121.0) Financing activities                (502.8)           (16.4)          (340.5)  In 2001, cash flow provided by operating activities was $775.8 million, compared to $116.5 million and $561.6 million in 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  Cash flow from net income,  adjusted for non-cash items,  decreased $103.9 million in 2001 from 2000. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in operating  profit in    2001.  The  increase in cash flow from  operating  activities  was the result of $763.2  million of cash  provided  by  working  capital  components.  Changes in inventory  provided $213.9 million in cash in 2001,  compared to a use of $302.9 million in 2000, reflecting better inventory management.  Additionally,  changes in accounts  receivable,  consisting primarily of amounts due from our strategic partners, provided $165.8 million in cash during 2001, when compared to a use of $149.0  million  in the prior  year.  This  favorable  change  resulted  from an enhanced collection effort and improved receivables management.  Investing  activities  used $2.3  million  in cash in 2001,  compared  to $134.0 million  and  $121.0  million  used  in 2000  and  1999,  respectively.  Capital expenditures  approximated $139.2 million in 2001, compared to $119.6 million in 2000 and $102.4 million in 1999. Capital  expenditures for these years consisted primarily  of  our  retail  store   expansions  and  remodels  and  upgrades  of information  systems.  In addition,  in 2001 we  purchased  the land for our new corporate  headquarters  building.  We anticipate  that the capital  expenditure requirement for 2002 will  approximate  $130.0 million to $135.0 million.  These expenditures  will primarily  relate to our future store expansions and remodels and updated  information  systems.  On June 22, 2001, we received $123.6 million for the settlement of the purchase  price of Computer City,  Inc. and settlement of the $136.0 million CompUSA note.  Cash used by financing  activities was $502.8 million in 2001, compared to $16.4 million and $340.5 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Purchases of treasury stock  required cash of $308.3  million,  $400.6  million and $422.2  million in 2001,  2000 and  1999,  respectively.  (See  "Capital  Structure  and  Financial Condition" below for further information on our stock repurchase  programs.) The 2001, 2000 and 1999 stock  repurchases  were partially  funded by $53.7 million, $66.3  million  and  $81.5  million,  respectively,  received  from  the sale of treasury  stock to  employee  stock  plans  and  from  stock  option  exercises. Dividends  paid,  net of tax, in 2001,  2000 and 1999 amounted to $43.7 million, $44.7 million and $42.5 million, respectively. The increase in dividends paid in 2000  resulted  from an increase in the per share  dividend in 2000.  On July 6, 2001, we purchased all of Microsoft's  preferred units in RadioShack.com LLC for $88.0 million,  thereby eliminating the minority interest in RadioShack.com LLC. The long-term notes we issued in 2001 provided  approximately  $346.1 million in cash, the majority of which was used to repay short-term debt. Additionally,  in 1999 we received $100.6 million in cash from medium-term  notes; the majority of the proceeds was used to repay current maturities of long-term debt. However, in 2000 the increase in  short-term  debt was used  primarily to fund  increases in accounts receivable, stock repurchases and additional inventory.  Our free cash flow, defined as our cash flow from operations less dividends paid and capital  expenditures,  was $592.9  million in 2001,  compared to a negative free cash flow of $47.8  million in 2000 for the  reasons  described  above.  We expect free cash flow to be approximately $200.0 to $250.0 million in 2002.  CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Management  considers our financial  structure and condition  solid. At December 31, 2001, total  capitalization was $1,449.0 million,  which consisted of $670.9 million of debt and $778.1 million of equity.  This resulted in a  debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 46.3%. The prior year debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 47.0%. The decrease resulted from utilizing the strong cash flow during 2001 to reduce total debt by $110.6 million.  Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 39.0% at December 31, 2001, compared to 18.2% at December 31, 2000 and  23.9% at  December  31,  1999.  This  increase  in 2001 was due to the issuance of $350.0 million of 10-year 7 3/8% notes due May 15, 2011.  Our debt is considered  investment grade by the rating agencies. On November 16, 2001,  Fitch  reduced their ratings from A to A- and F1 to F2. All other ratings were unchanged during the year. Below are their latest ratings by category.                                                 Standard       Category                   Moody's      and Poor's      Fitch       --------                   -------      ----------      -----       Medium-term notes           Baa1            A-            A-       ESOP senior notes           Baa1            A-            A-       Commercial paper            P-2             A-2           F2  Our debt primarily  consists of  medium-term  notes and two issuances of 10-year long-term notes.  We  have  a  $300.0   million   Debt  Shelf   Registration   Statement   ("Shelf Registration")  which became effective in August 1997. In August 1997, we issued $150.0   million  of  10-year   unsecured   long-term   notes  under  the  Shelf Registration.  The interest  rate on the notes is 6.95% per annum with  interest payable on September 1 and March 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 1998. These notes are due September 1, 2007.    We also  issued, in  various  amounts  and on various  dates from  December 1997 through  September 1999, medium-term  notes  totaling  $150.0  million under the Shelf Registration. At December 31, 2001, $146.0 million of these notes remained outstanding. The interest rates at December 31, 2001, for the outstanding $146.0 million  medium-term notes ranged from 6.09% to 7.35% and had a weighted average coupon rate of 6.6%.  These notes  have  maturities  ranging from  2002 to 2008.  On May 11, 2001, we issued  $350.0  million of 10-year 7 3/8% notes in a private offering to initial purchasers who offered  the notes to qualified institutional buyers  by relying  upon SEC Rule 144A. The interest rate on the notes is 7.375% per annum with  interest payable on November 15 and May 15 of each year. Payment of interest on the notes commenced on November 15, 2001, and the notes mature on May 15, 2011. On  August 3, 2001, under the terms of an exchange offering filed with the SEC, we exchanged substantially all of these notes for a similar amount of  publicly  registered  notes.  The  net effect of  this  exchange was that no additional debt was issued on August 3, 2001, and substantially all of the notes are now publicly registered with the SEC.  During  the  third  quarter of 2001, we  entered into several interest rate swap agreements, with maturities ranging from 2004 to 2007, to manage our exposure to interest  rate  movements by  effectively  converting a portion of our long-term debt from  fixed to variable  rates.  The  notional  amount of the interest rate swaps subject to variable rates  is $150.0  million.  Under these agreements, we have contracted to pay a  variable rate  based upon  LIBOR and to  receive fixed rate payments ranging from 6.95% to 7.35%. We have  designated the agreements as fair value  hedging  instruments.  At December 31, 2001, we recorded an asset of $2.9  million (its fair value) for  the swap  agreements and  adjusted  the fair value of the related debt by the same amount. The effect of these agreements was a reduction in  interest  expense of $1.3 million  during 2001, when compared to the fixed rates. At current  interest rates, we  expect this favorable condition to occur  again in 2002.  We  entered into  these agreements to balance our debt portfolio  by  changing  from all fixed interest rates to a mixture of fixed and floating interest rates, thereby taking advantage of lower short-term rates.  From  time to time, we utilize short-term debt such as commercial paper issuance and  uncommitted  bank  loans to  supplement our short-term financing needs. The commercial  paper and  the short-term seasonal bank debt have a typical maturity of 90 days or less.  The amount of  commercial paper  that could  be outstanding during 2001 was  limited to a maximum  of $600.0  million.  Our commercial paper program is supported by our revolving credit facility, which is described below.  In  the second quarter of 2001, we  renewed our existing  $300.0 million 364-day revolving credit facility  and also extended the maturity date to June 2002. The terms of the 364-day  revolving credit facility remained similar to the previous facility. Our $300.0  million five-year  revolving credit facility maturing June 2003 did  not change.  The revolving  credit facilities  will support any future commercial  paper borrowings  and are otherwise  available for general corporate purposes.  Annual commitment  fees for  the facilities are  0.07% of  the $300.0 million  364-day facility  and 0.085% of  the $300.0 million multiyear facility, whether used or unused.  We  use  operating  leases,  primarily for  our  retail  locations, distribution centers and corporate headquarters, to lower our capital requirements. We do not have any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements.  Management  believes  that our  present  borrowing  capacity is greater than our established credit lines and long-term debt in place.  On  December 14, 2000, we announced  that our Board of  Directors had authorized management  to purchase up to 10.0  million  shares of our  common stock. During 2001, 9.3  million shares  were repurchased for $250.4 million. Additionally, on December 13, 2001,  we announced  that our Board  of Directors had expanded that existing  program to allow  management to purchase  up to 25.0 million shares of our common stock. The expanded program has no expiration date.  The purchases under the share repurchase program described above are in addition to  the  shares  required for employee stock purchase plans, which are purchased throughout  the  year.  Purchases  will continue  to be made in 2002 in the open market  with funding of the programs coming from  existing cash balances, excess free cash flow and short-term borrowings, if needed.  In the  fourth  quarter  of  2001,  we  announced  the  sale  of  our  corporate headquarters  building  and our plans to  construct a new  headquarters  in Fort Worth,  Texas. We entered into  sale-leaseback  agreements  whereby our existing corporate headquarters land and buildings were sold and leased back to us. These agreements provide us with the time necessary to arrange for the construction of the new facility.  Currently,  our plans are to finance the new corporate campus with an off-balance sheet operating lease arrangement. We believe that this type of structure,  when used as designed and in  moderation,  enables us to maintain  financial  flexibility and is appropriate.  Management recognizes that this type of  financing  is under  review and that the  structure  may  change,  making it uneconomical to execute and requiring us to record the new corporate  campus and related debt on our balance sheet.  We have explored  alternatives  in the event that changes occur and believe that we have a number of viable options available to finance our corporate headquarters facility.  The tables below, as well as the information contained in Note 7 - "Indebtedness and Borrowing  Facilities" to our financial  statements,  summarizes our various repayment requirements, interest rates and available credit lines.  The table below contains the  contractual  commitments  associated with our debt obligations, lease obligations, and marketing agreements.

Management does not expect inflation to have a significant  impact on operations in  the  foreseeable   future,   unless  global  or   geo-political   situations substantially affect the world economy.    ITEM 7a.   QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  At December 31, 2001, we did not have any derivative instruments that materially increased  our  exposure to market risks for interest  rates,  foreign  currency rates, commodity prices or other market price risks other than the interest rate swaps noted above. We do not use derivatives for speculative purposes.  Our exposure to market risks results from changes in short-term  interest rates. Interest  rate  risk  exists  principally  with  respect  to $150.0  million  of indebtedness,  which,  because of the interest rate swaps discussed in Note 2 of the financial  statements,  effectively  bears  interest at short-term  floating rates. In the future, an unfavorable  change of 100 basis points in the interest rate applicable to this  floating-rate  indebtedness  could result in additional interest expense of $1.5 million annually.  This assumption assumes no change in the principal or the incurring of additional indebtedness.  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
