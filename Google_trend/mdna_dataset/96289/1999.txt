Item 7  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Results of     Operations and Financial Condition" ("MD&A")). Prior to the sale, there were     101  Computer  City  stores  open,  including  seven  in  Canada.  Operating     primarily  as a  supercenter  format,  the average  store size  approximated     21,050 square feet in gross area and offered approximately 4,000 products in     its  merchandising  assortment,  including  personal  computer  hardware and     software and related  products and  accessories.  To complement its hardware     and software  sales,  Computer  City also offered such services as classroom     and on-site  training  for  widely-used  software  applications,  as well as     repair,  maintenance,  custom  configuration,  diagnostic testing,  computer     upgrades and other  technical  services on all major brands of computers and     related products.      Incredible Universe.  In December 1996, the Company announced its  intent to     exit the Incredible Universe business. All Incredible Universe  stores  were     closed  or  sold  by  the  end  of  1997.  See   "Provisions  for   Business     Restructuring and Asset Impairment" in MD&A for further discussion.  Supporting the retail operations is an extensive infrastructure that includes:      A&A International, Inc.("A&A") - This wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company     serves the wide-ranging international import/export,  sourcing,  evaluation,     logistics  and  quality  control  needs of the  Company.  A&A also  provides     services for outside customers, primarily InterTAN, Inc. ("InterTAN").  Most     of A&A's activity for InterTAN involves sourcing of goods from manufacturers     in Asia.      Consumer   Electronics   Manufacturing   -  The   Company   operates   seven     manufacturing facilities in the United States and one overseas manufacturing     operation  in China,  which is a joint  venture.  These eight  manufacturing     facilities  employed  approximately 3,400 employees as of December 31, 1998.     The Company  manufactures  a variety of  products,  primarily  sold  through     RadioShack,  including audio,  video,  telephony,  antennas,  wire and cable     products and a wide variety of "hard to find" parts for consumer  electronic     products.      Tandy Service Centers-The Company maintains a service and support network to     service the consumer  electronics  and personal  computer retail industry in     the U.S. At December 31, 1998,  there were 53 Tandy  Service  Centers in the     U.S. which  repaired  name-brand and private label products sold through the     Company's retail distribution  channels.  The Company is a vendor-authorized     service provider for such leading  manufacturers as Compaq, Sony, Panasonic,     Hitachi,  Hewlett-Packard,  RCA/Thomson  and Nokia,  among others,  and also     performs  repairs for third-party  service centers and extended service plan     providers under national service agreements.      Regional  Distribution Centers - The 11 distribution centers operated by the     Company  ship over one million  cartons each month to the  Company's  retail     outlets.      Tandy Transportation, Inc.-A large fleet of tractors and trailers transports     merchandise from  manufacturers or ports of entry to the Company's  regional     distribution centers and local distribution  facilities and also delivers to     the Company's retail outlets.      Tandy Customer Support - Using state-of-the-art telephone and data networks,     Tandy Customer Support responds to more than five million calls annually for     answers to technical questions, customer service inquiries, and direct sales     related to RadioShack's catalog operations,  the Internet and "hard to find"     products offered through its RadioShack Unlimited program.  SEASONALITY As is the case with other retail  businesses,  the Company's net sales and other revenues are greater  during the  Christmas  season than during other periods of the year. There is a corresponding  pre-seasonal  inventory  build-up  requiring working capital associated with the anticipated increased sales volume. See Note 24 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for quarterly data.  PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS Tandy owns or is licensed to use many trademarks  related to its business in the United States and in foreign  countries.  Radio Shack,  RadioShack,  Optimus and You've Got Questions.  We've Got Answers.  are some of the registered marks most widely used by the Company.  Tandy believes that the RadioShack name and mark is well-recognized  by consumers,  and that the name and mark are associated with a high-quality  service  provider.  The Company's  manufactured  products are sold primarily  under the RadioShack and Optimus  trademarks  which are registered in the U.S. and many foreign countries. Tandy also owns various patents relating to retail and support  functions and various  products  which Tandy has  previously designed and continues to manufacture. The Company believes that the loss of the RadioShack name and RadioShack trademarks would be material to its business, but does not believe that the loss of any other marks would be material.  SUPPLIERS The Company  obtains  merchandise  from a large number of  suppliers  located in various  parts of the  world.  Alternative  sources  of  supply  exist  for most merchandise and raw materials purchased by the Company. As the Company's product line is diverse,  the  Company  would not expect a lack of  availability  of any single  product or raw  material  to have a material  impact on its  operations. Management  does not  believe  that the loss of any one  supplier  would  have a material impact on its operations.  BACKLOG ORDERS The Company has no material backlog of orders for the products it sells.  COMPETITION The consumer  electronics retail business remains highly competitive,  driven by technology and product cycles,  as well as the overall state of the economy.  In the consumer electronics retailing business,  competitive factors include price, product  quality,  product  features,   consumer  services,   manufacturing  and distribution  capability and brand reputation.  The Company competes in the sale of its products and services with department stores, mail order houses, discount stores,  general  merchants  and gift  stores  which  sell  comparable  products manufactured by others.  Competitors  range in size from local drug and hardware stores to large chains and department stores.  Consumer  electronics  mail-order companies  also  compete  with the  Company  as do a number of  competitors  via on-line commerce on the Internet.  The products which compete with those sold by the Company are  manufactured  by numerous  domestic and foreign  manufacturers. Many of these products carry nationally recognized brand names or private labels and are sold in markets common to the Company. Some of the Company's competitors have financial resources equal to or greater than the Company's resources.  Management believes that many factors are important to its competitive position, including  price,  quality,  service and the broad  selection of electronic  and telecommunications  products carried at conveniently  located  RadioShack retail outlets.  RadioShack's strategic alliances with well-recognized partners such as Sprint Communications  Company,  Compaq Computer Corporation and DirecTV,  among others,  allow the  Company to leverage  name brand  recognition  and  marketing efforts  and   advertising   campaigns  as  well  as  to  create   cross-revenue opportunities  such as repair service  income,  customer  residuals and cellular commissions.  The Company's  utilization of trained personnel and its ability to use national and local  advertising media are important to the Company's ability to compete in the consumer  electronics  marketplace.  Management of the Company believes  it is a  strong  competitor  with  respect  to  each  of  the  factors referenced  above.   Given  the  highly   competitive  nature  of  the  consumer electronics  retail  business,  no assurance  can be given that the Company will continue to compete  successfully with respect to each of the factors referenced above.  Also, in light of the  ever-changing  nature of the  electronics  retail industry,  the Company would be adversely  affected if its  competitors  were to offer their  products at  significantly  lower prices,  introduce  innovative or technologically  superior  products  not yet  available to the Company or if the Company were unable to obtain products in a timely manner for an extended period of time.  In 1998, Tandy operated two retailing formats:  RadioShack and, until August 31, 1998,  Computer City.  Each of the Company's  retailing  formats used a distinct path  to  the  marketplace,  based  on its  unique  customer  appeal,  marketing strengths and margin structure:     RadioShack: RadioShack stores offer the shopping convenience of approximately    7,000  company-owned  and  dealer/franchise  stores  which offer high quality    branded and private label computer,  telephony and  electronics  products and    parts, unique selection, repair services, knowledgeable personnel, convenient    credit   options   and   excellent    customer    service,    including   its    "service-oriented"  approach.  In  addition  to  providing  enhanced  product    explanation,  specially  trained  sales staff assist  customers  with service    activation,  where  applicable,  and  selection of  appropriate  accessories.    RadioShack has formed strategic  relationships  with key vendors in computers    (Compaq),  "direct-to-home"  satellite (RCA,  PrimeStar,  DirecTV, and USSB),    telecommunications  (Sprint)  and  wireless  communications  (Sprint  PCS) to    augment  the strong  position  that it has  historically  maintained  in core    product categories such as batteries,  communications equipment,  telephones,    antennas and electronic components, and parts and accessories.     Computer City, Inc.: This subsidiary operated 101 stores prior to the sale to    CompUSA.  Computer City stores  offered  approximately  4,000  different name    brand items,  competitive  prices and excellent  customer service on personal    computer  hardware  and  software,  as  well  as  accessories,  printers  and    peripherals.  The stores averaged  approximately 21,050 square feet. Although    retail sales were the largest  component  of Computer  City's  business,  its    stores also fulfilled other  functions,  including direct sales to corporate,    government  and  education  customers,  as  well  as  software  training  and    technical services.  See "Segment  Reporting  Disclosures"  in MD&A for 1998, 1997 and 1996 net sales and  operating  revenues,   operating  profit  (loss)  and  capital  assets  for RadioShack and Computer City.  EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 1998, the Company had approximately  38,200  employees.  That number included  approximately  6,500 temporary  retail employees who were hired for the Christmas selling season. None of the Company's employees are covered by collective   bargaining  agreements  nor  are  they  members  of  labor  unions. Management of the Company  considers its  relationship  with its employees to be good.  ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. Information on the Company's  properties is in MD&A and the financial statements included  in this  Form  10-K  and is  incorporated  herein  by  reference.  The following items are discussed further on the referenced pages:                                                    Page Retail Outlets...............................      12 Property, Plant and Equipment................      45 Leases.......................................      48  The Company leases, rather than owns, most of its retail facilities.  RadioShack stores are located primarily in major shopping malls,  stand-alone  buildings or shopping centers owned by other entities.  The Company owns most of the property on which its executive  offices are located in downtown Fort Worth,  Texas,  all distribution  centers,  except  for  two  which  are  leased,  and  most  of its manufacturing   facilities  located  throughout  the  United  States.  A&A,  the Company's import/export  subsidiary,  leases eight administrative offices in the Asia  Pacific  region.  Existing  warehouse  and  office  facilities  are deemed adequate to meet the Company's needs in the foreseeable future.      ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. Tandy has various claims, lawsuits, disputes with third parties,  investigations and pending  actions  involving  allegations  of  negligence,  product  defects, discrimination,  infringement of intellectual property rights, tax deficiencies, violations  of permits or  licenses,  and breach of contract  and other  matters against the  Company  and its  subsidiaries  incident  to the  operation  of its business.  The  liability,  if  any,  associated  with  these  matters  was  not determinable at December 31, 1998.  Although  occasional adverse  settlements or resolutions may occur and negatively  impact earnings in the year of settlement, it is the opinion of management  that their ultimate  resolution will not have a materially adverse effect on Tandy's financial position.  ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS. No  matters  were  submitted  to a vote of  security  holders  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1998.

MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS  AND         FINANCIAL CONDITION ("MD&A").  FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS With the  exception of  historical  information,  the matters  discussed in MD&A contain forward-looking  statements that involve various risks and uncertainties and are  indicated  by  words  such  as  "anticipates",  "expects",  "believes", "plans",  "could", and similar words and phrases. Factors that could cause Tandy Corporation's  ("Tandy" or the "Company")  actual  results to differ  materially from management's  projections,  forecasts,  estimates and expectations include, but are not limited to, the following:  o   changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity exerted by current     competitors  and  potential  new  competition  from both  retail  stores and     alternative  methods or channels of  distribution,  such as  electronic  and     telephone shopping services and mail order; o   changes in general U.S. or regional U.S. economic conditions  including, but     not limited to, consumer credit  availability,  interest  rates,  inflation,     personal  discretionary  spending  levels  and  consumer sentiment about the     economy in general; o   the  presence  or  absence  of  new  products  or  product  features  in the     merchandise categories the Company sells and changes in the Company's actual     merchandise sales mix; o   the inability to negotiate profitable contracts with service providers; o   the inability to collect the level of anticipated residuals and  commissions     for products and services sold by the Company's RadioShack division; o   lack of  availability  or access to sources of supply  inventory (as a large     importer  of  consumer  electronic  products  from Asia,  unfavorable  trade     imbalances could negatively affect the Company); o   the inability to retain and grow an effective  management  team in a dynamic     environment or changes in the cost or  availability of a suitable work force     to manage and support the Company's service-driven operating strategies; o   the potential negative impact of Year 2000 issues; or o   the  imposition of new  restrictions  or  regulations  regarding the sale of     products  and/or  services  the  Company  sells,  changes  in tax  rules and     regulations applicable to the Company.  Additionally, as a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the deregulated telecommunications  market  will  continue  to present  both  opportunities  and increased  competition  for the  provision of  telecommunication  equipment  and services to consumers.  STOCK SPLIT On August 21, 1997,  the  Company's  Board of Directors  declared a  two-for-one split of Tandy common stock,  payable on September 22, 1997.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  CALENDAR 1998 COMPARED WITH CALENDAR 1997 - -----------------------------------------  NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES  Consolidated  net sales and  operating  revenues  decreased  10.9% from $5,372.2 million in 1997 to $4,787.9  million in 1998;  this  decrease  was  attributable primarily  to the  sale  of  Computer  City  to  CompUSA  on  August  31,  1998. Consolidated comparable store sales for 1998 are not meaningful, due to the sale of Computer City.  RadioShack Segment - ------------------  Sales for the RadioShack segment in 1998 increased 8.7% to $3,591.2 million from $3,303.9  million in 1997, due primarily to a 7.4%  comparable  store sales gain and the opening of 67 new stores, net of store closures. RadioShack's comparable store  sales  increase  was driven  primarily  by  increased  sales of  wireless communication and telephony  products and services.  A continued healthy economy and a strong retail  consumer  electronics  industry are expected to result in a comparable   store  sales  gain  for  1999.  The  following   table   summarizes RadioShack's  retail  sales  breakdown  by class of products and each class as a percent of total RadioShack  retail sales  (excluding  outside sales from retail support operations):                                            Percent of RadioShack Retail Sales                                                Year Ended December 31,                                        ----------------------------------------- Class of Products                       1998            1997             1996 - -----------------                     --------        --------         -------- Electronic parts, accessories  and specialty equipment(1)               30.0%           31.5%            32.3% Communications                            28.5            27.5             24.4 Audio and video                           15.5            16.8             18.0 Personal electronics and seasonal         10.4            11.6             12.4 Personal computers and peripherals(1)      9.1             9.4             10.4 Services and other(2)                      6.5             3.2              2.5                                       --------        --------         --------                                          100.0%          100.0%           100.0%                                       ========        ========         ========  (1) Computer  accessories  have been  reclassified  in the prior  years from the     personal   computers  category  to  the  electronic  parts  and  accessories     category. (2) Includes  residuals,  prepaid wireless  airtime,  repair income and extended     service contracts.  Electronic  parts,  accessories  and specialty  equipment,  the largest  product category of RadioShack's  retail sales mix,  decreased 1.5 percentage  points in 1998 when  compared  to 1997,  despite a 4.1%  increase  in dollar  sales.  This decrease as a percent of retail sales was  primarily  due to the  communications and services categories becoming a higher percent of the product mix in 1998.  The  communications  category  increased  to 28.5% of retail sales from 27.5% in 1997.  Dollar  sales of the  category  increased  13.2%  over  last  year.  This category,  which  includes  wireless  communications  such as  cellular  and PCS telephones,  as well as residential telephones,  answering machines,  pagers and other related telephony products,  continues to benefit from the Sprint Store at RadioShack  launched in  September  1997.  This  "store-within-a-store"  concept provides  customers  with access to a full  service  communications  center that offers, where available, Sprint local and long-distance telephone service, Spree SM prepaid phone cards and Sprint branded residential telephones.  Additionally, RadioShack  earns  commissions from cellular  carriers for activating  customers with cellular services. Sales of communication products are expected to continue to grow in 1999.  Sales of audio and video products declined to 15.5% of retail sales in 1998 from 16.8% of retail sales in 1997, primarily due to the overall shift in the product mix to communications and services. Sales dollars were flat from the prior year, due in part to RadioShack's limited selection of name brand products. RadioShack plans to announce a strategic  alliance with a  well-recognized  audio and video manufacturer  in the second quarter of 1999,  which  management  believes should improve  sales in this  category.  The audio and video  category  also  includes "direct-to-home" satellite sales, which includes digital satellite systems (DSS) and Primestar satellite television services. Sales of these systems and services increased significantly over the prior year.  Personal  electronics  and seasonal  products  decreased to 10.4% of  RadioShack retail sales in 1998 from 11.6% in 1997,  due  primarily to an overall  shift in the product mix to communications  and services.  The sales decreases since 1996 are also  attributable  to sales  declines in such items as boomboxes,  cassette products and toys,  other than remote control cars.  This trend is indicative of lower general consumer demand for these products.  In 1999,  RadioShack plans to expand its  marketing  efforts in this category by  advertising  gift items year round, as well as by offering a broader selection of products.  On February 25,  1998,  RadioShack  entered  into a multi-year  retail sales and service  agreement  with  Compaq  Computer  Corporation  ("Compaq").  Under this agreement,  Compaq became the sole supplier of personal  computers  sold through RadioShack  retail outlets via a  "store-within-a-store"  concept similar to the Sprint Store at RadioShack.  Despite a large unit gain and a 5.8% sales gain for this  category for 1998,  the personal  computer  category  decreased to 9.1% of RadioShack  retail  sales  in 1998  from  9.4%  in  1997.  RadioShack  computers experienced a 32% decline in the average 1998 selling price of desktop computers from the 1997 annual average selling price.  Aggressive  pricing  strategies put into place as RadioShack  transitioned  from IBM to Compaq branded computers and products  during the first six months of 1998 and general selling price declines in the  personal  computer  industry  contributed  to this  decline.  Management believes that the downward  trend in selling  prices of personal  computers will continue  in 1999,  but to a lesser  extent  than  seen in  1998.  Despite  this downward  trend,  RadioShack  believes  that the higher  unit  sales  volumes of personal  computers  will  contribute to increased  sales of higher gross margin products and services,  such as accessories and extended  service plans, as well as to  increased  customer  traffic  to the store.  Additionally,  in the fourth quarter of 1998,  RadioShack launched the Compaq  "Built-For-You"  program which enables  consumers  to  custom-configure  personal  computers  at  their  nearby RadioShack store with convenient direct shipment to their home, office or nearby RadioShack store.  Sales in the services and other  category,  which  includes  residuals,  prepaid wireless  airtime,  repair income and extended service  contracts,  increased in 1998 in dollars and as a percent of RadioShack  retail sales, due to an increase in  residual  income  received  from  RadioShack's   third  party  providers  of communication and "direct-to-home"  satellite products and services,  as well as to a large increase in sales of prepaid  wireless  airtime.  Residual  income is earned  on  sales  of  Sprint  long   distance  and  PCS   services,   sales  of "direct-to-home"  satellite programming and sales of other wireless products and services. Residuals vary by service provider, but are typically a portion of the continuing  service  revenue  throughout the ensuing months and/or years of that customer's subscription.  In 1998, RadioShack earned approximately $34.2 million of  residual  income,  compared  to $7.9  million  in 1997.  Residual  income is expected to continue to increase in 1999; however,  increases are dependent upon such factors as customers'  continued usage of certain services and stability of average revenue per subscriber,  among other factors.  Prepaid  wireless airtime sales are expected to continue to increase in 1999.  Computer City Segment - ---------------------  Computer City's overall sales  decreased 37.1% to $1,196.7  million in 1998 from 1997, due to the sale of this subsidiary to CompUSA on August 31, 1998.  For the  eight  months  ended  August  31,  1998,  sales of  personal  computers decreased  in dollars due to a  reduction  of  approximately  25% in the average selling  price of desktop and notebook  computers  from the same period in 1997. Additionally,  both overall and comparable stores sales were negatively impacted by the  announced  sale of Computer  City to CompUSA on June 22, 1998,  at which time Computer City took promotional  mark-downs to sell both its third-party and private-label inventory in preparation for the sale to CompUSA. See "Sale of Computer City, Inc." below.   GROSS PROFIT  Gross  profit for the  Company  was  $2,004.4  million or 41.9% of net sales and operating  revenues in 1998,  compared with $2,014.3  million or 37.5%, in 1997. This  increase  in gross  profit as a  percentage  of net  sales  and  operating revenues was primarily the result of RadioShack  sales  accounting  for a larger portion of the Company's  consolidated net sales and operating revenues in 1998, when  compared to 1997due to the sale of Computer  City to CompUSA on August 31, 1998. Computer City had an inherently lower gross margin than RadioShack.  RadioShack's  gross profit  increased in dollars for the year ended December 31, 1998 versus 1997, but decreased as a percentage of  RadioShack's  total sales by 0.6  percentage  points  over the same  period.  This  percentage  decrease  was primarily  due to a shift  within  RadioShack's  product  offerings to increased sales of prepaid wireless airtime,  which has a significantly lower gross margin than the overall  RadioShack  average gross margin.  This decrease was partially offset by an increase in residual  income which has close to 100% gross  margin. Gross  profit for  RadioShack  is expected to increase in dollars in 1999 due to expected  sales  volume  increases  in both  products  and  services,  including residual  income  and  sales of  prepaid  wireless  airtime.  Gross  profit as a percentage  of  RadioShack's  sales,  however,  is expected to decrease in 1999, similar to 1998, because of increased sales of prepaid wireless airtime.  Computer  City's  gross  profit  as a  percent  of  Computer  City net sales and operating  revenues  decreased 2.3 percentage points for the year ended December 31, 1998 when  compared to 1997.  This  decrease was primarily due to aggressive marketing  of  inventory,   especially   private-label  branded  inventory,   in preparation for the sale of the subsidiary.

The  Company's  SG&A expense was flat in dollars,  but increased as a percent of net sales and operating  revenues to 33.0% for the year ended  December 31, 1998 versus 29.4% for the year ended December 31, 1997. The higher SG&A percentage is due primarily to RadioShack becoming a larger percentage of Tandy's consolidated operations during 1998 (see "Gross Profit" above). RadioShack operates at higher relative SG&A expense  levels than  consolidated  Tandy  Corporation.  Excluding Computer City and closed units associated with the 1996 restructuring plan, SG&A expense  as a  percentage  of sales  would  have been  37.7% for the year  ended December 31, 1998 versus 38.9% for the year ended December 31, 1997.  Although  payroll and  commissions  expense for 1998 remained flat in dollars in comparison  with 1997,  this cost  increased  as a  percentage  of net sales and operating  revenues  from  13.7% in 1997 to  15.3%  in 1998,  due in part to the increase  in  RadioShack  sales as a  percentage  of  total  Company  sales  and operating revenues, as described above.  RadioShack has inherently higher salary expense  as  a  percentage  of  sales,  when  compared  to  consolidated   Tandy Corporation.  To a lesser extent,  payroll  expense was  negatively  impacted by higher payroll costs  associated with  infrastructure-building  at CCI, prior to its announced sale in June 1998.  Advertising  expense  increased both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating  revenues,  in the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1997.  This  increase  over the prior year is primarily attributable to increased advertising expense at Computer City in 1998, compared to 1997.  Somewhat offsetting this increase was a dollar decrease in advertising expense at RadioShack in 1998 from 1997. In 1997, however,  the marketing launch of the Sprint Store at RadioShack resulted in increased  advertising expense for that year. In 1999, advertising expense in dollars for RadioShack is expected to be comparable to or slightly more than 1998.  Rent expense decreased in dollars in comparison with 1997 and increased slightly as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues to 4.5% in 1998 from 4.1% in 1997.  This  increase is related to the sale of Computer  City,  which had lower rent expense as a percentage of sales than consolidated Tandy Corporation.  Rent expense in dollars for RadioShack  increased in 1998 compared to the prior year, but  decreased  slightly  as a percent of sales.  Rent  expense  in dollars  for RadioShack is expected to increase  slightly in 1999,  due to new store openings and lease renewals at slightly higher rates.  RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS  On February 1, 1997,  in an effort to reduce the  turnover  rate among its store managers and to align the store managers'  interests and goals with those of the shareholders,  the  Company  granted,  under  the  1993  Incentive  Stock  Plan, approximately 2,041,200 restricted stock awards consisting of 400 shares each to 4,907  RadioShack  store  managers and 800 shares each to 98 Computer City store managers.  The restricted  stock awards had a weighted average fair market value of $22.59 per share when  granted.  This  restricted  stock vested at the end of five years on February 2, 2002, if the Company  employed the managers at a store manager or higher position,  at that time. However, the grants provided that the restricted  shares could vest early if the Company's  common stock closed at $33 13/16 or more for any 20  consecutive  trading days after  February 1, 1999.  At December  31, 1998,  it was probable  that the  1,289,600  shares that  remained outstanding under this grant would vest under the early vesting provisions.  The resulting  charge to compensation  expense of $82.6 million,  including  related payroll taxes, was recorded in the December 31, 1998 financial statements.  Vesting of these  restricted  stock awards  occurred when the  Company's  common stock closed above the targeted amount for the twentieth consecutive trading day on March 1, 1999.  Vesting  resulted in the issuance of 1,272,000  shares of the Company's  common  stock  at a fair  market  value  of  $56.09  per  share.  The difference  between the December 31, 1998 accrual for  compensation  expense and the actual expense when vested will be recorded in the first quarter of 1999.  On February 1, 1998, the Company  granted,  under the 1997 Incentive Stock Plan, approximately  324,750  restricted stock awards consisting of 250 shares each to 1,299  RadioShack  store  managers  not  included in the  February 1, 1997 grant described  above. The restricted stock awards had a weighted average fair market value of $39.22 per share when granted.  This restricted  stock will vest at the end of five years on February 2, 2003, if the Company  employs the managers at a store manager or higher position, at that time. However, the grants provide that the restricted  shares could vest early if the Company's  common stock closes at $58 1/8 or more for any 20  consecutive  trading  days after  February  1, 2000. Compensation  expense,  equal to the fair market  value of the  shares,  will be recognized over the remaining  vesting period when it becomes  probable that the performance  criteria will be met or upon actual vesting.  At December 31, 1998, there were 222,000 restricted stock awards outstanding and eligible for ultimate vesting pursuant to this restricted stock award.  The  Company  does not plan to  continue  granting  restricted  stock  awards to RadioShack  store managers.  See "1999 Incentive Stock Plan" below regarding the February 1999 grant of stock options to RadioShack store managers.  SALE OF COMPUTER CITY, INC.  On June  22,  1998,  the  Company  announced  that it had  signed  a  definitive agreement with CompUSA for the sale of 100% of the  outstanding  common stock of the Company's Computer City, Inc.  subsidiary.  On August 31, 1998, the sale was completed.  The  Company  received  approximately  $36.5  million in cash and an unsecured  subordinated  note for $136.0 million as consideration  for the sale. The note, which is of equal priority with CompUSA's existing  subordinated debt, bears  interest  at 9.48%  per  annum  and is  payable  over a ten year  period. Interest  is payable  on June 30 and  December  31 of each year,  with the first payment  made on December 31,  1998.  Beginning on December 31, 2001,  principal payments will be due  semiannually  until the note matures on June 30, 2008. The Company  recognized a loss of $108.2 million from the sale of CCI in 1998, which included  certain  liabilities  and  contractual  obligations  incurred  by  the Company.  Although no  significant  additional  provisions  are expected in 1999 relating to the sale of CCI, unexpected contractual requirements associated with the  sale,  among  other  factors,  could  result  in  additional  charges.  The management of the Company  believes that the sale of CCI will enable it to focus exclusively on the growth potential of RadioShack.  Net sales and operating  revenues,  operating losses and restructuring and other charges for  Computer  City for each of the three  years  ended  December 31 are presented below:  (In millions)                             1998(1)       1997          1996 - ------------                            --------      --------      -------- Net sales and operating revenues        $1,196.7      $1,903.7      $1,721.6 Operating loss                             (95.6)        (14.9)        (20.3) Restructuring and other charges             --            --           (54.2)(2)  (1) Includes  operations  for only eight  months,  due to sale to CompUSA on     August 31,  1998.   (2) As  described  more fully in  "Provisions  for  Business  Restructuring  and     Asset Impairment" below, during the fourth  quarter of 1996 Tandy elected to     close 21   unprofitable  stores.   CCI  recognized  a  restructuring  charge     aggregating $14.8 million associated with these closings.The charges related     primarily to lease obligations and employee termination expenses.  CCI  also     recognized asset impairment charges aggregating   $18.7  million during 1996     and  lower  of  cost  or  market impairments aggregating approximately $20.7     million  related to inventory liquidated at the affected stores.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE  The  accompanying  table below  summarizes the breakdown of interest  income and interest expense:                                                    Year Ended December 31,                                                 ---------------------------------- (In millions)                                  1998         1997         1996    - -------------                                --------     --------     -------- Interest income:  Notes receivable                            $    7.8     $    8.7     $    9.3  IRS settlements and other interest income        3.0          4.5          3.7                                              --------     --------     --------    Total interest income                         10.8         13.2         13.0  Interest expense                                (45.4)       (46.1)       (36.4)                                              --------     --------     --------  Net interest expense                         $  (34.6)    $  (32.9)    $  (23.4)                                              ========     ========     ========  Net interest  expense was $34.6  million for 1998 versus $32.9 million for 1997. Interest expense decreased slightly during 1998, due to a corresponding decrease in the  Company's  average  debt  outstanding  during 1998 as well as to a small decrease in short-term interest rates for the year.  Interest  income  decreased in 1998 due to the repayment of the  InterTAN,  Inc. ("InterTAN")  note  receivable  on December 31, 1997.  On August 31, 1998,  the Company received a note from CompUSA for $136.0 million with an interest rate of 9.48% per annum. Interest income relating to the Fry's Electronics, Inc. and its affiliates ("Fry's") notes receivables resulted from the 1997 sale of assets and real estate of six Incredible Universe stores. At December 31, 1998, the Company held multiple notes receivable from Fry's totaling  approximately  $47.6 million (see "Provisions for Business Restructuring and Asset Impairment" below).  Assuming the existing  interest rate  environment  remains stable,  net interest expense is  expected to  decrease  during  1999,  primarily  due to  anticipated interest income of $12.9 million on the CompUSA note receivable.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  The  provision  for income  taxes  reflects an  effective  tax rate of 38.5% for fiscal years 1998 and 1997. The Company  expects the effective tax rate for 1999 to increase  slightly to 39.0%,  due  primarily to an increase in the  effective state tax rate, which results from a higher percentage of income being earned in states with higher tax rates.  CALENDAR 1997 COMPARED WITH CALENDAR 1996 - -----------------------------------------  NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES  Consolidated  net sales  and  operating  revenues  decreased  14.5% to  $5,372.2 million in 1997 from  $6,285.5  million in 1996,  attributable  to Tandy's store closure plan  announced in December  1996. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company showed a 2.0% comparable store sales increase over fiscal 1996.  RadioShack Segment - ------------------  Sales for the RadioShack segment in 1997 increased 4.5% to $3,303.9 million from $3,160.5  million  in 1996,  adjusted  for  stores  closed  under the 1996 store closure plan,  due to positive same store sales gains and the opening of 108 new stores,  net of RadioShack store closures.  RadioShack's  comparable store sales increase  was 1.9% for the year ended  December 31,  1997,  driven  primarily by increased  sales of wireless  communication  and  telephone  products.  Sales of electronic  parts,  accessories  and specialty  equipment,  the largest  product category of RadioShack's sales mix in 1997, remained relatively  consistent with the prior year; however, the category as a percentage of RadioShack retail sales decreased   as  sales  of   communications   products   increased   16.7%.   The communications category increased to 27.5% of RadioShack retail sales from 24.4% in 1996. This category benefited from the successful rollout of the Sprint Store at RadioShack in September 1997.  Sales of audio and video products  declined to 16.8% of retail sales in 1997 from 18.0% in 1996, due to lower  consumer  demand for these products and the heightened level of competition  within the industry. Offsetting  the decline in audio and video sales was a 7.0%  increase in 1997 of "direct-to-home" satellite system sales, despite a substantially reduced average selling price of digital satellite  systems.  Personal  electronics and seasonal products  decreased  to 11.6% of retail  sales in 1997 from  12.4% in 1996,  due primarily  to an overall  shift in the product mix to  communications.  Personal computer  sales  decreased  as a percentage  of total  retail  sales  despite an overall unit gain for 1997,  due to a 17.8% decrease in the average 1997 selling price on desktop  and  notebook  computers  from 1996.  The  services  and other category  increased in 1997 due to residual  income  received from  RadioShack's third party providers of communication and "direct-to-home"  satellite products, as well as an increase in income from prepaid wireless airtime.  Computer City Segment - ---------------------  Computer City's overall sales in 1997 increased  10.6% to $1,903.7  million from $1,721.6 million in 1996, adjusted for the 21 stores closed pursuant to the 1996 store closure plan.  Computer City's  comparable  store sales increased 2.2% for the year ended  December  31, 1997.  The overall  sales  increase was  primarily attributable  to positive  same store sales plus  revenues  generated  by 14 new stores  opened in 1996.  In stores  open at least  one year,  sales of  personal computers were up slightly in 1997 due to a significant increase in direct sales to corporate,  education and government  customers.  This increase was offset by the decrease in the annual average  selling price of retail  desktop  computers, which fell approximately  15.0% from the 1996 annual average selling price. To a lesser extent, a decrease in sales of non-DOS machines in 1997 also impacted the personal  computers sales increase.  Product  categories which experienced sales and unit increases in 1997 included  scanners,  which  benefited from both lower selling  prices  and  new  technology,  as  well  as  notebook  computers  which experienced  a large  increase in both sales  dollars  and unit sales.  Sales of software,  accessories  and supplies also  experienced  positive sales growth in 1997.  GROSS PROFIT  Gross  profit for the Company was  $2,014.3  million,  or 37.5% of net sales and operating revenues,  in 1997, compared with $2,022.4 million, or 32.2%, in 1996. This  increase  in gross  profit as a  percentage  of net  sales  and  operating revenues was  primarily  due to  RadioShack  sales  accounting  for 61.5% of the Company's  total sales and operating  revenues in fiscal year 1997,  compared to 50.3% in fiscal  year  1996;  this  occurred  as a result of the  closure of the Incredible Universe stores in early 1997 and, to a lesser extent, the closure of 21 Computer  City  stores at December  31,  1996.  Excluding  stores in the 1996 closure  plan and  excluding  the 1996  fourth  quarter  lower of cost or market inventory  impairment,  the slight decline in the Company's  gross profit margin from  38.8% in 1996 to  38.4%  in 1997  resulted  primarily  from the fact  that RadioShack's  1997  percentage  sales  increase  was less than  Computer  City's percentage sales increase. Computer City had inherently lower gross margins than RadioShack.  RadioShack's gross profit as a percentage of RadioShack sales increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 1997 versus 1996, due to a positive shift within RadioShack's  product  offerings  to increased  cellular  and  telecommunication sales,  as a percent of sales,  and was further  enhanced by decreased  sales of lower margin personal computers.  Computer City's gross profit for continuing stores as a percent of Computer City sales  increased 0.9  percentage  points in 1997 when  compared to 1996,  due to improvement  in  inventory   management,   increased   sales  of  higher  margin accessories  and  software  and an increase in the ratio of service  revenues to total  revenues.  Service  revenues  typically  have a higher  gross margin than merchandise sales.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  The  Company's  SG&A  expense as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues increased for the year ended  December 31, 1997 to 29.4% from 28.0% for the year ended  December  31,  1996.  The higher SG&A  percentage  was due  primarily  to RadioShack,  which became a larger percentage of Tandy's consolidated operations during 1997 (see "Gross Profit" above).  RadioShack  operated at higher relative SG&A expense levels than consolidated Tandy Corporation.  Excluding those stores in the 1996 store closure plan, SG&A expense as a percentage of sales would have approximated  29.5% for the year ended  December 31, 1997. See  "Provisions  for Business Restructuring and Asset Impairment" below.  Although  payroll  and  commissions  expense  for 1997  decreased  in dollars in comparison with 1996, this cost increased as a percentage of sales and operating revenues from 12.1% in 1996 to 13.7% in 1997,  due to the increase in RadioShack sales as a percentage of total sales and  operating  revenues  described  above. RadioShack  has  inherently  higher  salary  expense  as a  percentage  of total RadioShack sales when compared to the total Company.  RadioShack payroll expense increased in dollars and as a percentage of  RadioShack  sales in 1997 from 1996 due to increased staffing at the store level. Computer City payroll expense as a percentage  of  Computer  City  sales  increased  from  1996 to 1997  due to the addition of new stores in 1997,  added  headcount in the direct sales area and a realignment of support staff from Tandy Corporation to Computer City.  Advertising expense decreased,  both in dollars and as a percentage of sales and operating  revenues,  in 1997 as compared to 1996.  This decrease over the prior year was primarily the result of reductions in Incredible  Universe  advertising in 1997, due to stores closed pursuant to the 1996 restructuring  plan. Computer City had a  substantial  increase  in vendor  participation  in its  advertising campaigns in 1997 compared to 1996.  Somewhat  offsetting  these decreases was a slight  dollar  increase in  advertising  expense at  RadioShack  to promote the Sprint  "store-within-a-store"  concept,  which was launched in September  1997. RadioShack  advertising  expense as a  percentage  of  RadioShack  sales in 1997 remained constant with 1996.  Rent expense  increased  as a  percentage  of sales to 4.1% in 1997 from 3.8% in 1996. This increase was related to a decrease in the number of Computer City and Incredible Universe stores which had lower rent expense as a percentage of sales than the Company as a whole. Rent expense in dollars decreased in 1997 from 1996 due to Incredible Universe and Computer City store closures pursuant to the 1996 restructuring  plan.  Rent expense for RadioShack  remained  consistent with the prior year in dollars and decreased slightly as a percentage of sales.  Credit card fees expense,  which includes fees  associated with third party bank credit cards and fees paid for  promotional  accounts such as "zero interest for six  months",  decreased as a result of the closure of the  Incredible  Universe stores and decreased usage by RadioShack during 1997.  Other SG&A expense  decreased  both as a percentage  of net sales and  operating revenues  and in dollars when  compared to fiscal year ended  December 31, 1996. Increases in other  income were  primarily  attributable  to the receipt of $9.0 million,  pre-tax, of income from O'Sullivan Industries ("O'Sullivan") (see "Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit Reimbursement  Agreement" below) and non-recurring gains of $4.7 million  recorded on repayment of the note  receivable from InterTAN and $3.0  million  on sale  of  certain  assets.  These  increases  were  offset  by additional  restructuring expense of the $11.6 million related to store closings pursuant to the 1996 store closure plan.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE  Net interest  expense was $32.9  million for 1997 versus $23.4  million in 1996. Interest expense increased in 1997 as the Company continued  purchasing treasury stock and continued to fund store  expansion.  Interest  expense also  increased during  1997  when  the  Company  refinanced  existing  short-term  indebtedness (average  maturity  of 90 days or less) by issuing  $150.0  million of  ten-year unsecured notes, resulting in a moderately higher interest rate when compared to the short-term financing used in 1996.  Interest  income  relating to the InterTAN  notes  decreased in 1997 as InterTAN made the scheduled  principal payments on the note balances.  The remaining note was repaid in December 1997. In addition,  the $90.0 million AST Research,  Inc. ("AST") note was repaid in 1996 and, accordingly, the Company no longer received interest income from this source in 1997.  Interest income relating to the Fry's notes  receivables  resulted from the 1997 sale of assets and real estate of six Incredible  Universe  stores.  At December 31, 1997,  the Company held  multiple notes  receivable  from  Fry's  of  approximately  $75.3  million  with  varying maturities  ranging  from one to five  years and  interest  rates  ranging  from approximately 5.9% to 6.7%.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  The  provision  for income  taxes  reflects an  effective  tax rate of 38.5% for fiscal year 1997,  compared to an effective tax rate of 37.1% for the comparable period in fiscal year 1996. The fiscal 1997 effective tax rate differed from the fiscal  1996  effective  tax rate  primarily  because  the fiscal  1996 tax rate included  foreign income taxes which were incurred on foreign income despite the overall loss incurred by the Company.  PROVISIONS FOR BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT In the fourth quarter of 1996, Tandy initiated certain restructuring programs to exit its  Incredible  Universe  business,  close 21  unprofitable  Computer City stores and close its 53 remaining McDuff stores.  These  restructuring  programs were  undertaken  as a  result  of the  highly  competitive  environment  in the electronics  industry.  The Company  recorded  total  pre-tax  charges of $162.1 million  in 1996  related  to  future  lease  obligations,  real  estate  costs, disposition  of  fixed  assets,   employee  termination  expenses  and  contract cancellation  costs  related to this  restructuring  program.  The Company  also recognized,   in  1996,  lower  of  cost  or  market   impairments   aggregating approximately  $91.4 million,  pre-tax,  primarily related to inventory that was liquidated at the affected stores.  Inventory impairment charges were recognized in the  Consolidated  Statements  of Income as an  increase  in cost of sales in 1996. The Company also recognized a non-cash  impairment charge of $86.8 million to write down the carrying values of long-term  assets pursuant to SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" ("FAS 121") as part of the restructuring plan.  Upon adoption of FAS 121 in the first quarter of 1996, the Company recognized an initial non-cash  impairment loss of approximately $26.0 million to conform with this  statement,  primarily as a result of grouping  long-lived  assets at their lowest  level  of  cash  flows  to  determine  impairment  as  required  by this statement.  In January  1997,  the Company  closed the  respective 53 McDuff and 21 Computer City stores.  Additionally,  by July 1997, all of the Incredible Universe stores were either closed or sold.  During 1997, the Company sold the assets related to several  closed  stores,  including  the sale of the real estate,  related fixed assets and  inventory  of six  Incredible  Universe  stores to Fry's.  These six stores were sold for  approximately  $21.5  million in cash and $97.4 million in notes  receivable  with no material  gain or loss  recognized  upon the sale. At December 31, 1998, the notes receivable balance was $47.6 million with remaining interest rates ranging from 6.6% to 6.7% and maturity dates in 2001 and 2002. In 1997,  additional  costs totaling  $11.6 million  related to store closings were recorded  and  included  in  SG&A  expense  in  the  accompanying   Consolidated Statements of Income.  On January 1, 1998, five closed Incredible Universe locations  remained.  During 1998,  three were sold for a total of $13.3  million in cash and a $3.0  million note  receivable.  The balance on the note  receivable  was  approximately  $3.0 million at December 31, 1998. The lease on an additional location was terminated during 1998, leaving one Incredible  Universe location remaining at December 31, 1998.  In 1998,  $6.5  million  was  accrued  and  charged to SG&A  expense  for additional lease obligations and real estate costs.  The components of the  restructuring  charge and an analysis of the reserves are outlined in a table in Note 5 - "Provisions for Business Restructuring and Asset Impairment"  of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  ("Notes"). Although no significant  additional  provisions are expected in 1999 relating to the 1996  restructuring,  unexpected delays in the closing of real estate sales, among other factors, could result in additional charges.  Net sales and  operating  revenues  and  operating  losses of the stores  closed pursuant to the restructuring plans are shown below for each year ended December 31 (unaudited):  (In millions)                           1998         1997         1996 - -------------                           ----         ----         ----  Net sales and operating revenues     $    --      $  164.6     $1,403.4 Operating loss                            --         (30.1)(1)   (114.4)(1)  (1) Excludes  business  restructuring  and asset  impairment  charges  discussed     above.  TAX SHARING AND TAX BENEFIT REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT Under the Company's  Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit  Reimbursement  Agreement  (the "Agreement")  with  O'Sullivan  Industries,  a former  subsidiary of Tandy,  the Company receives payments from O'Sullivan  approximating the federal tax benefit that  O'Sullivan  realizes from the increased tax basis of its assets  resulting from the initial  public  offering  completed in February  1994.  The higher tax basis increases  O'Sullivan's  tax deductions and,  accordingly,  reduces income taxes payable by  O'Sullivan.  For the years ended  December 31, 1998,  1997 and 1996,  the Company  recognized  income of $6.0  million,  $5.8  million and $0.2 million,  net of tax,  respectively,  under this Agreement.  These payments will continue  to be  made  over a  15-year  time  period  and  are  contingent  upon O'Sullivan's  level of earnings  from year to year.  The income is recorded as a reduction of SG&A expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities",  which  is effective  for all companies for quarters  beginning  after June 15, 1999.  This statement requires a company to record all derivative  instruments at fair value on the balance  sheet.  The Company  does not use  derivatives  for  speculative purposes.  As such, its market risk was not material in 1998 and is not expected to be material in 1999.  CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY                                              Year Ended December 31,                                       ----------------------------------         (In millions)                          1998         1997         1996 - -------------                        --------     --------     -------- Operating activities                 $  414.8     $  320.3     $  307.5 Investing activities                    (93.0)       (63.9)      (112.9) Financing activities                   (363.2)      (272.0)      (216.6)  In 1998, cash flow provided by operating activities approximated $414.8 million, compared  to $320.3  million in 1997.  Cash flow from net income,  adjusted  for non-cash items including restricted stock awards, loss on sale of Computer City, depreciation and deferred tax items,  decreased $33.1 million from 1997 to 1998. This  decrease was primarily  due to the  increased  operating  losses of CCI in 1998,  prior to CCI's sale to CompUSA.  During 1998,  changes in working capital generated  $55.2 million of cash flow compared to a use of cash of $72.4 million in  1997.  The  increase  was  caused  primarily  by the  liquidation  of  CCI's inventories.  In 1997, cash flow from operations  before working capital changes  increased to approximately  $392.7  million  from  $258.3  million in 1996,  due to  improved operating  performance.  For 1997,  the Company used $72.4  million in cash from operations due to changes in working capital accounts, primarily attributable to a decrease in other current liabilities of $209.6 million, related, for the most part, to resulting expenditures associated with the 1996 restructuring activity. Substantially  offsetting the decreased cash flow from  expenditures  related to restructuring was a decrease in inventory at closed Incredible Universe stores.  In 1996, the working capital  components of operations cash flow generated $49.2 million  of  positive  cash  flow  from a  $38.1  million  increase  in  current liabilities.  In 1996,  inventory for RadioShack and related support  operations decreased  approximately $30.0 million,  while during the same period,  Computer City and Incredible Universe  inventories (prior to the restructuring  reserves) increased approximately $30.1 million. These year-to-year inventory fluctuations offset one another, resulting in no material net cash effect for 1996.  Investing  activities  used  $93.0  million in cash in 1998,  compared  to $63.9 million in 1997 and $112.9 million in 1996.  Capital  expenditures  approximated $131.5 million in 1998, compared to $118.4 million in 1997 and $174.8 million in 1996.  Capital  expenditures  for 1998 and 1997 were used  primarily  for retail expansion,  upgrading information systems and infrastructure  enhancements prior to the announced  sale of CCI on June 22, 1998.  Capital  expenditures  for 1996 were  primarily used for retail  expansion,  upgrading  information  systems and headquarter   building   renovations.   Management   anticipates   that  capital expenditure  requirements  for 1999 will  approximate  $100.0  million to $110.0 million,  and will consist  primarily of RadioShack  future store expansions and remodels,   upgrades  of   machinery  in  selected   distribution   centers  and manufacturing plants and updated information systems. These expenditures will be funded  primarily from  operating cash flow.  Cash proceeds from the sale of CCI generated  $36.5  million in cash in 1998.  Cash  proceeds in 1997 totaled $57.4 million  and  related  to the  sale of  various  corporate  assets  and  certain Incredible  Universe  locations,  final  repayment of the note  receivable  from InterTAN and the sale of the Company's remaining shares of AST common stock. The cash portion of payments on the AST note receivable amounted to $60.0 million in 1996.  Cash used by financing activities was $363.2 million in 1998, compared to $272.0 million and $216.6 million in 1997 and 1996, respectively. Purchases of treasury stock  required cash of $337.4  million,  $425.6  million and $232.9  million in 1998,  1997 and  1996,  respectively.  (See  "Capital  Structure  and  Financial Condition"  below for further  information  on the  Company's  stock  repurchase programs.) The 1998, 1997 and 1996 stock  repurchases  were partially  funded by $57.8  million,  $50.7 million and $46.8  million,  respectively,  received from stock option  exercises and the sale of treasury stock to Tandy's employee stock purchase  plans.  Dividends paid, net of tax, in 1998, 1997 and 1996 amounted to $44.8  million,  $48.2 million and $52.5  million,  respectively.  In 1998,  the Company  used excess cash flow to decrease  its  short-term  debt from the prior year by $44.9  million.  Medium-term  notes issued by the Company under its 1997 Debt Shelf Registration  Statement provided  approximately $45.0 million in cash in 1998, the majority of which was used to repay current maturities of long-term debt. In 1997,  the Company's  short-term  debt increased over the prior year by $43.6  million.  The Company's  net change in long-term  debt was an increase of $107.5 million, due to the utilization of $150.0 million of long-term debt under the Company's $300.0 million Debt Shelf Registration Statement and the repayment of $42.3 million of long-term borrowings, primarily medium-term notes.  The current credit ratings for Tandy, which are generally considered  investment grade, follow:                                             Standard       Duff & Category                     Moody's      and Poor's      Phelps - --------                     -------      ----------      ------ Medium-Term Notes             Baa1           A-            A- ESOP Senior Notes             Baa1           A-            N/A Commercial Paper              P-2            A-2           D-1-   CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION The Company's balance sheet and financial  condition  continue to be strong. The Company's available borrowing facilities as of December 31, 1998 are detailed in Note 10 - "Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities" of the Notes.  On March 3, 1997, the Company  announced that its Board of Directors  authorized management to purchase an additional 10.0 million shares, as adjusted to reflect the two-for-one  split, of its common stock through the Company's existing share repurchase  program.  The share repurchase  program was initially  authorized in December  1995 and  increased in October 1996 and was  undertaken as a result of management's  view of the  economic  value of the  Company's  stock.  The  share increase for 1997 brought the total  authorization  to 30.0 million  shares,  of which 25.9  million  shares  totaling  $745.8  million had been  purchased as of December 31, 1998. Approximately 4.9 million shares were repurchased in 1998 for $216.6 million under the program. Additionally, on October 26, 1998, the Company announced  that its Board of Directors  authorized  the  repurchase of up to 5.0 million shares of the Company's common stock for an indefinite period of time to be used to offset the dilution of grants  under  Tandy's  incentive  stock plans (see Note 17 - "Stock Options and Performance Awards" in Notes). These purchases are in addition to the shares  required  for  employee  stock  plans,  which are purchased throughout the year. Purchases will continue to be made in 1999 in the open  market.  It is expected  that funding of the program will come from excess free cash flow.  In connection  with the share  repurchase  program,  the Board of Directors,  at their October 23, 1998 meeting,  authorized management to sell up to one million put options on the Company's common stock.  During 1998, the Company sold 80,000 put options with a strike price of $40.71 to an  independent  third party.  Such options grant the purchaser the right to sell shares of Tandy's  common stock to the Company at specified prices upon exercise of the options.  These put options are  exercisable  only at maturity  and can be settled in cash at the  Company's option,  in lieu of  repurchasing  the  stock.  The issued  put  options  have a maturity of six months.  At  December  31,  1998,  all 80,000  options  remained outstanding  and the full  redemption  value of the  options was  classified  as common stock put options in the accompanying  1998  Consolidated  Balance Sheet. The related  offset was recorded in common  stock in  treasury,  net of premiums received.  Additionally,  200,000 put  options  have been sold in 1999 at strike prices ranging from $45.08 to $55.20;  these put options have six month maturity dates.  Put options will continue to be sold by the Company from time to time in order to take  advantage of  attractive  share price  levels,  as  determined by management.  The timing  and terms of the  transactions,  including  maturities, depend on market conditions, the Company's liquidity and other considerations.  The Company's primary source of short-term debt consists of short-term  seasonal bank debt and commercial  paper,  which have maturities of less than 90 days. In the second quarter of 1998,  Tandy  replaced its existing  $500.0 million credit facilities with new credit  facilities,  also totaling  $500.0 million.  The new facilities were granted by a syndicate of 17 banks,  including a new agent bank, and consist of a $200.0 million 364-day  revolving credit facility maturing June 1999 and a $300.0 million  five-year  revolving  credit  facility  maturing June 2003.  The revolving  credit  facilities  are used as backup for the  commercial paper program and may also be utilized for general  corporate  purposes.  Annual commitment fees for the facilities are 0.06% of the $200.0 million  facility per annum and 0.085% of the $300.0  million  facility  per  annum,  whether  used or unused. Tandy plans to extend the $200.0 million facility to June 2000.  The total  debt-to-capitalization ratio was 35.6% at December 31, 1998, 33.6% at December  31,  1997 and 22.3% at  December  31,  1996.  These  increases  in the debt-to-capitalization  ratios  in  1998  and  1997  resulted  primarily  from a reduction in Tandy's  stockholders'  equity due to the share repurchase  program and the impact of divested businesses.  In May  1997,  the  Company  filed a  $300.0  million  Debt  Shelf  Registration Statement ("Shelf  Registration")  with the Securities and Exchange  Commission, which was declared  effective in August  1997.  On August 19, 1997,  the Company issued $150.0 million of 10 year unsecured  notes under the Shelf  Registration. The  interest  rate on the notes is 6.95% per annum  with  interest  payable  on September 1 and March 1 of each year,  commencing  March 1, 1998.  The notes are due September 1, 2007.  In December 1997, the Company issued $4.0 million in medium-term notes under the Shelf  Registration.  In January 1998,  the Company  issued an additional  $45.0 million in  medium-term  notes under the remaining  $150.0  million of the Shelf Registration. Tandy's medium-term notes outstanding at December 31, 1998 totaled $49.8  million,  compared to $30.0  million at December 31,  1997.  The interest rates at December  31, 1998 for the  outstanding  $49.8  million in  medium-term notes ranged from 6.09% to 7.25%, with weighted average coupon rates of 6.2% and 8.2% at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. An additional $32.0 million of medium-term notes were issued in January 1999 yielding a 6.15% interest rate. As of February 24, 1999,  the Company had remaining  availability  of $69.0 million under the Shelf Registration.  Management  believes that the Company's  present  borrowing  capacity is greater than the established  credit lines and long-term debt in place.  Management also believes that the Company's cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents and its available  borrowing  facilities  are more than adequate to fund planned store expansion,  to meet debt service and dividend requirements and to fund its share repurchase program.  1999 INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN In February 1999, the Company, based upon the Board of Directors' authorization, adopted the Tandy  Corporation  1999  Incentive  Stock Plan ("1999 ISP"),  which authorizes  the grants of stock options and stock  appreciation  rights to broad based employee groups and other eligible  employees.  Grants of restricted stock and  performance  awards are not  authorized  under the 1999 ISP.  In  addition, repricing of outstanding options is not permitted without shareholder  approval. The 1999 ISP will be  administered  as a broadly  based  plan to  provide  stock option  incentives  primarily to the Company's  5,000 plus store managers and to other eligible  employees of the Company.  A total of 4.75 million shares of the Company's common stock was reserved for issuance under the 1999 ISP.  The Board granted  approximately  1,082,000  stock options under the 1999 ISP at fair market value on February 24, 1999 to over 5,000  RadioShack  store managers employed as of that date.  INFLATION Inflation has not significantly  impacted the Company over the past three years. Management does not expect inflation to have a significant  impact on operations in the foreseeable  future,  unless global situations  substantially  affect the world economy.  YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE The Company's  management  recognizes  the need to take action to reach its goal that its  operations  and  relationships  with key vendors,  service  providers, customers  and other third  parties will not be  adversely  impacted by software processing errors arising from calculations using the Year 2000 and beyond. Like many  companies,  a  significant  number of Tandy's  computer  applications  and systems  require  modifications  in order for these  systems to be ready for the Year 2000.  All  statements  made and  referred to here are Year 2000  Readiness Disclosures under the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.  The Company's  State of Readiness:  Tandy is using a combination of internal and external  resources to identify,  assess,  remediate and test its many different information  technology ("IT") systems such as point of sale,  payroll,  credit, purchase   ordering,    merchandise    distribution,    management    reporting, manufacturing,  mainframe, and client/server applications, as well as its non-IT systems  (e.g.  heating,  ventilating  and air  conditioning  systems,  building security systems, etc.).  Since  beginning the project in 1995, the Company has completed  identifying and assessing  100% of its internal  mid-range  and  mainframe IT  applications  and approximately 80% of its data  communication and  telecommunication  systems for Year 2000 readiness.  An inventory and assessment of the Company's workstations, which includes desktop and notebook  computers,  will be completed in the second quarter of 1999.  As of December  31,  1998,  remediation  and unit  testing was approximately  90% complete  for  mid-range  and  mainframe  applications.  Unit testing  ensures the accuracy of the  programming  changes to the code. For data communication and  telecommunication  systems,  remediation and unit testing was approximately  75%  complete as of December  31, 1998 and is expected to be 100% complete by September 30, 1999.  Remediation  and testing to determine if all of the Company's mission critical systems will interface and operate effectively to process data  containing  dates  subsequent to January 1, 2000 for all remaining servers, systems software and personal computers are expected to be completed by the third quarter of 1999.  Third-party  software systems,  including  financial systems,  point-of-sale and manufacturing have been or will be implemented during 1999. The vendors of these third-party  software  packages  have  stated  that  they are Year  2000  ready; however, the Company has and/or intends to conduct its own testing in 1999.  With  respect  to  non-IT  system  issues,  the  Company  is in the  process  of identifying,  assessing and remediating,  if necessary, its building and process and  production  control  systems  for any  Year  2000  issues  relating  to the operations of its facilities.  Identification and assessment of security access, building  control  systems and  elevators  in the  buildings  which serve as the Company's  corporate  headquarters  have  been  completed  and  remediation  was approximately  60% complete at December 31, 1998.  The Company is in the process of identifying and assessing Year 2000 issues of its remote  locations,  such as its distribution centers,  manufacturing plants, and administrative  offices and does not expect any  significant  issues to arise from this process.  All of the Company's non-IT systems are expected to be Year 2000 ready by the third quarter of 1999.  Although  unforeseen  circumstances may arise, the Year 2000 remediation program is presently on schedule.  The Company will continue  communicating with its key suppliers, utilities, financial institutions,  customers and others to determine their state of Year 2000 readiness,  to coordinate Year 2000  conversions  where appropriate and to determine the extent to which the Company's interface systems are vulnerable.  Costs: In management's opinion, the financial impact of being Year 2000 ready is not expected to be material to the Company's  consolidated  financial  position, results  of  operations  or  cash  flows.   Management  anticipates  that  total expenditures  associated  with the Year 2000 internal  modifications  will range from $10.0  million to $14.0  million,  which has been and will  continue  to be funded from operating cash flow. As of December 1998, approximately $6.5 million representing  internal  payroll  and  related  benefits,  depreciation  expense, machine time and incentive  bonuses,  among other costs, has been spent on these internal  modifications.  An  additional  $0.5 million has been paid to external parties for consulting and professional  fees. As required by generally accepted accounting  principles,  all these  costs are  expensed as  incurred.  Combined, internal  and  external  costs  related  to the Year 2000  project  account  for approximately 7.0% of the Company's annual IT budget. Additionally,  the Company has purchased  and is installing  third party  financial  software  packages and related hardware totaling  approximately $20.0 million to $25.0 million in light of the Year  2000  issue.  These  purchases  are in  addition  to other  capital investments  made in the normal  course of  business  for  certain  third  party software  systems  and  applications   which  address  the  ongoing  retail  and operational needs of the Company.  The  Risks  of the  Company's  Year  2000  Issues:  With  respect  to the  risks associated  with its IT and non-IT systems,  the Company  believes that the most reasonably  likely  worst  case  scenario  is that some of the  Company's  store operating and inventory  management systems could fail in one or more geographic areas of the United  States.  The  consequence of such failure could include the inability of those affected  RadioShack  stores to  electronically  record sales transactions.  This could further result in a breakdown in the Company's  supply chain as the Company  relies on electronic  information to replenish its stores. Such an  occurrence  would  result  in a loss  of  revenue;  however,  it is not possible to quantify the possible range of such loss.  There  can be no  assurance  that the  systems  of third  parties  on which  the Company's  systems rely will be  converted  timely and that the systems will not have an adverse effect on the Company's systems or ongoing operations.  However, concerning the risks  associated with third parties,  the Company  believes that the most  reasonably  likely worst case  scenario is that some of the  Company's merchandise  vendors will not be compliant and will have difficulty  filling and distributing  orders.  Failure of one or more third party  service  providers on whom the Company  relies to address  Year 2000 issues  could also  result,  in a worst case scenario, in some business  interruption.  The lost revenues, if any, resulting  from  such  failures  would  depend  on the time  period in which the failure goes uncorrected and on how widespread the impact was.  The Company is also in the process of  assessing  the  implications  of possible Year 2000-related  claims regarding  products it has manufactured or sold, or is currently manufacturing or selling. The outcomes of any Year 2000 claims and the impact of such claims  cannot be  determined  at this time;  such  outcomes will depend on the facts and circumstances of each situation and an evolving state of law as these types of claims are addressed by legal systems in the United States and worldwide.  The Company has limited the scope of its risk  assessment  to those factors upon which it can  reasonably  be expected to have an  influence.  For  example,  the Company has made the  assumption  that  financial  institutions  and the Federal Reserve System as well as most utility companies and national telecommunications providers will continue to operate.  Obviously,  the lack of such services could have a material effect on the Company's ability to operate,  but the Company has little,  if any,  ability to influence  such an outcome,  or to reasonably  make alternative  arrangements  in advance  for such  services  in the event they are unavailable.  Contingency  Plans:  The Company has  completed  a  prioritization  of Year 2000 issues in order to develop and document Year 2000 contingency plans. The Company has identified its critical  applications to be its  merchandising and inventory systems,  which  include  purchasing,   receiving  and  distribution  and  store replenishment, its point-of-sale store operating system as well as its financial systems, which includes payroll, accounts payable and receivable and banking and other  financial  applications.  Should any or all of the critical  applications fail to perform properly  subsequent to January 1, 2000, the Company will resort to  temporary  manual  processing  for  recording  sales,  ordering  product and replenishing  the  Company's  stores,  which is not  expected to have a material adverse  impact on its  operations  in the  short-term.  Management  anticipates having a formal  documented  contingency  plan to deal  with  this  scenario  by November 1999. The Company's eleven distribution  centers are located in various geographic areas of the United States.  Should one or more of these distribution centers  fail to operate  due to  regional  power  outages  or other  unforeseen circumstances,  the Company's other distribution  centers which may be operating could replenish stores typically  serviced by those  distribution  centers for a relatively  short period of time.  Management  is in the process of  documenting this  contingency  plan.  Although no single  internal  or third party  supplier accounts for a material  portion of the Company's sales and operating  revenues, management is  evaluating  the need for a formal list of  alternative  suppliers should some existing  suppliers be unable to provide  product  beyond the end of calendar year 1999.  Should the decision be made that such a list and agreements with alternate suppliers be necessary,  they will be developed prior to November 1999.  All statements  concerning  Year 2000 issues other than  historical  statements, including,  without  limitation,  estimated costs and the projected timetable of Year 2000 compliance, constitute "forward-looking statements", as defined in the Private  Securities   Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995.  Such   forward-looking statements  should be read in conjunction with the Company's  disclosures  under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results".  ITEM 7a.   QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 133, "Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities",  which  is effective  for all companies for quarters  beginning  after June 15, 1999.  This statement requires a company to record all derivative  instruments at fair value on the balance  sheet.  The Company  does not use  derivatives  for  speculative purposes.  As such, its market risk was not material in 1998 and is not expected to be material in 1999.  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
