ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIALCONDITION AND                RESULTSOF OPERATIONS (“MD&A”).     This MD&Asection discusses our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition,risk management practices, critical accounting policies, and estimates andcertain factors that may affect our future results, including economic andindustry-wide factors. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with ourconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, included in thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1Aabove.     Subsequent to the end of 2007, we determined that weshould revise the classification of certain expenses relating tomerchandise acquisition and the operation of our distribution centers, includingdepreciation, in our Consolidated Statements of Income. This revision had noimpact on previously reported operating income, net income, financial position,stockholder's equity, comprehensive income, or cash flows from operatingactivities.  Our policy is, and historically has been, to capitalizesuch amounts into inventory. However, historically upon capitalization ofthese expenses, we increased inventory and previously decreased cost of productssold, rather than decreasing selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)expense where these expenses were originally recorded. As a result, wehad understated cost of products sold and overstated SG&A expenseand, to a lesser extent, depreciation. We believe the revised presentationprovides consistency between our consolidated balance sheets and statements ofincome by aligning the classification of our distribution costs within ourstatements of income in the manner in which these costs are included in ourinventory balance.  Referto  Note 2  – “Summary of SignificantAccounting Policies” under the section titled “Revision of ExpenseClassification ” in the Notesto Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion regarding therevision. The following discussion and analysis has been updated to reflect thisrevision.     OVERVIEW  Highlights relatedto the year ended December 31, 2007, include:         ·    Net sales and operating      revenues decreased $525.8 million to $4,251.7 million, compared to the      corresponding prior year period.  Comparable  store sales      decreased 8.2%.  This decline was primarily due to a sales decrease      in our wireless and personal electronics platforms.         ·    Gross margin      increased 300 basis points to 47.6% compared to the corresponding prior      year period.  This increase was primarily due to      improved  inventory      management and a shift in our product mix.         ·    SG&A expense decreased      $272.2 million to $1,538.5 million, compared to the corresponding prior      year period.  As a percentage of net sales and operating revenues,      SG&A declined 170 basis points to 36.2%.  A significant portion      of this  improvement was attributable      to decreased compensation as a result of reductions in our corporate and      store personnel in 2006 and better management of store labor hours.       Other factors leading to the decline of SG&A included a decrase in      professional fees driven by reduced legal costs related to our defense of      certain class action lawsuits during 2006, as well as a reduction in the      use of consultants.  The SG&A improvement also resulted from      $44.6 million in severance and other restructuring charges recognized in      2006, and a $14.3 million reduction of accrued vacation in 2007 in      connection with the modification of our employee vacation policy during      2007.         ·    Operating income      increased $225.0 million to $381.9 million, and net income increased      $163.4 million to $236.8 million, compared to the corresponding prior year      period.  The results for the year ended December 31, 2006, included      pre-tax impairment charges of $44.3 million.  Net income per diluated      share was $1.74 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $0.54      for the corresponding prior yearperiod.               19         2006RESTRUCTURING REVIEW  Due to negativetrends that developed in our business during calendar year 2005, we announced arestructuring program on February 17, 2006, that contained four keycomponents:         ·    Update our      inventory          ·    Focus on our      top-performing RadioShack company-operated stores, while closing 400 to      700 RadioShack company-operated stores, and aggressively   relocate      other RadioShack company-operatedstores          ·    Consolidate      our distribution centers          ·    Reduce our      overhead costs         Through December31, 2006, we conducted a liquidation of certain inventory during the summer andfall of 2006, and replaced underperforming merchandise with new faster-movingmerchandise. During the summer of 2006, we also focused on our top-performingstores and completed the closure of 481 underperforming stores, reducing thenumber of retail employees in connection with these closures. Additionally, weconsolidated our distribution centers in the fall of 2006. Management alsoreduced our cost structure; including our advertising spend rate and ourworkforce within our corporate headquarters. A number of other cost reductionswere implemented. As of December 31, 2006, we considered our restructuringprogram to be substantially complete.     The 2006restructuring affects comparability in certain areas of this MD&A discussionand is discussed where necessary.     See “FinancialImpact of Restructuring Program” below for a discussion of the financial impactof our 2006 restructuring program.     RESULTSOF OPERATIONS     NET SALES ANDOPERATING REVENUES     Consolidatednet sales decreas ed 11.0%or $525. 8  millionto $4,25 1 . 7  millionfor the year ended December 31, 2007 , from  $4,777.5 million in the corresponding prior year period. This decrease was primarily dueto a comparable store sales decline of  8.2% for the year ended December 31, 2007, in addition to the closure of 481company-operated stores during June and July 2006 as part of our 2006restructuring. Approximately 290 of the 481 stores were closed in July 2006,with a majority of the remainder closed in the last half of June 2006. Thedecrease in comparable store sales was primarily caused by a decline in ourwireless and personal electronics platform sales.     Consolidated netsales and operating revenues for our two reportable segments and other sales areas follows:                   Year Ended      December 31,         (In      millions)       2007          2006          2005         RadioShack      company-operated stores      $  3,637.7        $  4,079.8        $  4,480.8        Kiosks         297.0           340.5           262.7        Other      sales         317.0           357.2           338.2        Consolidated      net sales and operating revenues      $  4,251.7        $  4,777.5        $  5,081.7                                                         Consolidated net sales and      operating  revenues (decrease)      increase                      (11.0   %)                   (6.0  %)                    5.0  %     Comparable store sales (decrease) increase       (1)                   (8.2  %)                   (5.6  %)                    0.9  %            (1)    Comparable      store sales include the sales of RadioShack company-operated stores and      kiosks with more than 12 full months of recorded  sales.               20         The following tableprovides a summary of our consolidated net sales and operating revenues byplatform and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues.

We believe that these sales declines were theresult of increased wireless competition, a challenging wireless industryenvironment, and a shift to prepaid handsets and corresponding service plans.This decrease, however, was partially offset by increased sales of GPS products,particularly in the fourth quarter of 2007, and prepaid wireless handset sales.Including the effects of the 2006 store closures, wireless platform sales forthe year ended December 31, 2007, decreased 15 .7% .           21         Excluding theeffects of the 2006 store closures, sales in our accessory platform (includeshome entertainment, wireless, music and computer accessories; media storage;power adapters; digital imaging products and headphones) decreased 2 . 3 % for the year ended December 31, 2007, when compared to the corresponding prioryear period. This decrease was primarily the result of declines in wireless andhome entertainment accessory sales, but partially offset by increases in mediastorage and imaging accessories sales. Including the effects of the 2006 storeclosures, accessory platform sales for the year ended December 31, 2007,decreased  5.7% .     Excluding theeffects of the 2006 store closures, sales in our personal electronics platform(includes digital cameras, digital music players, toys, satellite radios,camcorders, general radios, and wellness products) decreased  11.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007, when compared to the corresponding prioryear period. This decrease was driven primarily by sales declines in satelliteradios and digital music players, but was partially offset by increased sales ofvideo gaming products. Including the effects of the 2006 store closures,personal electronics platform sales for the year ended December 31, 2007,decreased  13.7% .     Excluding theeffects of the 2006 store closures, sales in our modern home platform (includesresidential telephones, home audio and video end-products, direct-to-home(“DTH”) satellite systems, and computers) decreased 5.7 %, for the year ended December 31, 2007, when compared to the corresponding prioryear period. This decrease was the result of sales declines in residentialtelephones, and DVD players and recorders, offset by increased sales of laptopcomputers, PC peripherals, and flash drives. Including the effects of the 2006store closures, modern home platform sales for the year ended December 31, 2007,decreased 8.3 % .     Excluding theeffects of the 2006 store closures, sales in our power platform (includesgeneral and special purpose batteries and battery chargers) decreased 5.6 % for the year ended December 31, 2007, when compared to the corresponding prioryear period. This sales decline was the result of decreased sales of generalpurpose and special purpose telephone batteries. Including the effects of the2006 store closures, power platform sales for the year ended December 31, 2007,decreased 8 .6% .     Excluding theeffects of the 2006 store closures, sales in our technical platform (includeswire and cable, connectivity products, components and tools, as well as hobbyand robotic products) decreased  2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2007, when compared to the corresponding prioryear period. This sales decline was due primarily to a decrease in sales ofrobotic kits, metal detectors and tools, partially offset by an increase inaudio cable sales. Including the effects of the 2006 store closures, technicalplatform sales for the year ended December 31, 2007, decreased 6 .9% .     Excluding theeffects of the 2006 store closures, sales in our service platform (includesprepaid wireless airtime, extended service plans and bill payment revenue)decreased 2 . 6 % for the year ended December 31, 2007, when compared to the corresponding prioryear period. Prepaid airtime sales increased for the year ended December 31,2007; however, this gain was more than offset by decreases in bill paymentrevenue. Including the effects of the 2006 store closures, service platformsales for the year ended December 31, 2007, decreased 4 . 9 % .     Other revenue(includes RS company-operated store repair revenue and other revenue) decreased$4.0 million or 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to theprior year, due in part to the 2006 store closures and to a decline in storerepair revenue.           22         Kiosks     Kiosk sales consistprimarily of handset sales, postpaid and prepaid commission revenue and relatedwireless accessory sales. Kiosk sales decreased 12.8% or $43.5 million for theyear ended December 31, 2007, when compared to the corresponding prior yearperiod. While this decrease is partially attributable to fewer kiosk locationscompared to the prior year, we believe that this sales decline was primarily theresult of increased wireless competition, a challenging wireless industryenvironment, and a customer shift to prepaid handsets which are generally pricedlower than postpaid handsets.     OtherSales     Other sales includesales to our independent dealers, outside sales through our service centers,sales generated by our  www.radioshack.com Web site, sales to our Mexican joint venture, sales to commercial customers,outside sales of our global sourcing operations and manufacturing facilitiesand, in 2006, sales of our now closed Canadian company-operated stores. Othersales were down  $40.2 million or 11.3 % for the year ended December 31, 2007, respectively, when compared to thecorresponding prior year period. This sales decrease was primarily due to thesale or closure of five service centers late in the second quarter of 2006,fewer dealer outlets in 2007, and a decline in product sales to the remainingdealers.     GROSSPROFIT     Consolidated grossprofit and gross margin are as follows:                       Year Ended      December 31,         (In      millions)       2007          2006          2005         Gross      profit      $  2,025.8        $  2,129.4        $  2,266.7        Gross profit      decrease         (4.9  %)        (6.1  %)        (2.9  %)                                                  Gross      margin         47.6  %        44.6  %        44.6  %        Consolidated grossprofit and gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2007, were $2,025.8million and 47.6%, respectively, compared with $2,129.4 million and 44.6% in thecorresponding prior year period, resulting in a 4.9% decrease in gross profitdollars and a 300 basis point increase in our gross margin.     Thedecrease in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2007, was the result ofa decline in net sales and operating revenues primarily due to a comparablestore sales decrease and store closures associated with our 2006 restructuring. Our 2007 gross margin increased primarily due to an improvement in ourinventory management and a shift in product mix. In addition, refunds of $14.0million and $5.2 million for federal telecommunications excise taxes wererecorded in the first and fourth quarters of 2007, respectively. A portion ofthese refunds totaling $18.8 million was recorded as a reduction to cost ofproducts sold, which accounted for a 44 basis point increase in our grossmargin. See  Note 12  – “Federal Excise Tax” for adiscussion of the impact of the federal telecommunications excisetax.           23         SELLING, GENERALAND ADMINISTRATIVE (“SG&A”) EXPENSE     Our consolidatedSG&A expense decreased 15.0% or $272.2 million for the year ended December31, 2007, when compared to the corresponding prior year period. This representsa 170 basis point decrease as a percentage of net sales and operating revenuescompared to the corresponding prior year period.     The table belowsummarizes the breakdown of various components of our consolidated SG&Aexpense and its related percentage of total net sales and operatingrevenues.                   Year Ended      December 31,                   2007          2006  (1)          2005  (1)                   Dollars       % of Sales      & Revenues          Dollars       % of Sales      & Revenues          Dollars       % of Sales      & Revenues                  (In      millions)      Payroll and      commissions      $  638.6     15.0  %     $  798.2     16.7  %     $  767.9     15.1  %     Rent         304.7     7.2           312.1     6.5           292.1     5.7        Advertising         208.8     4.9           216.3     4.5           263.1     5.2        Other taxes      (excludes  income      taxes)         103.0     2.4           121.2     2.5           120.8     2.4        Utilities and      telephone         61.4     1.4           64.7     1.4           68.5     1.4        Insurance         58.1     1.4           62.8     1.3           63.1     1.2        Credit card      fees         37.8     0.9           40.1     0.8           40.4     0.8        Professional      fees         19.1     0.4           49.2     1.0           43.3     0.9        Licenses         12.7     0.3           13.2     0.3           13.4     0.3        Repairs and      maintenance         10.9     0.3           11.7     0.3           11.6     0.2        Printing,      postage and office  supplies         9.6     0.2           11.7     0.3           10.3     0.2        Stock      purchase and  savings      plans         7.2     0.2           11.1     0.2           15.5     0.3        Recruiting,      training &  employee      relations         6.8     0.2           12.3     0.3           14.6     0.3        Travel         5.2     0.1           8.3     0.2           10.3     0.2        Warranty and      product repair         5.1     0.1           7.1     0.1           11.9     0.2        Other         49.5     1.2           70.7     1.5           56.5     1.1                                                                                $  1,538.5     36.2  %     $  1,810.7     37.9  %     $  1,803.3     35.5  %            (1)    Amounts have      been revised. Refer to  Note 2  – “Summary of Significant      Accounting Policies” under the section titled “Revision of Expense      Classification ” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements      for a complete discussion.         Payroll andcommissions expense decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales andoperating revenues. This decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in ourcorporate support staff, a reduction of store personnel from store closures in2006, and better management of store labor hours. Additionally, compensationincluded an $8.5 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2007 associatedwith the reduction of approximately 280 corporate support employees, while theyear ended December 31, 2006, included employee separation charges ofapproximately $16.1 million connected with the 2006 restructuring. Furthermore,our accrued vacation was reduced $14.3 million during the year ended December31, 2007, in connection with the modification of our employee vacation policyduring 2007.     Rent expensedecreased in dollars, but increased as a percent of net sales and operatingrevenues. The rent decrease was primarily driven by store closures from our 2006restructuring.     Advertising expensedecreased in dollars, but increased as a percent of net sales and operatingrevenues. This decrease was primarily due to a change in our media strategy, aswe changed the mix of media used in our advertising program from television tomore radio and newspaper usage, as well as reduced sponsorshipprograms.           24            Professional feesdecreased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues.The decrease relates to a decline in our use of consultants and lower feesincurred as a result of our defense of certain class action lawsuits during2006, as well as prior year recognition of $5.1 million of the $8.8 millioncharge to establish a legal reserve for the settlement of these lawsuits. See  Note 13  – “Litigation” in the Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements for a discussion of these lawsuits.     DEPRECIATION ANDAMORTIZATION     The table belowgives a summary of our total depreciation and amortization bysegment.                   Year Ended      December 31,         (In      millions)       2007          2006           2005  (1)         RadioShack      company-operated stores      $  53.4        $  58.2        $  52.1        Kiosks         6.3           10.2           9.0        Other         1.7           2.3           2.3        Unallocated         51.3           57.5           60.4        Total      depreciation and amortization      $  112.7        $  128.2        $  123.8               (1)    Amounts have      been retrospectively adjusted to conform to current year presentations.      Certain prior year amounts have been reallocated between the segments and      other business activities and the unallocated  category.         The table belowprovides an analysis of total depreciation and amortization.                   Year Ended      December 31,         (In      millions)       2007          2006          2005         Depreciation      and amortization expense      $  102.7        $  117.5        $  113.5        Depreciation      and amortization included in  cost of      products sold         10.0           10.7           10.3        Total      depreciation and amortization      $  112.7        $  128.2        $  123.8           Total depreciationand amortization for the year ended December 31, 2007, declined $15.5 million or12.1%. This decrease was primarily due to the closure of stores and accelerationof depreciation as part of our 2006 restructuring, as well as a reduction in ourcapital expenditures during 2007. Additionally, the 2007 decline within thekiosk segment was the result of an impairment recorded during the third quarterof 2006.     IMPAIRMENT OFLONG-LIVED ASSETS AND OTHER CHARGES     During 2007, werecorded impairment charges for long-lived assets related primarily to ourSprint Nextel kiosk operations and company-operated stores of $2.7 million. Thischarge was comprised of $0.6 million, $0.5 million, $1.0 million and $0.6million recorded in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively.We recorded this amount based on the remaining estimated future cash flowsrelated to these specific stores. It was determined that the net book value ofmany of the stores' long-lived assets was not recoverable. For the stores withinsufficient estimated cash flows, we wrote down the associated long-livedassets to their estimated fair value.     For a completediscussion on the 2006 impairment, see the subsection titled “Impairment ofLong-Lived Assets and Other Charges” below, under the section titled “2006Compared to 2005” of MD&A.     These impairmentcharges, aggregating $2.7 million and $44.3 million, respectively, for 2007 and2006 were recorded within impairment of long-lived assets and other charges inthe accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income.           25            NET INTERESTEXPENSE     Consolidatedinterest expense, net of interest income, was $16.2 million for 2007 versus$36.9 million for 2006, a decrease of $20.7 million or 56%.  Interest expensedecreased 12% to $38.8 million in 2007 from $44.3 million in 2006. This decreasewas attributable to lower average outstanding debt, which was partially offsetby rising interest rates on our floating rate debt exposure.     Interest incomeincreased 205% to $22.6 million in 2007 from $7.4 million in 2006. This increasewas due to a higher average investment balance for 2007, as well as higheraverage investment rates.  Additionally, we recorded $2.6million of interest income related to federal telecommunications excise taxrefunds during 2007.  See  Note 12  – “Federal ExciseTax” for a discussion of the impact of the federal telecommunications excisetax.     Weanticipate net interest expense for 2008 will be below the 2007 level, due tolarger average cash balances when compared to the prior year.     OTHER INCOME(LOSS)     For the year endedDecember 31, 2007, we recognized a net gain of $0.9 million relating to ourderivative exposure to Sirius. During the third quarter of 2007, we modified theexpected date at which we would settle the warrants, resulting in a $2.4 millionunrealized gain, which was offset by mark-to-market losses of $1.5 millionduring the year, compared to a loss of $5.9 million for the year ended December31, 2006.     Additionally, forthe year ended December 31, 2006, we had a $2.7 million loss related to an otherthan temporary impairment of other investments.     INCOME TAXPROVISION     The income tax provision for each quarterly periodreflects our current estimate of the effective tax rate for the full year,adjusted for any discrete events that are reported in the quarterly period inwhich they occur. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007,was 35.4% compared to 34.1% for the corresponding prior year period. The 2007effective tax rate was impacted by the net reversal in June 2007 ofapproximately $10.0 million in unrecognized tax benefits, deferred tax assetsand accrued interest. Refer to  Note 11  – “Income Taxes” ofour consolidated financial statements for additional information. This $10.0million reversal lowered our effective tax rate 273 basis points for the yearended December 31, 2007. Furthermore,  the effective tax rate for 2006 wasprimarily affected by the tax benefit associated with inventory donationsoccurring in the quarter ended June 30, 2006. During the second quarter of 2006,we donated approximately $20 million in inventory to charitable organizations ina manner that provided us with a tax deduction in excess of the inventory cost.The entire tax benefit attributable to this charitable donation deduction isreflected in the effective tax rate for the second quarter of2006.     2006COMPARED WITH 2005     RESULTSOF OPERATIONS     NET SALES ANDOPERATING REVENUES     Sales decreased 6.0% to $4,777.5 million in 2006 from$5,081.7 million in 2005. We also had a 5.6% decrease in comparable store sales.These changes were primarily the result of a 59.5% decrease in our serviceplatform sales  due primarilyto the manner in which we began recognizing sales of prepaid wireless airtime in2006  and a 5.2% decrease in our wireless platform sales.  In addition, all platforms wereaffected by the decline in the number of RadioShack company-operated stores as aresult of our restructuring program.           26          RadioShackCompany-Operated Stores     All sales in theplatforms below were impacted by the closure of the RadioShack company-operatedstores related to our restructuring program.      Sales in ourwireless platform decreased in dollars, but increased as a percentage of netsales and operating revenues in 2006, compared to 2005. These decreases wereprimarily driven by a decline in unit sales of wireless handsets. Factorscontributing to this sales decline included an unfavorable mix shift to prepaidhandsets from postpaid, a sluggish wireless industry environment, a sharp unitsales decline in the northeastern United States, and fewer RadioShack stores.These decreases were partially offset by the introduction of various GPSproducts.     Sales in ouraccessory platform increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales andoperating revenues in 2006, compared to 2005. These increases were primarily theresult of higher sales of digital music accessories associated with higher salesof digital music players included in our personal electronics platform, inaddition to higher Bluetooth wireless accessories and flash memory sales. Theseincreases were partially offset by a decline in home entertainment accessorysales.     Sales in ourpersonal electronics platform increased in both dollars and as a percentage ofnet sales and operating revenues in 2006, compared to 2005. These salesincreases were driven primarily by increased sales of digital music players,offset by decreases in most of the remaining personal electronicscategories.     Sales in our modernhome platform decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales andoperating revenues in 2006, compared to 2005. These decreases were primarily dueto lower sales of telephones, home computers, and DVD players, which werepartially offset by increased sales of flat panel televisions.     Sales in our powerplatform decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales andoperating revenues in 2006, compared to 2005. These sales decreases were dueprimarily to a decrease in sales of both general and special purpose batteriescaused by factors such as reduced sales of products requiring batteries andcustomer tendencies to simply replace older cordless phones rather thanreplacing their batteries.     Sales in ourtechnical platform decreased in dollars, but increased slightly as a percentageof net sales and operating revenues in 2006, compared to 2005. The dollardecrease was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of specialtytools.     Sales in ourservice platform decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales andoperating revenues in 2006, compared to 2005. These decreases were primarilyattributable to a change in the manner in which we recognize income associatedwith sales of prepaid wireless airtime. Beginning in 2006, principally as aresult of changes in our agreements with wireless carriers, we no longer recordthe full value of airtime purchased by customers, but rather record only ourmarkup on the sale as revenue. This change reduced our total company-operatedstores revenue by approximately $134.6 million for 2006, as compared to thecorresponding prior year period, but had no impact on our gross profit oroperating income.     Other revenuedecreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operatingrevenues, due primarily to our 2006 store closures and, to a lesser extent, adecline in store repair revenue.     Kiosks     Kiosk salesincreased $77.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, when compared tothe prior year period. This increase was primarily the result of an increase inthe number of Sprint Nextel kiosks in late 2005 that operated for all of2006.           27             OtherSales     Other sales were up$19.0 million for 2006, or an increase of 5.6%, when compared to 2005. Thesesales increases were primarily due to an increase in sales to our network ofindependent dealers and an increase in Web site sales. These increases werepartially offset by the negative impact of five service centers, which we soldor closed in 2006.      GROSSPROFIT     Consolidated gross profit for 2006 was $2,129.4million or 44.6% of net sales and operating revenues, compared with $2,266.7million or 44.6% of net sales and operating revenues in 2005, resulting in a6.1% decrease in gross profit. The decrease in gross profit dollars wasprimarily the result of a decrease in net sales and operating revenues; theimpact of inventory liquidation related to the store closures involved in therestructuring program;  a mixchange toward lower gross margin products, including higher relative sales ofwireless prepaid and upgrade handsets and lower margin accessories; and moreaggressive promotional activity .  The gross margin rate was positivelyaffected by the change in the manner in which we began recognizing incomeassociated with sales of prepaid wireless airtime in 2006, as discussedabove.     SELLING, GENERALAND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE     Our consolidatedSG&A expense increased slightly in dollars and increased as a percent of netsales and operating revenues to 37.9% for the year ended December 31, 2006, from35.5% for the year ended December 31, 2005.  The dollar increase for 2006 wasprimarily due to an increase in payroll and commissions, plus rent expense; thisincrease was substantially offset by a decrease in advertising expense. However, headcount reductions from store closures, service center closures andcorporate headquarters reductions helped lower compensation expense (excludingthe severance charges) in the third and fourth quarters of 2006.     Payroll andcommissions expense increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales andoperating revenues. These increases were primarily the result of pay planchanges for RadioShack company-operated stores initiated in early 2006,severance related to our restructuring program, utilization of more labor hoursin our company-operated stores during the first half of the year, and increasedheadcount in our kiosk operations. We also began the required expensing of stockoptions as of January 1, 2006, which increased compensation expense by $12.0million, when compared to 2005.     Rent expenseincreased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues.The rent increase was primarily driven by a full year of rental payments on ourcorporate campus, as well as the addition of kiosk locations, which waspartially offset by store closures.     Advertising expensedecreased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues.This decrease was primarily due to a change in our media strategy, as we changedthe mix of media used in our advertising program from television to more radioand newspaper usage, as well as reduced sponsorship programs.     Professional feesincreased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues.The increase relates to the defense costs for certain class action lawsuits,including $5.1 million of the $8.8 million discussed under  Note 13  - "Litigation" to our Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements, as well as the cost of consultants engaged in variousprojects.     DEPRECIATION ANDAMORTIZATION     Total depreciationand amortization increased $4.4 million to $128.2 million and increased to 2.7%of net sales and operating revenues, compared to 2.4% for 2005. The increase indepreciation was primarily attributable to our new corporate headquarters,increased spending for our store remodel program, information system projects,and the amortization of intangibles related to our SAM’S CLUB kioskbusiness.           28         IMPAIRMENT OFLONG-LIVED ASSETS AND OTHER CHARGES     InFebruary 2006, as part of our restructuring program, our board of directorsapproved the closure of 400 to 700 RadioShack company-operated stores. Duringthe first half of 2006, we identified the stores for closure and subsequentlyperformed the impairment test. Based on the remaining estimated future cashflows related to these specific stores, it was determined that the net bookvalue of some of the stores' long-lived assets to be held for use was notrecoverable. For the stores with insufficient estimated cash flows, we wrotedown the associated long-lived assets to their estimated fair value, resultingin a $9.2 million impairment loss related to our RadioShack company-operatedstore segment. By July 31, 2006, we had closed 481 specific stores under therestructuring program; there were no additional closures under this program forthe remainder of the year.     Also, we purchasedcertain assets from Wireless Retail, Inc. during the fourth quarter of 2004 for$59.6 million, which resulted in the recognition of $18.6 million of goodwilland a $32.1 million intangible asset related to a five-year agreement with SAM'SCLUB to operate wireless kiosks in approximately 540 SAM'S CLUB locationsnationwide. These assets relate to our kiosk segment. As a result of continuedcompany and wireless industry growth challenges, together with changes in oursenior leadership team during the third quarter of 2006 that resulted in arefocus on allocation of capital and resources towards other areas of ourbusiness, we determined that our long-lived assets, including goodwillassociated with our kiosk operations, were impaired. We performed impairmenttests on both the long-lived assets associated with our SAM'S CLUB agreement,including the intangible asset relating to the five-year agreement, and theaccompanying goodwill.     With respect to thelong-lived tangible and intangible assets, we compared their carrying valueswith their estimated fair values using a discounted cash flow model, whichreflected our lowered expectations of wireless revenue growth and the ceasedexpansion of our kiosk business, and determined that the intangible assetrelating to the five-year agreement was impaired. This assessment resulted in a$10.7 million impairment charge to the intangible asset related to our kiosksegment in 2006. The remaining intangible balance will be amortized over theremaining life of the SAM'S CLUB agreement, which is scheduled to expire inSeptember 2009. The balance at December 31, 2006, was $7.8 million.     With respect to thegoodwill of $18.6 million, we estimated the fair value of the SAM'S CLUBreporting unit using a discounted cash flow model similar to that used in thelong-lived asset impairment test. We compared it with the carrying value of thereporting unit and determined that the goodwill was impaired.  As thecarrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, we thencompared the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with thecarrying amount of goodwill. This resulted in an $18.6 million impairment ofgoodwill related to our kiosk segment in 2006.     Additionally, basedon historical and expected cash flows for company-operated stores and kiosks, werecorded an impairment charge of $4.6 million related to property and equipmentand an impairment charge of $1.2 million related to goodwill.     These impairmentcharges, aggregating $44.3 million, were recorded within impairment oflong-lived assets and other charges in the accompanying 2006 ConsolidatedStatement of Income.     NET INTERESTEXPENSE     Consolidatedinterest expense, net of interest income, was $36.9 million for 2006 versus$38.6 million for 2005, a decrease of $1.7 million or 4%.     Interest expensedecreased slightly to $44.3 million in 2006 from $44.5 million in 2005. Thisdecrease in the interest expense during 2006 was attributable to lower averageoutstanding debt, which was partially offset by rising interest rates on ourfloating rate debt exposure.     Interest incomeincreased 25% to $7.4 million in 2006 from $5.9 million in 2005. These changeswere due to a higher average investment balance for 2006, as well as increasesin investment rates.           29         OTHER INCOME(LOSS)     For the year endedDecember 31, 2006, we recognized a loss of $8.6 million in other income (loss).This loss included $5.9 million relating to our derivative exposure to Siriuswarrants, which was a result of the required mark-to-market accounting treatmentof these warrants. The additional $2.7 million related to an other thantemporary impairment of other investments.     During the firstquarter of 2005, we sold all rights, title and interest to the “Tandy” namewithin Australia and New Zealand to an affiliate of Dick Smith Electronics, anAustralia-based consumer electronics retailer. This transaction resulted in therecognition of $10.2 million in other income in 2005.     INCOME TAXPROVISION     Our provision forincome taxes reflects an effective income tax rate of 34.1% for 2006, and 16.0%for 2005. The fluctuation in the effective tax rate during 2006 was dueprimarily to the tax benefit associated with inventory donations occurring inthe quarter ended June 30, 2006. During the second quarter of 2006, we donatedapproximately $20 million in inventory to charitable organizations in a mannerthat provided us with a tax deduction in excess of the inventory cost. Theentire tax benefit attributable to this charitable donation deduction isreflected in the effective tax rate for the second quarter. The lower effectivetax rate in 2005 was principally due to a favorable non-cash income tax benefitof $56.5 million relating to the release of a tax contingency reserve upon theexpiration of the associated statute of limitations. This reserve related tolosses sustained in connection with our European operations, which were fullydissolved by 1995. The release of the reserve occurred in the third quarter of2005 because the statute of limitations governing these issues expired onSeptember 30, 2005.     RECENTLYISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS     Refer to  Note 2  – “Summary of SignificantAccounting Policies” under the section titled  “Recently Issued AccountingPronouncements” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.     CASHFLOW AND LIQUIDITY  Asummary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities isoutlined in the table below.                   Year Ended      December 31,         (In      millions)       2007          2006          2005         Operating      activities      $  379.0        $  314.8        $  362.9        Investing      activities         (42.0  )        (79.3  )        39.3        Financing      activities         (299.3  )        12.5           (616.1  )        CashFlow – Operating Activities     Cash flows fromoperating activities provide us with the majority of our liquidity. Cashprovided by operating activities in 2007 was $379.0 million, compared to $314.8million and $362.9 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash provided by netincome plus non-cash adjustments to net income was $358.9 million in 2007compared to $230.7 million in 2006. The 2007 increase was due to an increase inoperating income in 2007, compared to the prior year. Cash provided by workingcapital components was $20.1 million and $84.1 million for years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.           30         CashFlow – Investing Activities     Cash used ininvesting activities was $42.0 million and $79.3 million in 2007 and 2006,respectively, while $39.3 million in cash was provided in 2005. The 2007decrease was primarily the result of reduced capital spending during 2007.Capital expenditures for these periods related primarily to retail stores andinformation systems projects. We received $220.4 million in net proceeds fromthe sale and leaseback of our corporate campus during the fourth quarter of2005. We anticipate that our capital expenditure requirements for 2008 willrange from $80 million to $100 million. RadioShack company-operated storeremodels and relocations, as well as information systems updates, will accountfor the majority of our anticipated 2008 capital expenditures. As of December31, 2007, we had $509.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cashequivalents, along with cash generated from our net sales and operating revenuesand, when necessary, from our credit facilities, are available to fund futurecapital expenditure needs.     Cash Flow – Fina ncingActivities     Cash used in financing activities was $299.3 millionand $616.1 million for 2007 and 2005, respectively, compared to cash provided of$12.5 million in 2006.  We usedcash of $208.5 million to repurchase our common stock during 2007; however,we  did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2006. The2007 stock repurchases were partially funded by $81.3 million received fromstock option exercises. The balance of capital to repurchase shares was obtainedfrom cash generated from operations.  Additionally, we paid off our $150.0million ten-year unsecured note payable which matured on September 4,2007.     FreeCash Flow     Our free cash flow,defined as cash flows from operating activities less dividends paid andadditions to property, plant and equipment, was $300.9 million in 2007, $189.9million in 2006 and $158.5 million in 2005. The consecutive increases in freecash flow were the result of a decrease in cash used by working capitalcomponents, primarily inventory, as well as a decrease in capitalexpenditures.     Webelieve free cash flow is a relevant indicator of our ability to repay maturingdebt, change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that managementbelieves will enhance shareholder value. The comparable financial measure tofree cash flow under generally accepted accounting principles is cash flows fromoperating activities, which was $379.0 million in 2007, $314.8 million in 2006and $362.9 million in 2005. We do not intend for the presentation of free cashflow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to be considered in isolation or as asubstitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.     The following tableis a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cashflow.                   Year Ended      December 31,         (In      millions)       2007          2006          2005         Net cash      provided by operating activities      $  379.0        $  314.8        $  362.9        Less:                                            Additions      to property, plant and equipment         45.3           91.0           170.7          Dividends      paid         32.8           33.9           33.7                                                     Free cash      flow      $  300.9        $  189.9        $  158.5           CAPITALSTRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION     Weconsider our capital structure and financial condition to be sound. We had$509.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2007, as a resourcefor our funding needs. Additionally, we have available to us $625 million ofbank credit facilities. As of December 31, 2007, we had no borrowings underthese credit facilities. For a discussion of the expected effect of ourrestructuring program on capital structure and financial condition, see“Financial Impact of Restructuring Program” below.           31         DebtObligations     DebtRatings:  Below are the agencies’ ratings by category, as well as theirrespective current outlook for the ratings, as of February 15,2008.         Category       Standard and      Poor’s       Moody's       Fitch      Senior      unsecured debt       BB       Ba1       BB      Outlook       Negative       Stable       Negative         OnMarch 12, 2007, Moody’s lowered its long-term rating to Ba1, long-term outlookto stable, and short-term rating to NP. These actions followed the announcementof our 2006 financial results. On June 21, 2007, Fitch lowered its long-termrating to BB and kept its rating outlook as negative. Factors that could impactour future credit ratings include free cash flow and cash levels, changes in ouroperating performance, the adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy, theeconomic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electronicsindustries, continued sales declines in comparable stores, our financialposition and changes in our business strategy. If further downgrades occur, theywill adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs, access todebt capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new store occupancycosts. Due to improvements in liquidity, we terminated our commercial paperprogram during the third quarter of 2007.     Our seniorunsecured debt primarily consists of an issuance of 10-year long-term notes andan issuance of a medium term note.     Long-TermNotes:  We have a $300 million debt shelf registration statement whichbecame effective in August 1997. In August 1997, we issued $150 million of10-year unsecured long-term notes under this shelf registration. The interestrate on the notes was 6.95% per annum with interest payable on September 1 andMarch 1 of each year. These notes contained customary non-financial covenants.In September 2007, our $150 million ten-year unsecured note payable came due.Upon maturity, we paid off the $150 million note payable utilizing our availablecash and cash equivalents.     OnMay 11, 2001, we issued $350 million of 10-year 7.375% notes in a privateoffering to initial purchasers who in turn offered the notes to qualifiedinstitutional buyers under SEC Rule 144A. The annual interest rate on the notesis 7.375% per annum with interest payable on November 15 and May 15 of eachyear. The notes contain certain non-financial covenants and mature on May 15,2011. In August 2001, under the terms of an exchange offering filed with theSEC, we exchanged substantially all of these notes for a similar amount ofpublicly registered notes. The exchange resulted in substantially all of thenotes becoming registered with the SEC and did not result in additional debtbeing issued.     During the thirdquarter of 2001, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with anunderlying notional amount of $110.5 million and a maturity in September 2007.This interest rate swap agreement expired in conjunction with the maturity ofthe note payable. In June and August 2003, we entered into interest rate swapagreements with underlying notional amounts of debt of $100 million and $50million, respectively, and maturities in May 2011. These swaps effectivelyconvert a portion of our long-term fixed rate debt to a variable rate. Weentered into these agreements to balance our fixed versus floating rate debtportfolio to continue to take advantage of lower short-term interest rates.Under these agreements, we have contracted to pay a variable rate of LIBOR plusa markup, and to receive a fixed rate of 6.95% for the swap entered into in2001, and 7.375% for the swaps entered into in 2003. We have designated theseagreements as fair value hedging instruments. We recorded an amount in othernon-current liabilities, net, of $1.5 million and $8.5 million (their fairvalue) at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, for the swap agreements andadjusted the fair value of the related debt by the same amount. Fair value wascomputed based on the market’s current anticipation of quarterly LIBOR ratelevels from the present until the swaps’ maturities.     Medium-TermNotes:  We also issued, in various amounts and on various dates fromDecember 1997 through September 1999, medium-term notes totaling $150 millionunder the shelf registration described above. At December 31, 2007, $5 millionof these notes remained outstanding with an interest rate of 6.42%; theycontained customary non-financial covenants. As of December 31, 2007, there wasno availability under this shelf registration. In January 2008, the remaining $5million of the medium-term notes payable came due, and was paid off utilizingour available cash and cash equivalents.           32            AvailableFinancing     CreditFacilities:  At December 31, 2007, we had an aggregate of $625 millionborrowing capacity available under our existing credit facilities. Thesefacilities consist of the following:         Amount      of Facility    Expiration      Date      $300      million    June      2009      $325      million    May      2011         These creditfacilities support commercial paper issuance, as well as provide us a source ofliquidity if the commercial paper market is unavailable to us. As of December31, 2007, there were no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities,nor were these facilities utilized during 2007. Interest charges under thesefacilities are derived using a base LIBOR rate plus a margin which changes basedon our credit ratings. Our bank syndicated credit facilities have customaryterms and covenants, and we were in compliance with these covenants at December31, 2007.     InJune 2006, we replaced our existing $300 million five-year credit facility,which was to expire in June 2007, with a $325 million five-year credit agreementexpiring May 2011. The new facility has a more favorable fixed charge coverageratio and provides for the exclusion of cash restructuring expenses from thecovenant calculation. We also amended the $300 million facility expiring in June2009 to include similar covenants and terminated our $130 million 364-dayrevolving credit facility.     Webelieve that our present ability to borrow is adequate for our business needs.However, if market conditions change, gross profit were to dramatically decline,or we could not control operating costs, our cash flows and liquidity could bereduced. Additionally, if a scenario as described above occurred, it could causethe rating agencies to lower our credit ratings further, thereby increasing ourborrowing costs, or even causing a further reduction in or elimination of ouraccess to debt and/or equity markets.     Capitalization     The following tablesets forth information about our capitalization on the datesindicated.                   December      31,                   2007          2006            (Dollars      in millions)       Dollars          % of Total      Capitalization          Dollars          % of Total      Capitalization         Current      debt      $  61.2           5.2  %     $  194.9           16.3  %     Long-term      debt         348.2           29.5           345.8           29.0          Total      debt         409.4           34.7           540.7           45.3        Stockholders’      equity         769.7           65.3           653.8           54.7        Total      capitalization      $  1,179.1           100.0  %     $  1,194.5           100.0  %        Our debt-to-totalcapitalization ratio decreased in 2007 from 2006, due primarily to a $131.3million decrease in total debt primarily related to the repayment of ourmedium-term notes payable in September 2007.     Dividends     Wehave paid common stock cash dividends for 21 consecutive years.  OnNovember 12, 2007, our Board of Directors declared an annual dividend of $0.25per share. The dividend was paid on December 19, 2007, to stockholders of recordon November 29, 2007.  Thedividend payment of $32.8 million was funded from cash onhand.     OperatingLeases     Weuse operating leases, primarily for our retail locations, two distributioncenters, and our corporate campus, to lower our capitalrequirements.           33         ShareRepurchases     OnFebruary 25, 2005, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase programwith no expiration date authorizing management to repurchase up to $250 millionin open market purchases.  On August 5, 2005, we suspended purchases underthe $250 million share repurchase program during the period in which a financialinstitution purchased shares pursuant to an overnight share repurchase program.During March 2007, management resumed share repurchases under the $250 millionprogram; however, no shares were repurchased during the second and fourthquarters of 2007. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased8.7 million shares or $208.5 million of our common stock. As of December 31,2007, there was $1.4 million available for share repurchases under the $250million share repurchase program.     SeasonalInventory Buildup     Typically, ourannual cash requirements for pre-seasonal inventory buildup range between $200million and $400 million. The funding required for this buildup comes primarilyfrom cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and operating revenues. Wehad $509.7 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2007, as aresource for our funding needs. Additionally, borrowings may be utilized to fundthe inventory buildup as described in “Available Financing” above.     Contractualand Credit Commitments     The followingtables, as well as the information contained in  Note 7  -"Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities" to our Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements, provide a summary of our various contractual commitments, debt andinterest repayment requirements, and available credit lines.     The table belowcontains our known contractual commitments as of December 31, 2007.         (In      millions)       Payments Due      by Period            Contractual      Obligations       Total Amounts      Committed          Less Than 1      Year          1-3      Years          3-5      Years          Over 5      Years         Long-term      debt obligations      $  356.0        $  5.0        $  --        $  350.0        $  1.0        Interest      obligations         88.5           26.3           52.4           9.7           0.1        Operating      lease obligations         922.6           196.0           305.9           153.7           267.0        Purchase obligations  (1)         334.3           310.5           23.8           --           --        Other      long-term liabilities    reflected on the balance sheet       (2)         123.7           --           60.3            26.3            37.1        Total      $  1,825.1        $  537.8        $  442.4        $  539.7        $  305.2               (1)    Purchase      obligations include our product commitments, marketing agreements and      freight commitments.

The majority of these contingent liabilitiesrelates to various lease obligations arising from leases assigned to CompUSA,Inc. (“CompUSA”) as part of the sale of our Computer City, Inc. subsidiary toCompUSA in August 1998. In the event CompUSA or the other assignees, asapplicable, are unable to fulfill their obligations, the lessors of suchlocations may seek to recover the unpaid rent from us.     OnFebruary 27, 2007, CompUSA announced a comprehensive realignment strategy toimprove its financial status. According to their press release, the realignmentincluded a $440 million cash infusion, closure of 126 stores, major expensereductions and a corporate restructuring. A portion of the 126 store closuresrepresents locations where we may be liable for the rent payments on theunderlying lease. During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, we receivednotices from two lessors seeking payment from us as a result of CompUSA being indefault for non-payment of rent. CompUSA has also informed us that there are anadditional 17 leases on which CompUSA has ceased making rent payments. CompUSAreported on December 7, 2007, that they were acquired by the Gordon BrothersGroup. CompUSA stores ceased operations in January 2008. DJM Realty, a divisionof Gordon Brothers Group, is currently in discussions with its lessors in aneffort to negotiate a satisfactory fulfillment of their legal obligation underthese leases.     Based on allavailable information pertaining to the status of these leases, and afterapplying the provisions set forth within SFAS No. 5, “Accounting forContingencies,” and FIN 14, “Reasonable Estimation of a Loss, An Interpretationof SFAS No. 5,” during the fourth quarter of 2007, we established an accrual of$7.5 million, recorded in current liabilities. It is reasonably possible that achange in our estimate of our probable liability could occur in the near term.We are continuing to monitor this situation and will update as necessary as moreinformation becomes available.     FINANCIALIMPACT OF RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM     Asdiscussed previously, our 2006 restructuring program, as originally stated inFebruary 2006, contained four key components:          ·     Update      our inventory          ·    Focus on our      top-performing RadioShack company-operated stores, while closing 400 to      700 RadioShack company-operated stores and aggressively relocate other      RadioShack company-operated stores          ·    Consolidate      our distribution centers          ·    Reduce our      overhead costs         Store Closures: As of December 31, 2006, we had closed 481 stores as a result of ourrestructuring program. Our decision to close these stores was made on astore-by-store basis, and there was no geographic concentration of closings forthese stores. For these closed stores, we recognized a charge in 2006 of $9.1million to SG&A for future lease obligations and negotiated buy-outs withlandlords. A lease obligation reserve is not recognized until a store has beenclosed or when a buy-out agreement has been reached with the landlord. Regardingthe 481 stores we closed as a result of the restructuring program during theyear ended December 31, 2006, we recorded an impairment charge of $9.2 millionrelated to the long-lived assets associated with certain of these stores. It wasdetermined that the net book value of several of the stores' long-lived assetswas not recoverable based on the remaining estimated future cash flows relatedto these specific stores. We also recognized $2.1 million in accelerateddepreciation associated with closed store assets for which the useful lives hadbeen changed due to the store closures.           35         Inconnection with these store closures, we identified 601 retail employees whosepositions were terminated by December 31, 2006. These employees were paidseverance, and some earned retention bonuses if they remained employed untilcertain agreed-upon dates. The development of a reserve for these costs began onthe date that the terms of severance benefits were established and communicatedto the employees, and the reserve was recognized over the minimum retentionperiod. As of December 31, 2006, $3.8 million had been recognized in SG&A asretention and severance benefits for store employees, with $3.6 million inbenefits paid to date. Additionally, as part of our store closure activities, weincurred and recognized in SG&A $6.1 million in expenses in 2006 primarilyin connection with fees paid to outside liquidators and for close-outpromotional activities for the 481 stores.     All storesidentified for closure under the restructuring program were closed as of July31, 2006. Additionally, we continue to negotiate buy-out agreements with ourlandlords; however, remaining lease obligations of $2.2 million still existed atDecember 31, 2007. There is uncertainty as to when, and at what cost, we willfully settle all remaining lease obligations.     DistributionCenter Consolidations:  We closed a distribution center located inSouthaven, Mississippi, and sold a distribution center in Charleston, SouthCarolina, in 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized alease obligation charge in SG&A in the amount of $2.0 million on the leaseof the Southaven distribution center and a gain of $2.7 million on the sale ofthe Charleston distribution center. We also incurred a $0.5 million chargerelated to severance for approximately 100 employees.  Additionally,there were $0.4 million in other expenses.     Service CenterOperations:  We closed or sold five service center locations during theyear ended December 31, 2006, resulting in the elimination of approximately 350positions. We recognized charges to SG&A of $1.2 million and $0.9 millionrelated to lease obligations and severance, respectively. This severanceobligation was paid as of December 31, 2006. Additionally, there were $0.1million in other expenses.     Overhead CostReductions:  Management conducted a review of our cost structure toidentify potential sources of cost reductions. In connection with this review,we made decisions to lower these costs, including reducing our advertising spendrate in connection with adjustments to our media mix. During the year endedDecember 31, 2006, we reduced our workforce by approximately 514 positions,primarily within our corporate headquarters. We recorded charges to SG&A fortermination benefits and related costs of $11.9 million, of which $6.4 millionhad been paid as of December 31, 2006. During 2007, severance payments totaling$5.0 million were paid, leaving an accrued severance balance of $0.7 million asof December 31, 2007.     Inventory Update: We have been replacing underperforming merchandise with new,faster-moving merchandise. We recorded a pre-tax charge to cost of products soldof approximately $62 million during the fourth quarter of 2005, as a result ofboth our normal inventory review process and the inventory update aspect of ourrestructuring program.           36         The following tablesummarizes the activity related to the 2006 restructuring program from February17, 2006, through December 31, 2007:                                     Asset          Accelerated                           (In      millions)       Severance          Leases          Impairments          Depreciation          Other          Total         Total charges      for 2006      $  16.1        $  12.3        $  9.2        $  2.1        $  4.9        $  44.6                                                                                         Total      spending for 2006,  net of      amounts realized  from sale of      fixed assets         (10.4  )        (8.5  )           --              --           (4.6  )        (23.5  )        Total      non-cash items         --           0.9           (9.2  )        (2.1  )        (0.2  )        (10.6  )     Accrual at      December 31,  2006          5.7            4.7            --            --            0.1            10.5                                                                                         Total      spending for 2007         (5.0  )        (3.9  )        --           --           (0.1  )        (9.0  )                                                                                      Additions for      2007                     1.4           --           --           --           1.4        Accrual at      December 31,  2007      $  0.7        $  2.2        $  --        $  --        $  --        $  2.9           See the allocationof our restructuring charges within our segments in  Note 28 – “Segment Reporting” in the Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements.     OFF-BALANCESHEET ARRANGEMENTS  Other than theoperating leases described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet financingarrangements, transactions, or special purpose entities.     INFLATION  With the exceptionof recent increases in energy costs, inflation has not significantly impacted usover the past three years. We do not expect inflation to have a significantimpact on our operations in the foreseeable future, unless international eventssubstantially affect the global economy.     CRITICALACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  Our consolidatedfinancial statements are prepared in accordance with generally acceptedaccounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States. The application of GAAPrequires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values ofassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reportedamount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and the relateddisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The use of estimates ispervasive throughout our financial statements and is affected by managementjudgment and uncertainties. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are basedon historical experience, current market trends and other factors that webelieve to be relevant and reasonable at the time the consolidated financialstatements are prepared. We continually evaluate the information used to makethese estimates as our business and the economic environment change. Actualresults may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptionsor conditions.     Inthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe our significantaccounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financialstatements. The accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical arerevenue recognition; inventory valuation under the cost method; estimation ofreserves and valuation allowances specifically related to insurance, tax andlegal contingencies; valuation of long-lived assets and intangibles, includinggoodwill; and stock-based compensation.     Weconsider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requiresdifficult, subjective or complex judgments, and is material to the portrayal ofour financial condition, changes in financial condition or results ofoperations. The selection, application and disclosure of our critical accountingpolicies and estimates have been reviewed by the Audit and Compliance Committeeof our Board of Directors.           37             RevenueRecognition:  Our revenue is derived principally from the sale of privatelabel and third-party branded products and services to consumers. Revenue isrecognized, net of an estimate for customer refunds and product returns, whenpersuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or serviceshave been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibilityis reasonably assured.      Certain products,such as wireless telephone handsets, require the customer to use the services ofa third-party service provider. In most cases, the third-party service providerpays us a fee or commission for obtaining a new customer, as well as a monthlyrecurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the serviceprovider and the customer. Fee or commission revenue, net of a reserve forestimated service deactivations, is generally recognized at the time thecustomer is accepted as a subscriber of a third-party service provider, whilethe residual revenue is recognized on a monthly basis.     Estimated productrefunds and returns, service plan deactivations, residual revenue and commissionrevenue adjustments are based on historical information pertaining to theseitems. If actual results differ from these estimates due to various factors, theamount of revenue recorded could be materially affected. A 10% difference in ourreserves for the estimates noted above would have affected net sales andoperating revenues by approximately $2.2 million for the fiscal year endedDecember 31, 2007.     InventoryValuation:  Our inventory consists primarily of finished goods availablefor sale at our retail locations or within our distribution centers and isrecorded at the lower of average cost (which approximates FIFO) or market. Thecost components recorded within inventory are the vendor invoice cost andcertain allocated external and internal freight, distribution, warehousing andother costs relating to merchandise acquisition required to bring themerchandise from the vendor to the point-of-sale.     Typically, themarket value of our inventory is higher than its aggregate cost. Determinationof the market value may be very complex and, therefore, requires a high degreeof judgment. In order for management to make the appropriate determination ofmarket value, the following items are commonly considered: inventory turnoverstatistics, current selling prices, seasonality factors, consumer trends,competitive pricing, performance of similar products or accessories, plannedpromotional incentives, technological obsolescence, and estimated costs to sellor dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions.     Ifthe estimated market value, calculated as the amount we expect to realize, netof estimated selling costs, from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory,is determined to be less than the recorded cost, we record a provision to reducethe carrying amount of the inventory item to its net realizable value.Differences between management estimates and actual performance and pricing ofour merchandise could result in inventory valuations that differ from the amountrecorded at the financial statement date and could also cause fluctuations inthe amount of recorded cost of products sold.     Ifour estimates regarding market value are inaccurate or changes in consumerdemand affect certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may be exposed tomaterial losses or gains in excess of our established valuationreserve.     Estimationof Reserves and Valuation Allowances:  The amount of liability we recordfor claims related to insurance, tax and legal contingencies requires us to makejudgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We useour history and experience, as well as other specific circumstances surroundingthese claims, in evaluating the amount of liability we should record. Asadditional information becomes available, we assess the potential liabilityrelated to our various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate. These revisions  couldmaterially impact our results of operations and financial position orliquidity.           38            Weare insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation, property andother liability claims, with deductibles up to $1.0 million per occurrence. Thisinsurance coverage limits our exposure for any catastrophic claims that mayarise above the deductible. We also have a self-insured health programadministered by a third party covering the majority of our employees thatparticipate in our health insurance programs. We estimate the amount of ourreserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reportingperiod. This estimate is based on historical claims experience, demographicfactors, severity factors, and other factors we deem relevant. A 10% change inour insurance reserves at December 31, 2007, would have affected net income byapproximately $5.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. As ofDecember 31, 2007, actual losses had not exceeded our expectations.Additionally, for claims that exceed our deductible amount, we record a grossliability and corresponding  receivablerepresenting expected recoveries, since we are not legally relieved of ourobligation to the claimant.     Weare subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign taxauthorities related to income tax, sales and use tax, personal property tax, andother forms of taxation. These audits examine our tax positions, timing ofincome and deductions, and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions.As part of our evaluation of these tax issues, we establish reserves in ourconsolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable taxexposures. Effective January 1, 2007, we began recognizing uncertain income taxpositions based on our assessment of whether the tax position was more likelythan not to be sustained on audit, as set forth within FASB Interpretation No.48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASBStatement No. 109.” Depending on the nature of the tax issue, we could besubject to audit over several years; therefore, our estimated reserve balancesmight exist for multiple years before an issue is resolved by the taxingauthority.     Additionally, weare involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated withemployment and other matters. A reserve has been established based on our bestestimates of the potential liability in these matters. This estimate has beendeveloped in consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel and is basedupon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies.     Although we believethat our tax and legal reserves are based on reasonable judgments and estimates,actual results could differ, which may expose us to material gains or losses infuture periods. These actual results could materially affect our effective taxrate, earnings, deferred tax balances and cash flows in the period ofresolution.     Valuation ofLong-Lived Assets and Intangibles, Including Goodwill:  Long-lived assets,such as property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment when events orchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not berecoverable, such as historical operating losses or plans to dispose of or selllong-lived assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives. Thecarrying amount is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of theundiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual dispositionof the asset. If the carrying amount is not recoverable, we recognize animpairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fairvalue. Fair value is determined by discounting expected future cash flows usingour risk-free rate of interest.     Impairment losses,if any, are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs. The carryingvalue of the asset is adjusted to the new carrying value, and any subsequentincreases in fair value are not recorded. Additionally, if it is determined thatthe estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased, theperiodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new carrying value of theasset.     The impairmentcalculation requires us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cashflows, strategic plans, useful lives and discount rates. If actual results arenot consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed toadditional impairment charges, which could be material to our results ofoperations.     Wehave acquired goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assetsrelated to business acquisitions that have occurred during prior years. Theoriginal valuation of these intangible assets is based on estimates for futureprofitability, cash flows and other judgmental factors. We review our goodwilland other intangible asset balances on an annual basis, during the fourthquarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carryingvalue of goodwill or an intangible asset might exceed their current fairvalue.           39            The determinationof fair value is based on various valuation techniques such as discounted cashflow and other comparable market analyses. These valuation techniques require usto make estimates and assumptions regarding future profitability, industryfactors, planned strategic initiatives, discount rates and other factors. Ifactual results or performance of certain business units are different from ourestimates, we may be exposed to an impairment charge related to our goodwill orintangible assets. The total value of our goodwill and intangible assets atDecember 31, 2007, was $7.9 million.     Stock-BasedCompensation : We have historically granted certain stock-based awards toemployees and directors in the form of non-qualified stock options, incentivestock options, restricted stock and  deferred stockunits. See  Note 2  - “Summary of Significant AccountingPolicies” and  Note 16  - “Stock-Based Incentive Plans” fora more complete discussion of our stock-based compensationprograms.     Atthe date that an award is granted, we determine the fair value of the award andrecognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period, whichtypically is the period over which the award vests. The restricted stock anddeferred stock units are valued at the fair market value of our stock on thedate of grant. The fair value of stock options with only service conditions isestimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair value ofstock options with service and market conditions is valued utilizing the MonteCarlo simulation model. The Black-Scholes-Merton and Monte Carlo simulationmodels require management to apply judgment and use highly subjectiveassumptions, including expected option life, expected volatility, and expectedemployee forfeiture rate. We use historical data and judgment to estimate theexpected option life and the employee forfeiture rate, and use historical andimplied volatility when estimating the stock price volatility.     While theassumptions that we develop are based on our best expectations, they involveinherent uncertainties based on market conditions and employee behavior that areoutside of our control. If actual results are not consistent with theassumptions used, the stock-based compensation expense reported in our financialstatements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of thestock-based compensation. Additionally, if actual employee forfeituressignificantly differ from our estimated forfeitures, we may have an adjustmentto our financial statements in future periods. A 10% change in our stock-basedcompensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2007, would have affectedour net income by approximately $1.0 million.     Prior to calendaryear 2006, we followed the guidance under Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and its relatedinterpretations.     FACTORSTHAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS     Matters discussedin MD&A and in other parts of this report include forward-looking statementswithin the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A ofthe Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements arestatements that are not historical and may be identified by the use of wordssuch as “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “potential” orsimilar words. These matters include statements concerning management’s plansand objectives relating to our operations or economic performance and relatedassumptions. We specifically disclaim any duty to update any of the informationset forth in this report, including any forward-looking statements.Forward-looking statements are made based on management’s current expectationsand beliefs concerning future events and, therefore, involve a number ofassumptions, risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors described inItem 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Managementcautions that forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actualresults could differ materially from those expressed or implied in theforward-looking statements.           40             ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVEDISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.     AtDecember 31, 2007, our derivative instruments that materially increased ourexposure to market risks for interest rates, foreign currency rates, commodityprices or other market price risks were primarily the interest rate swaps notedin our MD&A and warrants we earned to acquire common stock of Sirius. We donot use derivatives for speculative purposes.     Our exposure tointerest rate risk results from changes in short-term interest rates. Interestrate risk exists with respect to our net investment position at December 31,2007, of $333.9 million, consisting of fluctuating short-term investments of$483.9 million and offset by $150 million of indebtedness which, because of ourinterest rate swaps, effectively bears interest at short-term floating rates. Ahypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the interest rate applicable tothis floating-rate net exposure would result in a decrease in annual netinterest expense of $3.3 million. This hypothesis assumes no change in theprincipal or investment balance.      Our exposure tomarket risk, specifically the equity markets, relates to warrants we earned asof December 31, 2006 and 2005, to purchase 2 million and 4 million shares,respectively, of Sirius stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share. We haverecorded these as assets using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation method. Ourmaximum exposure is equal to the carrying value at December 31, 2007, of $2.4million.     Wemanage our portfolio of fixed rate exposures, compared to floating rateexposure, to reduce our exposure to interest rate changes. The fair value of ourfixed rate long-term debt is sensitive to long-term interest rate changes.Interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the fair valueof our debt due to differences between market interest rates and rates at theinception of the debt obligation. Based on a hypothetical immediate 100 basispoint increase in interest rates at December 31, 2007 and 2006, the fair valueof our fixed rate long-term debt would decrease $11.7 million and $12.9 million,respectively. Based on a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point decrease ininterest rates at December 31, 2007 and 2006, the fair value of our fixed ratelong-term debt would increase by $12.1 million and $13.4 million, respectively.Regarding the fair value of our fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates haveno impact on our consolidated financial statements.     ITEM 8.
