ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (“MD&A”).     This MD&A section discusses our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, risk management practices, critical accounting policies, and estimates and certain factors that may affect our future results, including economic and industry-wide factors. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A above.     EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  RadioShack is a leading national retailer of innovative mobile technology products and services, as well as products related to personal and home technology and power supply needs. We offer a targeted assortment of wireless phones and other electronic products and services from leading national brands, exclusive private brands and major wireless carriers.     Our more than 7,200 locations in the U.S. and Mexico give us a unique competitive advantage in scale, reach and convenience. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our various competitors by providing:         ·      Innovative mobile technology products and services, as well as products related to personal and home technology and power supply needs, at competitive prices            ·      Convenient neighborhood locations            ·      Knowledgeable, objective and friendly service            ·      Unique private brand offers and exclusive branded promotions        Our day-to-day focus is concentrated on:         ·      Providing our customers with a positive in-store experience            ·      Growing gross profit dollars            ·      Controlling costs throughout the organization            ·      Utilizing funds generated from operations to enhance long-term shareholder value        External Factors Affecting Our Business  In 2011, we continued to experience a highly challenging U.S. economic environment and reduced consumer spending that began in the fourth quarter of 2008. Consumer spending on wireless handsets has increased significantly over the past several years. The spending growth for wireless handsets has been primarily driven by increased purchases of smartphones such as Apple’s iPhone and Android-based devices.     A smartphone is a wireless handset that offers more advanced computing ability, connectivity to the Internet, and multimedia capabilities than a basic feature wireless phone. Smartphones typically combine wireless handset capabilities with capabilities previously found on separate devices. Some examples include GPS (global positioning system) navigation, digital music players and camera capabilities. We believe this convergence of capabilities into smartphones has contributed to a decline in these product categories. This convergence trend is likely to continue as smartphones evolve and as more consumers adopt smartphone technology.     According to the Consumer Electronics Association (“CEA”), in 2012 the consumer electronics industry will surpass $200 billion in overall revenues in the U.S. for the first time. The industry is expected to grow 3.7 percent in 2012, after reaching an estimated $195.2 billion in revenues in 2011. Smartphones are expected to continue to be the primary revenue driver for the industry. Smartphone unit sales are expected to increase 24 percent in 2012 to 108.8 million units, with total revenue exceeding $33 billion.     The innovation in certain mature consumer electronic product categories, such as DVD players, camcorders and audio products, has not been sufficient to maintain average selling prices. These mature products have become commoditized, and we continue to experience price declines and reduced margins for them.     Business Performance  2011 was a year of progress and transitions for our business. During 2011, we successfully completed several initiatives:         ·      Added wireless offerings from Verizon Wireless to our portfolio of top national wireless carriers            ·      Successfully completed the rollout of our Target Mobile centers to 1,496 Target stores throughout the U.S.            ·      Closed our Chinese manufacturing plant to transition to a more efficient global sourcing operation            ·      Doubled our annual dividend to $0.50 per share to increase value returned to shareholders            ·      Maintained our liquidity by entering into a new $450 million credit facility that expires in January 2016.            ·      Enhanced our balance sheet by selling $325 million of 8-year 6.75% senior notes                19                    During 2011, our Mobility business, which includes postpaid and prepaid wireless handsets, commissions and residual income, prepaid wireless airtime, e-readers, and tablet devices, increased from 44.2% of our net sales and operating revenues in 2010 to 51.4% in 2011. This and other factors discussed later in this MD&A had an effect on the decrease of our gross margin rate in 2011.      During 2011, our business experienced a transition to a lower gross margin rate. This decrease in gross margin rate has been driven primarily by a transition towards lower margin products as discussed later in this MD&A.     T-Mobile to Verizon Transition:  In 2011, we notified T-Mobile that it had breached its agreement with us through which we offered T-Mobile wireless products and services in our U.S. company-operated stores. We ceased offering T-Mobile wireless products and services in our U.S. company-operated stores on September 14, 2011, and began offering Verizon products and services in our U.S. company-operated stores on September 15, 2011. In conjunction with this transition, we recognized a $2.6 million inventory valuation loss with respect to T-Mobile wireless handsets we had on hand at June 30, 2011, which was classified as additional cost of products sold. Furthermore, in conjunction with this transition, we incurred an additional charge to earnings of $23.4 million in the third quarter of 2011 relating to a payment to T-Mobile. We continue to sell T-Mobile wireless products and services in certain Target Mobile centers.     Our sales of Verizon products and services in our U.S. company-operated stores from September 15, 2011, through December 31, 2011, outperformed the sale of T-Mobile products and services in those stores during the same period last year, and we view this as a growth opportunity for us in 2012.     Target Mobile Centers:  By December 31, 2011, we had successfully completed our rollout of Target Mobile centers in 1,496 Target stores.     Closure of Chinese Manufacturing Plant:  We ceased production operations in our Chinese manufacturing plant during the second quarter of 2011. Since production operations ceased, we have continued to acquire inventory similar to that previously produced by this facility from alternative product sourcing channels. In conjunction with the plant closing, we incurred total costs of $11.4 million in 2011. We incurred $7.7 million in compensation expense for severance packages for the termination of approximately 1,500 employees. We recorded a foreign currency exchange loss of $1.5 million related to the reversal of our foreign currency cumulative translation adjustment, which is classified as a selling, general and administrative expense. The remaining $2.2 million relates to an inventory valuation loss, accelerated depreciation, and other general and administrative costs. Substantially all of these costs were incurred in the second quarter of 2011. Future costs to manage the liquidation, which are not expected to be significant, will be expensed as incurred and will include compensation expense such as retention bonuses for the remaining employees, rent expense, and professional fees.     Discontinued Operations:  All of our remaining kiosks located in Sam’s Club stores were transitioned to Sam’s Club by June 30, 2011. We determined that the cash flows from these kiosks were eliminated from our ongoing operations. Therefore, these operations were reclassified from the kiosks segment to discontinued operations in the second quarter. The operating results of these kiosks are presented in the consolidated statements of income as discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for all periods presented. We incurred no significant gain or loss in connection with the transition of these kiosks to Sam’s Club. We redeployed substantially all of our Sam’s Club kiosk employees to nearby RadioShack stores or Target Mobile centers, and we redistributed our Sam’s Club kiosk inventory to our remaining retail channels.     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     2011 Summary  Net sales and operating revenues increased $112.2 million, or 2.6%, to $4,378.0 million when compared with last year. Comparable store sales decreased 2.2%. The increase in our net sales and operating revenues was driven primarily by sales at the 646 Target Mobile centers that were open on December 31, 2011, but not on December 31, 2010. The increase in sales that was driven by our additional Target Mobile centers was partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales. The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by sales decreases in our consumer electronics and signature platforms, which were partially offset by an increase in our mobility platform sales.     Gross margin decreased by 3.5 percentage points from last year to 41.4%. This decrease was primarily driven by a change in our sales mix within our mobility platform towards lower margin smartphones and tablets, combined with the overall growth of our mobility platform through our Target Mobile centers and U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores. Smartphones generally, and the Apple iPhone in particular, carry a lower gross margin rate, given their higher average cost basis. Revenue from smartphones as a percentage of our mobility platform in 2011 was 17.3 percentage points higher than in 2010. Additionally, our gross margin rate was negatively affected by more promotional pricing in the fourth quarter of 2011 when compared with the same period in 2010.     We expect this change in our sales mix to continue to affect our gross margin rate in 2012 primarily because of: customer migration to smartphones, the effect of Sprint and Verizon offering the iPhone for all of 2012 compared with less than full years in 2011, and the effect of our recently opened Target Mobile centers being open for a full year.                20                   Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense increased $93.6 million when compared with last year. This increase was primarily driven by increased costs to support our Target Mobile centers of $76 million, a one-time charge of $23.4 million, or 0.5% of net sales and operating revenues, related to our transition from T-Mobile to Verizon, and $9.5 million in costs related to the closure of our Chinese manufacturing plant. These increases were partially offset by decreased incentive compensation expense in our other retail channels as well as our corporate office. As a percentage of net sales and operating revenues, SG&A increased by 1.2 percentage points to 36.0%.     As a result of the factors above, operating income was $155.1 million, compared with $350.2 million last year. Operating income for our RadioShack company-operated stores segment was $530.2 million, compared with $675.4 million last year. The operating loss for our other business activities was $0.1 million, compared with operating income of $37.8 million in 2010. The decrease in operating income for our other business activities was driven primarily by a $17.0 million increase in the operating loss for our Target Mobile centers and a net loss on the closing of our Chinese manufacturing plant of $11.4 million.     Income from continuing operations was $0.65 per diluted share in 2011, compared with $1.55 and $1.56 per diluted share in 2010 and 2009, respectively.     2011 COMPARED WITH 2010     Net Sales and Operating Revenues  Consolidated net sales and operating revenues are as follows:                Year Ended December 31,        (In millions)       2011          2010          2009        U.S. RadioShack  company-operated  stores      $  3,663.3        $  3,808.2        $  3,650.9       Other         714.7           457.6           422.7       Consolidated net sales  and operating revenues      $  4,378.0        $  4,265.8        $  4,073.6                                                Consolidated net sales and  operating revenues  increase         2.6  %        4.7  %        1.0  %    Comparable store sales  (decrease) increase  (1)         (2.2  %)        4.1  %        0.8  %          (1)    Comparable store sales include the sales of U.S. and Mexico RadioShack company-operated stores as well as Target Mobile centers and kiosks with more than 12 full months of recorded sales. Following their closure as Sprint-branded kiosks in August 2009, certain former Sprint-branded kiosk locations became multiple wireless carrier RadioShack-branded locations. At December 31, 2009, we managed and reported 111 of these locations as extensions of existing RadioShack company-operated stores located in the same shopping malls. For purposes of calculating our comparable store sales, we include sales from these locations for periods after they became extensions of existing RadioShack company-operated stores, but we do not include sales from these locations for periods while they were operated as Sprint-branded kiosks.              The following table provides a summary of our consolidated net sales and operating revenues by platform and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues.                Consolidated Net Sales and Operating Revenues               Year Ended December 31,        (In millions)       2011          2010          2009        Mobility  (1)      $  2,251.2           51.4  %     $  1,885.6           44.2  %     $  1,375.0           33.8  %    Signature  (2)         1,256.2           28.7           1,303.9           30.6           1,486.7           36.5       Consumer electronics         840.7           19.2           1,041.0           24.4           1,170.8           28.7       Other sales  (3)         29.9           0.7           35.3           0.8           41.1           1.0       Consolidated net sales and operating revenues      $  4,378.0           100.0  %     $  4,265.8           100.0  %     $  4,073.6           100.0  %          (1)    The aggregate amount of upfront commission revenue and residual income received from wireless service providers and recorded in this platform was $1,499.1 million, $1,270.5 million and $926.5 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.     (2)    The sales decrease from 2009 to 2010 in the signature platform includes a decrease in sales of digital-to-analog television converter boxes. Consolidated sales of converter boxes, which were predominantly sold in our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores, were $33.7 million and $170.1 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.     (3)    Other sales include outside sales from repair services and outside sales of our global sourcing operations and domestic and overseas manufacturing facilities. We closed our overseas manufacturing facility in June 2011.                  21                   U.S. RadioShack Company-Operated Stores Segment     The following table provides a summary of our net sales and operating revenues by platform and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues for the U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores segment.                U.S. RadioShack Company-Operated Stores Segment               Net Sales and Operating Revenues               Year Ended December 31,        (In millions)       2011          2010          2009        Mobility      $  1,851.4           50.6  %     $  1,753.7           46.1  %     $  1,289.9           35.3  %    Signature         1,144.4           31.2           1,200.8           31.5           1,375.4           37.7       Consumer electronics         667.5           18.2           853.7           22.4           985.6           27.0       Net sales and operating revenues      $  3,663.3           100.0  %     $  3,808.2           100.0  %     $  3,650.9           100.0  %      Sales in our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores segment decreased $144.9 million or 3.8% in 2011.     Sales in our mobility platform (which includes postpaid and prepaid wireless handsets, commissions and residual income, prepaid wireless airtime, e-readers, and tablet devices) increased  5.6%  in 2011. This sales increase was driven by increased sales in our AT&T postpaid business, sales in our Verizon postpaid business, and sales of tablet devices. These sales increases were partially offset by decreased sales in our T-Mobile postpaid wireless business and decreased sales in our Sprint postpaid wireless business. The decreased sales in our Sprint postpaid wireless business were due to changes in Sprint’s customer and credit models, which resulted in fewer new and upgrade activations in the last three quarters of 2011.     Sales in our signature platform (which includes wireless, music, computer, video game, and home entertainment accessories; general purpose and special purpose power products; technical products; and services) decreased 4.7% in 2011. This sales decrease was primarily driven by decreased sales of digital-to-analog television converter boxes and related television antennas, music accessories, and media storage, but was partially offset by increased sales of headphones and tablet accessories.     Sales in our consumer electronics platform (which includes digital music players, personal computing products, laptop computers, cameras, residential telephones, digital televisions, and other consumer electronics products) decreased  21.8%  in 2011. This sales decrease was driven by sales declines in substantially all of the categories in this platform, but was primarily driven by decreased sales of digital music players, digital cameras and camcorders, and GPS devices. The convergence of these products’ functionality into smartphones has contributed to these sales decreases.     Other Sales     Amounts in other sales reflect our business activities that are not separately reportable, which include sales generated by our Target Mobile centers, sales to our independent dealers, sales generated by our Mexican subsidiary and  www.radioshack.com  website, sales to commercial customers, and sales to other third parties through our global sourcing operations. Other sales increased $257.1 million, or 56.2%, in 2011. This sales increase was driven primarily by sales at the 646 Target Mobile centers that were open on December 31, 2011, but not on December 31, 2010. We also experienced a sales increase at our Mexican subsidiary in 2011. These sales increases were partially offset by decreased sales to our independent dealers. Our Mexican subsidiary accounted for less than 5% of our consolidated net sales and operating revenues in 2011.     Gross Profit  Consolidated gross profit and gross margin are as follows:                Year Ended December 31,        (In millions)       2011          2010          2009        Gross profit      $  1,810.8        $  1,913.7        $  1,873.1       Gross profit (decrease) increase         (5.4  %)        2.2  %        2.2  %                                             Gross margin rate         41.4  %        44.9  %        46.0  %       Consolidated gross profit and gross margin for 2011 were $1,810.8 million and 41.4%, respectively, compared with $1,913.7 million and 44.9%, respectively, in 2010, resulting in a 5.4% decrease in gross profit dollars and a 3.5 percentage point decrease in our gross margin.     Gross margin decreased by 3.5 percentage points from last year to 41.4%. This decrease was primarily driven by a change in our sales mix within our mobility platform towards lower margin smartphones and tablets, combined with the overall growth of our mobility platform through our Target Mobile centers and U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores. Smartphones generally, and the Apple iPhone in particular, carry a lower gross margin rate given their higher average cost basis. Revenue from smartphones as a percentage of our mobility platform in 2011 was 17.3 percentage points higher than in 2010. Additionally, our gross margin rate was negatively affected by more promotional pricing in the fourth quarter of 2011 when compared with the same period in 2010.                22                   We expect this change in our sales mix to continue to affect our gross margin rate in 2012 primarily because of: customer migration to smartphones, the effect of Sprint and Verizon offering the iPhone for all of 2012 compared with less than full years in 2011, and the effect of our recently opened Target Mobile centers being open for a full year.     The gross margin rate for our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores segment decreased by 2.2 percentage points in 2011, primarily due to a change in sales mix towards lower margin smartphones as discussed above.     Selling, General and Administrative Expense  Our consolidated SG&A expense increased 6.3%, or $93.6 million, in 2011. This represents a 1.2 percentage point increase as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues compared to 2010.     The table below summarizes the breakdown of various components of our consolidated SG&A expense and their related percentages of total net sales and operating revenues.                Year Ended December 31,               2011          2010          2009                  Dollars          % of  Sales &  Revenues             Dollars          % of  Sales &  Revenues             Dollars          % of  Sales &  Revenues             (In millions)     Compensation      $  693.4           15.8  %     $  663.1           15.5  %     $  617.6           15.2  %    Rent and occupancy         261.5           6.0           265.3           6.2           266.2           6.5       Advertising         208.9           4.8           205.9           4.8           192.8           4.7       Other taxes (excludes income taxes)         108.3           2.5           97.7           2.3           97.8           2.4       Utilities         56.0           1.3           54.4           1.3           54.8           1.3       Insurance         49.6           1.1           45.9           1.1           44.6           1.1       Credit card fees         35.6           0.8           34.9           0.8           37.2           0.9       Professional fees         26.7           0.6           21.3           0.5           23.8           0.6       Repairs and maintenance         25.7           0.6           20.1           0.5           22.3           0.6       Licenses         14.9           0.3           13.2           0.3           11.5           0.3       Printing, postage and office supplies         9.0           0.2           6.9           0.2           7.7           0.2       Recruiting, training and employee relations         6.5           0.2           5.4           0.1           5.7           0.1       Travel         6.4           0.1           4.9           0.1           4.0           0.1       Matching contributions to savings plans         4.9           0.1           5.4           0.1           5.9           0.1       Warranty and product repair         1.3           --           2.2           0.1           2.7           0.1       Other         68.7           1.6           37.2           0.9           40.4           1.0                                                                                          $  1,577.4           36.0  %     $  1,483.8           34.8  %     $  1,435.0           35.2  %       The increase in SG&A expense was primarily driven by increased costs to support our Target Mobile centers of approximately $76 million, a one-time charge of $23.4 million related to our transition from T-Mobile to Verizon classified as other SG&A, and $9.5 million in costs related to the closure of our Chinese manufacturing plant. These increases were partially offset by decreased incentive compensation expense in our other retail channels as well as our corporate office.              23                 Depreciation and Amortization  The table below provides a summary of our total depreciation and amortization by segment.                Year Ended December 31,        (In millions)       2011          2010          2009        U.S. RadioShack  company-operated stores      $  37.9        $  45.4        $  45.8       Other         8.7           5.2           6.4       Unallocated         36.1           32.8           38.1       Total depreciation and  amortization from continuing  operations      $  82.7        $  83.4        $  90.3            The table below provides an analysis of total depreciation and amortization.                Year Ended December 31,        (In millions)       2011          2010          2009        Depreciation and  amortization expense      $  75.2        $  75.7        $  81.1       Depreciation and  amortization included  in cost of products sold            7.5              7.7              9.2       Total depreciation and  amortization from continuing  operations      $  82.7        $  83.4        $  90.3          Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Impairment of long-lived assets was $3.1 million and $4.0 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, these amounts were related primarily to underperforming U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores. In 2010, this amount was related primarily to underperforming U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores and certain test store formats.     Net Interest Expense  Consolidated net interest expense, which is interest expense net of interest income, was $43.7 million in 2011, compared with $39.3 million in  2010 .     In 2011 and 2010, interest expense primarily consisted of interest paid at the stated coupon rate on our outstanding notes, the non-cash amortization of the discounts on our long-term debt, cash received on our interest rate swaps, and the non-cash change in fair value of our interest rate swaps. Interest expense increased $ 4.9  million in  2011. This increase was driven by the increased average amount of long-term debt outstanding during 2011, the increased debt discount amortization related to our 2.50% convertible senior notes due August 1, 2013 (the “2013 Convertible Notes”), and increased commitment fees related to the five-year $450 million asset-based revolving credit facility we entered into on January 4, 2011, with a group of lenders with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative and collateral agent (the “2016 Credit Facility”).   Non-cash interest expense was $17.0 million in 2011 compared with $15.2 million in 2010.     Income Tax Expense  Our effective tax rate for 2011 was 37.5%, compared with 38.7% for 2010. The 2011 effective tax rate was affected by the realization of job retention credits generated pursuant to the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act. These credits lowered the effective tax rate by 1.1 percentage points.     The 2010 effective tax rate was affected by the net reversal of approximately $1.2 million in previously unrecognized tax benefits, deferred tax assets and accrued interest due to the effective settlement of state income tax matters during the period. These discrete items lowered the effective tax rate by 0.4 percentage points.     2010 COMPARED WITH 2009     Wireless Service Provider Settlement Agreement  The business terms of our relationships with our wireless service providers are governed by our wireless reseller agreements. These contracts are complex and include provisions determining our upfront commission revenue, net of chargebacks for wireless service deactivations; our acquisition and return of wireless handsets; and, in some cases, future residual revenue, performance targets and marketing development funds. Disputes occasionally arise between the parties regarding the interpretation of these contract provisions.     Certain disputes arose with one of the Company’s wireless service providers pertaining to upfront commission revenue for activations prior to July 1, 2010, and related chargebacks for wireless service deactivations. Negotiations regarding resolution of these disputes culminated in the signing of a settlement agreement in July 2010. In connection with the decision to settle these disputes, the Company considered the following: the timing of cash outflows and inflows in connection with the disputed upfront commission revenue and related chargebacks, and the estimated future residual revenue; the benefits of settling the disputes and agreeing to enter into good faith negotiations with the wireless service provider in the third quarter of 2010 to modify the commission and chargeback provisions of our wireless reseller agreement; and the risks associated with the ultimate realization of the estimated future residual revenue.     Key elements of the settlement agreement included the following:         ·      All disputes relating to upfront commission revenue for activations prior to July 1, 2010, and related chargebacks were settled.                   24                       ·      The wireless service provider agreed to pay $141 million to the Company on or before July 30, 2010.            ·      The Company and the wireless service provider agreed to enter into good faith negotiations in the third quarter of 2010 to modify the commission and chargeback provisions of our wireless reseller agreement.            ·      Beginning July 1, 2010, the wireless service provider was no longer obligated to pay future residual revenue amounts to the Company for a period of time for customers activated on or before June 30, 2010. For the first six months of 2010, these residual revenue amounts averaged approximately $9 million per quarter. Based on this average, we would receive no residual revenue payments from this wireless service provider for eight quarters beginning with the third quarter of 2010 under the terms of the settlement agreement.        The effects of the settlement agreement have been reflected in net sales and operating revenues in the consolidated financial statements for 2010.     Net Sales and Operating Revenues  Consolidated net sales increased 4.7% or $192.2 million to $4,265.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 , compared with  $4,073.6  million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to a comparable store sales increase of  4.1%  in 2010. The increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by increased sales in our mobility platform, which was partially offset by decreased sales in our signature and consumer electronics platforms.     U.S. RadioShack Company-Operated Stores Segment     Sales in our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores segment increased $157.3 million or 4.3% in 2010.     Sales in our mobility platform increased 36.0% in 2010. This sales increase was driven by increased sales in our Sprint and AT&T postpaid wireless business and increased sales of prepaid wireless handsets and airtime. The inclusion of T-Mobile as a postpaid wireless carrier increased sales for the first nine months of 2010; however, T-Mobile sales decreased in the fourth quarter, when compared to the same period in 2009.     Sales in our signature platform decreased 12.7% in 2010. This sales decrease was primarily driven by decreased sales of digital-to-analog television converter boxes and television antennas as well as general and special purpose batteries, which were partially offset by increased sales of wireless accessories. Consolidated sales of converter boxes were $33.7 million and $170.1 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Converter box sales have decreased since the transition to digital television occurred in June 2009.     Sales in our consumer electronics platform decreased 13.4% in 2010. This decrease was driven primarily by decreased sales of digital televisions, GPS devices, digital cameras and camcorders, and digital music players, which were partially offset by increased sales of laptops.     Other Sales     Other sales increased $34.9 million or 8.3% in 2010. This sales increase was driven primarily by new sales in our Target Mobile centers, increased sales at our Mexican subsidiary, and increased sales to our independent dealers, which were partially offset by the closure of our Sprint-branded kiosk business and decreased sales from  www.radioshack.com,  our global sourcing business, and our manufacturing operations. We closed our Sprint-branded kiosks in the third quarter of 2009. Our Mexican subsidiary accounted for less than 5% of our consolidated net sales and operating revenues in 2010.     Gross Profit  Consolidated gross profit and gross margin for 2010 were $1,913.7 million and 44.9%, respectively, compared with $1,873.1 million and 46.0%, respectively, in 2009, resulting in a 2.2% increase in gross profit dollars and a 110 basis point decrease in our gross margin.     The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily due to increased sales, but was partially offset by decreased gross margin. Gross margin declined primarily due to a higher sales mix of lower margin wireless handsets and incremental promotional and clearance markdowns associated with seasonal sell-through and product transitions in non-wireless platforms.     Selling, General and Administrative Expense  Our consolidated SG&A expense increased 3.4% or $48.8 million in 2010. This represents a 40 basis point decrease as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues compared to 2009.     Compensation expense increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues. This increase was driven by incentive compensation paid on increased wireless sales and the hiring of additional employees to support our Target Mobile centers.     Advertising expense was higher in 2010 primarily due to incremental advertising related to brand building in the second quarter of 2010.     Depreciation and Amortization  Total depreciation and amortization from continuing operations for 2010 declined $6.9 million or 7.6%. Our depreciation expense has been trending lower over the past five years due to our lower level of capital expenditures during this time compared with a higher level of capital expenditures in 2005 and prior years.                25                   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Impairment of long-lived assets was $4.0 million and $1.5 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2010, this amount was related primarily to underperforming U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores and certain test store formats. In 2009, these amounts were related primarily to underperforming U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores and kiosk locations.     Net Interest Expense  Consolidated net interest expense, which is interest expense net of interest income, was $39.3 million in both  2010  and 2009.     In 2010, interest expense primarily consisted of interest paid at the stated coupon rate on our outstanding notes, the non-cash amortization of the discount on our convertible notes, cash received on our interest rate swaps, and the non-cash change in fair value of our interest rate swaps. Interest expense decreased $ 2.2  million in  2010. This decrease was primarily driven by the reduced principal balance of our 7.375% notes due May 15, 2011, (the “2011 Notes”) resulting from the September 2009 repurchase of $43.2 million of the principal amount of the 2011 Notes and increased payments received on our interest rate swap contracts during 2010.   Non-cash interest expense was $15.2 million in 2010 compared with $13.7 million in 2009.     Interest income decreased $ 2.2  million in  2010 . This decrease was primarily due to lower average cash balances in the second half of 2010.     Income Tax Expense  Our effective tax rate for 2010 was 38.7%, compared with 37.5% for 2009. The 2010 effective tax rate was affected by the net reversal of approximately $1.2 million in previously unrecognized tax benefits, deferred tax assets and accrued interest due to the effective settlement of state income tax matters during the period. These discrete items lowered the effective tax rate by 0.4 percentage points.     The 2009 effective tax rate was affected by the net reversal of approximately $6.1 million in previously unrecognized tax benefits, deferred tax assets and accrued interest due to the effective settlement of state income tax matters during the period. These discrete items lowered the effective tax rate by 1.9 percentage points.     RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  Refer to Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” under the section titled “New Accounting Standards” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     Cash Flow Overview     Operating Activities:  Cash provided by operating activities in 2011 was $217.9 million, compared with $155.0 million in 2010. Cash flows from operating activities are comprised of net income plus non-cash adjustments to net income and working capital components. Cash provided by net income plus non-cash adjustments to net income was $219.2 million and $343.9 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in net income plus non-cash adjustments was primarily driven by decreased net income. Cash used in working capital components was $1.3 million and $188.9 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in cash used in working capital components in 2011 was primarily driven by a larger accounts payable balance. Our accounts payable balance was larger at December 31, 2011, than it was at December 31, 2010, because of differences in the timing of invoice receipts and related payments in 2011 compared with 2010.     Investing Activities:  Cash used in investing activities was $80.1 million and $80.0 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Capital expenditures of $82.1 million in 2011 were consistent with the $80.1 million we spent in 2010. Capital expenditures primarily related to information system projects, Target Mobile centers, and our U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores.     Financing Activities:  Net cash used in financing activities was $115.5 million in 2011 compared with $413.8 million in 2010. Our net cash used in financing activities for 2011 was primarily driven by the repurchase of $113.3 million of our common stock and the payment of a $49.6 million annual dividend. Our net cash used in financing activities for 2010 was primarily driven by the repurchase of $398.8 million of our common stock.     Free Cash Flow:   Our free cash flow, defined as cash flows from operating activities less dividends paid and additions to property, plant and equipment, was $86.2 million in 2011, $48.4 million in 2010, and $133.5 million in 2009. The increase in free cash flow for 2011 was attributable to increased cash flow from operating activities as described above.     We believe free cash flow is a relevant indicator of our ability to repay maturing debt, change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that management believes will enhance shareholder value. The comparable financial measure to free cash flow under generally accepted accounting principles is cash flows from operating activities, which was $217.9 million in 2011, $155.0 million in 2010, and $245.8 million in 2009. We do not intend for the presentation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, nor do we intend to imply that free cash flow represents cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.                26                   The following table is a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow.                Year Ended December 31,        (In millions)       2011          2010          2009        Net cash provided by  operating activities      $  217.9        $  155.0        $  245.8       Less:                                         Additions to property, plant  and equipment         82.1           80.1           81.0       Dividends paid         49.6           26.5           31.3                                                Free cash flow      $  86.2        $  48.4        $  133.5          SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY  As of December 31, 2011, we had $591.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $569.4 million in 2010. We believe that our cash flows from operations and available cash and cash equivalents will adequately fund our operations, our capital expenditures, and our maturing debt obligations. Additionally, we had a credit facility of $450 million with availability of $421.9 million as of December 31, 2011.        The table below lists our credit commitments from various financial institutions at December 31, 2011.         (In millions)       Commitment Expiration per Period           Credit Commitments       Total Amounts Committed          Less Than  1 Year          1-3 Years          3-5 Years          Over  5 Years        Lines of credit      $  450.0        $  --        $  --        $  450.0        $  --       Standby letters of credit         --           --           --           --           --       Total commercial commitments      $  450.0        $  --        $  --        $  450.0        $  --            Available Financing:  On January 4, 2011, we terminated our $325 million credit facility and entered into the 2016 Credit Facility. The 2016 Credit Facility expires on January 4, 2016. The 2016 Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes and the issuance of letters of credit. This facility is collateralized by substantially all of the Company’s inventory, accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents, and certain other personal property, and is guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries.     Borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facility are subject to a borrowing base of certain collateralized assets and bear interest at a bank’s prime rate plus 1.25% to 1.75% or LIBOR plus 2.25% to 2.75%. The applicable rates in these ranges are based on the aggregate average availability under the facility.     The 2016 Credit Facility also contains a $150 million sub-limit for the issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit. The issuance of letters of credit reduces the amount available under the facility. Letter of credit fees are 2.25% to 2.75% for standby letters of credit and 1.125% to 1.375% for commercial letters of credit.     We pay commitment fees to the lenders at an annual rate of 0.50% of the unused amount of the facility. As of December 31, 2011, no borrowings had been made under the facility, and letters of credit totaling $28.1 million had been issued.     The 2016 Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict certain payments, including dividends and share repurchases. Also, if we do not meet a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio during a trailing twelve-month period, the availability under our credit facility will be reduced by the greater of 12.5% of the borrowing base or $45 million. We currently anticipate that we will be in compliance with the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio during 2012.     We are generally free to pay dividends and repurchase shares as long as the current and projected unused amount under the facility is greater than 17.5% of the maximum borrowing amount and the minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is maintained. We may pay dividends and repurchase shares without regard to the Company's consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as long as the current and projected unused amount under the facility is greater than 75% of the maximum borrowing amount and cash on hand is used for the dividends or share repurchases.                27                   CASH REQUIREMENTS     Capital Expenditures:   We anticipate that our capital expenditure requirements for 2012 will range from $70 million to $90 million. The nature of our capital expenditures is comprised of a base level of investment required to support our current operations and a discretionary amount related to our strategic initiatives. The base level of capital expenditures required to support our operations ranges from $40 million to $50 million. The remaining amount of anticipated capital expenditures relates to strategic initiatives as reflected in our annual plan. These capital expenditures are discretionary and, therefore, may not be spent if we decide not to pursue one or more of our strategic initiatives. U.S. RadioShack company-operated store remodels and relocations and information systems projects will account for the majority of our anticipated 2012 capital expenditures. Cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities will be used to fund future capital expenditure needs.     Seasonal Inventory Buildup:   Typically, our annual cash requirements for pre-seasonal inventory buildup from August to November range between $150 million and $250 million. The funding required for this buildup comes primarily from cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and operating revenues. Additionally, our 2016 Credit Facility could be utilized to fund the inventory buildup.     Contractual Obligations  The table below contains our known contractual commitments as of December 31, 2011.         (In millions)       Payments Due by Period           Contractual Obligations       Total          Less Than  1 Year          1-3 Years          3-5 Years          More than  5 Years        Long-term debt obligations  (1)      $  701.0        $  --        $  376.0        $  --        $  325.0       Interest obligations         175.9           31.4           49.4           43.9           51.2       Operating lease obligations  (2)         577.5           195.2           241.8           108.2           32.3       Purchase obligations  (3)         333.2           316.0           15.2           2.0           --       Other long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet  (4)         87.6                       24.0           4.8           25.2       Total      $  1,875.2        $  542.6        $  706.4        $  158.9        $  433.7              (1)    For more information regarding long-term debt, refer to Note 4 – “Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.     (2)    For more information regarding lease commitments, refer to Note 13 – “Commitments and Contingencies” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.     (3)    Purchase obligations primarily include our product commitments and marketing agreements.     (4)    Includes a $33.6 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the related balances have not been reflected in the ‘‘Payments Due by Period’’ section of the table.                28                  2019 Notes:  On May 3, 2011, we sold $325 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior unsecured notes due May 15, 2019 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers exempt from registration pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (such notes, together with any notes issued in the exchange offer we subsequently registered with the SEC for such notes (the “Exchange Offer”), being referred to as the “2019 Notes”). In September 2011, substantially all of the privately placed notes were exchanged for notes in an equal principal amount that we issued pursuant to the Exchange Offer. Accordingly, the exchange resulted in the issuance of substantially all of the 2019 Notes in a transaction registered with the SEC, but it did not result in the incurrence of any additional debt.      The obligation to pay principal and interest on the 2019 Notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by all of the guarantors under the 2016 Credit Facility. On the issue date, the 2019 Notes were guaranteed by all of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries except Tandy Life Insurance Company. The 2019 Notes pay interest at a fixed rate of 6.75% per year. Interest is payable semiannually, in arrears, on May 15 and November 15. The 2019 Notes were sold to the initial purchasers at a discount of $2.5 million for aggregate consideration of $322.5 million and resulted in net proceeds to the Company of $315.4 million after the payment of $7.1 million in issuance costs. The effective annualized interest rate of the 2019 Notes after giving effect to the original issuance discount is 6.875%.      The 2019 Notes and the guarantees are the Company’s and the guarantors’ general unsecured senior obligations and, therefore, will be subordinated to all of the Company’s and the guarantors’ existing and future secured debt to the extent of the assets securing that debt. In addition, the 2019 Notes will be effectively subordinated to all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries that are not guaranteeing the 2019 Notes, to the extent of the assets of those subsidiaries.     The 2019 Notes contain covenants that could, in certain circumstances, limit our ability to issue additional debt, repurchase shares of our common stock, make certain other restricted payments, make investments, or enter into certain other transactions. At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with these covenants.     2013 Convertible Notes:  In August 2008, we sold the 2013 Convertible Notes in a private offering. Each $1,000 of principal of the 2013 Convertible Notes was initially convertible, under certain circumstances, into 41.2414 shares of our common stock (or a total of approximately 15.5 million shares), which is the equivalent of $24.25 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events set forth under terms of the 2013 Convertible Notes. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock, up to the principal amount of the note. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, (the “excess conversion value”) may be paid in cash or in stock, at our option. Holders may convert their 2013 Convertible Notes into common stock on the net settlement basis described above at any time from May 1, 2013, until the close of business on July 29, 2013, or if, and only if, one of the following conditions has been met:         ·      During any calendar quarter, and only during such calendar quarter, in which the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the conversion price per share of common stock in effect on the last day of such preceding calendar quarter            ·      During the five consecutive business days immediately after any 10 consecutive trading day period in which the average trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2013 Convertible Notes was less than 98% of the product of the closing price of the common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date            ·      We make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or specified corporate transactions occur        The 2013 Convertible Notes were not convertible at the holders' option at any time during 2011 or 2010. In 2011, we paid an annual dividend of $0.50 per share. This was a $0.25 per share increase as compared to the annual dividend we paid at the time we issued the 2013 Convertible Notes. This dividend increase triggered an anti-dilutive provision relating to the convertible notes that changed the conversion rate of the notes (“Convertible Note Anti-Dilutive Provision”). As a result, at December 31, 2011, each $1,000 of principal of the 2013 Convertible Notes was convertible, under the circumstances previously discussed, into 42.0746 shares of our common stock, which is the equivalent of $23.77 per share. Accordingly, conversion of all of the 2013 Convertible Notes would result in the issuance of approximately 15.8 million shares of our common stock.     Holders who convert their 2013 Convertible Notes in connection with a change in control may be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. In addition, upon a change in control, liquidation, dissolution or delisting, the holders of the 2013 Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2013 Convertible Notes for 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. As of December 31, 2011, none of the conditions allowing holders of the 2013 Convertible Notes to convert or requiring us to repurchase the 2013 Convertible Notes had been met.                29                   Concurrent with the issuance of the 2013 Convertible Notes, we entered into note hedge transactions with Citigroup and Bank of America whereby we have the option to purchase up to 15.8 million (originally 15.5 million) shares of our common stock at a price of $23.77 per share (originally $24.25 per share) (the “Convertible Note Hedges”), and we sold warrants to the same financial institutions whereby they have the option to purchase up to 15.8 million shares (originally 15.5 million shares) of our common stock at a per share price of $35.88 (originally $36.60) (the “Warrants”). The Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants were structured to reduce the potential future share dilution associated with the conversion of the 2013 Convertible Notes. The Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants are separate contracts with the two financial institutions, are not part of the terms of the 2013 Convertible Notes, and do not affect the rights of holders under the 2013 Convertible Notes. A holder of the 2013 Convertible Notes does not have any rights with respect to the Convertible Note Hedges or Warrants.     For a more detailed description of the 2013 Convertible Notes, Convertible Note Hedges, and Warrants, please see Note 4 – “Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities” and Note 5 – “Stockholders’ Equity” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.     Operating Leases:   We use operating leases, primarily for our retail locations and our corporate campus, to lower our capital requirements.     Capitalization  The following table sets forth information about our capitalization on the dates indicated.                December 31,               2011          2010           (Dollars in millions)       Dollars          % of Total  Capitalization          Dollars          % of Total  Capitalization        Short-term debt      $  --           0.0  %     $  308.0           20.8  %    Long-term debt         670.6           47.1           331.8           22.4       Total debt         670.6           47.1           639.8           43.2       Stockholders’  equity         753.3           52.9           842.5           56.8       Total capitalization      $  1,423.9           100.0  %     $  1,482.3           100.0  %       Our debt-to-total capitalization ratio increased in 2011 from 2010, primarily due to the repurchase of $113.3 million of our common stock in 2011.     Dividends:   We have paid common stock cash dividends for 25 consecutive years. On October 25, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an increase in the annual dividend on the Company’s common stock to $0.50 per share in 2011, compared with $0.25 per share paid in 2010, and changed the annual dividend payout to a quarterly payout. The annual cash dividend of $0.50 per share for 2011 was paid on December 15, 2011, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 25, 2011. The dividend payment of $49.6 million was funded from cash on hand. The Company expects dividends will be paid on a quarterly basis beginning in the first quarter of 2012 and will be funded from cash on hand and operating cash flows.     Share Repurchases:  In October 2011, our Board of Directors approved an authorization for a total share repurchase of $200 million of the Company’s common stock to be executed through open market or private transactions. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we repurchased 0.9 million shares or $11.9 million of our common stock under this program. We announced on January 30, 2012, that we have suspended further share repurchases under this program.     During the second quarter of 2011, we paid $101.4 million to purchase 6.3 million shares of our common stock in open market purchases under our 2008 share repurchase program. These purchases completed our $610 million 2008 share repurchase authorization.     The declaration of dividends, the dividend rate, and the amount and timing of share repurchases are at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, and plans for future dividends and share repurchases may be revised by the Board of Directors at any time. RadioShack's dividend and share repurchase programs could be affected by, among other things, changes in RadioShack's results of operations, capital expenditures, cash flows, and applicable tax laws.     OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  Other than the operating leases described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, transactions, or special purpose entities.     INFLATION  Inflation has not significantly affected us over the past three years. We do not expect inflation to have a significant effect on our operations in the foreseeable future.     CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States. The application of GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements and is affected by management’s judgment and uncertainties. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current market trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant and reasonable at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. We continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.                30                   In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are revenue recognition; inventory valuation; estimation of reserves and valuation allowances specifically related to insurance, tax and legal contingencies; valuation of long-lived assets and intangibles, including goodwill; and stock-based compensation.     We consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires difficult, subjective or complex judgments, and is material to the portrayal of our financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. The selection, application and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.     Revenue Recognition     Description     Our revenue is derived principally from the sale of name brand and private brand products and services to consumers. Revenue is recognized, net of an estimate for customer refunds and product returns, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.     Certain products, such as wireless telephone handsets, require the customer to use the services of a third-party service provider. The third-party service provider pays us an upfront commission for obtaining a new customer or upgrading an existing customer and, in some cases, a monthly recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the service provider and the customer. Our sale of an activated wireless telephone handset is the single event required to meet the delivery criterion for both the upfront commission and the recurring residual revenue. Upfront commission revenue, net of estimated wireless service deactivations, is generally recognized at the time an activated wireless telephone handset is sold to the customer at the point-of-sale. Recurring residual revenue is recognized as earned under the terms of each contract with the service provider, which is typically as the service provider bills its customer, generally on a monthly basis.     Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate     Our revenue recognition accounting methodology requires us to make certain judgments regarding the estimate of future sales returns and wireless service deactivations. Our estimates for product refunds and returns, wireless service deactivations and commission revenue adjustments are based on historical information pertaining to these items. Based on our extensive history in selling activated wireless telephone handsets, we have been able to establish reliable estimates for wireless service deactivations. However, our estimates for wireless service deactivations can be affected by certain characteristics of and decisions made by our service providers. These factors include changes in the quality of their customer service, the quality and performance of their networks, their rate plan offerings, their policies regarding extensions of customer credit, and their wireless telephone handset product offerings. These factors add uncertainty to our estimates.     Effect if actual results differ from assumptions     We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate sales returns or wireless service deactivations during the past three fiscal years. We continue to update our estimate for wireless service deactivations to reflect the most recently available information regarding the characteristics of and decisions made by our service providers discussed above. If actual results differ from our estimates due to these or various other factors, the amount of revenue recorded could be materially affected. A 10% difference in our reserves for the estimates noted above would have affected net sales and operating revenues by approximately $2.3 million in 2011.     Inventory Valuation     Description     Our inventory consists primarily of finished goods available for sale at our retail locations or within our distribution centers and is recorded at the lower of average cost (which approximates FIFO) or market. The cost components recorded within inventory are the vendor invoice cost and certain allocated freight, distribution, warehousing and other costs relating to merchandise acquisition required to bring the merchandise from the vendor to the location where it is offered for sale.     Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate     Typically, the market value of our inventory is higher than its aggregate cost. Determination of the market value may be very complex and, therefore, requires a high degree of judgment. In order for management to make the appropriate determination of market value, the following items are commonly considered: inventory turnover statistics, current selling prices, seasonality factors, consumer trends, competitive pricing, performance of similar products or accessories, planned promotional incentives, technological obsolescence, and estimated costs to sell or dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions.                31                   If the estimated market value, calculated as the amount we expect to realize, net of estimated selling costs, from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory, is determined to be less than the recorded cost, we record a provision to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item to its net realizable value.     Effect if actual results differ from assumptions     We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves during the past three fiscal years, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to estimate our inventory valuation reserves. Differences between management estimates and actual performance and pricing of our merchandise could result in inventory valuations that differ from the amount recorded at the financial statement date and could also cause fluctuations in the amount of recorded cost of products sold. If our estimates regarding market value are inaccurate or changes in consumer demand affect certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may be exposed to material losses or gains in excess of our established valuation reserve. We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our inventory valuation reserves. However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves.     Estimation of Reserves and Valuation Allowances for Self-Insurance, Income Taxes, and Litigation Contingencies     Description     The amount of liability we record for claims related to insurance, tax and legal contingencies requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We are insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation, property and other liability claims, with deductibles up to $1.0 million per occurrence. This insurance coverage limits our exposure for any catastrophic claims that result in liability in excess of the deductible. We also have a self-insured health program administered by a third-party covering the majority of our employees that participate in our health insurance programs. We estimate the amount of our reserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reporting period. This estimate is based on historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other factors we deem relevant.     We are subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities related to income tax, sales and use tax, personal property tax, and other forms of taxation. These audits examine our tax positions, timing of income and deductions, and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions. Our accounting for tax estimates and contingencies requires us to evaluate tax issues and establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable tax exposures. Depending on the nature of the tax issue, we could be subject to audit over several years; therefore, our estimated reserve balances might exist for multiple years before an issue is resolved by the taxing authority.     We are involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated with employment and other matters. Our accounting for legal contingencies requires us to estimate the probable losses in these matters. This estimate has been developed in consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies.     Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate     Our liabilities for insurance, tax and legal contingencies contain uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with these items. We use our history and experience, as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims, in evaluating the amount of liability we should record. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate. These revisions could materially affect our results of operations and financial position or liquidity.     Effect if actual results differ from assumptions     We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate our insurance, tax, or legal contingencies reserves during the past three fiscal years, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions for these items. However, a 10% change in our insurance reserves at December 31, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $4.0 million. As of December 31, 2011, actual losses had not exceeded our estimates. Additionally, for claims that exceed our deductible amount, we record a gross liability and corresponding receivable representing expected recoveries, since we are not legally relieved of our obligation to the claimant.                32                   Although we believe that our insurance, tax and legal reserves are based on reasonable judgments and estimates, actual results could differ, which may expose us to material gains or losses in future periods. These actual results could materially affect our effective tax rate, earnings, deferred tax balances and cash flows in the period of resolution.     Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles, including Goodwill     Description     Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, such as insufficient cash flows or plans to dispose of or sell long-lived assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives. The carrying amount is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying amount is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. We estimate fair value based on projected future discounted cash flows. Impairment losses, if any, are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs. The carrying value of the asset is adjusted to the new carrying value, and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded. Additionally, if it is determined that the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased, the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new existing carrying value of the asset and the new remaining useful life. Our policy is to evaluate long-lived assets for impairment at a store level for retail operations.     We have acquired goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets related to business acquisitions. The original valuation of these intangible assets is based on estimates of future profitability, cash flows and other judgmental factors. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We review our goodwill and other intangible asset balances on an annual basis, during the fourth quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset might exceed their fair value. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset or a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss for this difference.     Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate     Our impairment loss calculations for long-lived assets contain uncertainties because they require us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows, strategic plans, useful lives and assumptions about market performance. We also apply judgment in the selection of a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in our current business model.     Our impairment loss calculations for intangible assets and goodwill contain uncertainties because they require us to estimate fair values related to these assets. We estimate fair values based on various valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and other comparable market analyses. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require us to make judgments and assumptions regarding future profitability, industry factors, planned strategic initiatives, discount rates and other factors.     Effect if actual results differ from assumptions     We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodologies we use to assess impairment loss for long-lived assets, intangible assets, or goodwill during the past three fiscal years, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use in calculating these impairment losses. However, if actual results or performance of certain business units are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges, which could be material to our results of operations.     The total value of our goodwill and intangible assets at December 31, 2011, was $37.0 million. Of this amount, $33.5 million related to goodwill from the purchase of RadioShack de Mexico. Based on our most recent review of goodwill impairment, we noted that the fair values of our reporting units were substantially greater than their carrying values.     Stock-Based Compensation     Description     We have historically granted certain stock-based awards to employees and directors in the form of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock and deferred stock units. See Note 2 - “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 7 - “Stock-Based Incentive Plans” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of our stock-based compensation programs.     At the date an award is granted, we determine the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period, which typically is the period over which the award vests. The restricted stock and deferred stock units are valued at the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options with only service conditions is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair value of stock options with service and market conditions is valued utilizing a lattice model with Monte Carlo simulations.                33                   Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate     The Black-Scholes-Merton and lattice models require management to apply judgment and use subjective assumptions, including expected option life, volatility of stock prices, and employee forfeiture rate. We use historical data and judgment to estimate the expected option life and employee forfeiture rate, and use historical and implied volatility when estimating the stock price volatility. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.     Effect if actual results differ from assumptions     We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodologies used to record stock-based compensation during the past three years. While the assumptions that we develop are based on our best expectations, they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions and employee behavior that are outside of our control. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used, the stock-based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock-based compensation. Additionally, if actual employee forfeitures significantly differ from our estimated forfeitures, we may have an adjustment to our financial statements in future periods. A 10% change in our stock-based compensation expense in 2011 would have affected our net income by approximately $0.5 million.     FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS  Matters discussed in our MD&A and in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical and may be identified by the use of words such as “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “potential” or similar words. These matters include statements concerning management’s plans and objectives relating to our operations or economic performance and related assumptions. We specifically disclaim any duty to update any of the information set forth in this report, including any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are made based on management’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future events and, therefore, involve a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management cautions that forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.     ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.     At December 31, 2011, we held no derivative instruments that materially increased our exposure to market risks for interest rates, foreign currency rates, commodity prices or other market price risks.     Our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in short-term interest rates. Interest rate risk exists with respect to our cash equivalents of $426.2 million at December 31, 2011. These instruments currently yield less than 100 basis points on an annualized basis. A hypothetical decrease of interest rates to zero would result in a decrease in annual interest income of less than $4.3 million. This hypothesis assumes no change in the cash equivalent balance.     We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our purchase of inventory from manufacturers located in China and other areas outside of the U.S. Our purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars; however, the strengthening of the Chinese currency, or other currencies, against the U.S. dollar could cause our vendors to increase the prices of items we purchase from them. It is not possible to estimate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our purchases of this inventory. We are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations related to our Mexican subsidiary, which accounted for less than 5% of consolidated net sales and operating revenues.     ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
