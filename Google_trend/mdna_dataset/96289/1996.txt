For the year ended December 31, 1995, Tandy Corporation's     ("Tandy" or the "Company") sales increased 18% to     $5,839,067,000 from $4,943,679,000 for the year ended     December 31, 1994.  The increase in sales was primarily     attributable to the addition of 160 RadioShack(SM) stores     (net of closures), eight Incredible Universe(R) stores and 30     Computer City(R) stores during 1995.  Due to the closure of     233 Tandy Name Brand Retail Group ("Tandy Name Brand") stores     during the first quarter of 1995, sales for that division     decreased from $271,504,000 to $28,041,000.  This division is     now closed and sales of the remaining Tandy Name Brand stores     are included in the RadioShack total for each period     presented in the table above.        For the year ended December 31, 1995, the Company showed     approximately 5% same store sales growth, with all divisions     showing same store sales increases during the year.  The     RadioShack division achieved 6% same store sales growth,     while Incredible Universe and Computer City each had same     store sales increases of 2%.        Same store sales increases (decreases) for the quarter     ended December 31, 1995 for RadioShack, Computer City and     Incredible Universe were 5%, (6%) and less than 1%,     respectively.  RadioShack's increased sales for the year and     the quarter reflected the increasing demand for cellular     phones.  Cellular phone commissions increased in 1995 by     approximately $150,000,000 as compared to 1994.  In addition,     sales of its core products also increased, reflecting the     results of new advertising campaigns.  Same store sales at     Computer City for the fourth quarter declined primarily     because of lower than anticipated demand for personal     computers at its stores.  Computer City and Incredible     Universe are reevaluating their advertising plans, customer     service and other marketing strategies in an effort to     increase same store sales in 1996.  For example, new programs     being instituted at Computer City include a commissioned     sales program, a 110% price guarantee, increased emphasis on     being adequately stocked in advertised and fast-moving     merchandise, strengthened infrastructure and support for     corporate sales and the development and training of store     personnel.  At Incredible Universe a number of volume and     traffic building programs have been introduced for 1996.     These include new advertising programs that better represent     the broad scope of Incredible Universe and increase focus on     our differentiating strengths such as demonstrations, vendor     seminars, clinics and community events.  Also, increased     utilization of space is being planned to increase sales per     square foot.        RadioShack sales in 1995 of consumer electronics and     cellular commissions, as a percentage of overall sales, rose     modestly while the percentage of overall sales attributable     to personal computers and electronic parts, accessories and     specialty equipment decreased.  The decrease in RadioShack's     computer business reflected the impact of sharply lower     pricing in response to competitive pressures in the     marketplace.  The changing dynamics of the personal computer     business had a significant impact on RadioShack's sales     performance during 1993, and to a lesser extent in 1994 and     1995.  A combination of shifts in retail distribution to     computer superstores, large consumer electronics store     formats and telemarketing combined with rapidly declining     prices has taken the computer category from approximately     14.2% of RadioShack's sales and a gross profit of     approximately 15.2% for the year ended December 31, 1993 to     approximately 10.6% of sales and a gross profit of     approximately 11.8% for the year ended December 31, 1995.  It     is anticipated that personal computer sales should be between     10% and 12% of RadioShack's business in 1996.  The table     below shows the breakdown by major category of RadioShack     sales.

("InterTAN") entered     into a new import/export agreement under which Tandy's A&A     International ("A&A") operations would act as InterTAN's     agent in importing consumer electronics from the Far East.     Commencing in March 1994, only the purchasing agent     commission and sales made by Tandy manufacturing plants to     InterTAN were recorded as sales.  InterTAN purchases from     third parties through A&A are no longer recorded as sales,     reflecting the arrangement under the new merchandise     agreement; however, commission income is reported as     operating revenue.  Accordingly, reported sales by Tandy to     InterTAN in 1995 and 1994, reflected in Other Sales, were     considerably lower than in 1993; however, the earned income     relating thereto was not materially different.  See the     discussion in the "InterTAN Update" found below.        Tandy's sales increased 21% to $4,943,679,000 in 1994 from     $4,102,551,000 in 1993.  The increase in sales was primarily     attributable to the addition of six Incredible Universe and     29 Computer City stores during 1994.  A net increase of 45     RadioShack stores also contributed to the sales increase.     Partially offsetting these upward trends in sales was an     overall decline in sales for Tandy Name Brand.  This decline     can be partially attributed to the fact that 110 McDuff(R)     and VideoConcepts(R) stores were closed during February 1993.     See "Provision for Business Restructuring" below for further     discussion of Tandy Name Brand.        During 1994, Tandy posted a 5% same store sales increase.     RadioShack and Computer City achieved same store sales     increases of 5% while the Tandy Name Brand group was up only     slightly.  Incredible Universe, with three old stores,     experienced a 20% comparable stores sales gain during     calendar 1994.  Same store sales increases reflected growing     demand for consumer electronics and a strong economy.

(2)  In the first quarter of 1995, 151 VideoConcepts, 30     McDuff mall stores and 19 McDuff Supercenters were closed.     In addition, 33 other mall stores or Supercenters were     converted into RadioShack or Computer City Express(SM)     stores. See "Provision for Business Restructuring".      GROSS PROFIT       Gross profit as a percentage of sales declined from 39.0%     in 1994 to 35.5% in 1995.  This decrease reflects the     continued expansion of Tandy's lower gross margin retail     formats. During calendar year 1995, Computer City and     Incredible Universe represented 42.9% of total sales and     operating revenues compared to 31.7% of the 1994 total.     Management anticipates that Tandy's consolidated gross profit     percentage will continue to decline as the effects of the     Computer City and Incredible Universe expansions are     increasingly reflected in the revenue and gross profit mix.        During 1995 RadioShack's gross margin decreased when     compared to 1994 due to the rapid growth of cellular phone     and digital satellite system sales.  It is anticipated that     RadioShack's gross margin as a percentage of sales in 1996     could be equal to or slightly exceed the comparable 1995     figure due to emphasis on higher margin categories.  Computer     City's gross margin remained relatively flat in 1995 when     compared to 1994.  Competitive forces have continued to play     a major factor in keeping margins flat in 1995.  Margins are     not expected to vary much in 1996 as these competitive forces     in the marketplace remain in place and may even increase in     some quarters.  Incredible Universe's gross margins decreased     slightly in 1995 compared to 1994 reflecting the fact that     personal computers and related equipment, which inherently     have lower margins, contributed a larger portion to the     overall sales mix in 1995 versus 1994.  This trend is     expected to continue in 1996.        Gross profit as a percentage of sales declined in 1994 to     39.0% from the 1993 level of 41.9%.  Expansion of the     Computer City and Incredible Universe store formats impacted     gross margin during these years.  During 1994, Computer City     and Incredible Universe represented 31.7% of total sales and     operating revenues compared to 18.6% of the 1993 total.     Offsetting the mix of business shift within Tandy were the     increasing gross margins at RadioShack in 1994, which     continued to benefit from a lower percentage of sales related     to low margin computer equipment and a higher percentage     associated with the sale of higher gross margin categories     including parts, accessories and consumer electronics.      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES       Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") as a     percentage of sales and operating revenues for the year ended     December 31, 1995 declined from the years ended December 31,     1994 and 1993.  The accompanying table summarizes the     breakdown of various components of SG&A and their related     percentage of sales and operating revenues.  The lower SG&A     percentage reflects the lower costs, relative to net sales     and operating revenues, of the Company's newer retail formats     (Computer City and Incredible Universe), as well as the lower     operating costs achieved through cost reduction programs.        In comparison with the prior year, payroll and commissions     expense for 1995 decreased as a percentage of total sales and     operating revenues while the dollar amounts increased from     year to year.  The decrease as a percentage of sales is due     to the increase in combined Computer City and Incredible     Universe sales as a percentage of total sales and operating     revenues from 31.7% in 1994 to 42.9% in 1995.  These     divisions have an inherently lower salary structure when     compared to the total company.        Advertising costs for 1995 have decreased slightly as a     percentage of sales, while the dollar amounts have increased     since 1994.  The increase in advertising costs relates to the     addition of 30 new Computer City and eight Incredible     Universe stores during 1995 and, therefore, increased     marketing efforts in these new markets.  Additionally,     RadioShack incurred minor advertising expense increases     primarily relating to inflation.        Rent expense in 1995 decreased as a percentage of sales in     comparison with the prior year, while the dollar amounts     remained relatively stable.  This decrease as a percentage of     sales directly relates to the closing of Tandy Name Brand     stores and the increase in the number of Computer City and     Incredible Universe stores, as they have lower rent expense     as a percentage of sales than the Company as a whole.  The     relatively stable dollar amount is the result of the     reduction in rent expenses related to the 233 closed Tandy     Name Brand units offset by the rent of the additional     RadioShack, Computer City and Incredible Universe stores.        The expenses of the credit operations have significantly     declined as a result of the sale of the private label credit     card portfolios which was completed by March 31, 1995.        The sale of the credit card portfolio balance has     eliminated most of the risk of uncollectible accounts     receivable, thereby significantly reducing the bad debt     provision during 1995 as compared to prior years.  In     addition, servicing costs associated with the portfolio have     also been eliminated with the sale.  These factors were the     primary contributors to the decrease in the expenses of the     credit operations.  Offsetting these reductions are decreased     interest income (see discussion below) resulting from the     credit card portfolio sale.  Commencing in 1995, the Company     receives fees from an unrelated third party financier of its     private label credit card portfolio balance for the     generation of normal interest bearing accounts, and pays a     fee for the generation of special purpose promotional     accounts, such as "zero percent interest for twelve months".     These fees are classified in Credit card fees in the     accompanying SG&A table and are the primary reason for the     increase in this category in 1995 versus 1994.  Credit card     fees expense also includes fees associated with third party     bank credit cards.        Other SG&A expenses increased $22,728,000 in 1995 to     $178,636,000, primarily relating to store growth.        Although payroll and commissions expense for 1994 increased     in dollars in comparison with 1993, this cost decreased as a     percentage of sales and operating revenues.  This was due to     the increase in Computer City and Incredible Universe sales     as a percentage of total sales and operating revenues from     18.6% in 1993 to 31.7% in 1994; these divisions have an     inherently lower salary structure when compared to     RadioShack.  In addition, Computer City payroll expense as a     percentage of Computer City sales decreased from 1993 to     1994, while that of the other retail divisions has remained     approximately the same from year to year.        Advertising costs decreased as a percentage of sales and     operating revenues in the year ended December 31, 1994 as     compared to the year ended December 31, 1993.  Management     focused its efforts on more efficient advertising methods for     RadioShack, utilizing the Company's database of customer     activity to reduce costs while maintaining market awareness.     Advertising costs increased in dollars compared to the prior     year as new Computer City and Incredible Universe stores     opened and RadioShack shifted its marketing program to     electronic media.  The Company spent approximately 30% of its     advertising funds for television and radio commercials,     compared to 20% in previous years.  RadioShack's advertising     spots were shifted from sports-related events to prime-time     shows in order to reach a broader audience.        Rent expense increased slightly in dollars but decreased as     a percentage of sales during the year ended December 31, 1994     as compared to the year ended December 31, 1993.  The     increase in rent expense was due to a net increase of 45     RadioShack stores and the addition of 29 Computer City stores     and six Incredible Universe stores.  Incredible Universe and     Computer City formats typically have lower rent, as a     percentage of sales, than Tandy overall.        The Company's credit operations were successful in     supporting sales of the retail operations during 1994 and     1993.  Private label credit cards represented 35% of credit     sales for the year ended December 31, 1994 and 34% for the     year ended December 31, 1993.  Expenses associated with the     credit card operations, which are included in SG&A expense,     decreased as a percentage of sales during this period because     of a decrease in credit losses which reflected a stronger     economy.  As discussed above, the Company sold its Computer     City and Incredible Universe private label credit card     portfolios in 1994 and in the first quarter of 1995 sold its     RadioShack and McDuff private label credit card portfolios.        Credit card fees in 1994 increased over that in 1993     primarily due to an increase in discount fees paid to third     party bank cards because of both increased sales in the     Computer City and Incredible Universe formats and an increase     in credit card sales as a percentage of sales.        Other SG&A expenses increased $45,774,000 from 1993 to     1994.  RadioShack merchandise repair expenses increased     $8,261,000 in 1994 primarily reflecting an increase in     extended service plan sales.  The change in other SG&A also     reflects the $6,047,000 gain on the 1993 sale of the     Company's interests in two cellular telephone manufacturing     joint ventures, the $1,796,000 realized loss on the sale of     the cellular joint ventures included in the 1993 foreign     currency transactions and an increase in attorney fees of     $4,671,000 in 1994.

The dollar amount of     depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended     December 31, 1995 increased 8.5% over the dollar amount for     the year ended December 31, 1994 and 15.1% over the dollar     amount in 1993. The increase was due to additional capital     expenditures related to new stores added in the past two     years.  This increase was partially offset by the closure of     the Tandy Name Brand stores previously discussed.  In 1995     the Company added 160 RadioShack stores (net of closings),     eight Incredible Universe stores and 30 Computer City stores.     Six Incredible Universe stores, 29 Computer City stores and     45 RadioShack stores (net of closings) were added during     1994, thereby increasing depreciation and amortization from     1993 to 1994.

The decrease in interest income is     directly attributable to the sale of the Company's private     label credit card portfolios in the December quarter of 1994     and the March quarter of 1995.        Interest income in 1994 and 1993 was primarily attributable     to the Company's credit card operations.  Increased short-     term investments in 1994 resulted from proceeds received from     the divestiture of discontinued manufacturing and marketing     operations, as well as from cash provided by operating     activities.        Interest income from the credit card operations decreased     in 1995 due to the sale of the Company's credit card     portfolios.  As a result of the sale of the Computer City and     Incredible Universe credit card portfolios in 1994 and the     RadioShack and McDuff credit card portfolios in 1995, the     Company will no longer earn interest income from these     portfolios.  Interest income for 1995 includes the amount of     interest received prior to the sale of the RadioShack and     McDuff portfolios.  The decrease in interest income from the     credit card operations from 1993 to 1994 was a result of     increased use of certain special sales promotions and     marketing initiatives, some of which provided for no interest     charges for specified initial periods.  The decline in     average credit card receivables in 1994 resulted from     increased payments from credit customers reflecting the     overall improvement in the economy and a desire by consumers     to shift debt to lower interest rate instruments.        Other interest income relates primarily to short-term     investments of the Company.  The AST Research, Inc. ("AST")     note will mature in July 1996 and, therefore, interest income     derived therefrom will be less in 1996 than in previous     years.  Interest income relating to the InterTAN notes will     continue in 1996.  The Company does not anticipate  interest     income relating to settlements with the IRS in 1996.        The increase in interest expense for the year ended     December 31, 1995 as compared to the year ended December 31,     1994 is due to an increase in the use of short-term borrowing     facilities.  The use of these facilities was significantly     higher during the year ended December 31, 1995 as the Company     retired long-term debt, funded store expansion and funded the     share repurchase program.  Even though short-term debt     outstanding at the end of the year decreased 17.1%, the     weighted average of seasonal bank loans outstanding during     the year increased from $16,358,000 in 1994 to $106,963,000     in 1995, and the weighted average interest rate rose from     5.2% in 1994 to 6.2% in 1995.  Assuming interest rates do not     change significantly, it is anticipated that the weighted     average of short-term debt used during 1996 will increase as     compared to that used in 1995 due to a greater need for funds     for the share repurchase and store expansion programs.     Although a portion of the funds will be met with cash flows     from operations, proceeds from the AST note due in July 1996     and continuing principal payments from the InterTAN notes     receivable, the Company still anticipates that a portion will     be met through increased debt borrowings.  As a result , the     Company expects to incur net interest expense in 1996.  Long-     term debt decreased 8.2% from December 31, 1994 due to the     repayment of debt such as medium-term notes and senior notes.     During 1995, a significant portion of the cash proceeds     received from the sale of the credit operations was applied     to the funding of store expansion and repurchase of the final     7,500,000 shares under the completed 12,500,000 share     repurchase program.      PROVISION FOR BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING       In December 1994, the Company adopted a business     restructuring plan to close or convert 233 of the 306 Tandy     Name Brand stores.  At March 31, 1995 all 233 stores had been     closed or converted.  The remaining stores have become part     of the Tandy Specialty Retail Group of RadioShack.  A pre-tax     charge of $89,071,000 was taken in the fourth quarter of     fiscal 1994 related to the closing and conversion of these     stores.  The components of the restructuring charge and an     analysis of the amounts charged against the reserve are     outlined in a table in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated     Financial Statements.        Sales and operating revenues and operating losses     associated with the closed Tandy Name Brand stores in 1995     approximated $28,041,000 and $3,064,000 respectively.  Sales     and operating revenues associated with the closed Tandy Name     Brand stores approximated $261,990,000 and $271,914,000 for     1994 and 1993, respectively, and operating losses     approximated $18,125,000 and $15,342,000 for 1994 and 1993,     respectively.  In conjunction with this restructuring, 1,425     employees were terminated, most of whom were store employees.      GAIN ON SALE OF CREDIT OPERATIONS AND EXTENDED SERVICE     CONTRACTS       In December 1994, the Company entered into an agreement     with SPS Transaction Services, Inc., a majority-owned     subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover & Company ("SPS") to sell     its Computer City and Incredible Universe private label     credit card portfolios without recourse.  As a result of the     agreement, Tandy received cash of $85,764,000 and received a     deferred payment of $179,777,000.  The Company recognized a     gain of $35,708,000 in the accompanying 1994 Consolidated     Statements of Income.  The deferred payment amount did not     bear interest.  The total principal amount of $179,777,000     was paid in full during 1995.  The Company discounted the     deferred payment by $3,477,000 to yield interest income of     approximately 5% over the twelve month payout period.        On March 30, 1995, the Company completed the sale, at net     book value, of the RadioShack and Tandy Name Brand private     label credit card accounts and substantially all related     accounts receivable to Hurley State Bank, a subsidiary of     SPS.  As a result of the transaction, Tandy received     $342,822,000 in cash and a deferred payment amount of     $49,444,000.  The deferred payment does not bear interest and     principal is paid monthly with final payment due February 29,     1996.  The remaining discounted deferred payment balance of     $2,098,000 is classified as a current receivable in the     accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 1995.        Effective December 1994, the Company transferred all of its     existing obligations with respect to extended service     contracts in force at December 31, 1994, with the exception     of certain contracts aggregating approximately $7,734,000, to     an unrelated third party.  The unrelated third party     contractually assumed all of the Company's legal obligations     and risk of future loss pursuant to the extended service     contracts in exchange for $75,059,000.  As a result, the     Company recognized a gain of $55,729,000 associated with this     transaction in its accompanying 1994 Consolidated Statements     of Income.  The Company continues to provide repair services     to customers who tender products pursuant to the extended     service contracts on a non-exclusive basis.  The unrelated     third party pays the Company competitive market rates for     repairs on products tendered pursuant to the extended service     contracts.      PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES       The effective tax rate was 38.25% for the year ended     December 31, 1995, 37.6% for the year ended December 31,1994     and 37.1% for the year ended December 31, 1993.  The increase     in the effective tax rates for these years reflects shifts of     income into states with higher income tax rates such as     California, New York and Ohio.        The IRS Dallas field office is reviewing the Company's     1987-1989 tax returns and has referred certain issues to the     IRS National office.  The resolution of this matter, which     raises questions about the private letter rulings issued by     the IRS regarding the spin-off of InterTAN and certain other     tax matters, could result in additional taxes and interest to     the Company.  Although aggregate additional taxes involved in     these transactions could potentially range from $0 to $27     million, based on the advice of the Company's independent tax     advisors, the Company believes it would prevail if any tax     litigation was instituted.  Any ultimate tax assessment would     also include interest expense.  In any event, the Company     believes the ultimate resolution would have no material     impact on the Company's financial condition.      DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS       On June 25, 1993, the Board of Directors of Tandy adopted a     formal plan of divestiture under which the Company would sell     its computer manufacturing and marketing businesses, the     O'Sullivan Industries, Inc. ("O'Sullivan") ready-to-assemble     furniture manufacturing and related marketing business, the     Memtek Products division and the Lika printed circuit board     business.            Computer Manufacturing. The Company closed the sale         of the computer manufacturing and marketing         businesses to AST on July 13, 1993.  In accordance         with the terms of the definitive agreement between         Tandy and AST, Tandy received $15,000,000 upon         closing of the sale.  The balance of the purchase         price of $96,720,000 was payable by a promissory         note. The Company has discounted this note by         $2,000,000 and the discount continues to be         recognized as interest income using the effective         interest rate method over the life of the note.            During the quarter ended September 30, 1995, the         Company received $6,720,000 from AST as a prepayment         on its promissory note.  The original promissory note         was supported by a standby letter of credit in the         amount of the lesser of $100,000,000 or 70% of the         outstanding principal amount of the promissory note.         This letter of credit has been replaced by a         $75,000,000 Letter of Guarantee dated August 22,         1995, from Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., a Korean         corporation, or, alternatively, Samsung Electronics         America, Inc., a New York corporation.  As of         December 31, 1995, Samsung owned approximately 40% of         AST's outstanding stock.  Samsung's current credit         ratings by S&P and Moody's are A- and Baa1,         respectively.            As a result of the prepayment, the note has been         amended and the principal amount reduced to         $90,000,000.  The terms of the original promissory         note stipulated that the outstanding principal         balance could be paid on July 11, 1996 at AST's         option in cash or the common stock of AST, provided         that not more than 50% of the original principal         amount of the note could be paid in common stock of         AST.  The amended promissory note provides that AST         may repay the note in AST common stock, provided that         not more than the lesser of (a) $30,000,000, or (b)         33% of the outstanding principal amount of the note         at the time of payment may be payable by AST in         common stock of AST.  The interest rate on the         promissory note is currently 5% per annum and is         adjusted annually, not to exceed 5% per annum.         Interest is accrued and paid annually.            Memtek Products.  On November 10, 1993, the Company         executed a definitive agreement with Hanny Magnetics         (B.V.I.) Limited, a British Virgin Islands         corporation ("Hanny"), to sell certain assets of the         Company's Memtek Products operations, including the         license agreement with Memorex Telex, N.V. for the         use of the Memorex trademark on licensed consumer         electronics products.  This sale closed on         December 16, 1993.  Proceeds from this sale         aggregated $69,602,000.            O'Sullivan Industries.  On January 27, 1994, the         Company announced that it had reached an agreement         with the underwriters to sell all the common stock of         O'Sullivan Industries Holdings, Inc., the parent         company of O'Sullivan, to the public at $22 per         share.  The net proceeds realized by Tandy in the         initial public offering, together with a $40,000,000         cash dividend from O'Sullivan, approximated         $350,000,000.  The initial public offering closed on         February 2, 1994.            Tandy has recognized income of approximately         $1,335,000 and $4,399,000, net of tax, during the         years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively,         pursuant to a Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit         Reimbursement Agreement (the "Agreement") between         Tandy and O'Sullivan.  Under the Agreement Tandy         receives payments from O'Sullivan approximating the         federal tax benefit that O'Sullivan realizes from the         increased tax basis of its assets resulting from the         initial public offering.  The higher tax basis         increases O'Sullivan's tax deductions and,         accordingly, reduces income taxes payable by         O'Sullivan.  These payments will be made over a 15-         year time period and are contingent upon O'Sullivan's         taxable income each year.  The Company is recognizing         these payments as additional sale proceeds and gain         in the year in which the payments become due and         payable to the Company pursuant to the Agreement.         The additional gain is recorded as a reduction of         SG&A expense in the accompanying Consolidated         Statements of Income.            Lika.  On October 11, 1994, Tandy sold the assets         used in its Lika(R) printed circuit board division to         Viktron Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited         partnership.  The proceeds from the sale and         liquidation of assets approximated $16,380,000 which         included $7,754,000 in cash, proceeds from         liquidation of retained assets of $5,594,000 and         secured promissory notes for $3,032,000.  At December         31, 1995, $1,400,000 remained as a receivable from         Viktron.      CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY                                         Year Ended                                        December 31,                             -----------------------------------     (In thousands)            1995         1994         1993     --------------          ---------    ---------    ---------     Operating activities    $ 672,994    $ 268,938    $ 322,294     Investing activities     (180,347)     236,620     (57,464)     Financing activities     (554,782)    (513,160)    (164,221)          Tandy's cash flow and liquidity, in management's opinion,     remains strong.  During the year ended December 31, 1995,     cash provided by operations was $672,994,000 as compared to     $268,938,000 for the year ended December 31, 1994.        The increased cash flow from operations was due mainly to     the cash received from the sale of the credit card     portfolios, which approximated $342,822,000, collection of     the deferred payment amount from SPS of $179,777,000 and     liquidation of remaining unsold private label credit card     balances.  Inventory required less cash in 1995 than in 1994     due to liquidation of Tandy Name Brand inventory related to     closing stores and a net reduction in Computer City inventory     which was partially offset by increases in inventory to     support Incredible Universe and RadioShack store expansion,     while accounts payable and accrued expenses and income taxes     required $376,349,000 more cash in 1995 than in 1994.        During the year ended December 31, 1994, cash provided by     operations decreased from $322,294,000 in 1993 to     $268,938,000.  The decreased cash flow from operations was     due partially to the financing of receivables and inventories     related to the expansion of Computer City and Incredible     Universe store chains.  The increase of $261,071,000 in cash     used to fund accounts receivable was due primarily to the     increase in Tandy Credit receivables related to increased     retail sales by Computer City and Incredible Universe and the     use of certain special sales promotions and marketing     initiatives, some of which provided for no interest charges     for specified initial periods.  Inventory required     $156,129,000 more cash in 1994 than in 1993, relating to new     store openings and increases in average inventory to ensure     in-stock positions throughout the Christmas selling season.     Partially offsetting the cash used to finance receivables and     inventory were the sale of the Computer City and Incredible     Universe private label credit card portfolios which provided     cash of $85,764,000 as well as increases in accounts payable,     accrued expenses and income taxes which provided $184,017,000     more cash in 1994 than in 1993.  The 1994 increase in     accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes is net of     the cash expended of approximately $70,702,000 associated     with the transfer of the legal obligation and risk of loss     for existing extended service contracts to an unrelated third     party.        Investing activities involved capital expenditures     primarily for retail expansion totaling $226,511,000 for the     year ended December 31, 1995, $180,559,000 for the year ended     December 31, 1994, and $129,287,000 for the year ended     December 31, 1993.  Proceeds from the sale of property, plant     and equipment in 1995 and 1994 resulted primarily from sale-     leaseback transactions involving certain Incredible Universe     stores which netted the Company $37,550,000 and $52,719,000,     respectively, in cash.  Prepayment of a portion of the note     receivable from AST amounted to $6,720,000 in 1995.  Proceeds     received from the sale of divested operations totaled     $359,004,000 and $111,988,000 during the years ended     December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  See "Discontinued     Operations".  Investing activities in 1993 also included     $31,663,000 for the purchase of InterTAN's bank debt and the     extension and funding of a working capital line of credit.     See "InterTAN Update" for further information.  Future store     expansions and refurbishments and other capital expenditures     such as updated POS and information systems are expected to     approximate $150,000,000 to $160,000,000 per year over the     next two years and will be funded primarily from available     cash and cash flow from operations.  The Company's cash flow     from investing activities will be impacted in 1996 by the     maturity of the AST note and note payments from InterTAN.  It     is not anticipated that additional stores in 1996 will     materially impact inventory levels.        Purchases of treasury stock used cash of $502,239,000,     $275,415,000 and $27,650,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993,     respectively.  Increases in treasury stock purchases in 1995     and 1994 related primarily to the share repurchase program.     See "Capital Structure and Financial Condition" for further     discussion.  Sales of treasury stock to the Company's Stock     Purchase Program generated cash of $44,623,000, $41,579,000     and $42,067,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.     Dividends paid, net of tax, in 1995, 1994 and 1993 amounted     to $62,991,000, $74,512,000 and $74,873,000, respectively. As     a result of the Company calling for the redemption of its     $2.14 Depositary Shares of the Company's Series C Preferred     Equity Redemption Convertible Stock ("PERCS") in March 1995,     the Company eliminated its annual dividend payment to the     PERCS shareholders of approximately $32,000,000.  However, it     paid upon conversion a cash dividend to the PERCS     shareholders of approximately $0.321 for each depositary     share, representing the accrued dividend from January 16,     1995 through the redemption date of March 10, 1995.  The     Company plans to fund common stock dividends with available     cash and cash flow from operations.        At December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company decreased     short-term borrowings by $1,778,000, $110,393,000 and     $46,885,000, respectively.  Even though short-term debt     outstanding at the end of the year has decreased 17.1% from     1994, the weighted average of seasonal bank loans outstanding     during the year increased from $16,358,000 in 1994 to     $106,963,000 in 1995.  Assuming interest rates do not change     significantly, it is anticipated that the weighted average of     short-term debt used during 1996 will increase as compared to     that used in 1995 due to a greater need for funds for the     share repurchase program and store expansion.  Although a     portion of the funds will be met with cash flow from     operations, proceeds from the AST note due in July 1996 and     continuing principal payments from the InterTAN notes     receivable, the Company still anticipates that a portion will     be met through increased debt borrowings.  The reduction in     short-term borrowings has been funded primarily by proceeds     from the sale of divested operations and cash provided by     operations.  The Company's primary source of short-term debt,     for which borrowings and repayments have been presented net     in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, consists of     short-term seasonal bank debt and commercial paper.  The     commercial paper matures within 90 days as does the short-     term seasonal bank debt.        In January 1995, the $45,000,000 of 8.69% senior notes     which were outstanding at December 31, 1994 were paid in     full.  These senior notes had been outstanding since February     7, 1990.  In February 1995, the $6,000,000 of Tandy Credit's     medium-term notes, which were outstanding at December 31,     1994 and were to mature in May and August of 1995, were paid     in full.        Following are the current credit ratings for Tandy, which     are generally considered investment grade:                                    Standard   Duff &     Category            Moody's  and Poor's  Phelps     --------            -------  ----------  ------     Medium Term Notes    Baa2        A-        A-     ESOP Senior Notes    Baa2        A-        N/A     Commercial Paper     P-2         A-2       D-1-      CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION       The Company's balance sheet and financial condition     continue to be strong.  The Company's available borrowing     facilities as of December 31, 1995 are detailed in Note 9 of     the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.        In the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992, the Company issued     150,000 PERCS shares and used the proceeds of this offering     to purchase $430,000,000 of the Company's common stock for     treasury.  The PERCS are discussed further in Note 18 of the     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  On January 23,     1995, Tandy announced that it had exercised its right to call     the issued and outstanding PERCS for conversion on March 10,     1995 prior to the mandatory conversion date of April 15,     1995.  For each depositary share redeemed, 0.787757 Tandy     common shares were issued for an aggregate of approximately     11,816,000 shares.        On December 18, 1995, the Company announced that its Board     of Directors authorized management to purchase up to     5,000,000 shares of its common stock in addition to shares     required for employee plans.  This authorization to purchase     additional shares follows the 12,500,000 share repurchase     program which began in August 1994 and concluded in December     1995.  Purchases will be made from time to time in the open     market, and it is expected that funding of the program will     come from operating cash flow and existing bank facilities.     As of December 31, 1995, the Company had not repurchased any     shares under this new program.        The Company's issue of 10% subordinated debentures due June     30, 1994 was called by the Company on February 23, 1994 for     redemption on April 1, 1994.  The redemption was at 100% of     face value or $32,431,000.        The revolving credit backup facilities to Tandy's     commercial paper program were renewed in May 1994.  These     facilities are to be used only if maturing commercial paper     cannot be repaid due to an inability to sell new commercial     paper.  This agreement is composed of two facilities--one for     $200,000,000 expiring May 1996 and another $200,000,000     facility expiring in May 1997.  Annual commitment fees for     the facilities are 2/25 of 1% per annum and 1/8 of 1% per     annum, respectively, whether used or unused.        In fiscal 1991, the Company filed a shelf registration for     $500,000,000, of which $400,000,000 was designated for     medium-term notes.  During fiscal 1991, short-term debt was     refinanced by the issuance of $155,500,000 in medium-term     notes.  Tandy's medium-term notes outstanding at December 31,     1995 totaled $67,104,000 compared to $73,044,000 and     $125,479,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.     Availability under the program at December 31, 1995     approximated $312,800,000.  In February 1995, the $6,000,000     of Tandy Credit's medium-term notes, which were outstanding     at December 31, 1994 and were to mature in May and August of     1995, were paid in full.        The total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 17.1% at     December 31, 1995 and 1994 and 22.8% at December 31, 1993.     This debt-to-capitalization ratio could increase as Tandy     continues to repurchase shares under the existing     authorization and fund new store openings and other capital     expenditures such as updating its POS and other information     systems.        The Company also has agreements with unaffiliated groups to     lease certain stores and these groups are committed to make     available up to $317,426,000 for development or acquisition     of stores leased by the Company.  At December 31, 1995, the     Company had used $208,178,000 of that availability.     Agreements with these groups mature over the next five years,     and the Company is continuously monitoring financial markets     to optimize renewal terms.  In connection with the financing     of 16 locations by these groups, the Company has guaranteed     the residual value of the properties at approximately     $160,671,000 at the end of the lease terms.        Management believes that the Company's present borrowing     capacity is greater than the established credit lines and     long-term debt in place. Management also believes that the     Company's cash flow from operations, cash and short-term     investments and its available borrowing facilities are more     than adequate to fund planned store expansion, to meet debt     service and dividend requirements and to fund its share     repurchase program.      INFLATION       Inflation has not significantly impacted the Company over     the past three years.  Management does not expect inflation     to have a significant impact on operations in the foreseeable     future unless global situations substantially affect the     world economy.      NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS       In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board     (the "FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting     Standards ("FAS") No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of     Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed     Of" ("FAS 121"), which is effective for fiscal years     beginning after December 15, 1995.  Effective January 1,     1996, the Company will adopt FAS 121 which requires that     long-lived assets (i.e. property, plant and equipment and     goodwill) held and used by an entity be reviewed for     impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances     indicate that the net book value of the asset may not be     recoverable.  An impairment loss will be recognized if the     sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and     before interest) from the use of the asset is less than the     net book value of the asset.  The amount of the impairment     loss will generally be measured as the difference between the     net book value of the assets and the estimated fair value of     the related assets.  Upon adoption in the first quarter of     fiscal 1996, it is anticipated that the Company may record an     initial pre-tax impairment loss of approximately $15,000,000     to $25,000,000 to conform with this statement since it     requires grouping of assets at the lowest level of cash flows     to determine impairment.        In October 1995, the FASB issued FAS No. 123, "Accounting     for Stock-Based Compensation" ("FAS 123"), which is effective     for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995.     Effective January 1, 1996, the Company will adopt FAS 123     which establishes financial accounting and reporting     standards for stock-based employee compensation plans.  The     pronouncement defines a fair value based method of accounting     for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument and     encourages all entities to adopt that method of accounting     for all of their employee stock option compensation plans.     However, it also allows an entity to continue to measure     compensation cost for those plans using the intrinsic value     based method of accounting as prescribed by Accounting     Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued     to Employees" ("APB 25").  Entities electing to remain with     the accounting in APB 25 must make pro forma disclosures of     net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based     method of accounting defined in FAS 123 had been applied.     The Company will continue to account for stock-based employee     compensation plans under the intrinsic method pursuant to APB     25 and will make the disclosures in its footnotes as required     by FAS 123.      SALE OF JOINT VENTURE INTEREST       During the quarter ended September 30, 1993, the Company     entered into definitive agreements with Nokia Corporation     ("Nokia") to sell the Company's interests in two cellular     telephone manufacturing joint ventures with Nokia.  Pursuant     to the terms of the definitive agreements, the Company     received an aggregate of approximately $31,700,000 for its     interests in these joint ventures.  The Company also entered     into a three-year Preferred Supplier Agreement pursuant to     which it has agreed to purchase from Nokia substantially all     of RadioShack's requirements for cellular telephones at     prevailing competitive market prices at the time of the     purchase.  These operations were not part of the overall     divestment plan adopted in June 1993 by the Company's Board     of Directors; therefore, the gain on the sale and their     results of operations were not included in discontinued     operations.      INTERTAN UPDATE       Summarized in the tables below are the amounts recognized     by the Company at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and for each of     the three years ended December 31, 1995, in relation to its     agreements with InterTAN.  The Company purchased the notes at     a discount and InterTAN has an obligation to pay the gross     amount of the notes.

Under the merchandise purchase terms of the     original distribution agreement, InterTAN could purchase on     payment terms products sold or secured by Tandy.  A&A, a     subsidiary of Tandy, was the exclusive purchasing agent for     products originating in the Far East for InterTAN.        On July 16, 1993, InterTAN had an account payable to Tandy     of approximately $17,000,000, of which $7,600,000 was in     default.  InterTAN's outstanding purchase orders for     merchandise placed under the distribution agreement with     Tandy, but not yet shipped, totaled approximately     $44,000,000.  Since InterTAN defaulted, on July 16 Tandy     terminated the merchandise purchase terms of the distribution     agreement and the license agreements.  Tandy offered InterTAN     interim license agreements which expired July 22, 1993,     unless extended.  The agreements were extended on July 23,     1993.        On July 30, 1993, Trans World Electronics, Inc. ("Trans     World"), a subsidiary of Tandy, reached agreement with     InterTAN's banking syndicate to buy approximately $42,000,000     of InterTAN's debt at a negotiated, discounted price.  The     closing of this purchase occurred on August 5, 1993, at which     time Tandy resumed limited shipments to InterTAN and granted     a series of short-term, interim licenses pending the     execution of new license and merchandise agreements.  The     debt purchased from the banks was restructured into a seven-     year note with interest of 8.64% due semiannually beginning     February 25, 1994 and semiannual principal payments beginning     February 25, 1995 (the "Series A" note).  Trans World     provided approximately $10,000,000 in working capital and     trade credit to InterTAN.  Interest on the working capital     loan (the "Series B" note) of 8.11% is due semiannually     beginning February 25, 1994 with the principal due in full on     August 25, 1996.  Trans World also has received warrants with     a five-year term exercisable for approximately 1,450,000     shares of InterTAN common stock at an exercise price of     $6.618 per share.  As required by an agreement with Tandy,     InterTAN has registered the warrants under the Securities Act     of 1933.  At December 31, 1995, InterTAN's common stock     price, as quoted in the Wall Street Journal, was $7.25 per                             -------------------     share.  At February 29, 1996, InterTAN's common stock price     was $5.00 per share.        In addition to the bank debt purchased by Trans World and     the working capital loan, InterTAN's obligations to Trans     World included two additional notes for approximately     $23,665,000 (the "Series C" note) and $24,037,000 (the     "Series D" note) with interest rates of 7.5% and 8%,     respectively.  All principal and interest on these two notes     have been paid in full.  Subject to certain conditions     described below, all of Tandy's debt from InterTAN is secured     by a first priority lien on substantially all of InterTAN's     assets in Canada and the U.K.        A new merchandise agreement was reached with InterTAN in     October 1993, and amended in 1995, which requires a     percentage of future purchase orders to be backed by letters     of credit posted by InterTAN.  New license agreements provide     a royalty payable to Tandy, which began in the September 1995     quarter.  InterTAN had obligations for purchase orders     outstanding for merchandise ordered by A&A for InterTAN but     not yet shipped totaling approximately $25,447,000 at     December 31, 1995.        InterTAN increased its bank revolving credit facility with     its new banking syndicate to Canadian $60,000,000 (U.S.     $43,975,000 equivalent at December 31, 1995) in 1994.  In the     event of InterTAN's default on the bank credit line, Tandy     will, at the option of InterTAN's new banking syndicate,     purchase InterTAN's inventory and related accounts receivable     at 50% of their net book value, up to the amount of     outstanding bank loans, but not to exceed Canadian     $60,000,000.  In that event, Tandy could foreclose on its     first priority lien on InterTAN's assets in Canada and the     U.K.  If Tandy fails to purchase the inventory and related     accounts receivable of InterTAN from the banking syndicate,     the syndicate, upon notice to Tandy and expiration of time,     can foreclose upon InterTAN's assets in Canada and the U.K.     ahead of Tandy.  The inventory repurchase agreement between     InterTAN's banking syndicate and Tandy has been amended and     restated to reflect the foregoing.        A&A will continue as the exclusive purchasing agent for     InterTAN in the Far East on a commission basis.  Effective     March 1994, only the purchasing agent commission and sales by     Tandy manufacturing plants to InterTAN were recorded as sales     and operating revenues.  InterTAN purchases from third     parties through A&A are no longer recorded as sales,     reflecting the arrangement under the new merchandise     agreement.  Accordingly, sales by Tandy to InterTAN in 1994     and 1995 were considerably lower than in prior years;     however, the earned income relating thereto was not     materially different.        Through February 1996, InterTAN has met all of its payment     obligations to Tandy.  Published income before taxes for the     six months ended December 31, 1995 approximated $13,151,000     compared to $15,329,000 for the six months ended December 31,     1994.  The reduction in InterTAN's earnings per fully diluted     share from $1.11 in the six months ended December 31, 1994 to     $0.52 in the current six months is primarily attributable to     a tax credit taken in fiscal 1995, and to a lesser extent, an     economic downtrend in its primary market of Canada.  Nothing     has come to the attention of management which would indicate     that InterTAN would not be able to continue to meet its     payment obligations pursuant to the debt agreements with     Tandy.        Canadian tax authorities are reviewing InterTAN's Canadian     subsidiary's 1987-89 tax returns.  The Company cannot     determine whether the ultimate resolution of that review will     have an effect on InterTAN's ability to meet its obligations     to Tandy, but at present, nothing has come to the attention     of the Company which would lead it to believe that the     ultimate resolution of this review would impair InterTAN's     ability to meet its obligations to Tandy.
