ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF     OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.           Tandy Corporation ("Tandy" or the "Company") changed its     fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31 effective     December 31, 1992.           The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of     Results of Operations and Financial Condition compares the     full calendar year ended December 31, 1993 with the full     fiscal years ended June 30, 1992 and 1991.  Although these     twelve-month periods end at different times, management     believes that the seasonality of the retail business relating     to Christmas is so significant that it would distort trends     and related percentage comparisons to sales for the readers     if a full year's results were compared to the six-month     transition period ended December 31, 1992.      NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES          For the year ending December 31, 1993, overall sales     grew 12% to $4,102,551,000 as compared to $3,649,284,000 for     the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992.  This increase was     primarily due to the opening of three Incredible Universe     stores and the expansion of the Computer City chain.  On a     comparable store basis, Radio Shack's sales increased     slightly during the year ended December 31, 1993 as compared     to the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  A moderate increase     in sales of Radio Shack's core business (i.e., consumer     electronics and accessories) was offset by a decline in sales     of personal computers through the Radio Shack division.           The decrease in Radio Shack's computer business reflects     the impact of sharply lower pricing in response to     competitive pressures in the marketplace.  The changing     dynamics of the personal computer business has had a     significant impact on Radio Shack's performance during fiscal     years 1993, 1992 and 1991.  A combination of shifts in retail     distribution to super stores and telemarketing combined with     rapidly declining prices has taken the computer category from     approximately 17.0% of Radio Shack's sales with a gross     profit of 29.0% in the year ended June 30, 1992 to     approximately 14.2% of sales and a gross profit of 15.2% for     the year ended December 31, 1993.  Radio Shack's extensive     assortment of electronic parts, accessories and specialty     items differentiates it from other consumer electronics     retailers in the marketplace.   The table below shows the     breakdown by major category of Radio Shack sales.

The decline in Radio Shack's computer sales has been     offset by sales of the Computer City chain.  The Computer     City chain opened its 40th supercenter in December 1993,     approximately two years after its initial launching of eight     stores.  Computer City's sales increases were the result of     25 additional stores since June 30, 1992 and comparable store     sales gains at old stores in excess of 30% for the year ended     December 31, 1993.           The Name Brand Retail Group experienced a sales decrease     in calendar 1993 as compared to the June 1992 fiscal year.     This decrease was primarily a result of the closing of 110     McDuff and VideoConcepts stores in February 1993.  This     decline was offset in part by the addition of three     Incredible Universe stores.  The first two Incredible     Universe stores were opened in the fall of 1992 with the     third having been added in the fall of 1993.           Shipments to InterTAN Inc. decreased for calendar year     1993 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  See     the discussion in the "InterTAN  Update" found on page 23.

For the six-month period ending December 31, 1992, net     sales and operating revenues increased 6.4% to     $2,161,149,000.  This increase was primarily due to the     opening of two Incredible Universe stores and expansion of     the Computer City chain.  Comparable store sales were     essentially even with the six-month period ended December 31,     1991.           The change in the Company's sales in the fiscal years     ended June 30, 1992 and 1991 reflected a continued adverse     product cycle in consumer electronics, a weak economy and     widespread price cutting in the personal computer market.     Sales through all retail stores increased 3.2% in the fiscal     year ended June 30, 1992 as compared with fiscal 1991.           The increase in sales in the fiscal year ended June 30,     1992 was primarily due to new store expansions.  During     fiscal 1992, 15 Computer City stores, 34 McDuff and     VideoConcepts stores and seven of The Edge in Electronics     stores were opened.  On a company-wide basis, comparable     store sales declined 1% in fiscal 1992 following a similar     decline in the prior year.  Comparable store sales increased     slightly at Radio Shack in fiscal 1992 due to the continued     strengthening of its electronics parts, accessories and     specialty items business.  This increase more than offset a     decline in Radio Shack's computer business which was impacted     significantly by extensive price cutting in the marketplace.     Comparable store sales of the McDuff and VideoConcepts stores     were down 10% in fiscal 1992 as compared to fiscal 1991,     reflecting intense competitive pressures in name brand     electronics retailing.           To address the pricing and distribution shifts in     computer retailing, the Computer City chain of super stores     was launched in October 1991 (fiscal year ended June 30,     1992).  The Computer City format is designed to sell high     volumes of well known name brand personal computers and     related products at discount prices.           Though in operation for only the last seven months of     fiscal 1992, Computer City's sales more than offset the     decline in the Company's U.S. computer sales through Radio     Shack and direct sales.  As of June 30, 1992, 15 Computer     City stores were in operation, 13 in the U.S. and two in     Europe.       GROSS PROFIT          Gross profit as a percent of sales and operating     revenues for the year ended December 31, 1993 was 41.9% as     compared to 43.5% for the six months ended December 31, 1992,     47.2% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992 and 48.7% for     the fiscal year ended June 30, 1991.  The decline, in part,     reflects the faster growth of new high-volume formats such as     Computer City and Incredible Universe with inherently lower     gross margins than Radio Shack stores.  The Company expects     this trend to continue as sales at Incredible Universe and     Computer City increase.  Combined Computer City and     Incredible Universe sales contributed 18.6%, 8.9% and 2.6% to     consolidated sales in the fiscal year ended December 31,     1993, the six months ended December 31, 1992 and the fiscal     year ended June 30, 1992, respectively.  The 5.3% decline in     gross profit percent from fiscal 1992 reflects the growth of     the newer retail businesses.  Management expects the     long-term impact of accelerated growth for its new businesses     to result in a lower consolidated gross margin as a percent     of sales and operating revenues.           In addition to the increasing effect of the lower gross     margin businesses, Radio Shack's gross margin has trended     down during the fiscal years ended December 31, 1993 and June     30, 1992 and 1991 because of a decline in computer margins     resulting from more competitive pricing.  In the absence of     any additional major decreases in computer retail prices in     the industry, management believes this decline in Radio     Shack's gross margin will diminish during 1994.  Partially     offsetting the decline were increased sales of high-margin     electronic parts, accessories and specialty items sold     through Radio Shack.  In management's opinion, new concepts     which could increase Radio Shack gross margins include     introducing the Radio Shack Gift Express program, creating     new store formats and the launching of The Repair Shop at     Radio Shack, a name brand out-of-warranty repair program.     Competitive pressures in name brand electronics retailing     decreased McDuff's and VideoConcepts' gross margins in each     of the three fiscal years ended December 31, 1993 and June     30, 1992 and 1991.  Additionally, gross margins were impacted     in the McDuff and VideoConcepts units by the increasing     percentage of sales related to the lower margin computer     category.      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES          Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") as     a percent of sales and operating revenues for the year ended     December 31, 1993 declined from the year ended June 30, 1992     and declined for the six months ended December 31, 1992 from     the six months ended December 31, 1991.  The accompanying     table summarizes the breakdown of various components of SG&A     and their related percentage of sales and operating revenues.     The lower SG&A percent reflects the lower costs, relative to     net sales and operating revenues associated with the     Company's newer retail formats, as well as the lower     operating costs achieved through cost reduction programs and     the further streamlining of operations in the new retail     formats.           SG&A expenses as a percent of sales and operating     revenues declined in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992 as     compared with fiscal 1991.  The benefits of actions taken to     streamline operations and reduce costs are reflected in most     expense categories in fiscal 1992.           Year-to-year comparisons are impacted by the $18,987,000     gain which includes a foreign currency gain of $6,894,000 in     fiscal year 1992 from the sale of a Japanese subsidiary, the     assets of which were primarily real estate, and the remaining     foreign currency gain of $3,748,000 recognized in 1992 as     opposed to a foreign currency gain of only $762,000 in 1993.     The Company's exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has     decreased significantly with the disposal of the Company's     computer manufacturing and marketing operations as well as     the disposal of Memtek Products.  Both of these operations     had significant European operations.           Advertising costs have decreased in dollars and as a     percent of sales and operating revenues in the fiscal year     ended December 31, 1993 as compared to the fiscal years ended     June 30, 1992 and 1991.  Management has focused its efforts     on more efficient advertising methods in Radio Shack     utilizing the Company's data base of customer activity to     reduce costs while maintaining market awareness.           Rent expense has declined slightly in dollars and more     significantly as a percent of sales during the year ended     December 31, 1993 as compared to fiscal 1992.  This     percentage decrease results primarily from the fact that the     Company owns most of the Incredible Universe locations and is     additionally impacted by Computer City's low rent to sales     ratio.           The Company's credit operations have been successful in     supporting sales of the retail operations.  Private label     credit cards represented 34% of credit sales for the year     ended December 31, 1993, 36% for the six months ended     December 31, 1992, 43% in fiscal 1992 and 44% in fiscal 1991.      This decline in the percentage results from increased sales     through the Computer City and Incredible Universe stores     which have a lower percentage of private label card usage. A     decrease in bad debt expense relates to tighter credit     controls and a 4% decline from fiscal 1992 in overall private     label credit card sales. Expenses associated with the credit     card operations which are included in SG&A expense have     decreased.

The pre-tax charge of $48,000,000     related primarily to the closing of approximately 110 of the     432 Tandy Name Brand Retail Group stores, mainly McDuff     Supercenters in major market areas and, to a lesser extent,     the elimination of certain product lines.  Some product lines     were reduced or eliminated after consideration of competitive     factors and market trends.           In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1991, the Company     recorded a business restructuring charge of $8,531,000.  The     charge covered anticipated costs associated with Radio Shack     computer centers which were being closed, relocated or     converted to other store formats or sales offices.  These     costs included the estimated lease obligations for store     closings and relocations as well as estimated fixed asset     write-offs for all affected stores.      DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION          Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of     sales and operating revenues decreased slightly in the year     ended December 31, 1993 as compared with the year ended June     30, 1992.  The dollar amount of depreciation and amortization     expense for the year ended December 31, 1993 increased 7%     over the dollar amount for the year ended June 30, 1992, due     to additional capital expenditures related to the three     Incredible Universe stores and the addition of 25 new     Computer City stores.  The dollar amount of depreciation and     amortization expense for the year ended June 30, 1992     increased 5% over the prior fiscal year due to increased     capital expenditures related to the new Tandy Name Brand     Retail Group and Computer City super stores and the     remodeling of Radio Shack stores.

The decrease in interest     income of the credit company in the year ended December 31,     1993 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992     resulted from a decrease in the average credit card     receivables outstanding during the period.  This decline     results from increased payments from credit customers     reflecting the overall improvement in the economy and a     desire by consumers to shift debt to lower interest rate     instruments.  The increase in interest income of the credit     company in the six months ended December 31, 1992 as compared     to December 31, 1991 resulted from growth of consumer credit     card receivables.  The decrease in interest income of the     credit company in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992 as     compared with fiscal year 1991 resulted from the     securitization of private label receivables in June 1991.           Interest income, exclusive of Tandy Credit Corporation's     income, represented primarily interest on short-term     investments.  The increase in interest income for the year     ended December 31, 1993 compared to the fiscal year ended     June 30, 1992 was due to the increase in short-term     investments as proceeds from the divestiture of discontinued     operations were received and to the recognition of interest     income on the AST and InterTAN notes receivable.  Interest     income as it relates to InterTAN notes receivable will     increase in fiscal 1994 as the Company will commence     recording the accretion of discount relating thereto.  See     further discussion on notes receivable in the "InterTAN     Update".           The decrease in interest expense for the year ended     December 31, 1993 as compared to the year ended June 30, 1992     is due to the decrease of total debt and lower U.S. interest     rates.  Overall interest expense should decline in fiscal     1994 as the Company receives cash proceeds from the disposal     of its discontinued operations and applies a significant     portion of such proceeds against short-term debt and toward     the retirement of its 10% subordinated debentures.  Partially     offsetting the decline in expected interest expense in 1994     will be higher interest rates resulting from the Federal     Reserve Bank's move to keep inflation low in the overall U.S.     economy.  The decrease in interest expense in the fiscal year     ended June 30, 1992 reflected the reduced debt attributable     to the securitization of private label credit card     receivables and lower interest rates.      PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES          The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31,     1993 was 37.1%.  The higher effective tax rate for the year     ended December 31, 1993 as compared to 36.2% for the year     ended June 30, 1992 and 36.0% for the year ended June 30,     1991 reflects the impact of the increase of the federal tax     rate to 35% from 34%.  The effective tax rate for the     six-month period ended December 31, 1992 was 34.2%.  This     lower effective rate reflects the successful resolution of     certain IRS examinations during the period.           The requirements of Financial Accounting Standard No.     109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", which the Company adopted     January 1, 1993, are discussed in Note 12 of the Notes to     Consolidated Financial Statements.      DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS          On June 25, 1993, the Board of Directors of Tandy     adopted a formal plan of divestiture under which it would     sell its computer manufacturing and marketing businesses, the     O'Sullivan Industries, Inc. ready-to-assemble furniture     manufacturing and related marketing business, the Memtek     Products division and the Lika printed circuit board     business.  The divestiture plan replaced the Company's plan     to spin off all of the Company's manufacturing and marketing     businesses as described in Tandy's Transition Report on Form     10-K/A-4 for the six-month period ended December 31, 1992.      In connection with the plan of divestiture the Company     accounted for the divestiture of these businesses as     discontinued operations and recognized an after-tax charge of     $70,000,000 in its quarter ended June 30, 1993.  This charge     was subsequently reduced by approximately $15,822,000 in the     quarter ended December 31, 1993.  The reduction of the     reserve previously taken resulted from the better than     anticipated sales price received for O'Sullivan Industries     Holdings, Inc. partially offset by additional foreign     currency translation losses and below plan operating results     of the divested companies during the divestment period, net     of related income tax adjustments.  Prior year results of     operations have been reclassified to reflect the discontinued     operations treatment.           Computer Manufacturing.  In furtherance of the     divestiture plan, the Company closed the sale of the computer     manufacturing and marketing businesses to AST Research, Inc.     ("AST") on July 13, 1993.  In accordance with the terms of     the definitive agreement between Tandy and AST, Tandy     received $15,000,000 upon closing of the sale.  The balance     of the purchase price of $90,000,000 (as adjusted     post-closing based on the results of an audit of the assets     and liabilities conveyed) is payable by a promissory note.     The promissory note is payable in three years and interest is     accrued and paid annually.  The interest rate on the     promissory note is currently 3.75% per annum and is adjusted     annually, not to exceed 5% per annum.  The terms of the     promissory note stipulate that the outstanding principal     balance may be paid at maturity at AST's option in cash or     the common stock of AST.  However, at Tandy's option not more     than 50% of the initial principal balance may be paid in     common stock of AST.  The promissory note is supported by a     standby letter of credit in the amount of the lesser of     $100,000,000 or 70% of the outstanding principal amount of     the promissory note.  At December 31, 1993, the standby     letter of credit approximated $67,704,000.  Accounts     receivable relating to the computer operations, approximating     $83,000,000 at June 30, 1993, inured to the benefit of Tandy     upon collection.  At December 31, 1993, the balance of the     remaining accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful     accounts, was $7,700,000.  Tandy also retained certain     inventory which it intends to liquidate before June 30, 1994.     At December 31, 1993, this inventory amounted to     approximately $3,700,000.           In October 1993, the Company sold its computer marketing     operations in France to AST, together with certain other     multimedia assets and additional Swedish inventory, for an     aggregate of approximately $6,700,000, which was evidenced by     an increase in the amount of the promissory note described     above to $96,700,000.  The Company has discounted this note     by $2,000,000 and the discount will be recognized as income     using the effective interest rate method over the life of the     note.           Memtek Products.  On November 10, 1993, the Company     executed a definitive agreement with Hanny Magnetics (B.V.I.)     Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation ("Hanny") to     purchase certain assets of the Company's Memtek Products     operations, including the license agreement with Memorex     Telex, N.V. for the use of the Memorex trademark on licensed     consumer electronics products.  This sale closed on December     16, 1993.  As of December 31, 1993, Tandy has received     payments of $62,500,000, recorded a $7,102,000 receivable     from Hanny for the remaining purchase price and retained     approximately $61,000,000 in accounts receivable and certain     other assets for liquidation.  Hanny is a subsidiary of Hanny     Magnetics (Holdings) Limited, a Bermuda corporation, listed     on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  At December 31, 1993,     accounts receivable, net of related allowance for doubtful     accounts, retained by Tandy approximated $40,100,000.           O'Sullivan Industries.  On November 23, 1993, the     Company announced that it would sell the common stock of     O'Sullivan Industries, Inc. ("O'Sullivan") in an initial     public offering.  On January 27, 1994 the Company announced     that it had reached an agreement with the underwriters to     sell O'Sullivan Industries Holdings, Inc., the parent company     of O'Sullivan, common stock to the public at $22 per share.     The net proceeds realized by Tandy in the initial public     offering, together with the $40,000,000 cash dividend from     O'Sullivan, approximated $350,000,000.  The initial public     offering closed on February 2, 1994.           Pursuant to a Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit Reimbursement     Agreement between Tandy and O'Sullivan Industries Holdings,     Inc., the Company will receive payments from O'Sullivan     resulting from an increased tax basis of O'Sullivan's assets     thereby increasing tax deductions and accordingly, reducing     income taxes payable by O'Sullivan.  The amount to be     received by the Company each year will approximate the     federal tax benefit expected to be realized with respect to     the increased tax basis.  These payments will be made over a     15-year time period.  The Company will recognize these     payments as additional sale proceeds and gain in the year in     which the payments become due and payable to the Company.           Lika.  On January 24, 1994, the Company announced that     it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its     manufacturing facilities which make Lika printed circuit     boards.  This divestiture is expected to close by June 1994     and is expected to yield approximately $17,000,000 in     proceeds, including cash, a note and the liquidation of     certain retained assets.           In connection with the computer manufacturing sale and     the Memtek Products sale, the Company agreed to retain     certain liabilities primarily relating to warranty     obligations on products sold prior to the sale.  Management     believes that accrued reserves, as reflected on its December     31, 1993 balance sheet, are adequate to cover estimated     future warranty obligations for the products and for any     remaining costs to dispose of these operations.           With the closing of the Lika transaction, the     divestiture program announced in June 1993 will be complete.      Proceeds from the formal divestiture plan should total     approximately $715,000,000 including net income tax benefits     of $16,600,000 and notes receivable of approximately     $100,000,000 that mature by the end of 1996.  The proceeds     from the divestitures are being used to reduce short-term     debt and for the expansion of the Incredible Universe and     Computer City store operations.

During the year ended December 31,     1993, cash provided by operations was $322,294,000 as     compared to $146,782,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30,     1992.  The increased cash flow from operations in calendar     1993 compared to fiscal year ended June 30, 1992 was due     partially to receivables which provided $30,133,000 in cash     in 1993 but used $121,719,000 in 1992.  The decline in     accounts receivable in 1993 versus 1992 is due to the     liquidation of receivables related to the divested operations     and lower consumer receivables related to the Company's     private label credit card portfolio.  The latter reason     reflects consumers' desires to liquidate debt with higher     interest rates and the overall improved economy.  Inventory     required less cash in calendar 1993 than in fiscal 1992.  The     increase in inventory during 1993 related to new store     openings and the expansion of Radio Shack's core product lines.           Investing activities involved capital expenditures, net     of retirements, primarily for retail expansion of     $129,287,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 compared to     $127,495,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.     Proceeds received from the sale of divested operations     totaled $111,988,000 during the year ended December 31, 1993.     Investing activities in 1993 also included $31,663,000 for     the purchase of InterTAN's bank debt and the     extension/funding of a working capital line of credit.  See     "InterTAN Update" for further information.  Short-term debt     of $46,885,000 and long-term debt of $62,195,000 were retired     during 1993.  Future store expansions and refurbishments and     other capital expenditures are expected to approximate     $150,000,000 to $180,000,000 per year over the next two years     and will be funded primarily from available cash, proceeds     from divestiture of discontinued operations, cash flow from     operations and proceeds from possible sale/leaseback     arrangements of Incredible Universe stores.           Operating cash flow in the fiscal year ended June 30,     1992 was $146,782,000 compared to $617,353,000 for the fiscal     year ended June 30, 1991.  This decreased cash flow was     partially due to the $89,441,000 increase in inventories for     the Tandy Name Brand Retail Group and Computer City store     expansions in fiscal 1992 compared to a $151,339,000 decrease     in inventories in 1991.  Operating cash flow was also higher     in 1991 due to the cash proceeds from the securitization of     $350,000,000 of credit card receivables.           The Company's investing activities were generally for     capital expenditures in fiscal 1992 which totaled     $127,495,000.  The capital expenditures were used principally     for Radio Shack's store remodeling program, expansion of the     Computer City store chain and initial construction of two     Incredible Universe stores.           Financing activities in the fiscal year ended June 30,     1992 included the sale of Depositary Shares of PERCS for     $430,000,000 and the subsequent purchase of common stock with     the proceeds of this preferred stock issue.  Long-term and     short-term debt of $20,098,000 was retired in the year ended     June 30, 1992 compared to fiscal 1991 retirements of $441,577,000.           Following are the current credit ratings for Tandy     Corporation:                                                         Standard             Category                  Moody's          and Poor's             ________                  _______          __________              Senior Unsecured           Baa2                 A-             Subordinated               Baa3                BBB             Medium Term Notes          Baa2                 A-             Preferred Stock            Baa3                BBB             ESOP Senior Notes          Baa2                 A-             Commercial Paper            P-2                A-2           The above ratings are investment grade ratings.      Management does not believe that a downgrade in 1993 by     Moody's has had or will have a materially adverse effect on     the Company's ability to borrow funds although the borrowings     may be slightly more costly.      CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION          The Company's balance sheet and financial condition     continue to be strong.  The Company's available borrowing     facilities as of December 31, 1993 are detailed in Note 9 of     the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are     incorporated herein by reference.           Proceeds from the sale of divested operations totaled     $111,988,000 through December 31, 1993.  The net assets     associated with discontinued operations remaining to be     divested were $405,664,000 at December 31, 1993 and related     primarily to O'Sullivan which was disposed of in February     1994 and Lika whose sale is pending.  Other information     related to discontinued operations are discussed in     "Discontinued Operations".           In the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992, the Company     issued 150,000 PERCS shares and used the proceeds of this     offering to purchase $430,000,000 of the Company's common     stock for treasury.  Each PERCS share has an annual dividend     rate of $214.00 and is automatically convertible on April 15,     1995 into 100 shares of common stock, par value $1 per share,     subject to possible adjustment based upon the market value of     the common stock on the conversion date or the occurrence of     certain other events.  Based upon the market price of the     Company's common stock at December 31, 1993, each PERCS share     would have converted into 83 shares.  At any time prior to     April 15, 1995, the Company may call the PERCS.  The PERCS     are discussed further in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated     Financial Statements.           The Company's issue of 10% subordinated debentures due     June 30, 1994 was called by the Company on February 23, 1994     for redemption on April 1, 1994.  The redemption will be at     the price of 100% of face value or approximately $32,000,000.           In fiscal 1991, the Company filed a shelf registration     for $500,000,000, of which $400,000,000 was designated for     medium-term notes, and Tandy Credit Corporation increased its     medium-term note program by $200,000,000.  During fiscal     1991, short-term debt was refinanced by the issuance of     $155,500,000 in medium-term notes.  In the fourth quarter of     fiscal 1991, Tandy Credit Corporation completed an asset     securitization to increase financial flexibility.  Credit     card receivables were sold to the Tandy Master Trust which     issued $350,000,000 of participating 8.25% Class A Asset     Backed Certificates, Series A.  Proceeds were primarily used     to retire short-term debt.           Tandy established an employee stock ownership plan     ("TESOP") in 1990.  This plan issued $100,000,000 of debt in     July 1990 to purchase preferred stock from the Company for     funding of the plan.  The Company has guaranteed the     repayment of the TESOP notes and, as a result, the     indebtedness of the TESOP has been recognized as a long-term     obligation on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.     Dividend payments and contributions by the Company will be     used to repay the indebtedness.           The debt-to-capitalization ratio was 22.8%, 27.3%, 23.4%     and 24.8% at December 31, 1993, December 31, 1992, June 30,     1992 and June 30, 1991, respectively.  This     debt-to-capitalization ratio should improve further in fiscal     1994 due to the cash proceeds from divestitures being used to     retire debt.           The Company's available borrowing facilities as of     December 31, 1993 are detailed in Note 9 of the Notes to     Consolidated Financial Statements.  Management believes that     the Company's present borrowing capacity is greater than the     established credit lines and long-term debt in place.     Management believes that the Company's cash flow from     operations, cash and short-term investments, expected     proceeds from divestitures and its available borrowing     facilities are more than adequate to fund planned store     expansion, growth in the Company's private label credit     accounts, retirement of the 10% subordinated debentures and     to meet debt service and preferred dividend requirements.           Inflation has not significantly impacted the Company     over the past three years.  Management does not expect     inflation to have a significant impact on operations in the     foreseeable future unless global situations substantially     affect the world economy.           The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants     issued Statement of Position 93-7, "Reporting on Advertising     Costs" in December 1993.  The statement generally requires     all advertising costs to be expensed in the period in which     the costs are incurred or the first time the advertising     takes place and is effective for years beginning after June     15, 1994.  The statement is not anticipated to have any     material effect on the results of operation or financial     condition of the Company.      SALE OF JOINT VENTURE INTEREST          During the quarter ended September 30, 1993, the Company     entered into definitive agreements with Nokia Corporation     ("Nokia") to sell the Company's interests in two cellular     telephone manufacturing joint ventures with Nokia, TMC     Company Ltd. located in Masan, Korea, and TNC Company located     in Fort Worth, Texas.  Pursuant to the terms of the     definitive agreements, the Company received an aggregate of     approximately $31,700,000 for its interests in these joint     ventures.  The Company also entered into a three-year     Preferred Supplier Agreement pursuant to which it has agreed     to purchase from Nokia substantially all of Radio Shack's     requirements for cellular telephones at prevailing     competitive market prices at the time of the purchase.  These     operations were not part of the overall divestment plan     adopted in June 1993 by the Company's Board of Directors;     therefore, the gain on the sale and their results of     operations are not included in discontinued operations.      INTERTAN UPDATE          InterTAN Inc. ("InterTAN"), the former foreign retail     operations of Tandy, was spun off to Tandy stockholders as a     tax-free dividend in fiscal 1987.  Under the merchandise     purchase terms of the original distribution agreement,     InterTAN could purchase on payment terms from Tandy, at     negotiated prices, new and replacement models of products     that Tandy had in its Radio Shack U.S. catalog or which Tandy     may reasonably secure.  A&A International ("A&A"), a     subsidiary of Tandy, was the exclusive purchasing agent for     products originating in the Far East for InterTAN.           On July 16, 1993 InterTAN had an account payable to     Tandy of approximately $17,000,000 of which $7,600,000 was in     default.  InterTAN's outstanding purchase orders for     merchandise placed under the distribution agreement with     Tandy, but not yet shipped, totaled approximately     $44,000,000.  Because InterTAN had defaulted, on July 16     Tandy terminated the merchandise purchase terms of the     distribution agreement and the license agreements.  Tandy     offered InterTAN interim license agreements which expired     July 22, 1993, unless extended.  These were extended on July     23, 1993.           On July 30, 1993 Trans World Electronics, Inc. ("Trans     World"), a subsidiary of Tandy, reached agreement with     InterTAN's banking syndicate to buy approximately $42,000,000     of InterTAN's debt at a negotiated, discounted price.  The     closing of this purchase occurred on August 5, 1993, at which     time Tandy resumed limited shipments to InterTAN and granted     a series of short-term, interim licenses pending the     execution of new license and merchandise agreements.  The     debt purchased from the banks has been restructured into a     seven-year note with interest of 8.64% due semiannually     beginning February 25, 1994 and semiannual principal payments     beginning February 25, 1995 (the "Series A" note).  Trans     World also provided approximately $10,000,000 in working     capital and trade credit to InterTAN.  Interest on the     working capital loan (the "Series B" note) of 8.11% is due     semiannually beginning February 25, 1994 with the principal     due in full on August 25, 1996.  Trans World also has     received warrants with a five-year term exercisable for     approximately 1,450,000 shares of InterTAN common stock at an     exercise price of $6.62 per share.  As required by an     agreement with Trans World, InterTAN filed a registration     statement on January 21, 1994 seeking to register the     warrants under the Securities Act of 1933.           In addition to the bank debt purchased by Trans World     and the working capital loan, InterTAN's obligations to Trans     World included two additional notes for approximately     $23,665,000 (the "Series C" note) and $24,037,000 (the     "Series D" note) with interest rates of 7.5% and 8%,     respectively.  The notes represent the restructuring of     InterTAN accounts payable for merchandise already shipped and     require monthly interest payments.  Also, InterTAN had     obligations for purchase orders outstanding for merchandise     ordered by A&A for InterTAN but not yet shipped totaling     approximately $31,262,000 at December 31, 1993.  All     principal and interest on the Series C note was paid in full     by December 31, 1993.  As merchandise under existing     outstanding purchase orders is shipped, A&A will invoice     InterTAN and amounts owed will be assigned to Trans World and     will increase the amount of the Series D note.  The balance     of the Series D note as of December 31, 1993 was     approximately $7,500,000.  All of Tandy's debt from InterTAN     is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of     InterTAN's assets.           A new merchandise agreement was reached with InterTAN in     October 1993 which requires future purchase orders be backed     by letters of credit posted by InterTAN.  New license     agreements have been negotiated which provide for a future     royalty to Tandy.           As required by the various agreements now existing     between Tandy and InterTAN, InterTAN has obtained a bank     revolving credit facility for Canadian $30,000,000 (U.S.     $22,662,000 equivalent at December 31, 1993).  Tandy has     agreed with InterTAN's new banking agent,  that in case of     InterTAN's default on the bank credit line, Tandy will, at     the option of the bank, purchase InterTAN's inventory and     related accounts receivable at 50% of their net book value,     up to the amount of outstanding bank loans, but not to exceed     Canadian $60,000,000 (U.S. $45,324,000 equivalent at December     31, 1993).  In that event, Tandy could foreclose on its first     priority lien on InterTAN's assets.  If Tandy fails to     purchase the inventory and related accounts receivable of     InterTAN from the bank, InterTAN's banking agent, upon notice     to Tandy and expiration of time, can foreclose upon     InterTAN's assets ahead of Tandy.  At December 31, 1993,     InterTAN had no borrowings under this revolving credit     facility.           As of December 31,1993 InterTAN owed Tandy an aggregate     of $63,511,000.  The current portion of the obligation     approximates $11,650,000 and the non-current portion     approximates $51,861,000.  In 1993 Tandy has not recognized     any accretion of discount on the note receivable from     InterTAN resulting from the purchase of the bank debt at a     discounted price but will commence accretion of such discount     in 1994 due to InterTAN's financial results and payment     history as of December 31, 1993.  Accretion of this discount     will be based on the effective interest rate method and will     approximate $3,856,000 in 1994.  During the year ended     December 31, 1993, Tandy recognized approximately $93,315,000     of sales to InterTAN and interest income of $3,085,000.     Tandy's sales to InterTAN totaled $90,130,000 during the six     months ended December 31, 1992, $171,126,000 during fiscal     1992, and $160,024,000 during fiscal 1991.           A&A will continue as the exclusive purchasing agent for     InterTAN in the Far East on a commission basis.  Commencing     in March 1994 only the purchasing agent commission and sales     by Tandy manufacturing plants to InterTAN will be recorded as     sales.  InterTAN purchases from third parties through A&A     will no longer be recorded as sales reflecting the     arrangement under the new merchandise agreement.      Accordingly, management expects that reported sales by Tandy     to InterTAN in 1994 will be considerably lower than in prior     years, however, the earned income relating thereto will not     be materially different.
