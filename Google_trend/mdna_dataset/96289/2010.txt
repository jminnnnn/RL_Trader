ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIALCONDITION AND  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS(“MD&A”).   This MD&Asection discusses our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition,risk management practices, critical accounting policies, and estimates andcertain factors that may affect our future results, including economic andindustry-wide factors. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with ourconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, included in thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1Aabove.   OVERVIEW  Highlights relatedto the year ended December 31, 2009, include:       ·      Net sales and      operating revenues increased $51.5 million, or 1.2%, to $4,276.0 million      when compared with last year. Comparable store sales increased 1.3%. This      increase was driven primarily by increased sales in our Sprint Nextel      postpaid wireless business, the addition of T-Mobile as a postpaid      wireless carrier in our company-operated stores, increased sales of      prepaid wireless handsets and airtime, increased sales of netbooks, and      increased sales of digital televisions, but was partially offset by sales      declines in GPS products, digital-to-analog converter boxes, wireless      accessories, digital music players, batteries, and digital cameras.      Consolidated net sales and operating revenues also benefited from the      consolidation of our Mexico subsidiary for all of  2009.            ·      Gross margin      increased 40 basis points to 45.9% from last year. Gross margin was      positively impacted by improved product mix combined with fewer markdowns      as a result of more effective promotional productivity, inventory      management and higher sell-through of seasonal  products.            ·      Selling,      general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense decreased $1.9 million      when compared with last year. As a percentage of net sales and operating      revenues, SG&A decreased by 40 basis points to 35.3%. Significant      changes within SG&A expense include the full year results of our      Mexican subsidiary, more incentive compensation, and lower advertising      expense.            ·      As a result      of the factors above, operating income increased $47.2 million, or 14.6%,      to $369.4 million when compared with lastyear.            ·      Net income      increased $15.6 million to $205.0 million when compared with last year.      Net income per diluted share was $1.63 compared with $1.47 last      year.            ·      Adjusted      EBITDA increased $41.0 million, or 9.7%, to $462.3 million when compared      with last year.                  22              RESULTSOF OPERATIONS   Due to our adoptionof the FASB’s new rules regarding accounting for convertible debt, certain 2008amounts have been adjusted from the amounts included in our Annual Report onForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. Refer to Note 2 – “Summary ofSignificant Accounting Policies” under the section titled “New AccountingStandards” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion ofthese adjustments.   NetSales and Operating Revenues   Consolidated net salesincreased 1.2% or $51.5 million to $4,276.0 million for the year ended December31, 2009 , compared with  $4,224.5  million in2008. This increase was primarily due to a comparable store sales increase of 1.3%  in 2009.The increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by increased salesin our wireless and modern home platforms, but was partially offset by decreasedsales in our accessory and personal electronics platforms.   Consolidated netsales and operating revenues for our two reportable segments and other sales areas follows:                 Year Ended      December 31,        (In millions)       2009          2008          2007        U.S.      RadioShack company-operated stores      $  3,650.9        $  3,611.1        $  3,637.7       Kiosks         250.0           283.5           297.0       Other  (1)         375.1           329.9           317.0       Consolidated      net sales and operating revenues      $  4,276.0        $  4,224.5        $  4,251.7                                                   Consolidated      net sales and operating  revenues increase      (decrease)         1.2  %        (0.6  %)        (11.0  %)    Comparable      store sales increase (decrease)  (2)         1.3  %        (0.6  %)        (8.2  %)         (1)    Net sales and      operating revenues for 2009 include the consolidation of our Mexican      subsidiary.     (2)    Comparable      store sales include the sales of U.S. RadioShack company-operated stores      and kiosks with more than 12 full months of recorded sales. Following the      termination of the Sprint-branded kiosk business, these former      Sprint-branded kiosks were transformed into multiple wireless carrier      RadioShack-branded locations. We managed and reported 111 of these      locations as extensions of existing RadioShack company-operated stores      located in the same shopping malls at December 31, 2009; current year      results of such kiosks are included with these RadioShack company-operated      stores for purposes of comparable store sales. For more information      regarding the transition of the Sprint-branded kiosks to      RadioShack-branded locations, see Item 1 – “Business” in this Annual      Report on Form 10-K.      The following tableprovides a summary of our consolidated net sales and operating revenues byplatform and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues. Theseconsolidated platform sales include sales from our U.S. RadioShackcompany-operated stores and kiosks, as well as other sales.                 Consolidated      Net Sales and Operating Revenues                  Year Ended      December 31,        (In millions)       2009          2008          2007        Wireless      $  1,633.3           38.2  %     $  1,387.3           32.8  %     $  1,415.8           33.3  %    Accessory         1,058.6           24.8           1,174.6           27.8           1,019.2           24.0       Modern      home         561.0           13.1           531.8           12.6           557.1           13.1       Personal      electronics         454.9           10.6           549.2           13.0           657.2           15.5       Power         227.6           5.3           244.9           5.8           251.7           5.9       Technical         181.1           4.2           184.6           4.4           185.5           4.4       Service         115.3           2.7           95.5           2.3           100.3           2.3       Other sales       (1)         44.2           1.1           56.6           1.3           64.9           1.5       Consolidated      net sales and  operating revenues      $  4,276.0           100.0  %     $  4,224.5           100.0  %     $  4,251.7           100.0  %         (1)    Other sales      include outside sales from repair services and outside sales of our global      sourcing operations and domestic and overseas manufacturing      facilities.              23              2009COMPARED WITH 2008   U.S.RadioShack Company-Operated Stores Segment   The following tableprovides a summary of our net sales and operating revenues by platform and as apercent of net sales and operating revenues for the U.S. RadioShackcompany-operated stores segment.                 Net Sales and      Operating Revenues                  Year Ended      December 31,        (In millions)       2009          2008          2007        Wireless      $  1,342.1           36.8  %     $  1,070.7           29.7  %     $  1,085.6           29.8  %    Accessory         968.6           26.5           1,085.0           30.0           941.1           25.9       Modern      home         471.8           12.9           462.6           12.8           494.5           13.6       Personal      electronics         384.7           10.5           492.3           13.6           596.6           16.4       Power         204.7           5.6           227.3           6.3           235.8           6.5       Technical         167.3           4.6           170.9           4.7           173.3           4.7       Service         109.3           3.0           93.1           2.6           97.2           2.7       Other         2.4           0.1           9.2           0.3           13.6           0.4       Net sales and      operating  revenues      $  3,650.9           100.0  %     $  3,611.1           100.0  %     $  3,637.7           100.0  %     Sales in ourwireless platform (includes postpaid and prepaid wireless handsets, commissions,residual income and communication devices such as scanners and GPS products)increased  25.3% in 2009. This sales increase was driven by increased sales in our Sprint Nextelpostpaid wireless business, the addition of T-Mobile as a postpaid wirelesscarrier, and increased sales of prepaid wireless handsets. These increases werepartially offset by decreased sales of GPS products.   Sales in ouraccessory platform (includes home entertainment, wireless, music, computer,video game and GPS accessories; media storage; power adapters; digital imagingproducts and headphones) decreased  10.7%  in 2009. Thissales decrease was primarily driven by decreased sales in digital-to-analogconverter boxes, wireless accessories, imaging accessories, and media storage,but was partially offset by increased sales of television antennas. Consolidatedsales of converter boxes were $170.1 million and $204.8 million in 2009 and2008, respectively. The decrease in converter box sales occurred in the secondhalf of the year after the transition to digital television occurred in June2009. We expect sales of converter boxes to be minimal in 2010.   Sales in our modernhome platform (includes home audio and video end-products, personal computingproducts, residential telephones, and Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”)products) increased  2.0%  in 2009. In thisplatform we recorded sales gains in netbooks, digital televisions, and VoIPproducts, which were substantially offset by sales declines in laptops,residential telephones, and DVD players.   Sales in ourpersonal electronics platform (includes digital cameras, digital music players,toys, satellite radios, video gaming hardware, camcorders, and general radios)decreased  21.9% in 2009. This decrease was driven primarily by sales declines in digitalcameras, digital music players, video game consoles, satellite radios, andtoys.   Sales in our powerplatform (includes general and special purpose batteries and battery chargers)decreased  9.9 %in 2009. This decrease was primarily driven by decreased sales of both generaland special purpose batteries. Our sales performance in this platform wasnegatively affected by the disruption during the transition process of theassortment to our Enercell brand. This transition process will be complete inthe first quarter of 2010.   Sales in ourtechnical platform (includes wire and cable, connectivity products, componentsand tools, and hobby products) decreased  2.1 % in 2009. Werecorded an increase in sales of wire and cable products, which was more thanoffset by decreased sales across most of the other product categories in thisplatform.           24              Sales in ourservice platform (includes prepaid wireless airtime, extended service plans,AT&T’s ConnecTech service, and bill payment revenue) increased  17.4%  in 2009. Thisincrease was driven primarily by increased sales of prepaid wireless airtime andextended service plans.   KiosksSegment   Kiosk sales consistprimarily of handset sales, postpaid and prepaid commission revenue and relatedwireless accessory sales. Kiosk sales decreased 11.8% or $33.5 million in 2009.We realized a sales increase in our Sam’s Club business, which was offset by areduced number of kiosk locations. This decrease in locations was partially dueto the closure of underperforming Sprint-branded kiosk locations in the firsthalf of 2009 and the closure of the remainder of our Sprint-branded kiosks inthe third quarter. For more information regarding the reduction in kioskoutlets, see the Retail Locations table in Item 2 – “Properties” in this AnnualReport on Form 10-K.   InJune 2009, Sam’s Club notified us of their intent to exercise their right toassume operation of certain kiosk locations. This could result in the transferof up to approximately 45 kiosks to Sam’s Club starting in the first quarter of2010.  For more informationregarding our arrangement with Sam’s Club, see the Kiosks section in Item 1 –“Business” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   OtherSales   Other sales includesales to our independent dealers, outside sales through our service centers,sales generated by our  www.radioshack.com  Web siteand our Mexican subsidiary, sales to commercial customers, and outside sales ofour global sourcing operations and manufacturing. Other sales increased $45.2million or 13.7% in 2009. This sales increase was primarily attributable to theconsolidation of our Mexican subsidiary for all of 2009, but was partiallyoffset by decreased sales to our independent dealers. Our Mexican subsidiaryrepresented less than 5% of consolidated net sales and operating revenues in2009.   GrossProfit   Consolidated grossprofit and gross margin are as follows:                 Year Ended      December 31,        (In millions)       2009          2008          2007        Gross      profit      $  1,962.5        $  1,922.7        $  2,025.8       Gross profit      increase (decrease)         2.1  %        (5.1  %)        (4.9  %)                                                Gross      margin         45.9  %        45.5  %        47.6  %     Consolidated grossprofit and gross margin for 2009 were $1,962.5 million and 45.9%, respectively,compared with $1,922.7 million and 45.5% in 2008, resulting in a 2.1% increasein gross profit dollars and a 40 basis point increase in our grossmargin.   The improvement ingross margin was partially driven by improved product mix combined with fewermarkdowns as a result of more effective promotional productivity, inventorymanagement and higher sell-through of seasonal products.           25              Selling,General and Administrative Expense   Our consolidatedSG&A expense decreased 0.1% or $1.9   million in 2009. Thisrepresents a 40 basis point decrease as a percentage of net sales and operatingrevenues compared to 2008.

This increase was driven by more incentive compensation and theconsolidation of our Mexican subsidiary for all of 2009.   Total rent andoccupancy decreased from 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by reducedrent related to our amended headquarters lease, discussed below, and the closingof our Sprint-branded kiosks. These decreases were partially offset by theconsolidation of our Mexican subsidiary for all of 2009.   Advertising expensedecreased in 2009 primarily due to reduced spending in the second quarter of theyear. While our advertising expense in the second half of the year wasconsistent with the same period last year, we shifted a significant portion ofour advertising expenditures from product specific promotional activities tobuilding awareness of our new brand creative platform, THE SHACK™.   The increase inother taxes was partially driven by increased payroll taxes associated withincreased compensation expense. Additionally, we recorded an $8.2 million salesand use tax benefit from the settlement of a sales tax issue in2008.   Our insuranceexpense has decreased in recent years due to lower workers’ compensation costs.This has been the result of better claims experience during thistime.           26              The decrease inother SG&A expense was primarily due to a $12.1 million non-cash chargerecorded in connection with our amended headquarters lease in 2008. See belowfor further discussion.   Amended Corporate Headquarters Lease: In June 2008, Tarrant County College District (“TCC”) announced that ithad purchased from Kan Am Grund Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH (“Kan Am”) thebuildings and real property comprising our corporate headquarters in Fort Worth,Texas, which we had previously sold to Kan Am and then leased for a period of 20years in a sale and lease-back transaction in December 2005.   Inconnection with the above sale to TCC, we entered into an agreement with TCC toconvey certain personal property located in the corporate headquarters andcertain real property located in close proximity to the corporate headquartersin exchange for an amended and restated lease to occupy a reduced portion of thecorporate headquarters for a shorter time period. The amended and restated leaseagreement provides for us to occupy approximately 40% of the corporateheadquarters complex for a primary term of three years with no rental paymentsrequired during the term. The agreement also provides for one two-year option torenew approximately half of the space at market-based rents.   This agreementresulted in a non-cash net charge to other SG&A expense of $12.1 million forthe second quarter of 2008. This net amount consisted of a net loss of $2.8million related to the assets conveyed to TCC and a $9.3 million charge toreduce a receivable for economic development incentives associated with thecorporate headquarters to its net realizable value.   Depreciationand Amortization   The table belowgives a summary of our total depreciation and amortization bysegment.                 Year Ended      December 31,        (In millions)       2009          2008          2007        U.S.      RadioShack company-operated stores      $  45.8        $  52.9        $  53.4       Kiosks         3.2           5.8           6.3       Other         5.8           1.8           1.7       Unallocated         38.1           38.6           51.3       Total      depreciation and amortization      $  92.9        $  99.1        $  112.7        The table belowprovides an analysis of total depreciation and amortization.                 Year Ended      December 31,        (In millions)       2009          2008          2007        Depreciation      and amortization expense      $  83.7        $  87.9        $  102.7       Depreciation      and amortization included in  cost of products sold         9.2           11.2           10.0       Total      depreciation and amortization      $  92.9        $  99.1        $  112.7        Total depreciationand amortization for 2009 declined $6.2 million or 6.3%. This decrease wasprimarily due to reduced capital expenditures in recent years when compared withprior years.   Impairmentof Long-Lived Assets   Impairment oflong-lived assets was $1.5 million and $2.8 million for 2009 and 2008,respectively. These amounts were related primarily to underperforming U.S.RadioShack company-operated stores and kiosk locations.           27              NetInterest Expense   Consolidated netinterest expense, which is interest expense net of interest income, was $ 39.3  million for  2009  compared with$ 20.3  millionfor 2008.   Interest expenseprimarily consists of interest paid on the stated coupon rate for ouroutstanding bonds, the non-cash amortization of discounts and premiums on ouroutstanding bonds, cash paid or received on our interest rate swaps, and thenon-cash change in fair value of our interest rate swaps in 2009. Interestexpense increased $ 9.2  million in  2009. This increase wasprimarily driven by increased interest expense related to our 2013 convertiblenotes. These notes were outstanding for twelve months in 2009 and four months in2008.  This increase was partially offset by increased payments receivedon our interest rate swap contracts in 2009 and the repurchase of $43.2 millionof our notes due in May 2011.  Non-cash interest expense was$13.7 million in 2009 compared with $5.0 million in 2008.   Interest incomedecreased $ 9.8 million in  2009 .This decrease was due to a lower interest rate environment in 2009, but waspartially offset by larger average cash balances in 2009.   OtherLoss   During 2009 werecorded a loss of $1.6 million compared with a loss of $2.4 million in 2008.The 2009 loss was recognized in conjunction with the repurchase of a portion ofour 2011 Notes. The 2008 loss represented losses related to our derivativeexposure to Sirius XM Radio, Inc. warrants as a result of our fair valuemeasurements of these warrants. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of thesewarrants was zero, and these warrants expired in the first quarter of2009.   IncomeTax Expense   Our effective taxrate for 2009 was 37.6% compared with 36.8% for 2008. The 2009 effective taxrate was affected by the net reversal of approximately $6.1 million inpreviously unrecognized tax benefits, deferred tax assets and accrued interestdue to the effective settlement of state income tax matters during the period.These discrete items lowered the effective tax rate by 1.9 percentagepoints.   The 2008 effectivetax rate was affected by the execution of a closing agreement with respect to aPuerto Rico income tax matter during the year, which resulted in a credit toincome tax expense; this discrete item lowered the effective tax rate for 2008by 1.0 percentage point. In addition, the 2008 effective tax rate was affectedby the net reversal of approximately $4.1 million in unrecognized tax benefits,deferred tax assets and accrued interest related to the settlement of variousstate income tax matters and the expiration of the statute of limitations withrespect to our 2002 taxable year; this net reversal lowered the effective taxrate for 2008 by 1.4 percentage points.   2008COMPARED WITH 2007   NetSales and Operating Revenues   Consolidated net salesdecreased 0.6% or $27.2 million to $4,224.5 million in 2008 , from  $4,251.7  million in2007. This decrease was primarily due to a comparable store sales decline of 0.6%  in 2008.The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily caused by decreased salesin our personal electronics and modern home platforms, but was offset byincreased sales in our accessory platform.   U.S.RadioShack Company-Operated Stores Segment   Sales in ourwireless platform decreased  1.4%  in 2008. While werecorded sales gains related to our AT&T postpaid wireless business andprepaid wireless handsets, these gains were substantially offset by declines inthe Sprint Nextel postpaid wireless business and, to a lesser extent, sales ofGPS devices.   Sales in ouraccessory platform increased  15.3%  in 2008. Thisincrease was driven by sales of digital-to-analog television converter boxes. Wealso experienced sales gains in video game accessories in 2008. This increasewas partially offset by decreases in wireless, music, and imaging accessoriessales.           28              Sales in our modernhome platform decreased  6.5%  in 2008. Thisdecrease was primarily the result of declines in sales of DVD players andrecorders, cordless telephones, and flat panel televisions, but was partiallyoffset by increased sales of laptop computers.   Sales in ourpersonal electronics platform decreased  17.5%  in 2008. Thisdecrease was driven primarily by sales declines in digital music players, toys,and satellite radios, but was partially offset by increased sales of video gameconsoles.   Sales in our powerplatform decreased  3.6 % in 2008. Thisdecrease was primarily the result of decreased sales of certain special purposeand general purpose batteries.   Sales in ourtechnical platform decreased  1.4 % in2008.   Sales in ourservice platform decreased  4.2%  in 2008. Thisdecrease was driven primarily by declines in bill payment revenue and sales ofextended service plans, but was partially offset by increased sales of prepaidwireless airtime.   KiosksSegment   Kiosk salesdecreased  4.5 %or $ 13.5  millionin 2008. This sales decrease was driven primarily by a decline in the number ofour Sprint-branded kiosks, but was partially offset by sales gains at our Sam’sClub kiosks.   OtherSales   Other salesincreased  $12.9 million or  4.1% in 2008. This sales increase was driven primarily by increased sales at ourRadioShack.com Web site and the recognition of 100% of the sales for RadioShackde Mexico in the month of December. If we had owned 100% of RadioShack de Mexicofor all of 2008, we would have recognized approximately $100 million inadditional net sales and operating revenues for the year. Sales to independentdealers did not significantly change from 2007.   GrossProfit   Consolidated grossprofit and gross margin for 2008 were $1,922.7 million and 45.5%, respectively,compared with $2,025.8 million and 47.6% in 2007, resulting in a 5.1% decreasein gross profit dollars and a 210 basis point decrease in our grossmargin.   This decrease wasprimarily driven by increased sales of lower margin products such asdigital-to-analog television converter boxes, video gaming products andaccessories, and laptop computers, as well as a product shift away fromhigher-rate new activations to lower-rate existing customer upgrades in ourpostpaid wireless business. Gross margin was also negatively affected by loweraverage selling prices in GPS and media storage and by aggressive pricingrequired in our wireless platform in the first quarter to respond to a morecompetitive market environment.   Additionally, the2007 gross margin was favorably affected by refunds for federaltelecommunications excise taxes we recorded in 2007. A portion of these refundstotaling $18.8 million was recorded as a reduction to cost of products sold,which accounted for a 44 basis point increase in our gross margin.   Selling,General and Administrative Expense   Our consolidatedSG&A expense decreased 1.9% or $28.7 million in 2008. This represents a 50basis point decrease as a percentage of net sales and operating revenuescompared with 2007.   Payroll andcommissions expense decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales andoperating revenues. This decrease was partially driven by lower incentivecompensation paid to store and corporate personnel and fewer employees in ourkiosk operations, distribution centers, and at our corporate headquarters.Additionally, in 2007 we reduced our accrued vacation liability by $14.3 millionin connection with the modification of our employee vacation policy and recordedan $8.5 million charge for employee separation charges.           29              Rent expensedecreased primarily due to lower rent expense associated with our corporateheadquarters for the second half of 2008. See above for furtherdiscussion.   The decrease inother taxes was partially driven by reduced payroll taxes associated with thedecreased compensation expense. Additionally, we recorded an $8.2 million salesand use tax benefit from the settlement of a sales tax issue.   The increase inother SG&A was primarily due to a $12.1 million non-cash charge recorded inconnection with our amended headquarters lease in 2008 as previouslydiscussed.   Depreciationand Amortization   Total depreciationand amortization for 2008 declined $13.6 million or 12.1%. This decrease wasprimarily due to reduced capital expenditures in 2006 and 2007 when comparedwith prior years.   Impairmentof Long-Lived Assets   Impairment oflong-lived assets and other charges was $2.8 million and $2.7 million for 2008and 2007, respectively. These amounts were related primarily to ourSprint-branded kiosk operations and underperforming U.S. RadioShackcompany-operated stores. We recorded this amount based on the remainingestimated future cash flows related to these specific stores. It was determinedthat the net book value of many of the stores' long-lived assets was notrecoverable. For the stores with insufficient estimated cash flows, we wrotedown the associated long-lived assets to their estimated fairvalue.   NetInterest Expense   Consolidatedinterest expense, net of interest income, was $20.3 million for 2008 versus$16.2 million for 2007, an increase of $4.1 million or 25.3%.   Interest expensedecreased $3.9 million to $34.9 million in 2008 from $38.8 million in 2007. Thisdecrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates on our floating ratedebt exposure resulting from our interest rate swaps, but was partially offsetby additional interest expense related to our 2013 convertiblenotes.   Interest incomedecreased $8.0 million to $14.6 million in 2008 from $22.6 million in 2007. Thisdecrease was primarily due to a lower interest rate environment. Additionally,we recorded interest income related to the federal telecommunications excise taxrefunds of $0.5 million in 2008 and $1.4 million in 2007.   Other(Loss) Income   During 2008 werecorded a loss of $2.4 million compared with income of $0.9 million in 2007.These amounts represent unrealized losses and gains related to our derivativeexposure to Sirius XM Radio, Inc. warrants as a result of our fair valuemeasurements of these warrants. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of thesewarrants was zero.   IncomeTax Expense   Our effective taxrate for 2008 was 36.8% compared with 35.4% for 2007. The 2008 effective taxrate was affected by the execution of a closing agreement with respect to aPuerto Rico income tax issue during the year, which resulted in a credit toincome tax expense; this discrete item lowered the effective tax rate for 2008by 1.0 percentage point. In addition, the 2008 effective tax rate was affectedby the net reversal of approximately $4.1 million in unrecognized tax benefits,deferred tax assets and accrued interest related to the settlement of variousstate income tax issues and the expiration of the statute of limitations withrespect to our 2002 taxable year; this net reversal lowered the effective taxrate for 2008 by 1.4 percentage points.           30              The 2007 effectivetax rate was affected by the net reversal in June 2007 of approximately $10.0million in unrecognized tax benefits, deferred tax assets and accrued interest.This $10.0 million reversal lowered our effective tax rate 2.7 percentage pointsfor the year ended December 31, 2007.   Acquisitionof RadioShack de Mexico   InDecember 2008, we acquired the remaining interest (slightly more than 50%) ofour Mexican joint venture - RadioShack de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. - with GrupoGigante, S.A.B. de C.V. We now own 100% of this subsidiary, which consisted of200 RadioShack-branded stores and 14 dealers throughout Mexico at the time ofacquisition. The purchase price was $44.9 million which consisted of $42.2million in cash paid and transaction costs, net of cash acquired, plus $2.7million in assumed debt. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchasemethod of accounting in accordance with the FASB’s accounting guidance forbusiness combinations. The purchase price allocation resulted in an excess ofpurchase price over net tangible assets acquired of $35.5 million, all of whichwas attributed to goodwill. The goodwill will not be subject to amortization forbook purposes but rather an annual test for impairment. The premium we paid inexcess of the fair value of the net assets acquired was based on the establishedbusiness in Mexico and our ability to expand our business in Mexico and possiblyother countries. The goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes. Resultsof the acquired business have been included in our operations from December 1,2008, and were immaterial for 2008. If we had owned 100% of RadioShack de Mexicofor all of 2008, we would have recognized approximately $100 million inadditional net sales and operating revenues for the year.   RECENTLYISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   Refer to Note 2 –“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” under the section titled “NewAccounting Standards” in the Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements.   LIQUIDITYAND CAPITAL RESOURCES   CashFlow Overview   Operating Activities:  Cashprovided by operating activities in 2009 was $245.8 million, compared with$274.6 million in 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by less cash receivedfrom customers, dealers and service providers than in 2008. This decrease incash receipts was attributable to higher outstanding accounts receivablebalances at December 31, 2009, related to our increased commissions on wirelesssales. We collected a significant portion of these receivables in early 2010.The decrease in cash received from customers, dealers and service providers waspartially offset by less cash paid to suppliers and employees than in 2008; thiswas primarily attributable to our continued focus on managing our inventory andaccounts payable balances. We also received less interest on our cash balanceand paid more interest on our long-term debt than in 2008.   Investing Activities:  Cashused in investing activities was $80.8 million and $124.3 million in 2009 and2008, respectively. The decrease from 2008 was primarily the result of $42.0million in cash paid in 2008 for our acquisition of RadioShack de Mexico.Capital expenditures of $81.0 million in 2009 were consistent with last year.Capital expenditures primarily relate to our U.S. RadioShack company-operatedstores and information system projects.   Financing Activities : Net cashused in financing activities was $71.6 million in 2009 compared with net cashprovided by financing activities of $154.8 million in 2008. This change waspartially driven by the repurchase of $43.2 million of our 2011 Notes in 2009.The change was also driven by the issuance of our 2013 convertible notes andassociated hedge and warrant transactions in 2008. We also repurchased $111.3million of our common stock in 2008 under our share repurchase program, comparedwith no repurchases in 2009.   Free Cash Flow:  Our free cashflow, defined as cash flows from operating activities less dividends paid andadditions to property, plant and equipment, was $133.5 million in 2009, $157.7million in 2008, and $300.9 million in 2007. The decrease in free cash flow for2009 was attributable to decreased cash flow from operating activities asdescribed above.           31              Webelieve free cash flow is a relevant indicator of our ability to repay maturingdebt, change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that managementbelieves will enhance shareholder value. The comparable financial measure tofree cash flow under generally accepted accounting principles is cash flows fromoperating activities, which was $245.8 million in 2009, $274.6 million in 2008,and $379.0 million in 2007. We do not intend for the presentation of free cashflow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to be considered in isolation or as asubstitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, nor do we intend toimply that free cash flow represents cash flow available for discretionaryexpenditures.   The following tableis a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cashflow.                 Year Ended      December 31,        (In millions)       2009          2008          2007        Net cash      provided by operating activities      $  245.8        $  274.6        $  379.0       Less:                                         Additions to property, plant and      equipment         81.0           85.6           45.3       Dividends paid         31.3           31.3           32.8                                                   Free cash      flow      $  133.5        $  157.7        $  300.9        SOURCESOF LIQUIDITY   Asof December 31, 2009, we had $908.2 million in cash and cash equivalents.Additionally, we have a credit facility of $325 million. As of December 31,2009, we had $291.3 million available under this credit facility due to theissuance of standby letters of credit. We have not borrowed from this facility.We believe that our cash flows from operations and available cash and cashequivalents will adequately fund our operations, our capital expenditures, andour maturing debt obligations. Additionally, our credit facility is availablefor additional working capital needs or investment opportunities.   The table belowlists our credit commitments from various financial institutions.

This facility expiresin May of 2011.   Our $325 millioncredit facility provides us a source of liquidity. This facility is provided bya syndicate of lenders with a majority of the facility provided by Wells Fargo,Citigroup, and Bank of America. We incurred no borrowings from this facility in2009. Interest charges under this facility are derived using a base LIBOR rateplus a margin which changes based on our credit ratings. Our credit facility hascustomary terms and covenants, and we were in compliance with these covenants atDecember 31, 2009.   Credit Ratings:  Below are theagencies’ ratings by category, as well as their respective current outlook forthe ratings, as of February 8, 2010.              Rating      Agency           Rating           Outlook                   Standard and      Poor’s           BB           Stable                   Moody's           Ba1           Stable                   Fitch           BB           Stable                     32              OnOctober 20, 2009, Fitch updated our rating outlook to stable from negative.Other than the change in Fitch’s outlook, these ratings are consistent with theratings and outlooks reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the yearended December 31, 2008. Factors that could affect our future credit ratingsinclude free cash flow and cash levels, changes in our operating performance,the adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy, the economic environment,conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries, sales declines incomparable stores, our financial position and changes in our business strategy.If downgrades occur, which we do not expect, they will adversely affect ourfuture borrowing costs, access to debt capital markets, vendor financing termsand future new store occupancy costs.   CASHREQUIREMENTS   Capital Expenditures:  Weanticipate that our capital expenditure requirements for 2010 will range from$100 million to $120 million. U.S. RadioShack company-operated store remodelsand relocations, as well as information systems projects, will account for themajority of our anticipated 2010 capital expenditures. Cash and cash equivalentsand cash generated from operating activities will be used to fund future capitalexpenditure needs.   Seasonal Inventory Buildup: Typically, our annual cash requirements for pre-seasonal inventorybuildup range between $150 million and $250 million. The funding required forthis buildup comes primarily from cash on hand and cash generated from net salesand operating revenues. Additionally, our credit facility could be utilized tofund the inventory buildup.   ContractualObligations   The followingtables, as well as the information contained in Note 5 - "Indebtedness andBorrowing Facilities" to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, providea summary of our various contractual commitments, debt and interest repaymentrequirements, and available credit lines.   The table belowcontains our known contractual commitments as of December 31, 2009.

We are not able to reasonably      estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability      will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the related balances have      not been reflected in the ‘‘Payments Due by Period’’ section of the      table.      For moreinformation regarding long-term debt and lease commitments, refer to Note 5 –“Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities” and Note 13 – “Commitments andContingencies,” respectively, of our Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements.   2013 Convertible Notes:  InAugust 2008, we issued $375 million principal amount of convertible senior notesdue August 1, 2013, (the “2013 Convertible Notes”) in a private offering. Each$1,000 of principal of the 2013 Convertible Notes is initially convertible,under certain circumstances, into 41.2414 shares of our common stock (or a totalof approximately 15.5 million shares), which is the equivalent of $24.25 pershare, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events set forthunder terms of the 2013 Convertible Notes. Upon conversion, we would pay theholder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock, upto the principal amount of the note. Amounts in excess of theprincipal           33              amount, if any,(the “excess conversion value”) may be paid in cash or in stock, at our option.Holders may convert their 2013 Convertible Notes into common stock on the netsettlement basis described above at any time from May 1, 2013, until the closeof business on July 29, 2013, or if, and only if, one of the followingconditions has been met:         ·      During any      calendar quarter, and only during such calendar quarter, in which the      closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the      period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of      the preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the conversion price per      share of common stock in effect on the last day of such preceding calendar      quarter         ·      During the      five consecutive business days immediately after any 10 consecutive      trading day period in which the average trading price per $1,000 principal      amount of 2013 Convertible Notes was less than 98% of the product of the      closing price of the common stock on such date and the conversion rate on      such date         ·      We make      specified distributions to holders of our common stock or specified      corporate transactions occur      The 2013Convertible Notes were not convertible at the holders' option at any time during2009.   Holders who converttheir 2013 Convertible Notes in connection with a change in control may beentitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversionrate. In addition, upon a change in control, liquidation, dissolution ordelisting, the holders of the 2013 Convertible Notes may require us torepurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2013 Convertible Notes for 100%of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.As of December 31, 2009, none of the conditions allowing holders of the 2013Convertible Notes to convert or requiring us to repurchase the 2013 ConvertibleNotes had been met.   Concurrent with theissuance of the 2013 Convertible Notes, we entered into note hedge transactionswith Citigroup and Bank of America whereby we have the option to purchase up to15.5 million shares of our common stock at a price of $24.25 per share (the“Convertible Note Hedges”), and we sold warrants to the same financialinstitutions whereby they have the option to purchase up to 15.5 million sharesof our common stock at a per share price of $36.60 (the “Warrants”). TheConvertible Note Hedges and Warrants were structured to reduce the potentialfuture share dilution associated with the conversion of the 2013 ConvertibleNotes. The Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants are separate contracts with thetwo financial institutions, are not part of the terms of the 2013 ConvertibleNotes, and do not affect the rights of holders under the 2013 Convertible Notes.A holder of the 2013 Convertible Notes does not have any rights with respect tothe Convertible Note Hedges or Warrants.   The net proceedsretained by RadioShack as a result of the issuance of the 2013 ConvertibleNotes, the purchase of the Convertible Note Hedges, and the proceeds receivedfrom the issuance of the Warrants were approximately $319.2 million. Wecompleted these transactions to secure a source of liquidity in preparation forour $300 million credit facility expiring in June of 2009. On September 11,2008, we terminated this credit facility.   For a more detaileddescription of the 2013 Convertible Notes, Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants,please see Note 5 – “Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities” and Note 6 –“Stockholders’ Equity” in the Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements.   Long-Term Notes:  On May 11,2001, we issued $350 million of 10-year 7.375% notes in a private offering toqualified institutional buyers under SEC Rule 144A. In August 2001, under theterms of an exchange offering filed with the SEC, we exchanged substantially allof these notes for a similar amount of publicly registered notes. The exchangeresulted in substantially all of the notes becoming registered with the SEC anddid not result in additional debt being issued. The annual interest rate on thenotes is 7.375% per annum with interest payable on November 15 and May 15 ofeach year. The notes contain certain non-financial covenants and mature on May15, 2011.            34              InJune and August 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements withunderlying notional amounts of debt of $100 million and $50 million,respectively, and both with maturities in May 2011. Our counterparty for theseswaps is Citigroup. These swaps effectively convert a portion of our long-termfixed rate debt to a variable rate. For more information regarding our interestrate swaps, refer to Note 11 – “Derivative Financial Instruments.”   InSeptember 2009, we completed a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all ofthese notes. Upon expiration of the offer, $43.2 million of the aggregateoutstanding principal amount of the notes was validly tendered and accepted. Wepaid a total of $46.6 million, which consisted of the purchase price of $45.4million for the tendered notes plus $1.2 million in accrued and unpaid interest,to the holders of the tendered notes.   Operating Leases:  We useoperating leases, primarily for our retail locations and our corporate campus,to lower our capital requirements.   Continuing Lease Obligations: We have obligations under retail leases for locations that we assigned to otherbusinesses. The majority of these lease obligations arose from leases for whichCompUSA Inc. (“CompUSA”) assumed responsibility as part of its purchase of ourComputer City, Inc. subsidiary in August 1998. Because the company that assumedresponsibility for these leases has ceased operations, we may be responsible forrent due under the leases.   Following anannouncement by CompUSA in February 2007 of its intention to close as many as126 stores and an announcement in December 2007 that it had been acquired byGordon Brothers Group, CompUSA’s stores ceased operations in January 2008. Wemay be responsible for rent due on a portion of the leases that relate to theclosed stores. As of February 8, 2010, we had been named as a defendant in atotal of 12 lawsuits from lessors seeking payment from us, six of which had beenresolved.   Based on allavailable information pertaining to the status of these lawsuits, and afterapplying the FASB’s accounting guidance on accounting for contingencies, thebalance of our accrual for these obligations was $6.2 million and $9.0 millionat December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We have continued to monitor thissituation and will update our accrual to reflect new information on outstandinglitigation and settlements as more information becomes available.

Dividends:  We have paid commonstock cash dividends for 23 consecutive years. On November 9, 2009, our Board ofDirectors declared an annual dividend of $0.25 per share. The dividend was paidon December 16, 2009, to stockholders of record on November 27, 2009. Thedividend payment of $31.3 million was funded from cash on hand.            35              Share Repurchases:  In July2008, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with noexpiration date authorizing management to repurchase up to $200 million of ourcommon stock. In August 2009, our Board of Directors approved a $200 millionincrease in the dollar amount of this program. As of December 31, 2009, $290million of the total authorized amount was available for share repurchases underthis program. No shares were repurchased under this program in2009.   OFF-BALANCESHEET ARRANGEMENTS   Other than theoperating leases described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet financingarrangements, transactions, or special purpose entities.   INFLATION   With the exceptionof increased energy costs in 2007 and the first half of 2008, inflation has notsignificantly affected us over the past three years. We do not expect inflationto have a significant effect on our operations in the foreseeablefuture.   CRITICALACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   Our consolidatedfinancial statements are prepared in accordance with generally acceptedaccounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States. The application of GAAPrequires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values ofassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reportedamount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and the relateddisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The use of estimates ispervasive throughout our financial statements and is affected by management’sjudgment and uncertainties. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are basedon historical experience, current market trends and other factors that webelieve to be relevant and reasonable at the time the consolidated financialstatements are prepared. We continually evaluate the information used to makethese estimates as our business and the economic environment change. Actualresults may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptionsor conditions.   Inthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significantaccounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financialstatements. The accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical arerevenue recognition; inventory valuation; estimation of reserves and valuationallowances specifically related to insurance, tax and legal contingencies;valuation of long-lived assets and intangibles, including goodwill; andstock-based compensation.   Weconsider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requiresdifficult, subjective or complex judgments, and is material to the portrayal ofour financial condition, changes in financial condition or results ofoperations. The selection, application and disclosure of our critical accountingpolicies and estimates have been reviewed by the Audit and Compliance Committeeof our Board of Directors.   RevenueRecognition   Description  Our revenue isderived principally from the sale of name brand and private brand products andservices to consumers. Revenue is recognized, net of an estimate for customerrefunds and product returns, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixedor determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.   Certain products,such as wireless telephone handsets, require the customer to use the services ofa third-party service provider. The third-party service provider pays us anupfront commission for obtaining a new customer and, in some cases, a monthlyrecurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the serviceprovider and the customer. Our sale of an activated wireless telephone handsetis the single event required to meet the delivery criterion for both the upfrontcommission and the residual revenue. Upfront commission revenue, net ofestimated service deactivations, is generally recognized at the time anactivated wireless telephone handset is sold to the customer at thepoint-of-sale. Recurring residual income is recognized as earned under the termsof each contract with the service provider, which is typically as the serviceprovider bills its customer, generally on a monthly basis.           36              Judgmentsand uncertainties involved in the estimate  Our revenuerecognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires usto estimate future sales returns and service plan deactivations. These estimatesare subject to management judgment. Our estimate for product refunds andreturns, service plan deactivations, residual revenue and commission revenueadjustments are based on historical information pertaining to these items. Basedon our extensive history in selling activated wireless telephone handsets, wehave been able to establish reliable deactivation estimates.   Effectif actual results differ from assumptions  Wehave not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate salesreturns or service deactivations during the past three fiscal years, and we donot believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a materialchange in the future estimates or assumptions for these items. However, ifactual results differ from our estimates due to various factors, the amount ofrevenue recorded could be materially affected. A 10% difference in our reservesfor the estimates noted above would have affected net sales and operatingrevenues by approximately $4.1 million in 2009.   InventoryValuation   Description  Our inventoryconsists primarily of finished goods available for sale at our retail locationsor within our distribution centers and is recorded at the lower of average cost(which approximates FIFO) or market. The cost components recorded withininventory are the vendor invoice cost and certain allocated freight,distribution, warehousing and other costs relating to merchandise acquisitionrequired to bring the merchandise from the vendor to the location where it isoffered for sale.   Judgmentsand uncertainties involved in the estimate  Typically, themarket value of our inventory is higher than its aggregate cost. Determinationof the market value may be very complex and, therefore, requires a high degreeof judgment. In order for management to make the appropriate determination ofmarket value, the following items are commonly considered: inventory turnoverstatistics, current selling prices, seasonality factors, consumer trends,competitive pricing, performance of similar products or accessories, plannedpromotional incentives, technological obsolescence, and estimated costs to sellor dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions.   Ifthe estimated market value, calculated as the amount we expect to realize, netof estimated selling costs, from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory,is determined to be less than the recorded cost, we record a provision to reducethe carrying amount of the inventory item to its net realizablevalue.   Effectif actual results differ from assumptions  Wehave not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish ourinventory valuation or the related reserves during the past three fiscal years,and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be amaterial change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to estimate ourinventory valuation reserves. Differences between management estimates andactual performance and pricing of our merchandise could result in inventoryvaluations that differ from the amount recorded at the financial statement dateand could also cause fluctuations in the amount of recorded cost of productssold. If our estimates regarding market value are inaccurate or changes inconsumer demand affect certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may beexposed to material losses or gains in excess of our established valuationreserve. We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge torecord reasonable estimates for our inventory valuation reserves. However, it ispossible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves.   Estimationof Reserves and Valuation Allowances   Description  The amount ofliability we record for claims related to insurance, tax and legal contingenciesrequires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimatelybe incurred. We are insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation,property and other liability claims, with deductibles up to $1.0 million peroccurrence. This insurance coverage limits our exposure for any catastrophicclaims that           37              result in liabilityin excess of the deductible. We also have a self-insured health programadministered by a third-party covering the majority of our employees thatparticipate in our health insurance programs. We estimate the amount of ourreserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reportingperiod. This estimate is based on historical claims experience, demographicfactors, severity factors, and other factors we deem relevant.   Weare subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign taxauthorities related to income tax, sales and use tax, personal property tax, andother forms of taxation. These audits examine our tax positions, timing ofincome and deductions, and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions.Our accounting for tax estimates and contingencies requires us to evaluate taxissues and establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based onour estimate of current probable tax exposures. Depending on the nature of thetax issue, we could be subject to audit over several years; therefore, ourestimated reserve balances might exist for multiple years before an issue isresolved by the taxing authority.   Weare involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated withemployment and other matters. Our accounting for legal contingencies requires usto estimate the probable losses in these matters. This estimate has beendeveloped in consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel and is basedupon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies.   Judgmentsand uncertainties involved in the estimate  Our liabilities forinsurance, tax and legal contingencies contain uncertainties because we arerequired to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposuresassociated with these items. We use our history and experience, as well as otherspecific circumstances surrounding these claims, in evaluating the amount ofliability we should record. As additional information becomes available, weassess the potential liability related to our various claims and revise ourestimates as appropriate. These revisions could materially affect our results ofoperations and financial position or liquidity.   Effectif actual results differ from assumptions  Wehave not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate ourinsurance reserves during the past three fiscal years, and we do not believethere is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in thefuture estimates or assumptions for these items. However, a 10% change in ourinsurance reserves at December 31, 2009, would have affected net income byapproximately $5.0 million. As of December 31, 2009, actual losses had notexceeded our expectations. Additionally, for claims that exceed our deductibleamount, we record a gross liability and corresponding receivable representingexpected recoveries, since we are not legally relieved of our obligation to theclaimant.   Although we believethat our tax and legal reserves are based on reasonable judgments and estimates,actual results could differ, which may expose us to material gains or losses infuture periods. These actual results could materially affect our effective taxrate, earnings, deferred tax balances and cash flows in the period ofresolution.   Valuationof Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles, including Goodwill   Description  Long-lived assets,such as property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment when events orchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not berecoverable, such as negative cash flows or plans to dispose of or selllong-lived assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives. Thecarrying amount is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of theundiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual dispositionof the asset. If the carrying amount is not recoverable, we recognize animpairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fairvalue. We estimate fair value based on projected future discounted cash flows.Impairment losses, if any, are recorded in the period in which the impairmentoccurs. The carrying value of the asset is adjusted to the new carrying value,and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded. Additionally, if itis determined that the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should bedecreased, the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the newcarrying value of the asset. Our policy is to evaluate long-lived assets forimpairment at a store level for retail operations.           38              Wehave acquired goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assetsrelated to business acquisitions. The original valuation of these intangibleassets is based on estimates of future profitability, cash flows and otherjudgmental factors. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price overthe fair value of net assets acquired.  We review our goodwill and otherintangible asset balances on an annual basis, during the fourth quarter, andwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of areporting unit or an intangible asset might exceed their fairvalue.  If the carrying amount of an intagible asset or a reporting unitexceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss for thisdifference.   Judgmentsand uncertainties involved in the estimate  Our impairment losscalculations for long-lived assets contain uncertainties because they require usto apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows, strategic plans,useful lives and assumptions about market performance. We also apply judgment inthe selection of a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in our currentbusiness model.   Our impairment losscalculations for intangible assets and goodwill contain uncertainties becausethey require us to estimate fair values related to these assets. We estimatefair values based on various valuation techniques such as discounted cash flowsand other comparable market analyses. These types of analyses containuncertainties because they require us to make judgments and assumptionsregarding future profitability, industry factors, planned strategic initiatives,discount rates and other factors.   Effectif actual results differ from assumptions  Wehave not made any material changes in the accounting methodologies we use toassess impairment loss for long-lived assets, intangible assets, or goodwillduring the past three fiscal years, and we do not believe there is a reasonablelikelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptionswe use in calculating these impairment losses. However, if actual results orperformance of certain business units are not consistent with our estimates andassumptions, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges, which could bematerial to our results of operations.   The total value ofour goodwill and intangible assets at December 31, 2009, was $40.3 million. Ofthis amount, $35.6 million related to goodwill from the purchase of RadioShackde Mexico. Based on our most recent review of goodwill impairment, we noted thatthe fair values of our reporting units were substantially greater than theircarrying values.   Stock-BasedCompensation   Description  Wehave historically granted certain stock-based awards to employees and directorsin the form of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restrictedstock and deferred stock units. See Note 2 - “Summary of Significant AccountingPolicies” and Note 7 - “Stock-Based Incentive Plans” for a more completediscussion of our stock-based compensation programs.   Atthe date an award is granted, we determine the fair value of the award andrecognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period, whichtypically is the period over which the award vests. The restricted stock anddeferred stock units are valued at the fair market value of our stock on thedate of grant. The fair value of stock options with only service conditions isestimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair value ofstock options with service and market conditions is valued utilizing a latticemodel with Monte Carlo simulations.   Judgmentsand uncertainties involved in the estimate  TheBlack-Scholes-Merton and lattice models require management to apply judgment anduse highly subjective assumptions, including expected option life, volatility ofstock prices, and employee forfeiture rate. We use historical data and judgmentto estimate the expected option life and employee forfeiture rate, and usehistorical and implied volatility when estimating the stock price volatility.Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair valueestimate.             39               Effectif actual results differ from assumptions  We have not madeany material changes in the accounting methodologies used to record stock-basedcompensation during the past three years. While the assumptions that we developare based on our best expectations, they involve inherent uncertainties based onmarket conditions and employee behavior that  are outside of our control.If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used, the stock-basedcompensation expense reported in our financial statements may not berepresentative of the actual economic cost of the stock-based compensation.Additionally, if actual employee forfeitures significantly differ from ourestimated forfeitures, we may have an adjustment to our financial statements infuture periods. A 10% change in our stock-based compensation expense in 2009would have affected our net income by approximately $1.2million.    FACTORSTHAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS   Matters discussedin MD&A and in other parts of this report include forward-looking statementswithin the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A ofthe Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements arestatements that are not historical and may be identified by the use of wordssuch as “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “potential” orsimilar words. These matters include statements concerning management’s plansand objectives relating to our operations or economic performance and relatedassumptions. We specifically disclaim any duty to update any of the informationset forth in this report, including any forward-looking statements.Forward-looking statements are made based on management’s current expectationsand beliefs concerning future events and, therefore, involve a number ofassumptions, risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors described inItem 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Managementcautions that forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actualresults could differ materially from those expressed or implied in theforward-looking statements.   ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUTMARKET RISK.   AtDecember 31, 2009, the only derivative instruments that materially increased ourexposure to market risks for interest rates, foreign currency rates, commodityprices or other market price risks were interest rate swaps, which serve as aneconomic hedge on our long-term debt. We do not use derivatives for speculativepurposes. Refer to Note 11 – “Derivative Financial Instruments” in Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K foradditional information.   Our exposure tointerest rate risk results from changes in short-term interest rates. Interestrate risk exists with respect to our net investment position at December 31,2009, of $670.5 million, consisting of fluctuating short-term investments of$820.5 million and offset by $150 million of indebtedness which, because of ourinterest rate swaps, effectively bears interest at short-term floating rates. Ahypothetical increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the interest rateapplicable to this floating-rate net exposure would result in a change in annualnet interest expense of $6.7 million and an approximate $2.3 million change tothe fair value of our interest rate swaps, which would also affect net interestexpense. This hypothesis assumes no change in the principal or investmentbalance.   Wehave market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relatedto our purchase of inventory from manufacturers located in China and other areasoutside of the U.S. Our purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars; however, thestrengthening of the Chinese currency, or other currencies, against the U.S.dollar could cause our vendors to increase the prices of items we purchase fromthem. It is not possible to estimate the effect of foreign currency exchangerate changes on our purchases of this inventory. We are also exposed to foreigncurrency fluctuations related to our Mexican subsidiary, which represented lessthan 5% of consolidated net sales and operating revenues in 2009.
