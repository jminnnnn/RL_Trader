ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND         FINANCIAL CONDITION.  FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS      Tandy   Corporation   ("Tandy"  or  "Company")   participates  in  a  highly competitive industry that is characterized by aggressive pricing practices in an attempt to gain market  share.  In developing  strategies  to achieve  continued increases  in sales and  operating  profits,  the Company  anticipates  customer demand in managing its product  transitions,  inventory levels, and distribution cycles.  Due to  rapid  technological  advances  affecting  consumer  electronic product  cycles,  the Company's  operating  results could be adversely  affected should the Company be unable to anticipate  product cycle and/or customer demand accurately.  The Company's ability to achieve targeted sales and earnings levels depends upon a number of competitive  and market factors and,  accordingly,  are subject to risk.      The  regulatory  and trade  environment  in which the  Company  operates  is subject  to risk  and  uncertainty.  Unfavorable  tariffs  affecting  electronic products  imported from Asia as a result of a change in U.S. trade agreements or trade  imbalances  could  affect the Company.  In  addition,  as a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the deregulated telecommunications market in the future is expected to present both  opportunities  and increased  competition to the telecommunication  industry's historical role of providing telecommunication equipment and service to consumers.  Also see "Net Sales and Operating Revenues" for a discussion of a recent RadioShack(R) telecommunications alliance.      In arriving at the charges related to the restructuring plan, management was required to make certain estimates, including but not limited to estimates about expected proceeds from inventory sales in closed units, real estate  valuations, timing of closed store  dispositions,  and an assumption that Fry's Electronics, Inc.  and  its  affiliates   would  complete  the  purchase  of  six  Incredible Universe(R) stores pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements. Management made these estimates based on the best information available at the time and believes that  these  estimates  were  accurate  at the time  they  were  made.  However, unexpected  delays in  liquidation  and  closing  of asset  sales,  among  other factors,  could  result in the charges and reserves  previously  estimated to be inadequate, and future charges would be required.      With the exception of historical  information,  the matters discussed herein contain forward-looking  statements that involve risks and uncertainties and are indicated  by  words  such as  "anticipates",  "expects",  "believes",  "plans", "could", and similar words and phrases. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, economic conditions  including consumer  installment debt levels and interest  rate  fluctuations,  shifts in  consumer  electronic  product  cycles, technological  advances or a lack  thereof,  consumer  demand for  products  and services,  competitive products and pricing, availability of products, inventory risks due to shifts in market demand,  the regulatory and trade  environment and other risks indicated in filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The  increase  is  primarily attributable to two factors:  (1) the addition of 111 RadioShack  stores (net of closures) and 14 Computer  City(R)  stores  during 1996 and (2) the  incremental addition of a full year's  revenue  related to stores  opened  during 1995 whose total 1995 revenue  reflected a partial  year.  Tandy  announced a store closure plan in  December  1996 and  accordingly,  1997  consolidated  revenues  are not expected  to match  levels  obtained  in 1996.  Excluding  the  announced  store closures,  consolidated  sales for 1996 would have approximated  $4.882 billion. See Note 3 of "Notes to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements" for additional information.      For the year ended December 31, 1996,  the Company showed a 2.3%  comparable store  sales  decline,  which  was  the  result  of all  divisions  experiencing comparable sales declines during the year. Although the RadioShack division same store  sales  declined  less  than 1%,  Incredible  Universe  was down  4.2% and Computer City was down 4.9%.  These  declines are  indicative of the  heightened level of  competition  within  the  industry  and lower  consumer  demand  which negatively  impacted the consumer  electronics  industry as a whole.  This lower demand was primarily  attributed to higher  consumer debt levels and the lack of new products with significant technological advances.     RadioShack  sales for 1996  increased  less than 1% to  $3.237  billion  from $3.219  billion.  The McDuff store  closures,  which are included in  RadioShack sales,  totaled  $135.8  million in 1996.  Excluding  McDuff,  RadioShack  sales increased 2.8%. Consumer electronics, while remaining the single largest product category of  RadioShack's  sales mix,  declined  slightly to 44.8% of sales from 46.1% in 1995 and 45.4% in 1994  principally  due to declines in audio and video and personal  electronic  sales including  portable radio and cassette  product, VCRs, and camcorders.  Parts and accessory sales,  including batteries,  rose to 34.1% of RadioShack  business from 32.9% in 1995. The average 1996 selling price on desktop computers and notebook  computers rose 32.9% and 18.5%,  respectively over the 1995 average selling price. Although computer sales have increased as a percentage of total sales,  system units sold have  declined.  Repair income and cellular commissions experienced a slight decline in 1996 to 10.1% of sales from 10.4% in 1995,  which was up from 6.6% in 1994.  The 1996  decline  in  cellular commissions is partially  attributable to the changes in the California  market, which experienced  increased consumer demand in 1995 due to enactment of certain laws at that time.  RadioShack plans to expand its  company-owned  store base to 5,000 locations by the year 2000. In addition,  through a new dealership program entitled  "RadioShack  Select",  the  Company  plans to  award  up to 1,000  new dealerships over the next five years.       On  September  10,  1996,  the Company,  through the  RadioShack  division, entered into a telecommunications  alliance with Sprint Communications  Company, L.P.,  Sprint United Management  Company  (collectively,  "Sprint"),  and Sprint Spectrum L.P.  ("Spectrum").  This  alliance will allow  consumers to purchase a full range of  Sprint-branded  telecommunication  services and products  through participating  RadioShack retail stores. Under the agreement,  Sprint,  Spectrum and  RadioShack  will  create and  advertise a  "store-within-a-store"  concept. Customers will have access,  where available,  to a full service  communications information  center that will offer Spectrum  personal  communications  services ("PCS"), Sprint long distance, local and wireless phone service, Internet access and paging,  as well as  Spree(SM)  pre-paid  phone  cards and phone  equipment. RadioShack   will  also  be  the   exclusive   retailer  of  Sprint(R)   branded "residential"   telephones.   Sprint-branded  PCS  products  and  services  were available in 240 stores at the end of 1996.  Sprint  telecommunication  services are expected to be available in approximately 4,000 stores by late 1997.

Revenues for 1995  increased  49% over 1994 revenues of $1.184 billion.  These increases are the result of the chain's growth from 40 stores as of January 1, 1994 to a total of 113 stores as of December  31,  1996.  Although the Company  announced the closing of 21 Computer City stores in December  1996, revenues in this division are not expected to change significantly,  due in part to stores  opened in 1996 that  were  only  opened a partial  year,  incremental revenue from the anticipated  addition of approximately  five new stores as well as Computer City`s increased focus on a more experienced  target customer group. The 21 closing  Computer  City stores  generated  revenues of $359.1  million in 1996.  See discussion  under  Provision for Business  Restructuring  for certain actions  management is taking to improve  sales and  operating  results for this division.     Incredible  Universe  sales  increased  22.4% to $908.5  million  from $742.0 million in 1995.  Revenues for 1995 increased 94.4% over 1994 revenues of $381.7 million.  These increases are the result of the chain's growth from three stores as of January 1, 1994 to a total of 17 stores as of December 31, 1996.  Revenues for 1997 will be materially  reduced from 1996 levels due to the closure of this division in 1997. Revenues will be eliminated entirely after 1997 (see Note 3 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements").      For the year ended December 31, 1995, the Company's  consolidated  sales and operating  revenues  increased  18.1% to $5.839  billion from $4.944  billion in 1994.  The  increase in sales is primarily  attributable  to the addition of 160 RadioShack  stores (net of closures),  eight  Incredible  Universe stores and 30 Computer  City stores  during  1995.  Due to the closure of 233 Tandy Name Brand Retail Group ("Tandy Name Brand") stores during the first quarter of 1995, sales for that  division  decreased  from $271.5  million in 1994 to $28.1  million in 1995.  This division is now closed and sales of the  remaining  Tandy Name Brand stores are  included in the  RadioShack  total for each period  presented in the "Net  Sales  and  Operating  Revenues"  table.  See  Note  3 of  the  "Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information.

(2 ) Includes 21 stores that are part of the store closure plan announced in      December 1996. (3)  Incredible Universe division will cease operations in 1997.  GROSS PROFIT     Gross profit as a percentage  of sales  declined from 35.5% in 1995 to 32.2% in 1996.  The Company's  gross profit margin for 1996 was adversely  affected by approximately $91.4 million of lower of cost or market inventory  writedowns and related costs primarily associated with the restructuring  announced in December 1996. Excluding these charges, the gross profit margin would have been 33.6% for 1996.  The  decrease in gross  profit  margin from 35.5% to 33.6% (as  adjusted) reflects the  continued  effect of Tandy's  lower gross margin  retail  formats. During  calendar year 1996,  Computer City and Incredible  Universe  represented 47.3% of net sales and  operating  revenues as compared to 42.9% of the 1995 net sales and  operating  revenues.  Continuing  Computer  City  stores  would  have approximated  34.9% of 1996 sales after giving  effect to the 1996 store closure plan. Accordingly, management anticipates that Tandy's consolidated gross profit percentage  will  increase  slightly for the year ended  December 31, 1997,  due primarily  to the  1997  closure  of the  Incredible  Universe  division,  which historically   operated  at  lower  gross   margins  than   consolidated   Tandy Corporation.  Furthermore, gross profit margin for calendar year 1996, excluding stores in the closure plan and the 1996 fourth  quarter  lower of cost or market inventory impairment,  would have approximated 38.8%. See Provision for Business Restructuring below.      During 1996, RadioShack's gross margin was up slightly when compared to 1995 due to the relative  stability of product mix as a percentage  of overall  sales from 1995 to 1996.  No  significant  change is  expected in  RadioShack's  gross margin for 1997.  Excluding lower of cost or market  writedowns  associated with store closures,  Computer City's gross margin decreased  slightly in 1996 due to competitive  forces which continue to exist in the computer  retail industry and the lack of introduction in 1996 of new products with significant  technological advances. Incredible Universe's gross margin percentage decreased 2.2 percentage points from 1995 due to an increase in the relative  percentage  of lower margin computer sales and price competition in the consumer electronics industry.      Gross profit as a percentage  of sales  declined from 39.0% in 1994 to 35.5% in 1995. This decrease reflected the continued  expansion of Tandy's lower gross margin retail formats.  During calendar year 1995,  Computer City and Incredible Universe represented 42.9% of net sales and operating revenues compared to 31.7% of the 1994  total.  During  1995,  RadioShack's  gross  margin  decreased  when compared to 1994 due to the rapid growth of cellular phone and digital satellite system sales. Computer City's gross margin remained relatively flat in 1995 when compared to 1994.  Competitive  forces continued to be a major factor in keeping margins flat in 1995.  Incredible Universe's gross margins decreased slightly in 1995 compared to 1994  reflecting  the fact that personal  computers and related equipment, which inherently have lower margins,  contributed a larger portion to the overall sales mix in 1995 versus 1994.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES    Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  ("SG&A") as a percentage  of sales and operating  revenues for the year ended December 31, 1996 declined from the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994. The  accompanying  table  summarizes the  breakdown of various  components  of SG&A and their  related  percentage of sales and  operating  revenues.  The lower SG&A  percentage  reflects  the lower costs,  relative  to net sales and  operating  revenues,  of  Computer  City and Incredible  Universe,  which operate at lower relative  costs than  consolidated Tandy Corporation.  Accordingly,  management  anticipates that Tandy's SG&A as a percentage of sales and operating  revenues will increase  slightly for the year ended  December 31, 1997,  as Computer  City and  Incredible  Universe  begin to decrease in their  combined  proportion of overall Tandy  Corporation  business. Excluding  those stores in the 1996 store closure plan,  SG&A as a percentage of sales would have approximated 29.7% versus 28.0% for the year ended December 31, 1996. See Provision for Business Restructuring below.     Payroll and commissions expense increased slightly in 1996 as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues to 12.1% from 12.0% in 1995, down from 12.7% in 1994.  The 1996 and 1995  decrease as a percentage  of sales from 1994 is due to the  increase in  combined  Computer  City and  Incredible  Universe  sales as a percentage  of net sales and  operating  revenues from 31.7% in 1994 to 42.9% in 1995 and to 47.3% in 1996.  These  divisions  have an  inherently  lower  salary structure  when  compared to the total  company.  As of December 31,  1996,  the Company had  approximately  48,400  employees.  The  preceding  number  includes approximately  8,500 temporary retail employees who were hired for the Christmas selling season. See Provision for Business  Restructuring  below for anticipated work force reductions related to the Company's restructuring programs.     Advertising  costs for 1996 have  decreased as a  percentage  of sales due to nonrecurring  1995  promotional  expenses  relating  to the grand  opening of 30 Computer  City  stores  and  eight  Incredible   Universe  stores  during  1995. Additionally,  RadioShack's  1996  advertising  expense as a percentage of sales remained consistent with 1995.     Rent expense increased slightly as a percentage of sales to 3.8% in 1996 from 3.7% in 1995,  down  from  4.3% in 1994.  The  decrease  from  1994 to 1996 as a percentage  of sales  directly  relates  to the  closing of 233 Tandy Name Brand stores in the first  quarter of 1995 and the  increase in the number of Computer City and  Incredible  Universe  stores,  which  have  lower  rent  expense  as a percentage of sales than the Company as a whole.       The  expenses of the credit  operations  have  significantly  declined as a result  of the sale of the  private  label  credit  card  portfolios  which  was completed by March 31, 1995.  The sale of the credit card  portfolio  balance in 1994 has significantly reduced the bad debt provision during 1995 as compared to prior years.  In addition,  servicing  costs  associated with the portfolio have also been eliminated with the sale. These factors were the primary  contributors to the  decrease  in the  expenses of the credit  operations  from 1994 to 1995. Offsetting these reductions is decreased  interest income (see discussion below) resulting from the credit card portfolio  sale.  Commencing in 1995, the Company receives  fees from an  unrelated  third party  financier  of its private  label credit card  portfolio  balance for the  generation  of normal  interest-bearing accounts,  and pays a fee for the  generation  of  special  purpose  promotional accounts,  such as "zero interest for twelve  months." These fees are classified as credit card fees in the  accompanying  SG&A table and are the primary  reason for the increase in this category in 1995 versus 1994.  Credit card fees expense also includes fees associated with third party bank credit cards.  Other SG&A  expenses,  which  include  repair,  maintenance,  travel,  and other miscellaneous  expenses,  have in total remained  relatively  consistent between 3.1% - 3.0% of sales during 1996, 1995, and 1994.

The reversal to a net interest expense position in 1996 is primarily attributable to the sale of the Company's private label credit card portfolios in the fourth quarter of 1994 and the first quarter of 1995.     Interest  income from the credit card  operations  decreased in 1995 and 1996 due to the sale of the Company's credit card portfolios. As a result of the sale of the Computer City and Incredible  Universe credit card portfolios in 1994 and the  RadioShack  and McDuff credit card  portfolios in 1995, the Company will no longer earn  interest  income from these  portfolios.  Interest  income for 1995 includes the amount of interest received prior to the sale of the RadioShack and McDuff portfolios.  Interest income relating to the InterTAN,  Inc. ("InterTAN") notes will  continue in 1997 but at a reduced  level as  principal  payments are received.  In addition,  the AST Research,  Inc. ("AST") note was repaid in 1996 and,  accordingly,  the Company will no longer receive interest income from this source.  Other  interest  income  relates  primarily to cash  equivalents of the Company  and was  higher  in 1994  than in 1995 and 1996 due to  increased  cash equivalents  resulting  from  proceeds  received  from the 1993  divestiture  of discontinued  manufacturing  and marketing  operations.  The Company has entered into contracts  with Fry's  Electronics,  Inc. of Palo Alto,  California for the sale of the assets of six Incredible  Universe stores and contracts with certain affiliates  for the sale of the real  estate of those  stores.  Upon  successful completion of the  anticipated  closings,  the Company will hold multiple  notes receivable  approximating  $100 million with varying maturities ranging from one to five years and varying  interest  rates ranging from 5.91% to 6.7%.  Interest income of  approximately  $3.3 million relating to these notes is anticipated to be recognized in 1997,  contingent upon the transactions  closing.  Based on the above, interest income is expected to decline slightly in 1997.     Interest expense has grown since 1994 as a result of the Company's  increased usage of short-term  borrowing  facilities  including seasonal bank credit lines and commercial paper facilities, as excess funds from the 1993 manufacturing and marketing  operations  divestiture and 1994/1995 sale of credit  operations have been fully utilized. The use of these facilities was significantly higher during the years ended  December 31, 1996, and 1995, as the Company  retired  long-term debt,  funded store  expansion  and  executed a share  repurchase  program.  Net interest  expense is expected to  increase in 1997 as the Company  continues  to fund a portion  of its  share  repurchase  program  through  existing  borrowing facilities.  PROVISION FOR BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING    Tandy has  initiated  certain  restructuring  programs  affecting  its retail operations.  These  restructuring  programs  were  undertaken as a result of the highly  competitive   environment  in  the  electronics   industry.   Management anticipates these changes will strengthen its business by reducing costs.     1994  Restructuring:  In  December  1994,  the  Company  adopted  a  business restructuring  plan to close or convert 233 of the 306 Tandy Name Brand  stores. At March 31, 1995,  all 233 stores had been closed or  converted.  The remaining stores became part of the Tandy Specialty Retail Group of RadioShack.  A pre-tax charge of $89.1  million was taken in the fourth  quarter of fiscal 1994 related to  the  closing  and  conversion  of  these  stores.   The  components  of  the restructuring  charge and an analysis of the amounts charged against the reserve are  outlined  in a table  in Note 3 of the  "Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial Statements".     1996  Restructurings:  The Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $25.5 million during  the  second   quarter  of  1996  related  to  an   Incredible   Universe restructuring program announced on May 21, 1996. The charge related primarily to future lease obligations,  disposition of fixed assets, and certain  termination costs associated with employees.  The components of the restructuring charge and an analysis of the amounts  charged  against the reserve are outlined in a table in Note 3 of the "Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements".  This  program included  an  overhead  reduction  plan,  the  closing  of two  stores and costs associated with the cancellation of certain real estate sites held for new store development.  A  streamlining  of the  division's  overhead  costs  included the elimination of approximately 20 nonselling  positions per store,  reorganization of  some  central  unit  functions,  and a  significant  change  in  advertising strategy. The two stores located in Potomac Mills, Virginia and Charlotte, North Carolina  were  closed in the  second  quarter of 1996 due to  inadequate  sales volumes.     The Company also recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $136.6 million in the fourth quarter of 1996 related to additional  restructuring programs.  These programs  include the closure of the  remaining  53 McDuff  stores,  exiting the Incredible  Universe  business  (consisting  of 17  stores),  and  closure of 21 Computer  City  stores.  Computer  City will strive to  reposition  its focus on target customers who are the experienced  users, small office/home office group, and corporate  accounts.  Along with the target  customer group focus,  Computer City will work toward a more productive,  higher margin mix of business in areas such as services, software and peripherals. The Company will continue to closely monitor the operating  results of this  division.  Management  believes that its current restructuring strategy will improve this division's operations; however, there can be no assurance that it will be successful.     The fourth  quarter 1996  restructuring  charges  related  primarily to lease obligations,  real estate costs,  employee  termination  expenses,  and contract cancellation  costs. The components of the restructuring  charge and an analysis of the reserve are  outlined in a table in Note 3 of the "Notes to  Consolidated Financial Statements".  Implementation of the restructuring programs will result in the elimination of approximately 3,500 employee positions. Management expects the  restructuring  plan and cash  expenditures  relating to the  programs to be completed by December 31, 1997 in all material  respects.  Cash expenditures are anticipated  to be  funded  through  cash  flow  from  operations  and  existing borrowing  facilities.  The  cumulative  1996  restructuring  and store  closure programs  resulted  in  significant  impairments  related to  long-lived  assets totaling  $112.8  million  (see  discussion  below)  and lower of cost or market impairments  totaling $91.4 million  recognized  within cost of sales (see Gross Profit discussion above).  IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS    In March 1995, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  121,  "Accounting  for the Impairment of  Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of" ("FAS 121"),  which was effective for fiscal years  beginning after December 15, 1995. Effective January 1, 1996, the Company adopted FAS 121 which requires that long-lived  assets (primarily  property,  plant and equipment and goodwill) held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment  whenever  events or changes in circumstances  indicate  that  the  net  book  value  of the  asset  may  not be recoverable.  An  impairment  loss will be recognized if the sum of the expected future cash flows  (undiscounted  and before interest) from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset.  The amount of the impairment loss will generally be measured as the  difference  between the net book value of the assets and the estimated fair value of the related assets.     Upon adoption of FAS 121 in the first quarter of 1996, the Company recognized an initial non-cash  impairment loss of  approximately  $26.0 million to conform with this  statement,  primarily as a result of grouping  assets at their lowest level of cash flows to determine impairment as required by this statement.  Fair value was principally  determined  based upon estimated  future  discounted cash flows  (before  interest)  related  to each group of assets.  The  Company  also recorded a non-cash  impairment of $8.0 million in the  restructuring  charge in May 1996.     The Company  recognized an  additional  non-cash  impairment  charge of $86.8 million  in the fourth  quarter of 1996  primarily  related to the  disposal  of certain  long-lived assets pursuant to its restructuring plan (see Note 3 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial  Statements").  These assets principally relate to the Incredible  Universe,  Computer City and remaining McDuff stores that are part of the store closure plan and certain  foreign real estate.  Fair value was principally  determined by quoted market prices.  Management expects the plan of disposal to be accomplished in all material  respects by approximately  December 31,  1997.  The net book value of the  long-lived  assets to be  disposed  of at December  31,  1996  approximated  $68.2  million.  See Note 3 of the  "Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements" for the 1996 operating results of the stores included in the store closure plan.  UNREALIZED LOSS ON AST SECURITIES    On July 12,  1996,  the  Company  received  $60.0  million  in cash and $30.0 million in AST common  stock as final  payment of a $90.0  million  note payable from AST to the Company. The 4,498,594 shares of AST common stock Tandy received represented  approximately  7.8% of the  outstanding  common stock of AST at the time of receipt. The Company's cost basis approximated $6.67 per share.     On January 30, 1997, Samsung  Electronics Co., Ltd.  ("Samsung")  proposed to purchase the  remaining  outstanding  shares of AST common stock it does not own (Samsung owned approximately 46% as of December 31, 1996) for cash consideration of $5.10 per share.  As a result,  the Company  considers  the decline  from its original  cost basis of $6.67 per share and  Samsung's  offer price of $5.10 per share to be "other than  temporary"  and,  accordingly,  has assigned a new cost basis to the stock of $5.10 per share. The recognition of this reduction in cost basis was recorded as an unrealized loss of approximately  $7.0 million which is reflected as an increase to selling,  general and administrative  expense in the accompanying  1996  Consolidated  Statements  of Income.  Upon  consummation  of Samsung's  proposal at the offer price of $5.10 per share, the "unrealized loss" would effectively become "realized".     Consummation of Samsung's  proposed  acquisition of AST is subject to several conditions,  including approval of the transaction by the independent directors, negotiation  and  execution of a mutually  satisfactory  merger  agreement,  and receipt of all required United States and Korean governmental approvals.  GAIN ON SALE OF CREDIT OPERATIONS AND EXTENDED SERVICE CONTRACTS      In  December  1994,  the  Company   entered  into  an  agreement  with  SPS Transaction Services, Inc., a majority-owned subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover & Company  ("SPS") to sell its Computer  City and  Incredible  Universe  private label credit card  portfolios  without  recourse.  As a result of the agreement, Tandy  received cash of $85.8 million and received a deferred  payment of $179.8 million. The Company recognized a gain of $35.7 million in the accompanying 1994 Consolidated  Statements of Income. The total principal amount of $179.8 million was paid in full during 1995.     On March 30, 1995, the Company  completed the sale, at net book value, of the RadioShack  and  Tandy  Name  Brand  private  label  credit  card  accounts  and substantially all related accounts receivable to Hurley State Bank, a subsidiary of SPS. As a result of the  transaction,  Tandy received  $342.8 million in cash and a deferred payment amount of $49.4 million which has been paid in full.     Effective  December  1994,  the  Company  transferred  all  of  its  existing obligations with respect to extended service  contracts in force at December 31, 1994, with the exception of certain  contracts  aggregating  approximately  $7.7 million,  to an unrelated third party.  The unrelated third party  contractually assumed all of the Company's legal  obligations and risk of future loss pursuant to the extended  service  contracts in exchange for $75.0 million.  As a result, the Company  recognized a gain of $55.7 million associated with this transaction in  its  accompanying  1994  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income.  The  Company continues to provide repair services to customers who tender  products  pursuant to the extended service contracts on a non-exclusive  basis. The unrelated third party pays the Company competitive market rates for repairs on products tendered pursuant to the extended service contracts.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES    The  effective  tax benefit rate that  resulted  from the  Company's net loss position  was 37.1% for the year ended  December  31,  1996,  and the  effective provision rate was 38.3% for the year ended December 31, 1995, and 37.6% for the year ended  December 31, 1994. The effective tax rate for 1996 changed from 1995 due primarily to foreign  income taxes which were incurred on foreign  income in 1996 despite the overall loss incurred by the Company.     The IRS Dallas office had previously referred certain issues in the Company's 1987 tax return to the IRS  National  Office.  The issues  involved  the private letter rulings issued by the IRS in connection with the spin-off of InterTAN and certain other tax matters.  On June 20, 1996,  the IRS notified the Company that it would no longer challenge the private letter ruling issued in connection with the  InterTAN  spin-off.  In December  of 1996,  the IRS Dallas  Appeals  Office notified  the  Company  that it is no  longer  pursuing  the  remaining  matters associated with the separation of InterTAN from the Company.  TAX SHARING AND TAX BENEFIT REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT      On  February  2,  1994,  O'Sullivan  Industries  ("O'Sullivan"),  a  former subsidiary of Tandy Corporation, completed an initial public offering. Tandy has recognized income of approximately $0.2 million,  $1.3 million and $4.4 million, net  of  tax,  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  1996,  1995  and  1994, respectively,  pursuant to a Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit Reimbursement Agreement (the  "Agreement")  between Tandy and  O'Sullivan.  Under the  Agreement,  Tandy receives  payments from  O'Sullivan  approximating  the federal tax benefit that O'Sullivan  realizes from the increased tax basis of its assets  resulting  from the initial public  offering.  The higher tax basis increases  O'Sullivan's  tax deductions and, accordingly,  reduces income taxes payable by O'Sullivan.  These payments  will be made  over a  15-year  time  period  and are  contingent  upon O'Sullivan's taxable income each year. The Company is recognizing these payments as additional  sale  proceeds and gain in the year in which the payments  become due and payable to the Company pursuant to the Agreement. The additional gain is recorded  as a  reduction  of  SG&A  expense  in the  accompanying  Consolidated Statements of Income.  CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY                                    Year Ended                                   December 31,                               ------------------------------------------------ (In millions)                      1996              1995              1994 - - -------------                 --------------    --------------    ------------ Operating activities           $    307.5        $     673.0        $    268.9 Investing activities               (112.9)            (180.3)            236.6 Financing activities               (216.6)            (554.8)           (513.1)     Tandy's cash flow and liquidity,  in  management's  opinion,  remains strong. During the year ended December 31, 1996,  cash provided by operations was $307.5 million as compared to $673.0  million for the year ended  December 31, 1995 and $268.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1994.     The increased cash flow from operations for 1995 as compared to both 1996 and 1994 was the result of  nonrecurring  cash  flows  generated  in 1995  primarily related to the cash received from the sale of the credit card portfolios,  which approximated $342.8 million,  and collection of the deferred payment amount from SPS of $179.8 million.     Inventory  for   RadioShack   and  related   support   operations   decreased approximately $30.0 million in 1996, while during the same period, Computer City and Incredible Universe inventories (prior to restructuring  reserves) increased approximately $30.1 million.  These year-to-year  inventory  fluctuations offset one another,  resulting  in no material net cash effect for the year.  It is not anticipated  that  additional  stores in 1997 will materially  impact  inventory levels.  Other working  capital  components  generated $49.2 million of positive cash flow to operations in 1996. In 1995,  inventory  required less cash than in 1994 due to the  liquidation  of the closing  Tandy Name Brand  stores and a net reduction in Computer City inventory which was partially  offset by increases in inventory to support Incredible Universe and RadioShack store expansion. Current liability  reductions  in 1995  surpassed  comparable  1994  amounts  by  $376.2 million.     Investing  activities  involved  capital  expenditures  primarily  for retail expansion,  upgrading  information systems and headquarter  building renovations totaling $174.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1996, $226.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1995, and $180.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1994.  Proceeds  from the sale of property,  plant and equipment in 1995 and 1994  resulted  primarily  from  sale-leaseback  transactions  which  netted the Company $37.6 million and $52.7 million, respectively, in cash. The cash portion of payments on the note receivable from AST amounted to $6.7 million in 1995 and $60.0 million in 1996. Proceeds received from the sale of divested manufacturing and marketing  operations  totaled $359.0 million during the year ended December 31, 1994. Tandy's 1997 capital expenditures are expected to approximate $125.0 - $135.0  million  which  consist   primarily  of  future  store   expansions  and refurbishments,   as  well  as  other  capital   expenditures  such  as  updated information systems.  These expenditures will be funded primarily from cash flow from operations.     Purchases of treasury stock required cash of $232.9 million,  $502.2 million, and $275.4 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Sales of treasury stock to the Tandy Stock Plan generated cash of $39.4 million, $44.6 million and $41.6 million in 1996,  1995 and 1994,  respectively.  Dividends  paid, net of tax, in 1996, 1995 and 1994 amounted to $52.5 million,  $63.0 million and $74.5 million, respectively. As a result of the Company calling for the redemption of its $2.14 Depositary  Shares  of  the  Company's  Series  C  Preferred  Equity  Redemption Convertible  Stock  ("PERCS") in March 1995,  the Company  eliminated its annual dividend payment to the PERCS shareholders of approximately  $32.0 million.  The Company plans to fund common and Series B (Tandy Employees Stock Ownership Plan, "TESOP")  preferred  stock  dividends  with  available  cash and cash  flow from operations.      At December 31, 1996, the Company increased  short-term  borrowings by $40.9 million. Short-term debt reductions of $1.8 million and $110.4 million were made in 1995 and 1994,  respectively.  Reductions in short-term  borrowings  for 1994 were funded primarily by proceeds from the sale of divested  operations and cash provided by operations.  The Company's  primary  source of short-term  debt, for which  borrowings  and repayments  have been  presented net in the  Consolidated Statements  of Cash  Flows,  consists  of  short-term  seasonal  bank  debt  and commercial paper, which have maturities of less than 90 days.      Repayments of long-term  borrowings  during 1996 primarily  consist of $12.9 million of medium-term notes and $10.4 million of TESOP debt and $3.6 million in capital lease reductions.      Following  are the current  credit  ratings for Tandy,  which are  generally considered investment grade:                                             Standard           Duff & Category                     Moody's      and Poor's          Phelps - - --------                     -------      ----------          ------ Medium-Term Notes             Baa2           A-                 A- ESOP Senior Notes             Baa2           A-                 N/A Commercial Paper              P-2            A-2                D-1-  CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION    The Company's  balance sheet and financial  condition  continue to be strong. The  Company's  available  borrowing  facilities  as of  December  31,  1996 are detailed in Note 12 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements".     On March  3,  1997,  the  Company  announced  that  its  Board  of  Directors authorized  management to purchase an additional 5 million  shares of its common stock  through  the  Company's  existing  share  repurchase  program  which  was initially  authorized  in December  1995 and  subsequently  increased in October 1996. The share increase brings the total  authorization to 15 million shares of which  4,582,200  shares had been  purchased  as of  December  31,  1996.  These purchases  are in addition to the 12.5 million  share  repurchase  program which began in  August  1994 and  concluded  in  December  1995 as well as the  shares required for employee plans which are purchased  throughout the year.  Purchases will be made  from  time to time in the open  market,  and it is  expected  that funding of the program  will come from  operating  cash flow and  existing  bank facilities.     The revolving  credit backup  facilities to Tandy's  commercial paper program were renewed  during the second  quarter of 1996.  This agreement is composed of two facilities -- one for $200.0  million  expiring June 1997 and another $300.0 million  facility  expiring  in  June  2001.  Annual  commitment  fees  for  the facilities are 0.07% per annum and 0.10% per annum,  respectively,  whether used or unused.     Tandy's  medium-term  notes  outstanding  under a 1991 shelf  registration at December 31, 1996 totaled  $54.5  million  compared to $67.1 million at December 31, 1995.     The total  debt-to-capitalization  ratio was 22.3% at  December  31, 1996 and 17.1% at both  December  31, 1995 and 1994.  This  debt-to-capitalization  ratio could  increase as Tandy  continues  to  repurchase  shares  under the  existing authorization and fund capital expenditures.     Tandy anticipates receiving a net positive cash effect from the restructuring activities.   Primary  positive   contributors  to  this  cash  effect  are  the liquidation  of closed  store  inventory  and other  related  assets and the tax benefit  created  by  the  restructuring  and  FAS  121  charges.  Primary  cash expenditures  related to the  charge are  expected  to  aggregate  approximately $138.0  million and  primarily  relate to lease buyout  payments and real estate disposal  expenses.  The  Company  expects  to  receive a major  portion of this positive  cash effect  prior to  December  31, 1997 (see Note 3 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements").     The  Company  announced  on March 3,  1997 that the  Board of  Directors  had authorized the filing of a $300.0 million Debt  Registration  Statement with the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  Funding under the  Registration  Statement will take the form of senior  unsecured notes and medium-term  notes and will be used to refinance  existing  short-term  indebtedness and for general  corporate purposes.  The filing and funding of this debt registration is subject to future market conditions and unforeseen events.     Management  believes that the Company's present borrowing capacity is greater than the established  credit lines and long-term debt in place.  Management also believes that the Company's cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents and its available  borrowing  facilities  are more than adequate to fund planned store expansion,  to meet debt service and dividend requirements and to fund its share repurchase  program. If filed and funded, the issuance of longer term debt under the new shelf  registration  should improve the Company's  balance between short-term and long-term debt.  INFLATION    Inflation  has not  significantly  impacted  the Company  over the past three years.  Management  does not expect  inflation to have a  significant  impact on operations in the  foreseeable  future unless  global  situations  substantially affect the world economy.  INTERTAN UPDATE    Summarized in the tables below are the notes and other  receivables  due from InterTAN  at  December  31,  1996  and  1995 as well  as the  income  components generated from operations relative to InterTAN for each of the three years ended December 31, 1996,  1995 and 1994.  The estimated  fair market value of the note receivable  approximates  $28.4  million  at  December  31,  1996.  The  Company purchased  the notes at a discount  and InterTAN  has an  obligation  to pay the gross amount of the notes.

Under the merchandise purchase terms of the original distribution  agreement,  InterTAN could purchase on payment terms products sold or secured by Tandy.  A&A, a subsidiary of Tandy, was the exclusive  purchasing agent for products originating in the Far East for InterTAN.     In August 1993, Trans World  Electronics,  Inc. ("Trans World"), a subsidiary of  Tandy,  reached  an  agreement  with  InterTAN's  banking  syndicate  to buy approximately  $42.0  million of  InterTAN's  debt at a  negotiated,  discounted price. The debt purchased from the banks was restructured into a seven-year note with  interest  of  8.64%  due  semiannually  beginning  February  25,  1994 and semiannual principal payments beginning February 25, 1995 (the "Series A" note). Trans World provided  approximately  $10.0 million in working  capital and trade credit to InterTAN.  Interest on the working  capital loan (the "Series B" note) of 8.11% was due semiannually  beginning February 25, 1994 and the note was paid in full in 1996.  Trans World also has received  warrants with a five-year  term exercisable for  approximately  1,450,000  shares of InterTAN common stock at an exercise price of $6.618 per share.  The fair market value of these warrants was approximately  $1.0 million at December  31,  1996.  As required by an agreement with Tandy,  InterTAN has  registered  the warrants  under the Securities Act of 1933. At December 31, 1996,  InterTAN's  common stock price was $4.88 per share. At February 19, 1997, InterTAN's common stock price was $4.25 per share.    Subject to  certain  conditions  described  below,  all of  Tandy's  debt from InterTAN is secured by a first priority lien on substantially  all of InterTAN's assets in Canada  and the U.K.  The  Company  was also  granted  a  mortgage  by InterTAN on certain real property in Australia in 1996.     A  merchandise  agreement  was  reached  with  InterTAN in October  1993,  as subsequently  amended,  which requires a percentage of future purchase orders to be backed by letters of credit posted by InterTAN.  New license  agreements,  as amended,  provide a royalty payable to Tandy,  which began in the September 1995 quarter.   InterTAN  had  obligations   for  purchase  orders   outstanding  for merchandise   ordered  by  A&A  for  InterTAN  but  not  yet  shipped   totaling approximately $23.2 million at December 31, 1996.     InterTAN  increased its bank revolving  credit  facility with its new banking syndicate to Canadian $60.0 million (U.S.  $43.8 million  equivalent at December 31,  1996) in 1994.  At December 31,  1996,  InterTAN had borrowed  $2.6 million under this facility. In the event of InterTAN's default on the bank credit line, Tandy  will,  at the  option  of  InterTAN's  new  banking  syndicate,  purchase InterTAN's  inventory and related  accounts  receivable at 50% of their net book value,  up to the amount of outstanding  bank loans,  but not to exceed Canadian $60.0 million.  In that event,  Tandy could foreclose on its first priority lien on  InterTAN's  assets in Canada and the U.K.  If Tandy  fails to  purchase  the inventory  and  related  accounts   receivable  of  InterTAN  from  the  banking syndicate,  the  syndicate,  upon notice to Tandy and  expiration  of time,  can foreclose  upon  InterTAN's  assets in Canada and the U.K.  ahead of Tandy.  The inventory  repurchase  agreement between  InterTAN's banking syndicate and Tandy has been amended and restated to reflect the foregoing.     A&A will continue as the exclusive  purchasing  agent for InterTAN in the Far East on a commission basis.     Through  February  1997,  InterTAN has met all of its payment  obligations to Tandy.  Reported  income before taxes for the six months ended December 31, 1996 approximated  $10.0  million  compared to $13.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 1995.  Nothing has come to the attention of management  which would indicate  that  InterTAN  would  not be able to  continue  to meet  its  payment obligations pursuant to the debt agreements with Tandy.     Canadian tax  authorities  are  reviewing  InterTAN's  Canadian  subsidiary's 1987-93  tax  returns.   The  Company  cannot  determine  whether  the  ultimate resolution of that review will have an effect on InterTAN's  ability to meet its obligations to Tandy,  but at present,  nothing has come to the attention of the Company  which would lead it to believe  that the  ultimate  resolution  of this review would impair InterTAN's ability to meet its obligations to Tandy.
