ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ("MD&A").  This MD&A  section  discusses  our  results  of our  operations,  liquidity  and financial  condition,  risk  management  practices and certain  factors that may affect our future results, including economic and industry-wide factors, as well as our  critical  accounting  policies  and  estimates.  You should read MD&A in conjunction with our consolidated  financial  statements and accompanying  notes included in this Annual Report.  OVERVIEW RadioShack is primarily a retailer of consumer electronics and services. We seek to  differentiate   ourselves  from  our  various  competitors  by  focusing  on dominating cost-effective solutions to meet everyone's routine electronics needs and  families'  distinct  electronics  wants.  This  strategy  allows us to take advantage of the unique opportunities provided by our extensive retail presence, knowledgeable  sales staff, and relationships with reputable vendors. We believe this strategy  provides us with the  opportunity to increase our market share in the highly competitive  consumer  electronics area. In addition,  we continue to focus on methods to reduce the costs of products  sold and selling,  general and administrative  expense as a  percentage  of net sales and  operating  revenues. Furthermore,  we believe that by focusing on  opportunities  such as  innovative products,  new  markets,   licensing  opportunities  and  creative  distribution channels,  we can  ultimately  generate  increased  financial  returns  for  our shareholders over the long term.  We have identified two key  opportunities to drive company growth,  which are in alignment with our overall  strategy  described above. We are focusing on growth of our core business,  which includes our company-operated  stores,  dealers and our Web site  www.radioshack.com,  as well as businesses  that we consider to be close to our core  strengths,  which  includes  retail  services,  international operations and consumer electronics repairs.  With  respect to our core  business,  our  strategy is to enhance our brands and customer  experiences in our stores.  We are  accomplishing  this by focusing on improvement of our product assortment, store personnel and store environment. In order to improve our product assortment, we are customizing key stores by market area, with the goal of providing  products that are tailored to the customers of that  particular  market.  We  are  also  focusing  on  high-performing  product categories,  while  de-emphasizing  other product categories that have had lower historical performances. In addition, we are attempting to identify technologies that we believe we can grow, based on our established  ability to accelerate the adoption  rate of new  technologies.  With  respect to store  personnel,  we are enhancing our training,  compensation and store operating procedures,  including our  receiving,  labor  scheduling  and  hours of  operation.  Finally,  we have improved our store  environment by rolling out an updated store format to nearly 300 more stores in 2004.  We intend to  accelerate  this  roll-out  in 2005.  In addition,  we make  continuous  enhancements  to our store  format as stores are rolled out.  We are also focusing on businesses  that are  considered to be close to our core strengths.  This  close-to-core  strategy includes expanding our retail services business,  recognizing  innovative  product  channels  and  opportunities,   and identifying   international  expansion  opportunities.   In  order  to  identify innovative  product  channels  and  opportunities,  we are  focusing on creating innovative   relationships   with  key  parties  such  as  vendors  and  product developers,  utilizing new channels,  and  obtaining  intellectual  property and licensing rights to innovative products.  In 2004, we  significantly  expanded our retail services  business by purchasing the  wireless  kiosks in SAM'S  CLUB.  During the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 2004, we acquired  wireless  kiosk  fixtures and inventory  located within SAM'S CLUB retail  locations,  as well as certain  other assets and  liabilities  from Wireless Retail,  Inc. ("WRI").  The total purchase price was $59.1 million.  In conjunction  with  this  transaction,  we  received  cash and  commitments  from wireless carriers of $40.3 million.  Regarding our SAM'S CLUB operations, we pay rent for the use of the  kiosk  area  within  SAM'S  CLUB  locations,  and while utilizing our own employees, POS system, and store fixtures.   Another component of our retail services business is our Sprint kiosk locations, which are Sprint-branded and are located in malls. At these locations,  which we staff,  we sell Sprint  wireless  hardware  and related  accessories.  We have a profit-sharing  and  working-capital  arrangement  with Sprint  related to these locations.  We expect to continue to identify  additional  opportunities  in our overall retail services business in 2005.  KEY INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR MANAGEMENT To identify our progress in achieving our solutions strategy, we use several key financial  performance  metrics,  including  net  sales and  operating  revenues metrics, gross margin metrics, and selling,  general and administrative ("SG&A") expense and operating margin metrics.  Net Sales and Operating Revenues Metrics  As a  retailer,  we  consider  growth in  revenue to be a key  indicator  of our overall  financial  performance.  We examine  our  revenue by using  several key metrics, including overall change in net sales and operating revenue, comparable company  store sales  growth,  average  tickets per store and average  sales per ticket.  The  change in net sales  and  operating  revenue  provides  us with an  overall indication of the demand for our products and services. Comparable company store sales  growth  indicates  the extent to which  sales were  impacted by growth in existing sales channels. Comparable company store sales include the sales of any domestic,  retail  location  where  we  have  a  physical  presence,   including company-operated  stores  and  kiosks,  that has  more  than 12 full  months  of recorded sales. Average tickets per store, in conjunction with average sales per ticket,  provide us with an  indication  of whether the changes in revenues were generated by a higher  volume of  purchases  or by  purchases  of products  with higher prices.  The table below summarizes these revenue metrics for the years indicated:                                             2004      2003      2002                                          --------  --------  -------- Net sales and operating revenues growth    4.1%      1.6%     (4.2%) Comparable store sales growth               3%        2%       (1%) Average tickets per store per day           66        72        73 Average sales per ticket                  $34.17    $30.77    $29.40  In addition to the metrics  above,  we review the revenue per square foot of our various  channels  of  distribution  to  determine  productivity  of our product assortment and the overall distribution channel.  Gross Margin Metrics  We also view our gross margin as a key metric of our financial  performance,  as it  indicates  the extent to which we are able to reduce our  product  costs and optimize product mix.  The table below summarizes gross margin for the years indicated:                                             2004      2003      2002                                          --------  --------  -------- Gross margin                               50.3%     49.8%     48.9%  SG&A Expense and Operating Margin Metrics  We believe that our ability to leverage our fixed expense base and, accordingly, increase operating margin is an important indicator of our financial performance and process efficiency.  The table below summarizes these metrics for the years indicated:                                             2004      2003      2002                                          --------  --------  -------- SG&A expense as a percentage of sales      36.7%     37.4%     37.8% Operating margin                           11.5%     10.4%      9.3%     RETAIL OUTLETS The table below shows our retail locations broken down between  company-operated stores,  kiosks  and  dealer  outlets.  While  the  dealer  outlets  represented approximately  24% of RadioShack's  total retail locations at December 31, 2004, our  product  sales to  dealers  are less  than 10% of our  total  net sales and operating revenues (see "Results of Operations" below).                                       Average           At December 31,                                     Store Size  ----------------------------                                     (Sq. Ft.)     2004      2003      2002 - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------   Company-operated stores (1)         2,529      5,046     5,121     5,161   Kiosks (2)                             89        599         9       ---   Dealer outlets (3)                    N/A      1,788     1,921     2,052                                                 --------  --------  --------   Total number of retail locations               7,433     7,051     7,213                                                 ========  ========  ========  (1)  Over the past two years, we have closed over 100  company-operated  stores,      net of  new  store  openings  and  relocations.  This  trend  is due to not      renewing  locations that fail to meet our financial  return hurdles.  It is      anticipated that  company-operated  stores will decline in 2005 by about 50      stores.  (2)  Kiosks consist of 546 SAM'S CLUB  locations and 53 Sprint  locations at the      end of 2004 and 9 Sprint  locations  at year end 2003.  SAM'S  CLUB has the      unconditional  right to assume  the  operation  of up to 75  locations  (in      total) and to date has provided us with notice that,  effective April 2005,      SAM'S CLUB will assume operation of 23 kiosk locations  previously operated      by us. We expect the number of Sprint  kiosks to increase by  approximately      150 during 2005.  (3)  Over the past two years, we have closed over 250 dealer outlets, net of new      outlet openings or conversion to company-operated stores. This trend is due      to the closure of smaller outlets that failed to meet our minimum  purchase      requirements. It is anticipated that dealer outlets in 2005 will not change      materially from 2004.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net sales and operating revenues by channel of distribution are as follows:                                                 Year Ended December 31,                                             ---------------------------- (In millions)                                 2004      2003      2002 - -------------                               --------  --------  -------- Company-operated store sales                $4,472.3  $4,342.6  $4,231.2 Kiosk sales                                     56.4       0.7       --- Dealer and other sales                         312.5     306.0     346.0                                             --------  --------  -------- Net sales and operating revenues            $4,841.2  $4,649.3  $4,577.2                                             ========  ========  ========  Dealer and other sales not only  include our sales to the  independent  dealers, but  also   include   sales   and   operating   revenues   generated   from  our www.radioshack.com  Web site, outbound and inbound call centers,  and our retail support operations.  The following  table provides a summary of our net sales and operating  revenues by platform and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues. Platform sales include sales from  company-operated  stores,  kiosks,  dealer outlets,  and our RadioShack.com Web site.

We had a 3% increase in comparable  company store sales.  These  increases  were primarily  the result of a 22.5%  increase in our wireless  platform  sales.  An increase in average  store volume and the addition of 590 kiosk  locations  also contributed to our overall sales  increase.  Dealer and other sales,  which include sales to our dealer outlets,  in addition to retail support  operations and other sales, were up $6.5 million for 2004, or an  increase  of 2.1%,  when  compared  to 2003.  Sales  to our  dealers  remain substantially less than 10% of our total sales.  Revenue from our retail support operations,  service plans and other sales is generated  primarily  from outside sales of our repair centers and domestic and overseas manufacturing, in addition to our e-commerce  revenue.  The increase in these sales in 2004 was primarily a result of our restructuring of our extended service  contract,  partially offset due to the  disposition of RadioShack  Installation  Services  ("AmeriLink")  in September  2003.  Sales in our  wireless  platform  (which  is made up of  wireless  handsets  and communication  devices such as scanners and two-way radios) increased in dollars and as a  percentage  of net sales and  operating  revenues in 2004  compared to 2003.  This sales increase was due to both an increase in wireless  handset unit sales and an increase in the revenue per wireless handsets. Emphasis on national carrier  service and product  offerings  with  desirable  product  features  and content,  such as color screens and cameras also drove the favorable results. We anticipate sales in the wireless platform will increase for 2005, primarily as a result of a full year of SAM'S CLUB kiosk sales and the planned expansion of our Sprint  kiosks.  Sales  in  our  accessory   platform  (which   includes   accessories  for  home entertainment  products,   wireless  handsets,   digital  imaging  products  and computers,  as well as residential  phones and power)  decreased in both dollars and as a percentage  of net sales and  operating  revenues in 2004,  compared to 2003.  The decrease in this platform  resulted  primarily from a decline in home entertainment  accessories,  mostly  offset by increases  in wireless  power and digital imaging accessories.  Sales in our modern home platform (which consists of residential telephones, all home audio and video end-products, and direct-to-home ("DTH") satellite systems, as well as desktop, laptop and handheld computers) decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating  revenues in 2004,  compared to 2003. These decreases were primarily due to a sales decrease in DTH satellite systems, audio  products and cordless  telephones,  as well as a planned  decrease in DTH installation  revenue resulting from our sale of AmeriLink.  Sales in our personal  electronics  platform  (which includes  digital  cameras, camcorders,  toys,  wellness  products,  memory  players and  satellite  radios) increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating  revenues in 2004,  compared  to 2003.  These  increases  were  driven  primarily  by a sales increase in digital imaging products, memory players and the introduction of our satellite radio offering.  Sales  in our  power  platform  (which  includes  general  and  special  purpose batteries  and battery  chargers)  decreased  slightly in both  dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in 2004,  compared to 2003. These declines  were  primarily  the  result of a sales  decline  in  special  purpose batteries and battery chargers; however, the decline was substantially offset by a sales increase in general purpose  batteries.  Sales in our service  platform (which includes prepaid  wireless  airtime,  bill payment  revenue  and  warranty  service  plans)  decreased  in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in 2004,  compared to 2003. These decreases  were  primarily due to a decrease in  wireless-related  services.   Sales in our technical  platform  (which  includes wire and cable,  connectivity products,  components  and tools,  as well as hobby and  robotic  end  products) decreased  in both  dollars  and as a  percentage  of net  sales  and  operating revenues in 2004,  compared to 2003.  These  decreases  were  primarily due to a sales decline in wire and cable products and the related connectivity  products.   GROSS PROFIT  Gross profit for 2004 was $2,434.5  million or 50.3% of net sales and  operating revenues,  compared  with  $2,315.7  million or 49.8% of net sales and operating revenues in 2003,  resulting  in a 5.1%  increase in gross profit and a 50 basis point increase in our gross profit  percentage.  These  increases over the prior year  were  primarily  due to  significantly  less  margin  erosion  from  price markdowns;  we sold over 40% less in  discontinued  and devalued  merchandise in 2004 versus the prior year. In addition, the benefits of centralized procurement and better vendor management  enabled us to sell like-products year over year at higher gross margins.  These  increases  were  partially  offset by a change in  merchandise  mix among platforms,  resulting  in  increased  sales of lower  margin  products,  notably wireless, and decreased sales of higher margin products like accessories.

The dollar  increase for 2004 was primarily due to an increase in both payroll and commissions and advertising.   Payroll expense increased in dollars, but decreased as a percentage of net sales and operating  revenues.  This dollar increase was due to the higher sales-based compensation we paid as a result of our 3% increase in company  comparable store sales,  as well as our acquisition of the SAM'S CLUB kiosk locations and related personnel in October 2004. We expect payroll  expense to increase in 2005 due to the full-year effect of the acquisition of the SAM'S CLUB kiosk business and our planned increase in the number of Sprint kiosk locations.  Advertising  expense increased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating  revenues.  This  increase  is  primarily  related to an  increase  in expenditures  associated  with the  holiday  selling  season.  Additionally,  we received fewer contributions from our vendors. We expect our advertising expense to  increase in 2005 in dollars but  decrease as a  percentage  of net sales and operating revenues, as a result of increased sales from our kiosk operations and an improvement in operating efficiencies.  Rent expense  increased in dollars,  but decreased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues.  The dollar increase was due primarily to lease renewals and relocations at higher rates,  as well as the acquisition of the SAM'S CLUB kiosk business in October 2004. We expect an increase in 2005 rent expense,  primarily as a result of the full-year  effect of the  acquisition of the SAM'S CLUB kiosk business and Sprint kiosk expansion.  Insurance  expense  decreased  in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating  revenues,  as a result of both fewer  claims  and a  decrease  in the number of participants in our insurance programs.  Our insurance expense relates to  losses,  claims  and  insurance  premiums,  which  are  partially  offset by contributions from health insurance participants.  In 2005,  we expect SG&A  expense to increase in dollars,  due to the  full-year effect of our  acquisition  of the SAM'S CLUB  kiosk  business  and our  planned Sprint kiosk  expansion.  We anticipate a slight decrease as a percentage of net sales and operating  revenues,  due to anticipated  increased sales volume and a continued focus on leveraging our fixed expense base.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  Depreciation and amortization  expense  increased $9.4 million dollars to $101.4 million and increased to 2.1% of net sales and operating  revenues,  compared to 2.0% for 2003. The increase in  depreciation  was primarily  attributable to new store fixtures for existing company-operated stores, as well as the hardware and software  associated with information  systems upgrades.  We expect depreciation and  amortization  expense to increase by at least 10% in 2005 due to  increases associated  with our new  corporate  headquarters,  which  is now  substantially complete  and  occupied,  increased  spending  for our  store  remodel  program, information system projects,  and the amortization of intangibles related to our SAM'S CLUB kiosk business acquisition.  GAIN ON CONTRACT TERMINATION  There was no gain on contract  termination in 2004. For information on the prior year gain on contract  termination,  see the discussion  below under the section titled "2003 Compared with 2002."  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  There  was  no  significant   impairment  of  long-lived  assets  in  2004.  For information  on  the  prior  year  impairment  of  long-lived  assets,  see  the discussion below under the section titled "2003 Compared with 2002."  NET INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $18.2  million for 2004 versus $22.9 million for 2003, a decrease of $4.7 million or 20.5%.  Interest expense  decreased to $29.6 million in 2004 from $35.7 million in 2003. This  decrease  was  primarily  the result of a reduction  in the  average  debt outstanding  throughout 2004. In addition, the capitalization of $6.6 million of interest  expense related to the  construction of our new corporate  campus also lowered  overall  interest  expense for the year ended  December 31, 2004,  when compared to the same prior year period.  Interest income decreased  approximately 11% to $11.4 million in 2004 from $12.8 million in 2003, despite an increase in investment rates. This was primarily the result of a $1.3 million  decrease in interest  received from tax settlements in 2004 compared to 2003, as well as a lower average investment balance.   Interest  expense,  net of interest income, is expected to increase by more than $6 million in 2005, when compared to 2004, due to the elimination of capitalized interest  expense as a result of the substantial  completion of the construction of our corporate headquarters.  OTHER INCOME, NET  During the year ended  December  31,  2004,  we received  payments  and recorded income  of  $2.0  million  under  our  tax  sharing  agreement  with  O'Sullivan Industries Holdings, Inc. ("O'Sullivan"),  compared to $3.1 million received and recorded in the corresponding  prior year period.  Future payments under the tax sharing  agreement will vary based on the level of O'Sullivan's  future earnings and are also dependent on O'Sullivan's  overall financial  condition and ability to pay. We cannot give any  assurances as to the amount or frequency of payment, if any, that we may receive from O'Sullivan in future periods.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  Our  provision for income taxes  reflects an effective  income tax rate of 37.8% for 2004 and 36.9% for 2003.  The increase in the  effective  tax rate for 2004, when compared to 2003, was the result of a favorable tax settlement during 2003, relating to prior year tax matters.  We  anticipate  that the effective tax rate for 2005 will be approximately 38.2%.  2003 COMPARED WITH 2002  NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES  Sales  increased  approximately  1.6% to $4,649.3  million in 2003 from $4,577.2 million in 2002. We had a 2% increase in comparable  company store sales.  These sales  increases  were possible  because of an increase in average store volume, despite a decrease in 2003 of 40 company stores, net of store openings.  Sales  to  our  dealer  outlets  and  other  sales,   including  retail  support operations,  were down for 2003,  when  compared  to 2002.  Sales to our  dealer outlets remained  substantially less than 10% of our total sales. Retail support operation  sales  were  generated  primarily  from  outside  sales of our repair centers,  AmeriLink,  and domestic and overseas  manufacturing.  The decrease in retail support operations sales from 2003 to 2002 was primarily the result of an overall decline in our AmeriLink commercial  installation  business, the closure of several of our manufacturing facilities in the third quarter of 2003, and the sale of AmeriLink in September 2003.  Sales in our wireless  platform  increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in 2003,  compared to 2002. This sales increase was due  primarily  to an  increase  in the average  selling  price of our  wireless handsets as a result of our continued  emphasis on national  carrier service and product  offerings with desirable  product  features and content,  such as color screens and cameras.  Sales in our  accessory  platform  increased  in  dollars,  but  decreased  as a percentage of net sales and operating  revenues in 2003,  compared to 2002.  The dollar  increase in this  platform was primarily the result of increases in both wireless power and imaging  accessories sales, but partially offset by a decline in sales of residential telephone and home entertainment accessories.  Sales in our modern home platform  decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating  revenues in 2003,  compared to 2002. These decreases were  primarily  due to decreased  sales of satellite  dishes and their  related installation services, in addition to desktop CPUs and monitors.  Sales  in our  personal  electronics  platform  increased  in  dollars  and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in 2003,  compared to 2002. These increases  were  driven  primarily  by sales  increases  in digital  cameras and camcorders,  micro  radio-controlled  cars  and,  to a lesser  extent,  wellness products  sold under our  LifewiseTM  brand.  This sales  increase was partially offset by decreased sales of educational toys.  Sales in our power platform increased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and  operating  revenues in 2003,  compared  to 2002.  This sales gain was primarily due to increased sales of general and special purpose batteries.  Sales in our service  platform  increased in dollars and as a percentage  of net sales and operating  revenues in 2003,  compared to 2002.  These  increases were primarily due to an increase in our wireless services sales.  Sales in our technical platform decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in 2003, compared to 2002. These decreases were primarily due to a decline in sales of bulk and packaged  wire, as well as sales decreases for technical components and hobby products.    GROSS PROFIT  Gross profit for 2003 was $2,315.7  million or 49.8% of net sales and  operating revenues,  compared  with  $2,238.3  million or 48.9% of net sales and operating revenues in 2002,  resulting  in a 3.5%  increase in gross profit and a 90 basis point increase in our gross profit  percentage.  These  increases over the prior year were primarily due to the following:  We  experienced  over $40.0  million in benefit from our supply chain vendor and strategic pricing initiatives. In connection with these initiatives, we utilized online reverse  auctions,  realized more favorable terms from vendors,  improved the impact of markdowns,  priced our products more  appropriately,  and utilized other techniques and incentives to optimize gross profit.  We also improved our  merchandise  mix within  platforms by increasing the sales mix for many of our higher margin products, while managing the mix down for many lower margin products.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  Our SG&A expense  increased  0.7% in dollars,  but decreased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to 37.4% for the year ended December 31, 2003, from 37.8% for the year ended  December  31, 2002.  The dollar  increase for 2003 was primarily due to an increase in both payroll and  commissions  and  advertising, partially  offset by a litigation  charge in 2002 related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit in California.  Payroll  expense  increased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating  revenues in 2003, due primarily to an increase in incentive pay based on increased earnings, as well as the 2.6% increase in company store sales.  Advertising  expense  increased in dollars and as a percentage  of net sales and operating revenues in 2003. These increases related to an increase in television advertising, as well as a decrease in contributions from vendors.  Rent expense  increased in dollars for 2003 due primarily to lease  renewals and relocations at higher rates,  as well as a slight  increase in the average store size. Rent expense as a percent of net sales and operating revenues remained the same for 2003,  compared to 2002,  due to fewer company stores and our continued rent reduction efforts.  Insurance  expense  increased  in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues in 2003, when compared to 2002.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  Depreciation  and amortization  expense  decreased $2.7 million dollars to $92.0 million and remained at 2.0% of net sales and  operating  revenues for both 2003 and 2002.  GAIN ON CONTRACT TERMINATION  RadioShack  and  Microsoft  mutually  agreed  during  2002  to  terminate  their agreement  and settle the  remaining  commitments  each had to one another.  The termination  of this agreement took effect at the start of the fourth quarter of 2002, upon satisfaction of several  contractual  obligations.  The net financial result was an $18.5 million gain (principally  cash received),  driven primarily by the settlement of a multi-year obligation Microsoft had to connect our stores with broadband capabilities.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  AmeriLink  was  acquired  in 1999 to  provide us with  residential  installation capabilities for the technologies and services offered in our retail stores.  As a result of continued  difficulties in the DTH business and a refocus during the fourth quarter of 2002 on our satellite installation  strategy,  together with a revised  cash  flow  projection  for  our  overall  installation   business,  we determined that the remaining  long-lived  assets associated with AmeriLink were impaired.  We compared the carrying value of these long-lived  assets with their fair value and determined  that the remaining  goodwill  balance of $8.1 million was impaired and we, therefore,  recorded an impairment charge of this amount in the accompanying 2002 Consolidated Statement of Income. As of December 31, 2002, there was no  remaining  goodwill  balance  on our  balance  sheet  relating  to AmeriLink. We sold AmeriLink in September 2003.    NET INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $22.9  million for 2003 versus $34.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $11.5 million or 33.4%.  Interest  expense  decreased to $35.7 million in 2003 from $43.4 million in 2002 primarily as a result of a reduction in the average debt outstanding  throughout 2003. In addition,  our interest rate swap instruments and the capitalization of $2.6  million  of  interest  expense  related  to the  construction  of our  new corporate  campus  also  lowered  overall  interest  expense  for the year ended December 31, 2003, when compared to the same prior year period.  Interest income increased over 42% to $12.8 million in 2003 from $9.0 million in 2002, primarily as a result of a $5.6 million increase in interest received from income tax settlements in 2003, as compared to 2002.  OTHER INCOME, NET  In July 2003, we received payment of $15.7 million  resulting from the favorable settlement of a lawsuit we had previously  filed. We recorded this settlement in the  third  quarter  of 2003 as  other  income  of $10.7  million,  net of legal expenses of $5.0 million paid as a result of the lawsuit.  In September 2003 we sold our wholly-owned subsidiary AmeriLink to INSTALLS inc, LLC in a  cash-for-stock  sale,  resulting in a loss of $1.8  million,  based on AmeriLink's book value, which was recorded in other income.  For the year ended  December 31, 2003,  we received and recorded  income of $3.1 million owed to us under a tax sharing  agreement with  O'Sullivan,  compared to $33.9 million received and recorded in the  corresponding  prior year period. In the second quarter of 2002, we received and recorded  income of $27.7 million in partial settlement of amounts owed to us under this tax sharing agreement.  This partial  settlement  followed  a ruling  in our favor by an  arbitration  panel. Future payments under the tax sharing  agreement will vary based on the level of O'Sullivan's  future  earnings and are also  dependent on  O'Sullivan's  overall financial condition and ability to pay.  During the second half of 2002,  we received two payments  totaling $6.2 million relating to quarterly payments under the tax sharing agreement with O'Sullivan.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  Our  provision for income taxes  reflects an effective  income tax rate of 36.9% for 2003 and 38.0% for 2002.  The decrease in the  effective  tax rate for 2003, when compared to 2002, was the result of a favorable tax  settlement  related to prior year tax matters.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2003, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (the "FASB") issued revised FIN 46,  "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of  Accounting  Research  Bulletin  No. 51" ("FIN  46R").  FIN 46R  requires the consolidation  of an entity in which an  enterprise  absorbs a  majority  of the entity's expected losses,  receives a majority of the entity's expected residual returns,  or both,  as a result of  ownership,  contractual  or other  financial interests  in the entity  (variable  interest  entities or  "VIEs").  FIN 46R is applicable  for financial  statements of public  entities that have interests in VIEs or  potential  VIEs  referred to as  special-purpose  entities  for periods ending after December 31, 2003.  Applications  by public  entities for all other types of entities are required in financial  statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. The application of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on our results of operations,  financial  position or liquidity,  and does not apply to our dealer outlets.  In December 2004, the FASB issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R "Share-Based Payment." SFAS No. 123R establishes standards for the  accounting  for  transactions  in  which an  entity  exchanges  its  equity instruments  for  goods  or  services.   This  Statement  focuses  primarily  on accounting  for  transactions  in which an entity obtains  employee  services in share-based payment transactions.  SFAS No. 123R requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the historical  financial statements as services are performed. Prior to SFAS 123R, only certain pro forma disclosures  of fair value were  required.  We will adopt the provisions of SFAS No.  123R  beginning  with the  third  quarter  of 2005.  We intend to elect the modified  prospective  transition  method,  which will require that we recognize compensation  expense for all new and unvested  share-based  payment awards from the  effective  date.  Based on our  preliminary  analysis of SFAS No. 123R,  we anticipate the after-tax impact of adoption on our results of operations for the six months ending  December 31, 2005, will be an expense of  approximately  $6.8 million.   During fiscal year 2004, we adopted  Emerging  Issues Task Force  ("EITF") Issue No.  03-10,  "Application  of Issue No. 02-16 by  Resellers to Sales  Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers,"  which amends EITF No. 02-16.  According to the amended guidance, if certain criteria are met,  consideration received by a reseller in the form of reimbursement  from a vendor for honoring the vendor's sales incentives  offered directly to consumers (i.e.,  manufacturers'  coupons) should not be recorded as a reduction  of the cost of the  reseller's  purchases from the vendor.  The adoption of EITF No. 03-10 did not  materially  impact our results of operations, financial position or liquidity in fiscal year 2004.  In November  2004,  the FASB issued  SFAS No.  151,  "Inventory  Costs." The new Statement  amends  Accounting  Research  Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4,  "Inventory Pricing,"  to clarify  the  accounting  for  abnormal  amounts of idle  facility expense,  freight,  handling costs, and wasted material.  SFAS 151 requires that these items be recognized as current-period charges and requires that allocation of fixed  production  overhead to the cost of  conversion be based on the normal capacity of the  production  facilities.  This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not expect adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY A summary of cash flows from  operating,  investing and financing  activities is outlined in the table below.                            Year Ended December 31,                        ---------------------------- (In millions)            2004      2003      2002 - -------------          --------  --------  -------- Operating activities   $ 352.5   $ 651.9   $ 521.6 Investing activities    (290.2)   (188.9)    (99.0) Financing activities    (259.1)   (274.8)   (377.5)  Cash Flow - Operating Activities  In 2004,  cash flows  provided by  operating  activities  were  $352.5  million, compared to $651.9 million and $521.6 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.  During the year ended  December  31,  2004,  increases  in accounts  receivable, consisting  primarily  of amounts due from our various  vendors and  third-party service  providers,  used  $53.0  million  in cash,  compared  to $17.2  million provided  in the  prior  year.  An  increase  in  vendor  and  service  provider receivables due to an increase in sales of wireless  services resulted in a cash usage by accounts receivable in 2004, while cash provided in 2003 was the result of reductions of vendor and service provider  receivables and dealer receivables from increased collections and lower sales of satellite television hardware.  During the year ended  December  31, 2004,  increases  in inventory  used $234.2 million in cash,  compared to $202.3 million  provided during 2003. The increase in inventory since December 31, 2003, was primarily the result of abnormally low inventory  levels  during  the  holiday  selling  season of 2003 and  additional inventory  purchased to stock the new kiosk locations  during the fourth quarter of 2004.  Typically,  our annual cash  requirements  for pre-seasonal  inventory  build-up range  between  $200  million and $400  million.  The funding  required for this build-up comes primarily from cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and operating  revenues.  We had $437.9  million in cash and cash  equivalents as of December 31, 2004, as a resource for our funding  needs.  Additional  capital is available  under our $600 million  dollar  commercial  paper  program,  which is supported  by a bank  credit  facility  that could be  utilized in the event the commercial  paper  market is  unavailable  to us. We currently do not expect the commercial  paper market to become  unavailable  to us nor that; we will need to utilize our credit facility. As of December 31, 2004, we had no commercial paper outstanding, nor had we utilized any of our credit facility.  During  the year  ended  December  31,  2004,  $161.8  million  more in cash was provided by accounts payable as a result of effective management of our payables in 2004 and an increase in inventory levels, when compared to the prior year.   Cash Flow - Investing Activities  Cash used in investing activities in 2004 was $290.2 million, compared to $188.9 million  and  $99.0  million  used  in  2003  and  2002,  respectively.  Capital expenditures  for  2004 and  2003  increased  over  2002,  primarily  due to the continued  construction  of our new  corporate  campus in 2004 and  2003,  while capital expenditures for 2002 were primarily for our retail store expansions and remodels and  information  systems  upgrades.  We also had capital  expenditures relating  to retail  stores and  information  systems in both 2004 and 2003.  We anticipate  that  our  capital   expenditure   requirements  for  2005  will  be approximately  $200.0 million to $240.0 million.  Although capital  expenditures for 2005 will be about the same as 2004,  expenditures  will occur in  different areas.  Company-operated  store remodels and relocations,  approximately 150 new Sprint kiosks and updated  information  systems  account for the majority of our anticipated  2005  capital  expenditures.  See  further  discussion  on our  new corporate  headquarters  below in the  section  titled  "Capital  Structure  and Financial Condition." During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Wireless Retail, Inc. ("WRI"). These assets included  wireless  kiosks and inventory  located within SAM'S CLUB retail  locations.  The total  purchase  price was $59.1  million.  See  further discussion  on our  SAM'S  CLUB  kiosk  business  above  in the  section  titled "Overview."  As of December  31,  2004,  we had $437.9  million in cash and cash equivalents. These cash and cash equivalents, along with cash generated from our net sales and operating revenues and, if necessary,  from our credit facilities, are available to fund future capital expenditure needs.  Cash Flow - Financing Activities  Cash used in financing activities was $259.1 million in 2004, compared to $274.8 million  and  $377.5  million  in 2003 and 2002,  respectively.  We used  $251.1 million for the  repurchase  of our common stock in 2004 and $286.2  million and $329.9  million  for the  repurchase  of our  common  stock  in 2003  and  2002, respectively.  Repurchases of common stock were made under our share  repurchase and employee stock programs.  See the further discussion of our stock repurchase programs  below  in  the  section  titled   "Capital   Structure  and  Financial Condition." The 2004, 2003 and 2002 stock  repurchases  were partially funded by $85.8 million, $51.5 million and $49.6 million, respectively,  received from the sale of  treasury  stock  to  employee  benefit  plans  and  from  stock  option exercises.  The balance of capital to  repurchase  shares was obtained from cash generated  from  operations.  We  received  $32.3  million  from  the  sale  and lease-back of our former corporate  technology center building during the second quarter of 2002. This transaction was recorded as a financing  obligation due to responsibilities which we retain during the lease period. Additionally,  our net borrowings  decreased  $54.1 million in 2004,  compared to a slight  increase in 2003 and a decrease of $89.7  million in 2002.  Dividends  paid,  net of tax, in 2004, 2003 and 2002 amounted to $39.7 million,  $40.8 million and $39.8 million, respectively.  This  change  in  dividends  paid over the last  three  years was affected  by a  dividend  per  share  increase  and  yearly  share  repurchases, resulting in fewer shares outstanding.  Free Cash Flow  Our free cash  flow,  defined  as cash  flows  from  operating  activities  less dividends paid and additions to property, plant and equipment, was $83.4 million in 2004, $421.5 million in 2003 and $375.0 million in 2002. The decrease in free cash flow in 2004 was the result of a cash usage in working capital  components, primarily  inventory.  The  increase in free cash flow between 2002 and 2003 was the result of supply chain  initiatives,  including a greater  focus on reducing inventory  weeks-of-supply.  We expect free cash flow to be  approximately  $200 million to $240 million in 2005.  The increase from 2004 is based  substantially on the anticipated  increase in cash generated from working  capital,  primarily from inventory reductions.  We believe free cash flow is an  appropriate  indication  of our ability to fund share  repurchases,  repay maturing debt, change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that management  believes will enhance  shareholder  value.  The comparable  financial  measure  to  free  cash  flow  under  generally  accepted accounting principles is cash flows from operating activities, which were $352.5 million in 2004,  $651.9  million in 2003 and $521.6  million in 2002. We do not intend the presentation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial  measure,  to be considered in isolation or as a substitute  for measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP.   The following table is a reconciliation of cash flows from operating  activities to free cash flow.                                                 Year Ended December 31,                                              ---------------------------- (In millions)                                  2004      2003      2002 - -------------                                --------  --------  -------- Net cash provided by operating activities    $ 352.5   $ 651.9   $ 521.6 Less:  Additions to property, plant and equipment    229.4     189.6     106.8  Dividends paid                                 39.7      40.8      39.8                                              --------  --------  -------- Free cash flow                               $  83.4   $ 421.5   $ 375.0                                              ========  ========  ========  CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION We consider our financial  structure  and  condition to be sound.  We had $437.9 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2004, as a resource for our funding needs.  Additionally,  borrowings are available under our $600.0 million commercial paper program,  which is supported by bank credit  facilities and can be utilized in the event the commercial paper market becomes  unavailable to us. However, we currently expect that the commercial paper market would be available to us,  thus we do not expect to utilize our credit  facilities.  As of December 31, 2004, we had no commercial paper outstanding and had not utilized our credit facilities.  Debt Obligations  Debt Ratings:  Our debt is considered  investment  grade by the rating agencies. Below are the agencies' latest ratings by category,  as well as their respective current outlook for the ratings.                                                          Standard                 Category                     Moody's   and Poor's  Fitch                 --------                     -------   ----------  -----                 Senior unsecured debt         Baa1      A-         BBB+                 Commercial paper              P-2       A-2        F2                 Outlook                       Stable    Stable     Stable  Factors  that can impact our credit  ratings  include  changes in our  operating performance,  the economic  environment,  conditions  in the retail and consumer electronics  industries,  our  financial  position  and changes in our  business strategy.  We do not currently foresee any reasonable  circumstances under which our credit  ratings would be  significantly  downgraded.  If a downgrade were to occur,  it could  adversely  impact,  among other things,  our future  borrowing costs,  access to capital  markets,  vendor financing terms and future new store occupancy costs.  Our  senior  unsecured  debt  primarily  consists  of two  issuances  of 10-year long-term notes and an issuance of medium-term notes.  Long-Term  Notes:  We have a $300.0  million debt shelf  registration  statement which became  effective in August 1997. In August 1997, we issued $150.0 million of 10-year unsecured long-term notes under this shelf registration. The interest rate on the notes is 6.95% per annum with  interest  payable on  September 1 and March 1 of each year. These notes are due September 1, 2007.  On May 11, 2001, we issued  $350.0  million of 10-year 7 3/8% notes in a private offering  to  initial  purchasers  who in turn  offered  the notes to  qualified institutional  buyers under SEC Rule 144A. The annual interest rate on the notes is 7.375% per annum with  interest  payable  on  November  15 and May 15 of each year.  The notes mature on May 15, 2011.  In August 2001,  under the terms of an exchange  offering filed with the SEC, we exchanged  substantially  all of these notes for a similar amount of publicly  registered notes.  Because no additional debt was issued in the exchange  offering,  the net effect of this  exchange was that no  additional  debt was issued,  and  substantially  all of the notes were registered with the SEC.  During  the  third  quarter  of 2001,  we  entered  into an  interest  rate swap agreement with  underlying  notional amount of $110.5 million with a maturity in 2007. In June and August 2003,  we entered into  interest  rate swap  agreements with  underlying  notional  amounts of debt of $100.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively,  and both with  maturities  in May 2011.  These swaps  effectively convert a portion  of our  long-term  fixed  rate debt to a  variable  rate.  We entered into these  agreements  to balance our fixed versus  floating  rate debt portfolio to continue to take  advantage  of lower  short-term  interest  rates. Under these agreements,  we have contracted to pay a variable rate of LIBOR plus a markup and to receive a fixed rate of 6.95% for the swap  entered into in 2001 and  7.375%  for the  swaps  entered  into in  2003.  We have  designated  these agreements as fair value hedging instruments.   Medium-Term  Notes: We also issued, in various amounts and on various dates from December 1997 through September 1999,  medium-term notes totaling $150.0 million under the shelf registration described above. At December 31, 2004, $5.0 million of these notes remained outstanding. The interest rate at December 31, 2004, for the outstanding $5.0 million in medium-term notes was 6.42%.  These notes have a maturity in 2008. As of December 31, 2004, there was no availability  under this shelf registration.  Available Financing  Commercial  Paper:  We have  access  to  short-term  debt  instruments,  such as commercial  paper  issuances,  which are available to supplement  our short-term financing  needs.  The commercial  paper program,  when utilized,  has a typical maturity  of 90 days or  less.  The  amount  of  commercial  paper  that  can be outstanding  is limited to a maximum of the unused  portion of our $600  million revolving credit facilities described in more detail below. We currently have no commercial paper outstanding.  Credit  Facilities:  In the second  quarter of 2004,  we replaced  our  existing $300.0 million 364-day  revolving  credit  facility with a new five-year  credit facility  maturing in June 2009. The terms of this revolving credit facility are substantially  similar  to the  previous  facility.  This  credit  facility,  in addition to our existing $300.0 million five-year credit facility, which expires in June 2007,  will support our  commercial  paper  borrowings  and is otherwise available for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2004, there were no outstanding  borrowings under these credit facilities.  Our outstanding debt and bank  syndicated  credit  facilities  have customary  covenants,  and we were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2004.  Management  believes  that our  present  ability to borrow is  greater  than our established  credit  lines  and  long-term  debt in  place.  However,  if market conditions change and sales were to dramatically decline or we could not control operating costs, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Additionally, if a scenario as described  above  occurred,  it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit  ratings,  thereby  increasing  our  borrowing  costs,  or even causing a  reduction  in or  elimination  of our  access to debt  and/or  equity markets.  Dividends  We have paid common stock cash  dividends  for 18 years.  On September 24, 2004, our Board of Directors  declared an annual  dividend of $0.25 per common  share. The  dividend  was paid on  December  20,  2004,  to  shareholders  of record on December 1, 2004. The dividend  payment of $39.7 million was funded from cash on hand.  Operating Leases  We use operating leases, primarily for our retail locations and two distribution centers, to lower our capital requirements.  Share Repurchases  We repurchased  6.9 million shares of our common stock for $210.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2004, under our share repurchase program.  We  intend  to  execute  share  repurchases  from  time to time in order to take advantage of attractive  share price levels,  as determined by  management.  The timing  and  terms  of these  transactions  depend  on  market  conditions,  our liquidity and other  considerations.  In February  2003,  our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase  program for 15.0 million shares,  which was in addition to our 25.0  million  share  repurchase  program that was  completed  during the second  quarter of 2003.  At February  18, 2005,  there were 2.5 million  shares available to be repurchased  under this 15.0 million share  repurchase  program. The 15.0 million  share  repurchase  program has no  expiration  date and allows shares to be repurchased in the open market.  On February 25, 2005, our Board of Directors  approved a new share  repurchase  program.  This new  program  allows management to repurchase up to $250 million in open market  purchases and has no expiration  date. We anticipate  that we will  repurchase,  under our authorized repurchase  programs,  between  $200.0  million and $250.0 million of our common stock during 2005. The funding required for these share repurchase programs will come from cash generated from net sales and operating revenues and cash and cash equivalents.  We will also  repurchase  shares in the open  market to offset the sales of shares to our employee benefit plans.  Construction of Corporate Headquarters  In the fourth quarter of 2001 and the second quarter of 2002, we sold our former corporate headquarters buildings.  We entered into sale-leaseback  agreements in which our former corporate headquarters' land and buildings were sold and leased back to us. These arrangements  provided us with the necessary time to construct our new  headquarters,  which we began  partially  occupying  during  the fourth quarter of 2004. Our total campus costs are estimated to be $261.5 million, with completion expected during the first quarter of 2005.   Capitalization  The following table sets forth information about our capitalization at the dates indicated.

Long-term debt as a percentage of total  capitalization  decreased in 2004 due to a decrease in long-term  debt,  as current  maturities of our  outstanding  notes moved to the short-term  debt  classification,  as well as the  increase  in equity of $152.8 million from 2003.  Treasury Stock  On December 11, 2003,  our Board of Directors  approved the  retirement  of 45.0 million shares of our common stock held as treasury stock. These shares returned to the status of authorized and unissued. See our 2003 Consolidated Statement of Stockholders' Equity for additional details of this transaction.  Contractual and Credit Commitments  The  following  tables,  as  well  as  the  information  contained  in  Note 7 - "Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities" to our "Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements," provide a summary of our various contractual commitments,  debt and interest repayment requirements, and available credit lines.

The  majority of these  contingent  liabilities relate to various  lease  obligations  arising from leases that were assigned to CompUSA,  Inc. as part of the sale of our  Computer  City,  Inc.  subsidiary  to CompUSA,  Inc. in August 1998. In the event CompUSA or the other  assignees,  as applicable, are unable to fulfill their obligations, we would be responsible for rent due under the leases.  Our rent exposure  from the  remaining  undiscounted lease  commitments  with no  projected  sublease  income is  approximately  $154 million.  However,  we have no  reason  to  believe  that  CompUSA  or the other assignees will not fulfill their obligations under these leases or that we would be unable to sublet the properties;  consequently,  we do not believe there will be a material  impact on our financial  statements from any fulfillment of these contingencies.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Other than the operating  leases described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, transactions, or special purpose entities.  INFLATION Inflation has not significantly impacted us over the past three years. We do not expect  inflation  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  our  operations  in the foreseeable future,  unless international events substantially affect the global economy.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated  financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals ("GAAP") in the United States. The application of GAAP  requires us to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the reported values of assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements,  the reported  amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting  period,  and the related  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  The use of estimates is pervasive  throughout our financial  statements and is affected by management judgment and uncertainties.  Our estimates,  assumptions and judgments are based on  historical  experience,  current  market  trends and other  factors  that we believe to be relevant and  reasonable  at the time the  consolidated  financial statements are prepared.  We continually  evaluate the information  used to make these  estimates as our business and the economic  environment  changes.  Actual results may differ  materially from these estimates under different  assumptions or conditions.  In the Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements,  we describe our significant accounting  policies  used  in the  preparation  of the  consolidated  financial statements. The accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are: revenue  recognition;  inventory valuation under the cost method;  estimation of reserves and valuation  allowances,  specifically related to insurance,  tax and legal  contingencies;  and  valuation  of  long-lived  assets  and  intangibles, including goodwill.  We consider an  accounting  policy or estimate to be critical if it requires our most  difficult,  subjective  or  complex  judgments,  and  is  material  to the portrayal of our financial condition,  changes in financial condition or results of  operations.  The  selection,  application  and  disclosure  of our  critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.   Revenue Recognition: Our revenue is derived principally from the sale of private label and  third-party  branded  products and services to consumers.  Revenue is recognized,  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product  returns,  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.  Certain products, such as wireless telephones and satellite systems, require the customer to use the services of a third-party  service provider.  In most cases, the third-party service provider pays us a fee or commission for obtaining a new customer,  as well as a monthly recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement  between the service  provider and the  customer.  Fee or commission revenue,  net of a reserve for  estimated  service  deactivations,  is generally recognized at the time the customer is accepted as a subscriber of a third-party service provider.  Estimated  product  refunds and returns,  service plan  deactivations,  residual revenue and commission revenue  adjustments are based on historical  information pertaining to these items.  If actual results differ from these estimates due to various factors,  the amount of revenue recorded could be materially affected. A 10% difference in our reserves for the estimates noted above would have affected net sales and operating  revenues by  approximately  $1.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.  Inventory  Valuation:   Our  inventory  consists  primarily  of  finished  goods available for sale at our retail  locations or within our  distribution  centers and is recorded  at the lower of average  cost or  expected  sales price  (i.e., market value).  The cost  components  recorded  within  inventory are the vendor invoice cost and certain allocated external and internal freight,  distribution, warehousing  and other costs  required to  transport  the  merchandise  from the vendor to the point-of-sale, usually a store.  Typically,  the  market  value  of  our  inventory  is  higher  than  its  cost. Determination of the market value may be very complex and, therefore, requires a high  degree  of  judgment.  In order  for  management  to make the  appropriate determination  of market  value,  the following  items are commonly  considered: inventory  turnover  statistics,  current selling prices,  seasonality  factors, consumer  trends,  competitive  pricing,  performance  of  similar  products  or accessories,  planned  promotional  incentives,  and estimated  costs to sell or dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions.  If the  calculated  market  value is  determined  to be less  than the  recorded average cost, a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item.  Differences  between  management  estimates  and actual  performance  and pricing of our merchandise could result in inventory valuations that differ from the  amount  recorded  at the  financial  statement  date,  and could also cause fluctuations  in the amount of recorded cost of products  sold.  If our estimates  regarding  market value are  inaccurate or changes in consumer demand affect  certain  products in an unforeseen  manner,  we may be exposed to material losses or gains in excess of our established  valuation  reserve.  Estimation  of Reserves  and  Valuation  Allowances:  The amount of liability we record for claims related to insurance,  tax and legal contingencies requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We use our past history and experience,  as well as other specific circumstances surrounding  these claims,  in evaluating the amount of liability that we should record. As additional  information  becomes  available,  we assess the potential liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate. These revisions could materially  impact our results of operations and financial position or liquidity.  We are insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation, property and other liability claims, with deductibles up to $0.5 million per occurrence. This insurance  coverage  limits our  exposure for any  catastrophic  claims that may arise  above  the  deductible.  We  also  have  a  self-insured  health  program administered  by a third  party  covering  the  majority of our  employees  that participate  in our health  insurance  programs.  We estimate  the amount of our reserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reporting period. This estimate is based on information  provided by either an independent actuarial  firm or third  party.  The  information  includes  historical  claims experience,  demographic  factors,  severity factors,  and other factors we deem relevant.  A 10% change in our  insurance  reserves at December 31, 2004,  would have affected net income by approximately $7.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.  As of December 31, 2004,  actual losses had not exceeded our expectations.   We are  subject to  periodic  audits  from  multiple  domestic  and  foreign tax authorities related to income tax, sales and use tax, personal property tax, and other forms of taxes.  These audits examine our tax positions,  timing of income and deductions, and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions. As part of our evaluation of these tax issues, we establish reserves in our consolidated financial  statements  based on our estimate of current  probable tax exposures. Depending  on the  nature of the tax  issue,  it could be  subject to audit over several  years;  therefore,  our  estimated  reserve  balances  might  exist for multiple years before an issue is resolved by the taxing authority.  Additionally,  we are involved in legal  proceedings and governmental  inquiries associated  with  employment and other matters.  A reserve has been  established based on our best estimates of the potential  liability in these  matters.  This estimate has been developed in  consultation  with in-house and outside  counsel and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies.  Although  we believe  that our tax and legal  reserves  are based on  reasonable judgments  and  estimates,  actual  results  could differ which may expose us to material  gains  or  losses  in  future  periods.  These  actual  results  could materially  affect our effective tax rate,  earnings,  deferred tax balances and cash in the period of resolution.  Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles,  Including Goodwill:  Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment,  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that the  carrying  value of the assets contained in our financial statements may not be recoverable.  Our evaluation of potential  impairment  involves comparing the carrying value of the asset to the estimated  fair value of the asset.  The fair value is  determined by estimating the future  undiscounted  cash flows that the asset will  generate.  If the fair value  calculated is less than the carrying  value,  we calculate the discounted cash flows of the asset and record an impairment  loss. The  impairment  loss is the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset and is recorded  as a charge to  earnings  in the period  the  impairment  occurs.  The carrying  value of the asset is  adjusted  to the new  carrying  value,  and any subsequent  increases  in fair value are not  recorded.  Additionally,  if it is determined  that the  estimated  remaining  useful  life of the asset  should be decreased,  the  periodic  depreciation  expense  is  adjusted  based on the new carrying value of the asset.  The  impairment   calculation  requires  us  to  apply  judgment  and  estimates concerning  the future cash flows,  strategic  plans,  useful life and  discount rates. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and  assumptions, we may be exposed to  additional  impairment  charges which could be material to our results of operations.  We have acquired goodwill and other separately identifiable  intangibles related to business  acquisitions that have occurred during the current and prior years. The  original  valuation  of  these  intangibles  is  typically  performed  by a third-party  appraiser  and may  include  the use of  estimates  that we provide concerning future  profitability,  cash flows and other judgmental  factors.  We review our goodwill and intangible  balances on an annual basis,  typically near our fiscal year end, and whenever  events or changes in  circumstances  indicate the carrying  value of the goodwill or  intangibles  might exceed their  current fair value.  The determination of fair value is based on various valuation techniques such as discounted  cash flow and other  comparable  market  analyses.  These  valuation techniques  require  us to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  regarding  future profitability,  industry factors, planned strategic initiatives,  discount rates and others factors.  If actual results or performance of certain  business units are different  from our  estimates,  we may be exposed to an  impairment  charge related to our  goodwill or  intangibles.  The total value of our  goodwill  and intangibles at December 31, 2004, was $46.7 million.   FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS  Matters   discussed  in  MD&A  and  in  other  parts  of  this  report   include forward-looking  statements  within the meaning of the federal  securities laws. These matters include  statements  concerning  management's plans and objectives relating to our operations or economic performance and related  assumptions.  We specifically  disclaim  any duty to update any of the  information  set forth in this  report,   including  any   forward-looking   statements.   Forward-looking statements  are made based on  management's  current  expectations  and  beliefs concerning  future  events  and,  therefore,  involve  a  number  of  risks  and uncertainties.  Management  cautions  that  forward-looking  statements  are not guarantees,  and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual  results of  operations or financial  condition to differ  materially include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following factors.  General Business Factors  o    Changes in national or regional U.S. economic  conditions,  including,  but      not limited to, recessionary or inflationary trends,  equity market levels,      consumer credit availability,  interest rates, consumers' disposable income      and  spending  levels,  continued  rise of oil  prices,  job  security  and      unemployment, and overall consumer confidence; o    changes  in the  amount  and  degree of  promotional  intensity  exerted by      current  competitors and potential new competition  from both retail stores      and alternative  methods or channels of  distribution,  such as e-commerce,      telephone shopping services and mail order; o    any potential  tariffs  imposed on products  that we import from China,  as      well as the potential  strengthening  of China's  currency against the U.S.      dollar; o    continuing  terrorist  activities in the U.S., as well as the international      war on terrorism; o    the  disruption  of  international,  national  or  regional  transportation      systems; o    the lack of availability or access to sources of inventory; o    changes in the financial  markets that would reduce or eliminate our access      to longer term capital or short-term credit availability; o    the imposition of new  restrictions  or regulations  regarding the products      and/or services we sell or changes in tax rules and regulations  applicable      to us; and o    the occurrence of severe weather  events or natural  disasters  which could      significantly   damage  or  destroy  outlets  or  prohibit  consumers  from      traveling  to our retail  locations,  especially  during  the peak  holiday      shopping season.  RadioShack Specific Factors  o    The inability to  successfully  execute our solutions  strategy to dominate      cost-effective  solutions to meet everyone's routine  electronics needs and      families' distinct electronics wants; o    the failure to differentiate ourselves as an electronics specialty retailer      in the U.S. marketplace; o    the failure to maintain or increase the level of sales in our  non-wireless      business categories; o    any  reductions or changes in the growth rate of the wireless  industry and      changes in the wireless  communications  industry  dynamics,  including the      effects of industry consolidation; o    the inability to create,  maintain or renew profitable contracts or execute      business  plans with  providers of  third-party  branded  products and with      service providers relating to cellular and PCS telephones which could cause      the reduction or elimination of our commissions as well as residual income; o    the presence or absence of new services or products and product features in      the  merchandise  categories we sell and  unexpected  changes in our actual      merchandise sales mix; o    the  inability  to  effectively  manage our  inventory  levels in a rapidly      changing marketplace; o    the inability to attract, retain and grow an effective management team in a      dynamic  environment or changes in the cost or  availability  of a suitable      workforce to manage and support our operating strategies; o    the  inability to optimize and execute our strategic  plans,  including our      retail services operations and other sales channels; o    the existence of contingent lease  obligations  related to our discontinued      retail operations  arising from an assignee's or a sub-lessee's  failure to      fulfill its lease  commitments,  or from our inability to identify suitable      sub-lessees for vacant facilities; o    the  inability  to  successfully   identify  and  analyze  emerging  growth      opportunities in the areas of strategic business  alliances,  acquisitions,      licensing  opportunities,   new  markets,  non-store  sales  channels,  and      innovative products; and o    the inability to successfully  identify and enter into  relationships  with      developers of new  technologies or the failure of these new technologies to      be adopted by the market.   ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  At December 31, 2004, we did not have any derivative instruments that materially increased  our  exposure to market risks for interest  rates,  foreign  currency rates,  commodity  prices or other market  price risks,  other than the interest rate  swaps  noted  in our  MD&A  discussion.  We do  not  use  derivatives  for speculative purposes.  Our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in  short-term  interest rates.  Interest rate risk exists with respect to our net investment at December 31, 2004, of $86.2 million,  comprised of fluctuating  short-term investments of $386.2 million and offset by $300.0 million of  indebtedness  which,  because of our interest  rate swaps,  effectively  bears  interest at  short-term  floating rates.  A  hypothetical  increase  of 100  basis  points  in the  interest  rate applicable  to this  floating-rate  net  exposure  would result in a decrease in annual net interest expense of $0.9 million.  This assumption  assumes no change in the net principal balance.  We also  manage  our  portfolio  of fixed rate debt to reduce  our  exposure  to interest  rate  changes.  The fair  value of our fixed  rate  long-term  debt is sensitive to long-term interest rate changes. Interest rate changes would result in  increases  or  decreases  in the fair  value of our debt due to  differences between market interest rates and rates at the inception of the debt obligation. Based on a hypothetical  immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December  31,  2004 and 2003,  the fair value of our fixed rate  long-term  debt would  decrease  $24.2  million  and  $28.7  million,  respectively.  Based on a hypothetical  immediate 100 basis point  decrease in interest  rates at December 31,  2004 and  2003,  the fair  value of our fixed  rate  long-term  debt  would increase by $25.7 million and $30.6  million,  respectively.  Regarding the fair value of our fixed rate debt,  changes in  interest  rates have no impact on our consolidated financial statements.  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
