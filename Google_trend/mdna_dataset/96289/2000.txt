ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND         FINANCIAL CONDITION ("MD&A").  FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS With the  exception of  historical  information,  the matters  discussed in MD&A contain forward-looking  statements that involve various risks and uncertainties and are indicated by words such as "anticipates," "expects," "believes," "will," "should," "could," and similar words and phrases. Factors that could cause Tandy Corporation's  ("Tandy" or the "Company")  actual  results to differ  materially from management's  projections,  forecasts,  estimates and expectations include, but are not limited to, the following:  o   changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity exerted by current     competitors  and  potential  new  competition  from both  retail  stores and     alternative  methods or channels of  distribution,  such as  e-commerce  and     telephone shopping services and mail order; o   changes in general U.S. or regional U.S. economic conditions including,     but not limited to, consumer credit availability, interest rates, inflation,     personal discretionary spending levels and consumer sentiment about the     economy in general; o   the inability to successfully implement, market and execute the     RadioShack.comSM  website and its coordination with RadioShack retail     outlets; o   the presence or absence of new services or products and product  features in     the  merchandise  categories  RadioShack  sells and changes in  RadioShack's     actual merchandise sales mix; o   the inability to negotiate  profitable  contracts or execute  business plans     with   providers  of  such   services  as  cellular   and  PCS   telephones,     direct-to-home satellite, Internet access and high-speed bandwidth; o   the inability to collect the level of anticipated residual revenues,     commissions and bounties for products and services sold by RadioShack; o   the inability to successfully implement and execute Tandy's strategic     alliances with Thomson Multimedia and/or Microsoft Corporation; o   lack of  availability  or access to sources of supply  inventory (as a large     importer  of  consumer  electronic  products  from Asia,  unfavorable  trade     imbalances could negatively affect Tandy); o   the inability to retain and grow an effective  management  team in a dynamic     environment or changes in the cost or  availability of a suitable work force     to manage and support Tandy's service-driven operating strategies; o   the imposition of new restrictions or regulations regarding the sale of     products and/or services Tandy sells or changes in tax rules and regulations     applicable to Tandy; o   the  inability  to  successfully  coordinate  AmeriLink Corporation and  its     operations  with  RadioShack;  or o   the adoption rate and market demand for high speed Internet and other     Internet-related services.  The  United  States  retail  industry  and  the  specialty  retail  industry  in particular are dynamic by nature and have undergone significant changes over the past several years.  Tandy's ability to anticipate and  successfully  respond to continuing challenges is key to achieving its expectations.  STOCK SPLIT On May 20, 1999,  Tandy's  Board of Directors  declared a  two-for-one  split of Tandy common stock,  payable on June 21, 1999.  All  references to the number of shares (other than common stock issued or outstanding  on the 1998  Consolidated Balance Sheet and the 1997 and 1998  Consolidated  Statements  of  Stockholders' Equity),  per share amounts,  cash dividends and any other  reference to shares, unless otherwise noted, have been adjusted to reflect the split on a retroactive basis.  Previously awarded stock options,  restricted stock awards and all other agreements payable in Tandy's common stock have also been adjusted or amended to reflect the split.

The RadioShack segment consists of the  RadioShack  retail  division,  including  RadioShack.com,  and  the  retail division's support operations,  including its manufacturing  facilities,  repair centers and  AmeriLink  Corporation  ("AmeriLink").  The  Computer  City segment consists of Computer City,  Inc. ("CCI" or "Computer  City"),  which was sold to CompUSA Inc.  ("CompUSA") on August 31, 1998. The closed units segment  includes all Tandy stores and non-retail  units which were part of the store closure plan announced in December 1996 (see "1996 Business Restructuring" below).  Corporate administration and other includes corporate units which serve all areas of Tandy and also income or expenses  which were not  allocated to RadioShack or Computer City.    The  following  table  summarizes  net sales and operating  revenues,  operating profit (loss) and assets for Tandy's reportable segments. Consolidated operating profit is reconciled to Tandy's income before income taxes.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  1999 COMPARED WITH 1998 - -----------------------  NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES  Consolidated  net sales and  operating  revenues  decreased  13.8% from $4,787.9 million in 1998 to $4,126.2  million in 1999;  this  decrease  was  attributable primarily  to the  sale  of  Computer  City  to  CompUSA  on  August  31,  1998. Consolidated  comparable  store sales for 1999 are not  meaningful,  due to this sale.  RadioShack Segment  RadioShack had an outstanding  year with  RadioShack's  overall sales increasing 14.9% to $4,126.2  million in 1999 from $3,591.2  million in 1998, due primarily to a 12.2% comparable  company-owned  store sales gain and the opening of 48 new stores,  net of store  closures.  Additionally,  sales to  RadioShack's  dealers experienced  strong growth  throughout the year.  RadioShack's  comparable store sales  increase  was  driven  primarily  by  increased  sales of  communications products, prepaid wireless airtime and sales of audio and video equipment, which includes  "direct-to-home"  satellite systems and services ("DTH").  A continued healthy economy and a strong retail consumer  electronics  industry are expected to result in a positive  comparable  store  sales gain for 2000.  The  following table  summarizes  RadioShack's  retail sales breakdown by class of products and each class as a percent of total  RadioShack  retail  sales  (excluding  outside sales from retail support operations):                                             Percent of RadioShack Retail Sales                                                Year Ended December 31,                                    ---------------------------------------------  Class of Products                     1999        1998        1997        1996 - -----------------                   --------    --------    --------    -------- Communications                         29.3%       28.5%       27.5%       24.4% Electronic parts, accessories          27.2        30.0        31.5        32.3     and specialty equipment Audio and video                        17.1        15.5        16.8        18.0 Personal electronics and seasonal       9.4        10.4        11.6        12.4 Personal computers and peripherals      8.7         9.1         9.4        10.4 Services and other                      8.3         6.5         3.2         2.5                                     --------    --------    --------    --------                                       100.0%      100.0%      100.0%      100.0%                                     ========    ========    ========    ========  For the  first  time,  the  communications  category,  which  includes  wireless communications  such as  cellular  and PCS  telephones,  as well as  residential telephones,   answering  machines,   pagers  and  other  related  telephony  and communication  products,   surpassed  the  electronic  parts,   accessories  and specialty  equipment  category as  RadioShack's  largest product  category.  The communications  category  increased,  as a  percentage  of total retail sales in 1999,  primarily  due to a 50%  increase  in  unit  sales  of PCS  and  cellular telephones.  Both  unit and  dollar  sales of PCS and  cellular  telephones  are expected  to  continue  to  increase  in  2000.  Through  The  Sprint  Store  at RadioShack,  customers are provided with access to a full service communications center that offers,  where available,  Sprint local and long-distance  telephone service,   Spree(SM)   prepaid  phone  cards  and  Sprint  branded   residential telephones.  On October 5, 1999,  Sprint  announced it would be merging with MCI WorldCom,  Inc., subject to stockholder and regulatory approvals.  The merger is expected to close in the second half of 2000. Tandy's management  anticipates no significant  changes  to its  existing  agreements  as a result  of the  pending merger.  Sales of electronic parts,  accessories and specialty  equipment  decreased as a percentage  of total  retail sales in 1999 when  compared to 1998,  despite a 4% sales gain.  The  category was 27.2% of  RadioShack's  retail sales mix in 1999, down from 30.0% in 1998,  primarily due to the  communications  category and the services  and other  category  becoming a higher  percent of the  product mix in 1999.  This  category  is  expected  to  increase  in sales,  but  decrease as a percentage of RadioShack's retail sales mix in 2000 as the communications, audio and video, and services and other categories increase.  The audio and video category  experienced a sales increase of approximately  27% during 1999 when compared to 1998,  due primarily to a strong  increase in sales of DTH.  Sales of DTH are  expected to continue to increase in 2000.  On May 13, 1999,  Tandy entered into a multi-year  retail sales and service  agreement with Thomson Multimedia ("Thomson"),  which owns the RCA brand. Under this agreement, Thomson  will  supply  RadioShack  with  various  RCA-branded  audio  and  video components  such as  televisions,  VCRs,  camcorders,  digital  video disc (DVD) players,  digital  cameras,  CD shelf  systems and other  digital  entertainment products  beginning  in 2000.  Some of these items are  currently  available  in stores.   The  expanded   assortment  will  be  sold  through  The  RCA  Digital Entertainment Center at RadioShack via a "store-within-a-store"  concept with an expected   rollout   date  in   mid-2000.   Store   fixture   costs   for   this "store-within-a-store"  will be borne by Thomson.  Management believes that this alliance  will allow  RadioShack  to be more  competitive  in the  evolution  of digital  technology,  which should enhance sales in the audio and video category in 2000 and beyond.  Personal  electronics  and seasonal  products  decreased to 9.4% of RadioShack's retail sales mix in 1999 from 10.4% in 1998,  due  primarily to an overall shift in the product mix as mentioned  above.  This  category  experienced  a 4% sales increase over the prior year as a result of increased sales of toys, portable CD players and radios.  Sales of personal  computers and peripherals  were 8.7% of  RadioShack's  retail sales in 1999,  compared  to 9.1% in 1998,  despite a large  unit gain and a 10% sales gain for the year.  The average  selling price of CPU's  decreased 16%, in line with the general  market  decline.  The average  selling  price of CPU's is expected to decrease slightly in 2000.  Despite this downward trend,  management believes  that  the  higher  unit  sales  volumes  of  personal   computers  and peripherals  will contribute to increased sales of this category,  as well as to sales of higher gross margin  products and  services,  such as  accessories  and extended service plans.  Sales in the services and other  category,  which includes  residuals and income from prepaid wireless airtime,  repair services and extended service  contracts, increased in 1999 in dollars and as a percent of RadioShack retail sales, due to an  increase in sales of prepaid  wireless  airtime as well as to an increase in residual   income   received  from   RadioShack's   third  party   providers  of communications  and DTH.  Residual income is also earned on sales of Sprint long distance  and PCS  services  as well as  sales of other  wireless  products  and services. Residuals vary by service provider, but are typically a portion of the continuing  service  revenue paid by the consumer  throughout the ensuing months and/or  years  of that  customer's  subscription.  In  1999,  RadioShack  earned approximately  $63.0  million of residual  income,  compared to $34.2 million in 1998.  Residual  income is expected  to  continue to increase in 2000;  however, increases  are  dependent  upon such factors as  customers'  continued  usage of certain  services and stability of average revenue per  subscriber,  among other factors.  Prepaid  wireless  airtime  sales are  expected  to  decrease in 2000. RadioShack  installation  service revenue is expected to increase in 2000 due to the AmeriLink acquisition.  Connectivity  Strategy  Update:  Tandy entered into two  agreements  during 1999 which  management  believes are  significant  steps  towards  achieving  Tandy's strategic plan for RadioShack to become  "America's  Home  Connectivity  Store," similar to its existing  concept of "America's  Telephone  Store."  Connectivity will provide  solutions for  connecting to and utilizing  high-speed  bandwidth. Bandwidth  refers to volume at which data can be transmitted  and,  depending on the volume delivered,  may enable consumers to have such capabilities as instant and/or  high speed  Internet  access,  movies on demand and  multiple  phone/fax connections through a single phone or cable line.  On November 11, 1999, Tandy Corporation announced a five-year strategic alliance with  Microsoft   Corporation   ("Microsoft")  that  encompasses  broadband  and narrowband  technology,  as well as in-store  and online  efforts.  In the third quarter of 2000,  RadioShack  and Microsoft are expected to launch The Microsoft Internet Center @ RadioShack via a "store-within-a-store"  concept in as many as 5,000 company-owned RadioShack stores and participating dealer/franchise outlets nationwide. Store fixture costs for this "store-within-a-store" will be borne by Microsoft.  The Microsoft  Internet  Center @ RadioShack will allow customers to view  demonstrations  of narrowband  and broadband  technology  and subscribe to MSN(TM) dial-up or broadband  Internet  access service,  as well as view a broad range of existing and future products, solutions and services based on Microsoft technologies. RadioShack will receive a "bounty" on certain sales of Microsoft's MSN broadband and  narrowband  Internet  access  service sold through its retail outlets or through its  RadioShack.com  website.  Additionally,  RadioShack will earn a residual based on a portion of the continuing service revenue paid by the consumer   throughout   the  ensuing  months  and/or  years  of  the  customer's subscription  to  MSN.  The  timing  of the  commencement  of the  residuals  is dependent upon the marketing  program under which new  customers'  subscriptions are  acquired.

On April 21, 1999,  Tandy  announced  it had entered into a strategic  agreement with  NorthPoint  Communications,  Inc.  ("NorthPoint"),  a provider  of Digital Subscriber Line ("DSL") technology.  DSL technology transports data at speeds up to 25 times faster than common dial-up modems,  allowing for high-speed Internet access  and  other  data-intensive  applications.  Management  anticipates  this alliance will  accelerate  the adoption rate of these  services at an affordable price to the mass market. Additionally,  NorthPoint will provide RadioShack with DSL services for consumer display purposes in many of its retail stores, as well as for internal use. NorthPoint currently operates in 33 markets in the U.S. and expects to expand its service territory to 60 markets by the end of 2000.  Also,  on July 30, 1999,  Tandy  acquired  AmeriLink,  one of America's  leading installers  of cable,  telephony and  high-bandwidth  products.  See  "AmeriLink Acquisition" below for further information.  GROSS PROFIT  Gross profit for Tandy was $2,083.5  million or 50.5% of net sales and operating revenues,  compared  with  $2,004.4  million or 41.9% of net sales and operating revenues in 1998. This increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales and operating  revenues was primarily the result of RadioShack  sales accounting for all of the Company's consolidated net sales and operating revenues in 1999, when compared to 1998 due to the sale of Computer City to CompUSA on August 31, 1998. Computer City had an inherently lower gross margin  percentage than consolidated Tandy  Corporation.  Without  Computer  City and  other  closed  units,  Tandy's consolidated gross profit as a percent of net sales and operating revenues would have been 52.1% for 1998.  RadioShack's gross profit increased 11.4% in dollars for the year ended December 31, 1999 versus 1998, but decreased as a percentage of RadioShack's  total sales from 52.1% of sales in 1998 to 50.5% in 1999. This 1.6 percentage point decrease was due primarily to mix shifts within  RadioShack's  product offerings as sales of lower margin  categories  increased as a portion of the overall sales volume. To a lesser extent,  the decrease in the gross margin percentage was also due to promotional  markdowns of private  label audio and video  products as RadioShack began  transitioning  to RCA-branded  products in the fourth quarter of 1999, as well as to markdowns taken  throughout the year on residential  telephones.  The decrease in gross margin was partially  offset by an increase in residual income which has 100% gross margin.  Gross profit as a percentage of RadioShack's sales is  expected to decrease in 2000,  although  not to the extent it  decreased  in 1999, due to continuing mix shifts within  RadioShack's  product  offerings.  An expected  increase in residual income should partially offset this decrease.  In addition, management expects to increase gross margin dollars and gain operating leverage in selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses.   SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  The table  below  summarizes  the  breakdown  of various  components  of Tandy's consolidated  SG&A  expense  and its  related  percentage  of  total  sales  and operating revenues.

(2) Includes  expenses  related to Computer  City before its sale to CompUSA on     August 31, 1998.   Tandy's SG&A expense decreased  slightly in dollars,  but increased as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues to 36.0% for the year ended  December  31, 1999  versus  33.0% for the year  ended  December  31,  1998.  The  higher  SG&A percentage  in 1999 was due  primarily  to the 1998 sale of Computer  City which operated  at  lower  relative  SG&A  expense  levels  than  consolidated   Tandy Corporation.  Excluding  Computer  City and other  closed  units,  Tandy's  SG&A expense as a percentage  of sales would have  approximated  37.7% in 1998.  This decrease of 1.7  percentage  points from 1998 was due primarily to the favorable effect of increased sales at RadioShack during 1999.  Despite  the sale of Computer  City in 1998,  payroll  expense for  consolidated Tandy Corporation increased in dollars and as a percent of Tandy's net sales and operating revenues to 18.0% in 1999,  compared to 15.3% in 1998. Payroll expense for  RadioShack  increased  to $99.1  million  in 1999  compared  to 1998.  This increase was due primarily to  RadioShack  retail store  expansions,  changes in compensation  plans and increases in personnel,  commissions,  bonuses and other incentives  resulting  from  RadioShack's  strong  comparable  store  sales  and profits.  The increase as a percentage of  RadioShack's  net sales and operating revenues to 16.2% in 1999, compared to 15.8% in 1998, was also due to changes in compensation plans, increases in personnel and other incentives.  Rent expense for consolidated  Tandy  Corporation  decreased in dollars in 1999, but increased as a percent of Tandy's net sales and  operating  revenues to 5.0% in 1999  from  4.5% in 1998.  The  decrease  in  dollars  was due to the sale of Computer  City in 1998.  The  percentage  increase  also  related to the sale of Computer  City,  which had lower  rent  expense  as a  percentage  of sales than consolidated  Tandy  Corporation.  Rent  expense  for  RadioShack  increased  in dollars,  but decreased as a percentage of RadioShack's  net sales and operating revenues in 1999 compared to 1998. Rent expense increased $20.5 million in 1999, compared to 1998,  due primarily to 48 new  RadioShack  store  openings,  net of store  closures,  throughout  the year,  as well as lease  renewals  at slightly higher  rates.  The  decrease  as a  percentage  of  RadioShack's  net sales and operating  revenues to 5.2% in 1999,  compared to 5.4% in 1998 was due primarily to the favorable effect of increased  comparable  RadioShack stores sales on the expense rate structure.  Advertising expense for consolidated Tandy Corporation decreased in dollars, but increased  as a percent of Tandy's net sales and  operating  revenues to 4.8% in 1999, compared to 4.4% in 1998, due to the sale of Computer City in August 1998. Advertising expense for RadioShack decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of RadioShack's  net sales and operating  revenues to $198.1 million and 4.8% of sales in 1999,  compared to $200.2 million and 5.6% of sales in 1998. The dollar decrease was due primarily to increased  marketing  development  funds  received from service providers.  In addition,  the decrease as a percentage of sales and operating  revenues reflects the sales leverage gained from  RadioShack's  sales increase.  Credit card fees expense,  which includes fees  associated with third party bank credit cards and fees paid for  promotional  accounts such as "zero interest for six months," and the "other"  expense  category  both  decreased  primarily as a result of the sale of Computer City.  In 2000,  Tandy's  SG&A  expense is  expected  to  increase  in  dollars  due to additional sales volume, but decrease as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues as a result of the sales leverage gained from a comparable  store sales increase and, to a lesser extent, an increase in new stores.  RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS  On  February  1, 1998,  Tandy  granted,  under the 1997  Incentive  Stock  Plan, approximately  649,500  restricted stock awards consisting of 500 shares each to 1,299  RadioShack store managers not included in the February 1, 1997 restricted stock grant.  The February 1998 restricted  stock awards had a weighted  average fair market value of $19.61 per share when granted.  This restricted stock grant was to vest on February 2, 2003, if managers  receiving the grants were employed by Tandy at a store  manager  or higher  position,  at that time.  However,  the grants  provided  that the  restricted  shares  would vest early if Tandy common stock closed at $29.0625 or more for any 20  consecutive  trading days beginning February 1, 2000. At December 31, 1999, it was probable that the 348,000  shares that  remained  outstanding  under this grant would vest under the early vesting provisions.  The  resulting  charge to  compensation  expense of $14.7  million, including related payroll taxes, was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1999.  Vesting of these  restricted  stock awards  occurred  when Tandy's  common stock closed above the targeted  amount for the twentieth  consecutive  trading day on February 29, 2000. Vesting resulted in the issuance of 336,000 shares of Tandy's common stock at a fair market value of $37.53 per share.  In the fourth quarter of 1998, Tandy recorded estimated  compensation expense of $82.6 million  related to the early vesting of restricted  stock awards that had been granted to 4,907 store managers on February 1, 1997. These awards vested on March 1, 1999 and the actual price of the stock and the number of shares  vested differed  from the  estimated  accrual at December 31, 1998.  The amount of this difference,  $5.1  million,  was  recorded  as a credit to  expense in the first quarter of 1999.  The restricted stock program for store managers was replaced in 1999 and 2000 by a stock  option  program for store  managers.  See Note 19 - "Stock  Options and Performance Awards" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ("Notes"). Management  does not  anticipate  any future use of  restricted  stock for store managers.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $16.8  million for 1999 versus $34.6 million for 1998.  Interest expense decreased 18.1% to $37.2 million in 1999, from $45.4 million in 1998.  This  decrease was a result of Tandy no longer  having to incur  interest expense  on  Computer  City  capital  lease   obligations,   as  well  as  to  a corresponding decrease in Tandy's average debt outstanding during 1999. Interest income  increased almost 90% in 1999 to $20.4 million in 1999 from $10.8 million in 1998,  due  primarily  to  interest  from the  $136.0  million  CompUSA  note receivable  which was outstanding a full year (see "Sale of Computer City, Inc." below for further information).  Interest  expense,  net of interest income, is expected to increase during 2000, primarily due to anticipated higher short-term interest rates and increased debt from additional share repurchases.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  The provision for income taxes  reflects an effective tax rate of 38.0% for 1999 compared with 38.5% for 1998.  This decrease  resulted  primarily  from improved utilization  of foreign tax credits and  implementation  of certain state income tax initiatives.  1998 COMPARED WITH 1997 - -----------------------  NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES  Consolidated  net sales and  operating  revenues  decreased  10.9% from $5,372.2 million in 1997 to $4,787.9  million in 1998;  this  decrease  was  attributable primarily  to the  sale  of  Computer  City  to  CompUSA  on  August  31,  1998. Consolidated  comparable  store sales for 1998 were not meaningful,  due to this sale.  RadioShack Segment - ------------------  Sales for the RadioShack segment in 1998 increased 8.7% to $3,591.2 million from $3,303.9  million in 1997, due primarily to a 7.4%  comparable  store sales gain and the opening of 48 new stores, net of store closures. RadioShack's comparable store  sales  increase  was driven  primarily  by  increased  sales of  wireless communication and telephony products and services.  Electronic  parts,  accessories  and specialty  equipment,  the largest  product category of  RadioShack's  retail sales mix in 1998,  decreased  1.5  percentage points in 1998 when  compared to 1997,  despite a 4.1% increase in dollar sales. This   decrease  as  a  percent  of  retail  sales  was  primarily  due  to  the communications  and the services and other categories  becoming a higher percent of the product mix in 1998. The  communications  category  increased to 28.5% of retail sales in 1998 from 27.5% in 1997. Dollar sales in this category increased 13.2% over 1997 as the  category  continued  to benefit from The Sprint Store at RadioShack  launched  in  September  1997.  Sales of audio  and  video  products declined  to 15.5% of retail  sales in 1998 from 16.8% of retail  sales in 1997, primarily  due to the overall  shift in the product  mix to  communications  and services. Sales dollars in the audio and video category were flat from the prior year, due in part to RadioShack's limited selection of name brand products.  The audio and video  category  also  included  DTH  sales,  which  included  digital satellite  systems (DSS) and Primestar  satellite  television  services in 1998. Sales of these systems and services increased  significantly over 1997. Personal electronics and seasonal products  decreased to 10.4% of RadioShack retail sales in 1998 from 11.6% in 1997, due primarily to an overall shift in the product mix to  communications  and services.  The sales  decrease in this category was also attributable to sales declines in such items as boomboxes, cassette products and toys,  other than remote control cars, due to lower general  consumer demand for these products.  The personal computer  category  decreased to 9.1% of RadioShack retail sales in 1998 from 9.4% in 1997, despite a large unit gain and a 5.8% sales gain for this category for 1998. RadioShack computers experienced a 32% decline in the average 1998 selling price of desktop  computers  from the 1997 annual  average  selling price.  Aggressive pricing strategies put into place as RadioShack  transitioned from IBM to Compaq branded computers and products during the first six months of 1998 and general  selling  price  declines  in the  personal  computer  industry contributed to this decline.  Sales in the services and other category increased in 1998 in  dollars  and as a percent  of  RadioShack  retail  sales,  due to an increase in residual income received from RadioShack's  third party providers of communication  and DTH,  as well as to a large  increase  in  sales  of  prepaid wireless  airtime.  In 1998,  RadioShack earned  approximately  $34.2 million of residual income, compared to $7.9 million in 1997.  Computer City Segment - ---------------------  Computer City's overall sales  decreased 37.1% to $1,196.7  million in 1998 from 1997, due to the sale of this  subsidiary to CompUSA on August 31, 1998. For the eight months ended August 31,  1998,  sales of personal  computers  decreased in dollars due to a reduction of approximately  25% in the average selling price of desktop and notebook computers from the same period in 1997. Additionally,  both overall and comparable  stores sales were  negatively  impacted by the announced sale of Computer  City to CompUSA on June 22, 1998,  at which time Computer City took  promotional  mark-downs  to sell both its  third-party  and  private-label inventory in preparation  for the sale to CompUSA.  (See "Sale of Computer City, Inc." below.)  GROSS PROFIT  Gross profit for Tandy was $2,004.4  million or 41.9% of net sales and operating revenues  in 1998,  compared  with  $2,014.3  million  or 37.5%,  in 1997.  This increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues was primarily  the result of RadioShack  sales  accounting  for a larger  portion of Tandy's  consolidated net sales and operating revenues in 1998, when compared to 1997, due to the sale of Computer City to CompUSA in August 1998.  Computer City had an inherently lower gross margin than consolidated Tandy Corporation.  RadioShack's  gross  profit  increased  in  dollars  in 1998  versus  1997,  but decreased as a percentage of RadioShack's  total sales by 0.6 percentage  points over the same period.  This  percentage  decrease was  primarily  due to a shift within  RadioShack's  product  offerings to increased sales of prepaid  wireless airtime,  which  has  a  significantly  lower  gross  margin  than  the  overall RadioShack  average  gross  margin.  This  decrease was  partially  offset by an increase in residual income, which has close to 100% gross margin.  Computer  City's  gross  profit  as a  percent  of  Computer  City net sales and operating  revenues  decreased  2.3  percentage  points in 1998 when compared to 1997.  This decrease was  primarily  due to  aggressive  marketing of inventory, especially  private-label branded inventory,  in preparation for the sale of the subsidiary.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  Tandy's  SG&A  expense was flat in dollars,  but  increased  as a percent of net sales and operating  revenues to 33.0% in 1998 versus 29.4% in 1997.  The higher SG&A percentage was due primarily to RadioShack  becoming a larger percentage of Tandy's  consolidated   operations  during  1998  (see  "Gross  Profit"  above). RadioShack  operates at higher  relative SG&A expense  levels than  consolidated Tandy Corporation.  Excluding Computer City and closed units associated with the 1996  restructuring  plan, SG&A expense as a percentage of sales would have been 37.7% in 1998 versus 38.9% in 1997. Although payroll and commissions expense for 1998 remained flat in dollars in comparison  with 1997, this cost increased as a percentage  of net sales and  operating  revenues from 13.7% in 1997 to 15.3% in 1998,  due in part to the increase in RadioShack  sales as a percentage of total Company  sales and  operating  revenues,  as  described  above.  RadioShack  has inherently  higher  salary  expense as a percentage  of sales,  when compared to consolidated  Tandy  Corporation.  To  a  lesser  extent,  payroll  expense  was negatively    impacted    by    higher    payroll    costs    associated    with infrastructure-building  at CCI,  prior  to its  announced  sale  in June  1998. Advertising  expense  increased both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and  operating  revenues in 1998,  as compared to 1997.  This  increase over the prior  year is  primarily  attributable  to  increased  advertising  expense  at Computer City in 1998, compared to 1997. Somewhat offsetting this increase was a dollar decrease in advertising expense at RadioShack in 1998 from 1997. In 1997, however,  the  marketing  launch of the Sprint Store at  RadioShack  resulted in increased  advertising  expense for that year. Rent expense decreased in dollars in comparison with 1997 and increased  slightly as a percentage of net sales and operating  revenues to 4.5% in 1998 from 4.1% in 1997. This increase was related to the sale of Computer  City,  which had lower rent expense as a percentage  of sales  than  consolidated  Tandy  Corporation.   Rent  expense  in  dollars  for RadioShack  increased in 1998 compared to the prior year, but decreased slightly as a percent of sales.  RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS  On February 1, 1997,  in an effort to reduce the  turnover  rate among its store managers and to align the store managers'  interests and goals with those of the shareholders,  Tandy  granted,  under  the  1993  ISP,  approximately  4,082,400 restricted stock awards  consisting of 800 shares each to 4,907 RadioShack store managers  and  1,600  shares  each  to 98  Computer  City  store  managers.  The restricted  stock awards had a weighted  average fair market value of $11.30 per share when granted.  This restricted  stock was to vest at the end of five years on February 2, 2002, if managers  receiving the grants were employed by Tandy at a store manager or higher position,  at that time. However,  the grants provided that the  restricted  shares would vest early if Tandy's  common stock closed at $16.90625  or more for any 20  consecutive  trading days  beginning  February 1, 1999.  At December 31,  1998,  it was probable  that the  2,579,200  shares that remained  outstanding  under  this  grant  would  vest  under the early  vesting provisions.  The  resulting  charge to  compensation  expense of $82.6  million, including related payroll taxes, was recorded in the December 31, 1998 financial statements. The awards vested on March 1, 1999 and the actual price of the stock and the number of shares  vested  differed  slightly from  estimated  accrual at December 31, 1998.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $34.6  million for 1998 versus $32.9 million for 1997.  Interest expense decreased slightly during 1998, due to a corresponding decrease in Tandy's average debt outstanding during 1998 as well as to a small decrease in short-term interest rates for the year.  Interest  income  decreased in 1998 due to the repayment of the  InterTAN,  Inc. ("InterTAN")  note receivable on December 31, 1997,  offset by interest received on the note receivable from CompUSA for $136.0 million. Interest income relating to  Fry's  Electronics,  Inc.  and its  affiliates  ("Fry's)  notes  receivables resulted from the 1997 sale of assets and real estate of six Incredible Universe stores.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  The provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of 38.5% for both 1998 and 1997.  AMERILINK ACQUISITION On July 30, 1999, Tandy acquired AmeriLink in an all stock transaction valued at approximately $75.8 million. Tandy exchanged approximately 1.8 million shares of Tandy common stock for all of the  outstanding  common stock of  AmeriLink.  The transaction  was  accounted  for under the purchase  method of  accounting.  The purchase  price was  allocated to the assets  acquired and  liabilities  assumed based on their  estimated  fair  values  at the date of the  acquisition,  which resulted in  approximately  $50.7  million of goodwill  being  recorded in other assets in the  accompanying  1999  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.  The associated goodwill  will be  amortized  over 20 years.  AmeriLink  designs,  installs  and maintains  cabling  systems  for the  transmission  of  video,  voice  and data, primarily for home use.  AmeriLink  will  continue to provide these  services to outside  parties  and  also  to  RadioShack,   through  AmeriLink's   RadioShack Installation  Services  Division.  Services for  RadioShack in 2000 will consist primarily of customer DIRECTV installations;  however, new services such as home theater  and  broadband  Internet  access,   among  others,  will  be  added  as RadioShack's needs dictate. At February 25, 2000, AmeriLink had 76 field offices located in 26 states.  RADIOSHACK.COM, LLC In   October   1999,   Tandy   launched   its   e-commerce    enabled   website, www.RadioShack.com.  On November 10, 1999,  Tandy and Microsoft formed a limited liability company, RadioShack.com, LLC ("RS.com"), for the purpose of  marketing and selling electronics  products on the Internet.  Tandy contributed assets and also extended a royalty-free license for certain trademarks and service marks to RS.com, and  Microsoft  contributed  cash of $100.0  million on January 4, 2000. Tandy owns 100% of the common units of RS.com,  while Microsoft owns 100% of the preferred  units and Tandy will  include  RS.com in its  consolidated  financial statements.  Tandy is  entitled  to  receive  75% of the  profits  and losses of RS.com,  while  Microsoft will receive 25%;  however,  the preferred  units have liquidation  rights  which  could  impact the  allocation  of profits and losses between the unit holders.  The preferred units are convertible into common units at any time and must be converted in the event of certain capital  transactions. In certain circumstances,  Microsoft has the option to require Tandy to purchase its units and Tandy has the right to purchase  Microsoft's  units.  Also, in the event of liquidation,  the preferred units have  preferential  rights to recover their initial investment.  During 2000,  RadioShack and Microsoft will jointly  redesign and reengineer the www.RadioShack.com  website,  incorporating  current Microsoft  technology.  The planned result will be a  full-featured  online  e-commerce site where customers can go for a wide range of electronics products, parts and services. Among other features,  customers will have the ability to obtain answers to frequently asked questions on electronics through  www.RadioShack.com's  "Ask the Shack" feature, as well as the ability to  download  instruction  manuals and service  documents relating to electronics products. Management anticipates that the newly designed website will be  relaunched  during the third  quarter of 2000,  and it believes that  www.RadioShack.com  will become a premier destination site for electronics products,  services,  information,   answers  and  solutions  for  consumer  and commercial  customers.  As of March 1, 2000,  there were over  20,000  different products on the website.  Additionally, Microsoft will provide www.RadioShack.com premier placement across the  MSN(TM)  network,  Microsoft's  Internet  access  service,  and its  online properties,  including the  newly-launched MSN eShop(TM) online shopping service site (http://eshop.msn.com/).  Through its presence on eShop, www.RadioShack.com will be able to take advantage of the portal  leadership of MSN to reach a broad audience of customers on the Internet.  SALE OF COMPUTER CITY, INC. On August 31, 1998,  Tandy completed the sale of 100% of the outstanding  common stock of its Computer City, Inc. subsidiary to CompUSA Inc. In the third quarter of 1998,  Tandy  received  approximately  $75.0 million in cash and an unsecured subordinated  note for $136.0 million as consideration  for the sale. The amount of cash to be retained was subject to  adjustment  and in the fourth  quarter of 1998 the amount of cash  consideration  was reduced to $36.5  million.  The note bears  interest  at 9.48%  per  annum  and is  payable  over a ten year  period. Interest is payable on June 30 and December 31 of each year;  the first  payment was made on December  31,  1998.  Beginning  on  December  31,  2001,  principal payments will be due semiannually until the note matures on June 30, 2008. Tandy recognized  a loss of  $108.2  million  from the sale of  Computer  City,  which included certain liabilities and contractual obligations incurred by Tandy.  Computer City's results from operations  through August 31, 1998 are included in the accompanying  Consolidated  Financial Statements.  Below is a summary of net sales and operating  revenues and net losses  (unaudited)  for Computer City for each year ended December 31:  (In millions)                            1999           1998(1)        1997 - -------------                           ------          ------        ------ Net sales and operating revenues        $   --         $1,196.7      $1,903.7 Operating loss                              --            (95.6)        (14.9)  (1)  Includes  operations  for only eight  months,  due to sale to CompUSA on      August 31, 1998.  On March 1, 2000, Grupo Sanborns,  S.A. de C.V. ("Sanborns") and TPC Acquisition Corporation,  a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanborns,  acquired CompUSA.  Tandy's management does not believe that this acquisition will have a negative impact on CompUSA's ability to repay its obligation to Tandy.  1996 BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING In the fourth quarter of 1996, Tandy initiated  certain  restructuring  programs resulting from the highly competitive environment in the electronics industry at the time. In conjunction  with these programs,  in January 1997, Tandy closed 53 McDuff  stores and 21  unprofitable  Computer City stores.  Additionally,  Tandy either closed or sold all of its  Incredible  Universe  stores during 1997.  The components  of the  restructuring  charge and an  analysis of the  reserves  are outlined  in a table in Note 7 - "1996  Business  Restructuring"  of the  Notes. Below is a summary of net sales and  operating  revenues  and  operating  losses (unaudited) of the stores closed  pursuant to the  restructuring  plans for each year ended December 31:  (In millions)                           1999         1998         1997 - -------------                           ----         ----         ---- Net sales and operating revenues     $    --      $    --      $  164.6 Operating loss                            --           --         (30.1)(1)   (1)  Excludes business restructuring charges.  TAX SHARING AND TAX BENEFIT REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT Under  Tandy's  Tax  Sharing  and  Tax  Benefit  Reimbursement   Agreement  (the "Agreement") with O'Sullivan Industries  ("O'Sullivan"),  a former subsidiary of Tandy,  Tandy receives  payments from O'Sullivan  approximating  the federal tax benefit that  O'Sullivan  realizes  from the  increased  tax basis of its assets resulting  from the initial  public  offering  completed in February  1994.  The higher tax basis increases O'Sullivan's tax deductions and, accordingly, reduces income taxes payable by O'Sullivan.  For the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and  1997,  Tandy  recognized  income of $5.1  million,  $6.0  million  and $5.8 million, net of tax, respectively, under this Agreement. The Agreement calls for payments to continue  to be made over a 15-year  time period and are  contingent upon O'Sullivan's level of earnings from year to year. In November 1999, members of O'Sullivan's  senior  management team, in conjunction with a financial buyer, acquired all of O'Sullivan's outstanding common stock. The effect of this change of control on the payments  Tandy will  receive is  currently  the subject of an arbitration proceeding between Tandy and O'Sullivan. Depending on the outcome of such  arbitration,  the amount of payments received under the Agreement could be significantly  less than in prior years and/or the timing of such payments could be delayed.  NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging  Activities." In June 1999,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 137 which delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to quarters  beginning  after June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 requires a company to record all derivative  instruments at fair value on the balance sheet.  Tandy does not use derivatives for speculative  purposes. As such, its market risk was not material in 1999 and is not expected to be material in 2000.  CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY                                    Year Ended December 31,                               -------------------------------- (In millions)                   1999        1998        1997 - -------------                 --------    --------    -------- Operating activities          $  561.6    $  414.8    $  320.3 Investing activities            (121.0)      (93.0)      (63.9) Financing activities            (340.5)     (363.2)     (272.0)  In 1999, cash flow provided by operating activities was $561.6 million, compared to $414.8 million and $320.3 million in 1998 and 1997,  respectively.  Cash flow from net income,  adjusted for non-cash items, increased $97.0 million from 1998 to 1999.  This  increase  was  primarily  due to increased  operating  profit at RadioShack.  The  increase  in cash  flow  from  operating  activities  was also positively  affected by a $49.8  million  increase in cash flow  generated  from working capital improvements  primarily attributable to a $73.0 million increase in accrued income taxes. During 1998, changes in working capital generated $55.2 million of cash flow  compared  to a use of cash of $72.4  million in 1997.  The increase in 1998 was caused  primarily by the  liquidation of CCI's  inventories prior to its sale in August 1998.  Investing  activities  used  $121.0  million in cash in 1999,  compared to $93.0 million in 1998 and $63.9  million in 1997.  Capital  expenditures  approximated $102.4 million in 1999, compared to $131.5 million in 1998 and $118.4 million in 1997.  Capital  expenditures  for 1999 consisted  primarily of RadioShack  store expansions  and  remodels,  upgrades  of  machinery  and  expansion  in selected distribution centers and manufacturing facilities,  updated information systems, including Year 2000 ("Y2K") initiatives, and web development for RadioShack.com. Capital expenditures for 1998 and 1997 were used primarily for retail expansion, upgrading  information  systems and Computer  City  infrastructure  enhancements prior to the announced  sale of CCI in June 1998.  Management  anticipates  that capital  expenditure  requirements for 2000 will  approximate  $120.0 million to $125.0 million and will consist  primarily of RadioShack future store expansions and remodels,  updated information  systems and, to a lesser extent,  expansions and additions relating to Tandy's distribution and manufacturing facilities, web development  for  RadioShack.com  and the purchase of vehicles  for  AmeriLink's RadioShack  Installation  Services  Division.  In April 1999, Tandy made a $20.0 million  dollar  investment  in  NorthPoint.  Cash proceeds from the sale of CCI generated  $36.5  million in cash in 1998.  Cash  proceeds in 1997 totaled $57.4 million  and  related  to the  sale of  various  corporate  assets  and  certain Incredible  Universe  locations,  final  repayment of the note  receivable  from InterTAN and the sale of Tandy's  remaining shares of AST Research,  Inc. common stock.  Cash used by financing activities was $340.5 million in 1999, compared to $363.2 million and $272.0 million in 1998 and 1997, respectively. Purchases of treasury stock  required cash of $422.2  million,  $337.4  million and $425.6  million in 1999,  1998 and  1997,  respectively.  (See  "Capital  Structure  and  Financial Condition" below for further information on Tandy's stock repurchase  programs.) The  1999,  1998 and 1997  stock  repurchases  were  partially  funded  by $81.5 million, $57.8 million and $50.7 million,  respectively,  received from the sale of treasury  stock to Tandy's  employee  stock purchase plans and employee stock option exercises. Dividends paid, net of tax, in 1999, 1998 and 1997 amounted to $42.5 million,  $44.8 million and $48.2 million,  respectively.  The decrease in dividends paid in 1999 and 1998 resulted from fewer outstanding  shares in those years. On October 25, 1999, Tandy announced a 10% increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.050 per share to $0.055 per share,  for  shareholders of record on January 3, 2000.  Medium-term notes issued by Tandy under its 1997 Debt Shelf Registration  Statement provided  approximately $101.0 and $45.0 million in cash in 1999 and 1998, respectively,  the majority of which was used to repay current maturities of long-term  debt. In 1999,  Tandy used excess cash flow to decrease short-term  debt from the prior year by $42.3  million  and in 1998,  Tandy used excess cash flow to decrease  its  short-term  debt from the prior year by $44.9 million.  Tandy ended 1999 with approximately  $100.0 million in additional cash as part of its Y2K readiness  planning.  It is anticipated that cash balances in the future will be less than $100.0 million.  The current credit ratings for Tandy, which are generally considered  investment grade, follow:                                             Standard       Duff & Category                     Moody's      and Poor's      Phelps - --------                     -------      ----------      ------ Medium-Term Notes             Baa1           A-            A- ESOP Senior Notes             Baa1           A-            N/A Commercial Paper              P-2            A-2           D-1-  CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Tandy's  balance sheet and financial  condition  continue to be strong.  Tandy's available borrowing facilities as of December 31, 1999 are detailed in Note 12 - "Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities" of the Notes.  On  March 3,  1997,  Tandy  announced  that its  Board of  Directors  authorized management to purchase up to 20.0 million  additional shares of its common stock through Tandy's existing share repurchase program.  The share repurchase program was initially  authorized in December 1995 and increased in October 1996 and was undertaken  as a result of  management's  view of the economic  value of Tandy's stock.  The  share  increase  for 1997  brought  the total  authorization  since inception to 60.0 million  shares,  of which  approximately  56.7 million shares totaling $949.2 million were repurchased as of December 31, 1999.  Approximately 4.8  million  shares  were  repurchased  in 1999 for  $203.4  million  under the program.  An additional 1.6 million shares have been repurchased from January 1, 2000 to February 29, 2000 for $70.5 million.  Additionally,  on October 26, 1998,  Tandy announced that its Board of Directors authorized  the  repurchase of up to 10.0 million shares of Tandy's common stock for an  indefinite  period of time to be used to offset the  dilution  of grants under  Tandy's  incentive  stock  plans  (see  Note  19  -  "Stock  Options  and Performance  Awards"  of the  Notes).  Approximately  4.2  million  shares  were repurchased in 1999 for $190.7 million,  bringing the total share  repurchase at December  31, 1999 under this  program to 7.0  million  shares  totaling  $254.5 million.  An additional  1.9 million shares were  repurchased  for $93.7 million from January 1, 2000 to February 29, 2000.  These purchases under the two share repurchase  programs  described above are in addition to the shares  required for employee  stock purchase  plans,  which are purchased throughout the year. Purchases will continue to be made in 2000 in the open market with funding of the  programs  coming from excess free cash flow and short-term borrowings, if needed.  In connection  with the share  repurchase  program,  the Board of Directors,  at their October 23, 1998 meeting,  authorized management to sell up to 2.0 million put options on Tandy common  stock.  Such put options  grant the  purchaser  the right to sell shares of Tandy's  common stock to Tandy at specified  prices upon exercise of the put options.  These put options are exercisable only at maturity and can be settled in cash at Tandy's option, in lieu of repurchasing the stock. The  issued put  options  have a maturity  of up to six  months.  Tandy has sold approximately 1.4 million put options since the inception of the program and 0.4 million put options  remained  outstanding at December 31, 1999. The put options expire on various dates  through April 2000. At December 31, 1999 and 1998,  the full  redemption  value of the put options was  classified  as common  stock put options in the accompanying  Consolidated Balance Sheets. The related offset was recorded in common stock in treasury, net of premiums received.  Additionally,  at their  February  23,  2000  meeting,  the  Board of  Directors authorized  management to supplement the put option program with equity forwards and increased the number of shares subject to put options and equity forwards to 4.6 million shares. The Board of Directors also extended the expiration date for the program to no later than December 31, 2002. Put options and equity  forwards will  continue to be executed  from time to time in order to take  advantage  of attractive share price levels, as determined by management. The timing and terms of the transactions,  including maturities, depend on market conditions, Tandy's liquidity and other considerations.  Tandy's primary source of short-term  debt consists of short-term  seasonal bank debt and commercial  paper,  which have  maturities of less than 90 days. In the second  quarter of 1999,  Tandy extended the maturity date of its $200.0 million 364-day  revolving credit facility to June 2000. Tandy also has a $300.0 million five-year  revolving  credit facility  maturing June 2003. The revolving  credit facilities are used as backup for the  commercial  paper program and may also be utilized  for  general  corporate  purposes.  Annual  commitment  fees  for  the facilities are 0.07% of the $200.0 million  facility per annum and 0.085% of the $300.0  million  facility per annum,  whether used or unused.  During the second quarter of 2000, Tandy plans to extend the $200.0 million facility to June 2001.  The total  debt-to-capitalization ratio was 38.0% at December 31, 1999, 35.6% at December  31,  1998 and 33.6% at  December  31,  1997.  These  increases  in the debt-to-capitalization  ratios  result  primarily  from a  reduction  in Tandy's stockholders'  equity  due to the share  repurchase  program  and the  impact of divested businesses.  In May 1997,  Tandy filed a $300.0  million  Debt Shelf  Registration  Statement ("Shelf  Registration") with the Securities and Exchange  Commission,  which was declared  effective in August 1997. In August 1997,  Tandy issued $150.0 million of 10 year unsecured  notes under the Shelf  Registration.  The interest rate on the notes is 6.95% per annum with interest payable on September 1 and March 1 of each year,  commencing  March 1, 1998.  The notes are due  September 1, 2007. In December  1997 and January  1998,  Tandy issued $4.0 million and $45.0  million, respectively,  in  medium-term  notes under the remaining  $150.0  million Shelf Registration.  An additional  $32.0 million,  $37.0 million and $32.0 million of medium-term  notes were issued in January 1999,  August 1999 and September 1999, respectively,  completing the remaining 1997 Shelf Registration.  Tandy's medium and  long-term  notes  outstanding  at  December  31,  1999 under the 1997 Shelf Registration  totaled $300.0 million,  compared to $199.0 million outstanding at December 31, 1998. The interest  rates at December 31, 1999 for the  outstanding $150.0 million in  medium-term  notes ranged from 6.09% to 7.35% with a weighted average coupon rate of 6.6%.  Tandy's management  believes that its present borrowing capacity is greater than the  established  credit  lines and  long-term  debt in place.  Management  also believes that Tandy's cash flow from  operations,  cash and cash equivalents and its available borrowing  facilities are more than adequate to fund planned store and business  expansion,  to meet debt service and dividend  requirements and to fund its share repurchase programs.  INFLATION Inflation  has not  significantly  impacted  Tandy  over the past  three  years. Management does not expect inflation to have a significant  impact on operations in the foreseeable  future,  unless global situations  substantially  affect the world economy.  YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE Tandy's  management  recognized  the  importance of taking  necessary  action to ensure that its operation and relationships with key vendors, service providers, customers and other third  parties  would not be adversely  impacted by software processing errors arising from calculations using the year 2000 and beyond. Like many  companies,  a  significant  number of Tandy's  computer  applications  and systems  required  modifications  in order for these systems to be ready for the year 2000.  With its transition plans and teams in place, Tandy  successfully  completed its Y2K rollover  without any major problems or disruptions.  All of Tandy's stores, manufacturing  facilities,  logistics  operations,  service  centers and support areas were fully functional  subsequent to the Y2K rollover.  Tandy is not aware that  any of its  major  business  partners  experienced  material  Y2K  issues. Additionally, to date, product returns and repairs at its retail stores have not been  significant  and management  does not  anticipate any further  activity or disruptions to occur on its part with respect to the Y2K rollover.  Tandy's total Y2K readiness costs were  approximately  $11.5 million,  including $1.1 million paid to external parties for consulting and  professional  fees. Of the total costs,  approximately $4.4 million were incurred in 1999. Tandy funded both the capital and expensed  elements of resolving  Y2K issues  through  funds generated  from  operations.  Tandy  does not  expect  to incur  any  additional significant costs in 2000.  All statements concerning Y2K issues other than historical statements constitute "forward-looking  statements," as defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform  Act  of  1995.  Such  forward-looking   statements  should  be  read  in conjunction with Tandy's  disclosures under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results."  ITEM 7a.   QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  In June  1998,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  133,  "Accounting  for  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities".  In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137 which delayed the  effective  date of SFAS No. 133 to quarters  beginning  after June 15,  2000.  SFAS No.  133  requires  a  company  to record  all  derivative instruments at fair value on the balance sheet.  Tandy does not use  derivatives for speculative purposes. As such, its market risk was not material in 1999.  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
