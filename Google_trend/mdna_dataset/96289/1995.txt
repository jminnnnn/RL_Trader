ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF              OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.         Tandy Corporation ("Tandy" or the "Company") changed its     fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31 effective     December 31, 1992.         The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of     Results of Operations and Financial Condition compares the     year ended December 31, 1994 with the years ended December     31, 1993 and June 30, 1992.  Although the years ended     December 31, 1993 and June 30, 1992 end at different times of     the year, management believes that the seasonality of the     retail business relating to Christmas is so significant that     it would distort trends and related percentage comparisons to     sales for the readers if a full year's results were compared     to the six-month transition period ended December 31, 1992.     Information for the six months ended December 31, 1992 is     included in the tables herein for informational purposes     only.  Significant events occurring during such period are     described in the respective sections below.         NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES                                                    Year Ended             Six Months Ended    Year Ended                                                December 31,              December 31,       June 30,                                         ---------------------------     --------------     ----------     (In thousands)                         1994             1993             1992             1992     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                Radio Shack                         $2,853,985       $2,712,973       $1,475,968       $2,761,050     Tandy Name Brand                       440,365          486,258          349,133          586,436     Incredible Universe                    381,682          136,119           34,249               --     Computer City                        1,184,152          626,222          187,745           94,231                                         ----------       ----------       ----------       ----------                                          4,860,184        3,961,572        2,047,095        3,441,717     Import/Export and Other Sales           83,495          140,979          114,054          207,567                                         ----------       ----------       ----------       ----------                                         $4,943,679       $4,102,551       $2,161,149       $3,649,284                                         ==========       ==========       ==========       ==========            For the year ended December 31, 1994, Tandy's sales     increased 21% to $4,943,679,000 from $4,102,551,000 for the     year ended December 31, 1993.  The increase in sales was     primarily attributable to the addition of six Incredible     Universe(R) and 29 Computer City(R) stores during 1994.  A     net increase of 45 company-owned Radio Shack(R) stores also     contributed to the sales increase.  Partially offsetting     these upward trends in sales was an overall decline in sales     for Tandy Name Brand.  This decline can be partially     attributed to the fact that 110 McDuff(R) and     VideoConcepts(R) stores were closed during February 1993.      See "Provision for Business Restructuring" below for further     discussion of Tandy Name Brand.         Tandy posted a 5% same store sales increase with all     divisions showing same store increases during the year.      Radio Shack and Computer City achieved same store sales     increases of 5% while the Tandy Name Brand group was only up     slightly.  Radio Shack same store sales increases continue to     be attributable to its focus on its core business (i.e.     consumer electronics, cellular telephones, parts and     accessories) which have higher margins versus personal     computers which have smaller margins.  Incredible Universe,     with three old stores, experienced a 20% comparable stores     sales gain during calendar 1994.  Same store sales increases     reflect growing demand for consumer electronics amid a strong     economy.         During 1994, Tandy and InterTAN Inc. ("InterTAN") entered     into a new import/export agreement under which Tandy's A&A     operations would act as InterTAN's agent in importing     consumer electronics from the Far East.  Commencing in March     1994, only the purchasing agent commission and sales made by     Tandy manufacturing plants to InterTAN were recorded as     sales.  InterTAN purchases from third parties through A&A are     no longer recorded as sales, reflecting the arrangement under     the new merchandise agreement; however, commission income is     reported as operating revenue.  Accordingly, reported sales     by Tandy to InterTAN in 1994, reflected in Import/Export and     Other Sales, were considerably lower than in 1993, however,     the earned income relating thereto was not materially     different.  See the discussion in the "InterTAN Update" found     below.         For the year ended December 31, 1993, overall sales grew     12% to $4,102,551,000 as compared to $3,649,284,000 for the     fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  This increase was primarily     due to the opening of three Incredible Universe stores and     the expansion of the Computer City store chain.  Computer     City sales increases were the result of 25 additional stores     since June 30, 1992 and comparable store sales gains at old     stores in excess of 30% for the year ended December 31, 1993.     Tandy Name Brand experienced a sales decrease in calendar     1993 as compared to the June 1992 fiscal year.  This decrease     was primarily a result of the closing of 110 McDuff and     VideoConcepts stores in February 1993.  This decline was     offset by the addition of three Incredible Universe stores.     The first two Incredible Universe stores were opened in the     fall of 1992, and the third was added in the fall of 1993.     Shipments to InterTAN decreased for calendar year 1993 as     compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  On a     comparable store basis, Radio Shack's sales increased     slightly during the year ended December 31, 1993, as compared     to the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  A moderate increase     in sales of Radio Shack's core business was offset by a     decline in sales of personal computers through the Radio     Shack division.         The decrease in Radio Shack's computer business reflects     the impact of sharply lower pricing in response to     competitive pressures in the marketplace.  The changing     dynamics of the personal computer business had a significant     impact on Radio Shack's performance during 1993 and fiscal     1992, and to a lesser extent in 1994.  A combination of     shifts in competitive retail distribution to superstores and     telemarketing combined with rapidly declining prices has     taken the computer category from approximately 17.0% of Radio     Shack's sales with a gross profit of approximately 29.0% in     the year ended June 30, 1992, to approximately 12.0% of sales     and a gross profit of approximately 13.7% for the year ended     December 31, 1994.  Radio Shack's extensive assortment of     electronic parts, accessories and specialty items     differentiates it from other consumer electronics retailers     in the marketplace.  The table below shows the breakdown by     major category of Radio Shack sales.

In addition, 33 other mall stores or Supercenters will be converted into Radio Shack or Computer City Express(SM) stores.         See "Provision for Business Restructuring".          GROSS PROFIT        Gross profit as a percent of sales declined in 1994 to     39.0% from the 1993 level of 41.9%.  This decrease reflects     the continued expansion of Tandy's lower gross margin retail     formats.  During calendar year 1994, Computer City and     Incredible Universe represented 31.7% of total sales and     operating revenues compared to 18.6% of the 1993 total.     Offsetting the mix of business shift within Tandy are the     increasing gross margins in Radio Shack in calendar 1994,     which continue to benefit from a lower percentage of sales     related to low margin computer equipment and a higher     percentage associated with the sale of higher gross margin     categories including parts, accessories and consumer     electronics.  Management anticipates that Tandy's     consolidated gross profit percentage will continue to decline     as the effects of the Computer City and Incredible Universe     expansions are increasingly reflected in the gross profit     mix.         Gross profit as a percent of sales and operating revenues     for the year ended December 31, 1993 was 41.9% as compared to     43.5% for the six months ended December 31, 1992, and 47.2%     for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  The decline, in     part, reflects the faster growth of new high-volume formats     such as Computer City and Incredible Universe which have     inherently lower gross margins than Radio Shack stores.     Combined Computer City and Incredible Universe sales     contributed 18.6%, 8.9% and 2.6% to consolidated sales in the     year ended December 31, 1993, the six months ended December     31, 1992 and the year ended June 30, 1992, respectively.     Competitive pressures in name brand electronics retailing     decreased Tandy Name Brand's gross margins in each of the     periods ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 and June 30, 1992.     Additionally, gross margins were impacted in the Tandy Name     Brand units by the increasing percentage of sales related to     the lower margin computer category.      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES        Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") as a     percent of sales and operating revenues for the year ended     December 31, 1994 declined from the year ended December 31,     1993, as well as from the year ended June 30, 1992 and from     the six months ended December 31, 1992.  The accompanying     table summarizes the breakdown of various components of SG&A     and their related percentage of sales and operating revenues.     The lower SG&A percentage reflects the lower costs, relative     to net sales and operating revenues, of the Company's newer     retail formats, as well as the operating costs achieved     through cost reduction programs.         Specific items impacting year-to-year comparisons are: (1)     for the year ended December 31, 1993, foreign currency     transactions include a $1,796,000 realized loss on the sale     of the cellular joint ventures; (2) other expenses in     calendar 1993 are net of a gain of $6,047,000 on the sale of     the cellular joint ventures, and (3) in fiscal year 1992, the     sale of a Japanese subsidiary, the assets of which were     primarily real estate, resulted in the recording of a gain of     $12,093,000 in other SG&A and a foreign currency gain of     $6,894,000.  The Company's exposure to foreign currency     fluctuations has decreased significantly with the divestiture     of the European marketing operations.         Although payroll and commissions expense has increased in     dollars, this cost has decreased as a percent of sales and     operating revenues in the year ended December 31, 1994 as     compared to the year ended December 31, 1993 and the fiscal     year ended June 30, 1992.  This is due to the increase in     Computer City and Incredible Universe sales as a percentage     of total sales and operating revenues from 2.6% in fiscal     1992 to 31.7% in 1994; these divisions have an inherently     lower salary structure when compared to Radio Shack.  In     addition, Computer City payroll expense as a percent of     Computer City sales has decreased from 1993 to 1994, while     that of the other retail divisions has remained approximately     the same from year to year.         Advertising costs have decreased as a percent of sales and     operating revenues in the year ended December 31, 1994 as     compared to the year ended December 31, 1993 and the fiscal     year ended June 30, 1992.  Management has focused its efforts     on more efficient advertising methods for Radio Shack     utilizing the Company's database of customer activity to     reduce costs while maintaining market awareness.  Advertising     costs increased in dollars compared to the prior year as new     Computer City and Incredible Universe stores opened and Radio     Shack shifted its marketing program to electronic media.  The     Company currently spends approximately 30% of its advertising     funds for television and radio commercials, compared to 20%     in previous years.  Radio Shack's advertising spots have been     shifted from sports-related events to prime-time shows in     order to reach a broader audience.         Rent expense has increased slightly in dollars but     decreased as a percent of sales during the year ended     December 31, 1994 as compared to the year ended December 31,     1993.  The increase in rent expense is due a net increase of     45 Radio Shack stores and the addition of 29 Computer City     stores and six Incredible Universe stores.  Incredible     Universe and Computer City formats typically have lower rent,     as a percent of sales, than Tandy overall.  As a percent of     sales, rent decreased from fiscal 1992 in comparison with     that for the year ended December 31, 1993 resulting in part     from Computer City's lower rent to sales ratio.         Other SG&A costs have increased over that of the prior     year due to several factors, including an increase in     discount fees paid to third party bank cards because of both     increased sales in the Computer City and Incredible Universe     formats and an increase in credit card sales as a percent of     sales.  Further, Radio Shack merchandise repair expenses     increases of $8,261,000 primarily reflected an increase in     extended service plan sales.  The change in other SG&A also     reflects the $6,047,000 gain noted above on the 1993 sale of     the Company's interests in two cellular telephone     manufacturing joint ventures and an increase in legal and     attorney fees of $4,671,000 in 1994.         The Company's credit operations have been successful in     supporting sales of the retail operations.  Private label     credit cards represented 35% of credit sales for the year     ended December 31, 1994, 34% for the year ended December 31,     1993, 36% for the six months ended December 31, 1992 and 43%     in fiscal 1992.  This decline in the percentage from 1992     results from increased sales through the Computer City and     Incredible Universe stores which have a lower percentage of     private label credit card usage.  Expenses associated with     the credit card operations, which are included in SG&A     expense, have decreased as a percent of sales due to a     decrease in credit losses reflecting a stronger economy.  As     discussed more fully in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated     Financial Statements, the Company has sold its Computer City     and Incredible Universe private label credit card portfolios     and expects in the first half of 1995 to sell its Radio Shack     and McDuff private label credit card portfolios.  Once     completed, the Company will no longer incur bad debt expense     or servicing costs associated with its private label credit     cards.  In 1995, the Company will begin to receive a fee from     the unrelated third party financer of its private label     credit card portfolio balance for the generation of normal     interest bearing accounts, and will pay a fee for the     generation of special purpose promotional accounts, such as     "zero percent interest for twelve months" programs.  See Note     3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for     further discussion of the Company's pending disposition of     its credit operations.

The dollar amount of depreciation and amortization expense     for the year ended December 31, 1994 increased 6% over the     dollar amount for the year ended December 31, 1993 and 14%     over that for the year ended June 30, 1992.  The increase is     due to additional capital expenditures related to the six     Incredible Universe stores added in 1994, and the addition of     29 Computer City stores this year.  Three Incredible Universe     stores and 25 Computer City stores were added from June 30,     1992 to December 31, 1993, thereby increasing depreciation     and amortization from fiscal 1992 to calendar 1993.      NET INTEREST (INCOME)/EXPENSE        Net interest income was $48,565,000 for the year ended     December 31, 1994, $25,831,000 for the year ended December     31, 1993 and $24,245,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30,     1992.  Interest income in all three years is primarily     attributable to the Company's credit card operations;     however, in fiscal 1994 the Company also received interest     income from the IRS reflecting the settlement of outstanding     tax issues of approximately $9,582,000, and interest income     earned on notes receivable from AST Research Inc. and     InterTAN which approximated $5,724,000 and $8,280,000,     respectively.  Increased short-term investments resulted from     proceeds received from the divestiture of discontinued     manufacturing and marketing operations, as well as from cash     provided by operating activities.  Interest income as it     relates to the AST Research Inc. and InterTAN notes     receivable is expected to continue in fiscal 1995.  See     further discussion on notes receivable in the "InterTAN     Update" and "Discontinued Operations" sections of     Management's Discussion and Analysis below.         Interest income from credit operations was $46,868,000 for     the year ended December 31, 1994, $57,401,000 for the year     ended December 31, 1993 and $62,307,000 for the fiscal year     ended June 30, 1992.  Interest income from the credit card     company has decreased in the last three years as a result of     increased use of certain special sales promotions and     marketing initiatives, some of which provide for no interest     charges for specified initial periods.  The decline in     average credit card receivables results from increased     payments from credit customers reflecting the overall     improvement in the economy and a desire by consumers to shift     debt to lower interest rate instruments.  Due to the December     1994 sale of the Computer City and Incredible Universe credit     card portfolios, the Company will no longer include any     interest income from these portfolios.  Since the sale, at     net book value, of the Radio Shack and McDuff portfolios is     contingent upon and subject to regulatory and rating agency     approvals, the Company will continue to include interest     income from these portfolios until final approval is received     and the sale is completed.  This sale is expected to close in     the first half of 1995.         The decrease in interest expense for the year ended     December 31, 1994 as compared to the years ended December 31,     1993 and June 30, 1992 is due to the decrease of total debt     and lower U.S. interest rates.  Short-term debt has decreased     41% and long-term debt has decreased 18% from December 31,     1993 due to the repayment of debt such as subordinated     debentures, medium-term notes and commercial paper.  The     Company expects overall interest expense to increase in 1995     as compared to interest expense in 1994.  As the Company     receives cash proceeds from the sale of its credit     operations, it will apply a significant portion of such     proceeds to the repayment of short-term debt, for store     expansion and to fund its 12,500,000 share repurchase     program, of which approximately 5,000,000 shares had been     repurchased as of December 31, 1994.      PROVISION FOR BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING        In December 1994, the Company adopted a business     restructuring plan to close or convert 233 of the 306 Tandy     Name Brand stores.  Closed stores will include 151     VideoConcepts, 30 McDuff mall stores and 19 McDuff     Supercenters.  Thirty-three other mall stores or McDuff     Supercenters will be converted to Radio Shack or Computer     City Express stores.  It is anticipated that a majority of     these planned closures will be completed by the end of the     first quarter of 1995.  Approximately 57 McDuff Supercenters     and 16 The Edge in Electronics stores will remain open and     will become part of the Specialty Retail Group of Radio     Shack.  A pre-tax charge of $89,071,000 was taken in the     fourth quarter of fiscal 1994 related to the closing and     conversion of these stores.  The components of the     restructuring charge and an analysis of the amounts charged     against the reserve are outlined in a table in Note 4 of the     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.         The lease obligations, termination benefits and conversion     of 33 stores will require cash outlays, most of which are     expected to be made during 1995.  The cash outlays will be     financed by operating cash flows.  Management anticipates     that pre-tax operating losses during the period of store     closures will approximate $6,000,000 to $8,000,000     (unaudited).         Sales and operating revenues associated with the closing     of Tandy Name Brand stores were approximately $261,990,000     (unaudited) and $271,914,000 (unaudited) for calendar years     1994 and 1993, respectively, and operating losses     approximated $18,125,000 (unaudited) and $15,342,000     (unaudited) for calendar 1994 and 1993, respectively.  During     the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992, sales and operating     revenues and operating losses from the closing stores were     approximately $254,531,000 (unaudited) and $10,169,000     (unaudited), respectively.  The results of the closing stores     for the six months ended December 31, 1992 are not presented     because, due to the seasonal nature of the stores'     operations, such results would not be comparable to any of     the twelve-month results for the other periods presented.  In     conjunction with this restructuring, 1,425 (unaudited)     employees will be terminated, most of which are store     employees and managers.  As of December 31, 1994, no     employees had been terminated and, accordingly, no     termination benefits had been paid.         The Company adopted a plan resulting in business     restructuring charges during the six months ended December     31, 1992 designed to improve the Company's competitiveness     and future profitability.  The pre-tax charge of $48,000,000     related primarily to the closing of 110 of the then 432 Tandy     Name Brand stores, mainly McDuff Supercenters in major market     areas and, to a lesser extent, the elimination of certain     product lines.  Some product lines were reduced or eliminated     after consideration of competitive factors and market trends.     These stores were closed in the first quarter of 1993.      GAIN ON SALE OF CREDIT OPERATIONS AND EXTENDED SERVICE       CONTRACTS        In December 1994 the Company entered into an agreement     with SPS Transaction Services, Inc., a majority-owned     subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover & Company ("SPS") to sell     its Computer City and Incredible Universe private label     credit card portfolios without recourse.  As a result of the     agreement, in which Tandy received cash of $85,764,000 and     will receive a deferred payment of $179,777,000, the Company     recognized a gain of $35,708,000 in the accompanying     Consolidated Statements of Income. The deferred payment     amount does not bear interest.  Principal will be paid     monthly with the total principal amount of $179,777,000 due     over a twelve month period.  The Company has discounted the     deferred payment by $3,477,000 to yield approximately 5% over     the twelve month payout period.  As a result, the discounted     deferred payment amount of $176,300,000 is classified as     current in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at     December 31, 1994.  The Company also signed a letter of     intent to sell its Radio Shack and McDuff private label     credit card portfolios at net book value and without recourse     to SPS in 1995, including the rights to the securitized     accounts (see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial     Statements).  The agreement for the sale of McDuff and Radio     Shack portfolios was completed in January 1995, subject only     to regulatory and rating agency approval which should be     forthcoming in the first half of 1995.  Tandy anticipates     receiving approximately $290,000,000 (unaudited) cash and a     deferred payment approximating $80,000,000 (unaudited), on     terms similar to the deferred payment arrangement mentioned     above.         Tandy National Bank (the "Bank"), a limited purpose     nationally chartered credit card bank, was established on May     11, 1994.  The Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tandy, was     created to operate the consumer credit card programs for     Tandy.  All new accounts approved after May 12, 1994 were     originated and owned by the Bank.  After the Company's sale     of the private label credit card portfolios, the Bank will     cease operations.         Effective December 1994, the Company transferred all of     its existing obligations with respect to extended service     contracts in force at December 31, 1994, with the exception     of certain contracts aggregating approximately $7,734,000, to     an unrelated third party.  The unrelated third party     contractually assumed all of the Company's legal obligations     and risk of future loss pursuant to the extended service     contracts in exchange for $75,059,000, of which $70,702,000     was paid in December 1994 and $4,357,000 was paid in February     1995.  As a result, the Company has recognized a gain of     $55,729,000 associated with this transaction in its     accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  The Company     will continue to provide repair services to customers who     tender products pursuant to the extended service contracts on     a non-exclusive basis.  The unrelated third party will pay     the Company competitive market rates for repairs on products     tendered pursuant to the extended service contracts.         The Company will continue to sell extended service     contracts on behalf of the unrelated third party and will     receive a commission upon the sale.  The commission will be     recognized as commission income at the time of sale.      PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES        The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31,     1994 was 37.6% and was 37.1% for the year ended December 31,     1993.  The higher effective tax rates for these two years as     compared to 36.2% for the year ended June 30, 1992 reflects     the impact of the increase of the federal tax rate to 35%     from 34% which was effective January 1, 1993.  The effective     tax rate for the six-month period ended December 31, 1992 was     34.2%.  This lower effective rate reflects the successful     resolution of certain IRS examinations during the period.         The IRS Dallas field office is reviewing the Company's     1987-1989 tax returns.  The review in Dallas could lead to     referral to the IRS National office.  The resolution of this     matter could result in additional taxes and interest to the     Company related to the spin-off of InterTAN and raises     questions about the private letter rulings issued by the IRS     regarding the spin-off and certain other tax matters.     Although aggregate additional taxes involved in these     transactions could potentially range from $0 to $46 million,     based on the advice of the Company's independent tax     advisors, the Company believes it would prevail if any tax     litigation had to be instituted.  Any ultimate tax assessment     would also include interest.  In any event, the Company     believes the ultimate resolution would have no material     impact on the Company's financial condition.         Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, "Accounting for     Income Taxes", which the Company adopted January 1, 1993, is     discussed in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial     Statements.      DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS        On June 25, 1993, the Board of Directors of Tandy adopted     a formal plan of divestiture under which the Company would     sell its computer manufacturing and marketing businesses, the     O'Sullivan Industries, Inc. ("O'Sullivan") ready-to-assemble     furniture manufacturing and related marketing business, the     Memtek Products division and the Lika printed circuit board     business.           Computer Manufacturing.  The Company closed the sale of        the computer manufacturing and marketing businesses to AST        Research, Inc. ("AST") on July 13, 1993.  In accordance        with the terms of the definitive agreement between Tandy        and AST, Tandy received $15,000,000 upon closing of the        sale.  The balance of the purchase price of $90,000,000        is payable by a promissory note.  The principal amount of        this promissory note is payable by July 12, 1996; interest        is accrued and paid annually.  The interest rate on the        promissory note is currently 4.94% per annum and is        adjusted annually, not to exceed 5% per annum.  The terms        of the promissory note stipulate that the outstanding        principal balance may be paid at maturity at AST's option        in cash or the common stock of AST.  However, at Tandy's        option not more than 50% of the initial principal balance        may be paid in common stock of AST.  The promissory note        is supported by a standby letter of credit in the amount        of the lesser of $100,000,000 or 70% of the outstanding        principal amount of the promissory note.  At December 31,        1994, the standby letter of credit approximated        $67,704,000.            In October 1993, the Company sold its computer        marketing operations in France to AST, together with        certain other multimedia assets and additional Swedish        inventory, in return for an increase in the principal        amount of the promissory note described above to        $96,700,000.  The Company has discounted this note by        $2,000,000 and the discount will be recognized as interest        using the effective interest rate method over the life of        the note.            Memtek Products.  On November 10, 1993, the Company        executed a definitive agreement with Hanny Magnetics        (B.V.I.) Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation        ("Hanny"), to purchase certain assets of the Company's        Memtek Products operations, including the license        agreement with Memorex Telex, N.V. for the use of the        Memorex trademark on licensed consumer electronics        products.  This sale closed on December 16, 1993.  Hanny        is a subsidiary of Hanny Magnetics (Holdings) Limited, a        Bermuda corporation, listed on the Hong Kong Stock        Exchange.  Proceeds from this sale aggregated $69,602,000.        The $7,102,000 receivable which remained at December 31,        1993 was paid in 1994.            O'Sullivan Industries.  On January 27, 1994 the Company        announced that it had reached an agreement with the        underwriters to sell all the common stock of O'Sullivan        Industries Holdings, Inc., the parent company of        O'Sullivan, to the public at $22 per share.  The net        proceeds realized by Tandy in the initial public offering,        together with a $40,000,000 cash dividend from O'Sullivan,        approximated $350,000,000.  The initial public offering        closed on February 2, 1994.            Tandy has recognized income of approximately        $4,399,000, net of tax, during the year ended December 31,        1994, pursuant to a Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit        Reimbursement Agreement between Tandy and O'Sullivan under        which Tandy receives payments from O'Sullivan        approximating the federal tax benefit that O'Sullivan        realizes from the increased tax basis of its assets        resulting from the initial public offering.  The higher        tax basis increases O'Sullivan's tax deductions and,        accordingly, reduces income taxes payable by O'Sullivan.        These payments will be made over a 15-year time period and        are contingent upon O'Sullivan's taxable income each year.        The Company is recognizing these payments as additional        sale proceeds and gain in the year in which the payments        become due and payable to the Company pursuant to the Tax        Sharing and Tax Benefit Reimbursement Agreement.  The        additional gain is recorded as a reduction of SG&A expense        in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.            Lika.  On October 11, 1994, Tandy sold the assets used        in its Lika(R) printed circuit board division to Viktron        Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership.  The        proceeds from the sale and liquidation of assets        approximated $16,380,000 which included $7,754,000 in        cash, proceeds from liquidation of retained assets of        $5,594,000 and secured promissory notes for $3,032,000.         In connection with the computer manufacturing sale, the     Memtek Products sale and the Lika sale, the Company agreed to     retain certain liabilities primarily relating to warranty     obligations on products sold prior to the sale.  Management     believes that accrued reserves, as reflected on its December     31, 1994 balance sheet, are adequate to cover estimated     future warranty obligations for the products.         CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY                                                    Year Ended             Six Months Ended    Year Ended                                                December 31,              December 31,       June 30,                                         ---------------------------     --------------     ----------     (In thousands)                         1994             1993             1992             1992     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                Operating activities                $  268,938       $  322,294       $   13,680       $  146,782     Investing activities                   239,085          (52,149)         (90,171)        (102,190)     Financing activities                  (515,625)        (169,536)          82,663         (124,431)             Tandy's cash flow and liquidity, in management's opinion,     remains strong.  During the year ended December 31, 1994,     cash provided by operations was $268,938,000 as compared to     $322,294,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993.  The     decreased cash flow from operations was due partially to the     financing of receivables and inventories related to the     expansion of Computer City and Incredible Universe store     chains.  The increase of $261,071,000 in cash used to fund     accounts receivable was due primarily to the increase in     Tandy Credit receivables related to increased retail sales by     Computer City and Incredible Universe and the use of certain     special sales promotions and marketing initiatives, some of     which provide for no interest charges for specified initial     periods.  Inventory required $156,129,000 more cash in 1994     than in 1993.  The increase in inventory during 1994 related     to new store openings and increases in average inventory to     ensure in-stock positions throughout the Christmas selling     season.  Partially offsetting the cash used to finance     receivables and inventory were the sale of the Computer City     and Incredible Universe private label credit card portfolios     which provided cash of $85,764,000 as well as increases in     accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes which     provided $184,017,000 more cash in 1994 than in 1993.  The     1994 increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and     income taxes is net of the cash expended, approximating     $70,702,000, associated with the transfer of the legal     obligation and risk of loss for existing extended service     contracts to an unrelated third party.         During the year ended December 31, 1993, cash provided by     operations was $322,294,000 as compared to $146,782,000 for     the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  The increased cash flow     from operations in calendar 1993 compared to fiscal year     ended June 30, 1992 was due partially to receivables which     provided $30,133,000 in cash in 1993 but used $121,719,000 in     1992.  The decline in accounts receivable in 1993 versus 1992     was due to the liquidation of receivables related to the     divested operations and lower consumer receivables related to     the Company's private label credit card portfolio.  The     latter reason reflects consumers' desires to liquidate debt     with higher interest rates and the overall improved economy.     Inventory required less cash in calendar 1993 than in fiscal     1992.         Investing activities involved capital expenditures     primarily for retail expansion totaling $180,559,000 for the     year ended December 31, 1994, $129,287,000 for the year ended     December 31, 1993, and $127,495,000 for the year ended June     30, 1992.  Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and     equipment in 1994 resulted primarily from a sale-leaseback     transaction involving certain Incredible Universe stores     which netted the Company $52,719,000 in cash.  Proceeds     received from the sale of divested operations totaled     $359,004,000 and $111,988,000 during the years ended December     31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  See "Discontinued     Operations".  Investing activities in 1993 also included     $31,663,000 for the purchase of InterTAN's bank debt and the     extension and funding of a working capital line of credit.     See "InterTAN Update" for further information.  Future store     expansions and refurbishments and other capital expenditures     are expected to approximate $180,000,000 to $200,000,000 per     year over the next two years and will be funded primarily     from available cash, cash flow from operations and proceeds     from the sale of the private label credit card portfolios.         Purchases of treasury stock used cash of $275,415,000,     $27,650,000 and $527,773,000 in 1994, 1993 and fiscal 1992,     respectively.  Increases in treasury stock purchases in 1994     related primarily to the share repurchase program.  See     "Capital Structure and Financial Condition" for further     discussion.  Financing activities in fiscal 1992 included the     February 1992 sale of $2.14 Depositary Shares of the     Company's Series C Preferred Equity Redemption Convertible     Stock ("PERCS") for $429,982,000 and the subsequent purchase     of common stock with such proceeds.  Sales of treasury stock     to the Company's Stock Purchase Program generated cash of     $41,579,000, $42,067,000 and $49,590,000 in 1994, 1993, and     fiscal 1992, respectively.  Dividends paid, net of tax, in     1994, 1993 and fiscal 1992 amounted to $74,512,000,     $74,873,000 and $56,132,000, respectively.  The increase in     dividends since fiscal 1992 is mainly the result of dividends     paid on the PERCS which were issued in fiscal 1992.  As a     result of the Company calling its PERCS in March 1995, the     Company will eliminate its dividend payment to the PERCS of     approximately $32,000,000.  However, it will pay upon     conversion a dividend to the PERCS shareholders of     approximately $4,815,000.  Preferred stock dividends are     expected to exceed $11,000,000 in 1995.  The Company plans to     fund the preferred stock and common stock dividends with     available cash and cash flow from operations, as well as from     the proceeds from the sale of its credit card portfolios.         In 1994 and 1993, the Company decreased short-term     borrowings by $110,393,000 and $46,885,000, respectively, and     increased short-term borrowings by $57,533,000 in fiscal     1992.  The consistent reduction in short-term borrowings has     been funded primarily by proceeds from the sale of divested     operations and cash provided by operations.  The Company's     primary source of short-term debt, for which borrowings and     repayments have been presented net in the Consolidated     Statements of Cash Flows, consists of short-term seasonal     bank debt and commercial paper.  The commercial paper matures     within ninety days as does the short-term seasonal bank debt.           Following are the current credit ratings for Tandy     Corporation, which are investment grade:                                              Standard          Category              Moody's     and Poor's          --------              -------     ----------          Medium Term Notes      Baa2           A-          ESOP Senior Notes      Baa2           A-          Commercial Paper       P-2            A-2      CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION        The Company's balance sheet and financial condition     continue to be strong.  The Company's available borrowing     facilities as of December 31, 1994 are detailed in Note 9 of     the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.         In the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992, the Company issued     150,000 PERCS shares and used the proceeds of this offering     to purchase $430,000,000 of the Company's common stock for     treasury.  The PERCS are discussed further in Note 18 of the     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  On January 23,     1995, Tandy announced that it had exercised its right to call     the issued and outstanding PERCS for conversion on March 10,     1995 prior to the mandatory conversion date of April 15,     1995.  To complete the redemption, the Company will issue     from treasury stock approximately 11,816,000 shares of Tandy     Corporation common stock.         On August 1, 1994, the Company announced that its Board of     Directors authorized management to purchase up to 7,500,000     shares of its common stock in addition to shares required for     employee plans.  On December 30, 1994, the Board of Directors     authorized management to increase the share repurchase     program to 12,500,000 shares.  Purchases will be made from     time to time in the open market, and it is expected that     funding of the program will come from existing cash,     short-term debt and proceeds from the sale of the credit card     portfolios.  At December 31, 1994, approximately 5,000,000     shares had been repurchased under this program.         The Company's issue of 10% subordinated debentures due     June 30, 1994 was called by the Company on February 23, 1994     for redemption on April 1, 1994.  The redemption was at 100%     of face value or $32,431,000.         The revolving credit backup facilities to Tandy's     commercial paper program were renewed in May 1994.  These     facilities are to be used only if maturing commercial paper     cannot be repaid due to an inability to sell new commercial     paper.  This agreement is composed of two facilities--one for     $200,000,000 expiring May 1995 and another $200,000,000     facility expiring in May 1997.  Annual commitment fees for     the facilities are 2/25 of 1% per annum and 1/8 of 1% per     annum, respectively, whether used or unused.         In fiscal 1991, the Company filed a shelf registration for     $500,000,000, of which $400,000,000 was designated for     medium-term notes, and Tandy Credit Corporation increased its     medium-term note program by $200,000,000.  During fiscal     1991, short-term debt was refinanced by the issuance of     $155,500,000 in medium-term notes.  Tandy's medium-term notes     outstanding at December 31, 1994 totaled $73,044,000 compared     to $125,479,000 at December 31, 1993.         The total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 17.1%, 22.8%,     27.3% and 23.4% at December 31, 1994, December 31, 1993,     December 31, 1992 and June 30, 1992, respectively.  This     debt-to-capitalization ratio should improve further in fiscal     1995 due to the cash proceeds from the sales of the credit     operations being used to retire debt, fund the repurchase of     outstanding common shares into treasury shares and for other     purposes.         Management believes that the Company's present borrowing     capacity is greater than the established credit lines and     long-term debt in place.  Management also believes that the     Company's cash flow from operations, cash and short-term     investments and its available borrowing facilities are more     than adequate to fund planned store expansion and to meet     debt service and dividend requirements and to fund its share     repurchase program.      INFLATION        Inflation has not significantly impacted the Company over     the past three years.  Management does not expect inflation     to have a significant impact on operations in the foreseeable     future unless global situations substantially affect the     world economy.      NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS        The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants     issued Statement of Position 93-7, "Reporting on Advertising     Costs," in December 1993.  The statement generally requires     all advertising costs to be expensed in the period in which     the costs are incurred or the first time the advertising     takes place, and is effective for years beginning after June     15, 1994.  The statement is not anticipated to have any     material effect on the results of operations or financial     condition of the Company.      SALE OF JOINT VENTURE INTEREST        During the quarter ended September 30, 1993, the Company     entered into definitive agreements with Nokia Corporation     ("Nokia") to sell the Company's interests in two cellular     telephone manufacturing joint ventures with Nokia, TMC     Company Ltd. located in Masan, Korea, and TNC Company located     in Fort Worth, Texas.  Pursuant to the terms of the     definitive agreements, the Company received an aggregate of     approximately $31,700,000 for its interests in these joint     ventures.  The Company also entered into a three-year     Preferred Supplier Agreement pursuant to which it has agreed     to purchase from Nokia substantially all of Radio Shack's     requirements for cellular telephones at prevailing     competitive market prices at the time of the purchase.  These     operations were not part of the overall divestment plan     adopted in June 1993 by the Company's Board of Directors;     therefore, the gain on the sale and their results of     operations were not included in discontinued operations.      INTERTAN UPDATE        InterTAN, the former foreign retail operations of Tandy,     was spun off to Tandy stockholders as a tax-free dividend in     fiscal 1987.  Under the merchandise purchase terms of the     original distribution agreement, InterTAN could purchase on     payment terms products sold or secured by Tandy.  A&A     International ("A&A"), a subsidiary of Tandy, was the     exclusive purchasing agent for products originating in the     Far East for InterTAN.         On July 16, 1993 InterTAN had an account payable to Tandy     of approximately $17,000,000, of which $7,600,000 was in     default.  InterTAN's outstanding purchase orders for     merchandise placed under the distribution agreement with     Tandy, but not yet shipped, totaled approximately     $44,000,000.  Because InterTAN had defaulted, on July 16     Tandy terminated the merchandise purchase terms of the     distribution agreement and the license agreements.  Tandy     offered InterTAN interim license agreements which expired     July 22, 1993, unless extended.  The agreements were extended     on July 23, 1993.         On July 30, 1993 Trans World Electronics, Inc. ("Trans     World"), a subsidiary of Tandy, reached agreement with     InterTAN's banking syndicate to buy approximately $42,000,000     of InterTAN's debt at a negotiated, discounted price.  The     closing of this purchase occurred on August 5, 1993, at which     time Tandy resumed limited shipments to InterTAN and granted     a series of short-term, interim licenses pending the     execution of new license and merchandise agreements.  The     debt purchased from the banks has been restructured into a     seven-year note with interest of 8.64% due semiannually     beginning February 25, 1994 and semiannual principal payments     beginning February 25, 1995 (the "Series A" note).  Trans     World provided approximately $10,000,000 in working capital     and trade credit to InterTAN.  Interest on the working     capital loan (the "Series B" note) of 8.11% is due     semiannually beginning February 25, 1994 with the principal     due in full on August 25, 1996.  Trans World also has     received warrants with a five-year term exercisable for     approximately 1,450,000 shares of InterTAN common stock at an     exercise price of $6.618 per share.  As required by an     agreement with Tandy, InterTAN has registered the warrants     under the Securities Act of 1933.  At December 31, 1994,     InterTAN's common stock price, as quoted in the Wall Street                                                     -----------     Journal, was $8.125 per share.  The fair market value of the     -------     warrants at December 31, 1994 approximates $2,500,000.         In addition to the bank debt purchased by Trans World and     the working capital loan, InterTAN's obligations to Trans     World included two additional notes for approximately     $23,665,000 (the "Series C" note) and $24,037,000 (the     "Series D" note) with interest rates of 7.5% and 8%,     respectively.  The notes represented the restructuring of     InterTAN accounts payable for merchandise already shipped and     required monthly interest payments.  All principal and     interest on the Series C note was paid in full by December     31, 1993.  The Series D note was paid in full during the     first quarter of 1994.  All of Tandy's debt from InterTAN is     secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of     InterTAN's assets in Canada and the U.K.         A new merchandise agreement was reached with InterTAN in     October 1993 which requires future purchase orders to be     backed by letters of credit posted by InterTAN.  New license     agreements provide for a future royalty to Tandy.  InterTAN     had obligations for purchase orders outstanding for     merchandise ordered by A&A for InterTAN but not yet shipped     totaling approximately $24,705,000 at December 31, 1994.         InterTAN has increased its bank revolving credit facility     with the new banking syndicate to Canadian $60,000,000 (U.S.     $42,774,000 equivalent at December 31, 1994).  In the case of     InterTAN's default on the bank credit line, Tandy will, at     the option of InterTAN's new banking syndicate, purchase     InterTAN's inventory and related accounts receivable at 50%     of their net book value, up to the amount of outstanding bank     loans, but not to exceed Canadian $60,000,000.  In that     event, Tandy could foreclose on its first priority lien on     InterTAN's assets in Canada and the U.K.  If Tandy fails to     purchase the inventory and related accounts receivable of     InterTAN from the banking syndicate, the syndicate upon     notice to Tandy and expiration of time, can foreclose upon     InterTAN's assets in Canada and the U.K. ahead of Tandy.  The     inventory repurchase agreement between InterTAN's banking     syndicate and Tandy has been amended and restated to reflect     the foregoing.         As of December 31, 1994 InterTAN owed Tandy an aggregate     of $39,965,000, net of discount.  The current portion of the     obligation approximates $8,707,000 and the non-current     portion approximates $31,258,000.  In 1994 Tandy recognized     $3,855,000 in accretion of discount on the note receivable     from InterTAN which resulted from the purchase of the bank     debt at a discounted price.  Accretion of this discount is     based on the effective interest rate method.  Tandy     recognized sales to and commission income from InterTAN of     approximately $19,764,000 and interest income of $8,280,000     during fiscal 1994.  During the year ended December 31, 1993,     Tandy recognized approximately $93,315,000 of sales to     InterTAN and interest income of $3,085,000.  Tandy's sales to     InterTAN totaled $90,130,000 during the six months ended     December 31, 1992 and $171,126,000 during fiscal 1992.         A&A will continue as the exclusive purchasing agent for     InterTAN in the Far East on a commission basis.  Commencing     in March 1994, only the purchasing agent commission and sales     by Tandy manufacturing plants to InterTAN were recorded as     sales and operating revenues.  InterTAN purchases from third     parties through A&A are no longer recorded as sales,     reflecting the arrangement under the new merchandise     agreement.  Accordingly, sales by Tandy to InterTAN in 1994     are considerably lower than in prior years, however, the     earned income relating thereto was not materially different.         Through February 1995 InterTAN has met all of its payment     obligations to Tandy.  In addition, its operations have     improved in fiscal 1995 as evidenced by its published net     income for the six months ended December 31, 1994     approximating $17,704,000 or $1.11 per fully diluted share as     opposed to net income of $4,567,000 or $0.49 per fully     diluted share for the same period in the prior year.  As a     result, nothing has come to the attention of management which     would indicate that InterTAN would not be able to continue to     meet its payment obligations pursuant to the debt agreements     with Tandy.         Canadian tax authorities are reviewing InterTAN's Canadian     subsidiary's 1987-89 tax returns.  The Company cannot     determine whether the ultimate resolution of that review will     have an effect on InterTAN's ability to meet its obligations     to Tandy, but at the present, the Company believes that the     ultimate resolution of this review will not impair InterTAN's     ability to meet its obligations to Tandy.
