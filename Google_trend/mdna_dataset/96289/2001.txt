ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND  RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS ("MD&A").  FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS With the  exception of  historical  information,  the matters  discussed in MD&A contain forward-looking  statements that involve various risks and uncertainties and are indicated by words such as "anticipates," "expects," "believes," "will," "should,"  "could,"  and similar  words and  phrases.  Factors  that could cause RadioShack  Corporation's  ("RadioShack"  or the  "Company")  actual  results to differ  materially  from  management's  projections,  forecasts,  estimates  and expectations include, but are not limited to, the following:  o   changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity exerted by current     competitors  and  potential  new  competition  from both  retail  stores and     alternative  methods  or  channels  of  distribution,  such  as  e-commerce,     telephone shopping services and mail order; o   the  inability to successfully implement and execute RadioShack's  strategic     initiatives, including the development  of its  new strategic business units     ("SBUs") and emerging sales channels, as well as new  alliances which may be     formed with other retailers,  such as Blockbuster Inc.  ("Blockbuster")  and     third party service providers; o   changes in general U.S.  or regional U.S. economic conditions including, but     not  limited  to,  consumer  credit availability, interest rates, inflation,     personal discretionary spending levels and consumer sentiment and confidence     about the economy in general; o   the inability to  successfully market and execute the www.RadioShack.com(SM)     website  and its  coordination  with   RadioShack  retail  outlets  and  the     Company's other existing and/or emerging sales channels; o   the  presence or absence of new services or products and product features in     the  merchandise  categories  RadioShack  sells  and  unexpected  changes in     RadioShack's actual merchandise sales mix; o   the  inability to  maintain  profitable  contracts or execute business plans     with service providers  relating to  cellular and PCS telephones, direct-to-     home  ("DTH")  satellite  programming,   Internet   access  and   high-speed     bandwidth; o   the  inability to collect the level of anticipated residual income, consumer     acquisition fees and rebates for products and third  party  services offered     by RadioShack; o   the inability  to  successfully implement and execute RadioShack's strategic     alliances with Microsoft  Corporation ("Microsoft"), Cellco Partnership (dba     Verizon Wireless), At Home Corporation (Excite@Home) and/or Blockbuster; o   the inability  of the  Company  to  fully  recover  investments  made in the     securities of other companies; o   lack of  availability  or access to  sources of supply inventory (as a large     importer  of  consumer  electronic  products  from  Asia,  unfavorable trade     imbalances could negatively affect RadioShack); o   the inability to  retain and  grow an effective management team in a dynamic     environment or changes in  the cost or availability of a suitable work force     to manage and support RadioShack's service-driven operating strategies; o   the  imposition  of new  restrictions or  regulations  regarding the sale of     products  and/or  services  RadioShack  sells or  changes  in tax  rules and     regulations applicable to RadioShack; o   the  adoption  rate  and  market  demand for high-speed  Internet  and other     Internet-related services; or o   the  occurrence  of  severe  weather  events  which prohibit  consumers from     travelling to the Company's retail locations,  especially  during  the  peak     Christmas season.  Both the United States  retail  industry and the  specialty  retail  industry in particular are dynamic by nature and have undergone significant changes over the past several years.  RadioShack's ability to anticipate and successfully respond to continuing challenges is key to achieving its expectations.  STOCK SPLIT On May 25, 1999, RadioShack's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split of RadioShack common stock,  payable on June 21, 1999. All references to the number of  shares  (other  than  common  stock  issued or  outstanding  for 1998 on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Stockholders' Equity), per share amounts, cash dividends and any other reference to shares,  unless otherwise noted,  have been adjusted to reflect the split on a retroactive  basis.  Previously  awarded stock  options,  restricted  stock  awards and all other  agreements  payable in RadioShack's  common  stock have also been  adjusted  or amended to reflect  the split.

Additionally,  sales to RadioShack's dealer/franchise outlets experienced strong growth throughout the year. RadioShack's comparable store sales increase was due primarily to increased sales of  communications  products and sales of audio and video  equipment,  which  includes DTH satellite  systems and services.  Despite weakening in the retail sector,  RadioShack  expects a positive store sales gain for 2001. The following table summarizes  RadioShack's retail sales breakdown by category as a percent of total RadioShack retail sales (excluding  outside sales from retail support operations):                                               Percent of RadioShack Retail Sales                                                   Year Ended December 31,                                     ----------------------------------------------                                      2000      1999      1998      1997      1996                                     ------    ------    ------    ------    ------            Communications                       27.9%     29.3%     28.5%     27.5%     24.4% Electronic parts, accessories  and specialty equipment             24.8      27.2      30.0      31.5      32.3 Audio and video                      22.5      17.1      15.5      16.8      18.0 Personal electronics and seasonal     8.6       9.4      10.4      11.6      12.4 Personal computers and peripherals    8.7       8.7       9.1       9.4      10.4 Services and other                    7.5       8.3       6.5       3.2       2.5                                     ------    ------    ------    ------    ------                                     100.0%    100.0%    100.0%    100.0%    100.0%                                     ======    ======    ======    ======    ======    The communications  category includes wireless  communications  such as cellular and PCS  telephones,  as well as  residential  telephones,  answering  machines, pagers  and  other  related  telephony  products.  The  communications  category increased 10% in dollars, but decreased as a percentage of total retail sales to 27.9% in 2000, from 29.3% in 1999.  This category  decrease was due to the audio and video  category  becoming a larger  percentage of total retail  sales.  Unit sales of PCS and cellular  telephones  increased  23% over the prior year to 4.1 million  units.  Unit and dollar sales of both PCS and cellular  telephones  are expected to continue to increase in 2001.  Sales of electronic parts,  accessories and specialty  equipment  decreased as a percentage  of total  retail sales in 2000 when  compared to 1999,  despite a 5% sales gain.  The  category was 24.8% of  RadioShack's  retail sales mix in 2000, down from 27.2% in 1999,  primarily due to the audio and video category becoming a higher  percent of the  product  mix in 2000.  This  category  is  expected to increase in sales, but decrease as a percentage of RadioShack's retail sales mix in 2001.  Sales in the audio and video category increased  approximately 47% in 2000, when compared  to 1999,  due  primarily  to the June 2000  launch of The RCA  Digital Entertainment  Center at RadioShack and a significant  increase in DTH satellite system and services sales. In addition,  the audio and video category  increased from  17.1% of the  retail  sales  mix in 1999 to 22.5% in 2000.  This  category includes  televisions,  VCRs,  camcorders,  digital  video disc  (DVD)  players, digital cameras, CD shelf systems and other digital  entertainment  products, in addition to DTH satellite  systems and services.  Management  believes the audio and video category will continue to increase in dollar sales and as a percent of RadioShack's total retail sales in 2001.  Personal  electronics  and seasonal  products  decreased to 8.6% of RadioShack's retail sales mix in 2000 from 9.4% in 1999, due primarily to an overall shift in the product mix described above.  This category  experienced a 5% sales increase over the prior year as a result of increased sales of giftable items, electronic gadgets and remote control cars.  Sales of personal  computers and peripherals  were 8.7% of  RadioShack's  retail sales in both 2000 and 1999. This category had a 12% unit sales gain in CPUs and had a 15% dollar  sales gain for the year.  The  average  selling  price of CPUs decreased 6%, in line with the general market decline. The average selling price of CPUs and monitors, for the industry in general as well as for RadioShack,  is expected to decrease slightly in 2001.  Despite this downward trend,  management believes  that  the  higher  unit  sales  volumes  of  personal   computers  and peripherals,  as well as anticipated  increased sales of handheld  computers and Internet  appliances,  will contribute to increased  sales of this category.  In addition,  increases in sales in the personal computer and peripherals  category should  strengthen  sales of higher gross margin products and services,  such as accessories and extended service contracts.  Sales in the services and other category,  which includes  residual  income,  as well as income from  prepaid  wireless  airtime,  repair  services  and extended service  contracts,  increased  approximately 7% in dollars,  but decreased as a percent  of  RadioShack  retail  sales to 7.5% in 2000  from  8.3% in 1999.  The increase in sales was primarily due to an increase in residual  income  received from RadioShack's third party providers of wireless communications,  offset by a decrease in sales of prepaid wireless  airtime.  Sales in the services and other category also decreased due to the reclassification of RadioShack.com sales from this category  to the appropriate product categories in 2000. Residual income is also  earned on sales of Sprint  long  distance  and paging  services.  Residual income varies by third party service provider, but is typically a portion of the continuing  service  revenue  paid  by  the  consumer  to the  service  provider throughout the ensuing months and/or years of that consumer's  subscription.  In 2000,  RadioShack  earned  approximately  $104.0  million  of  residual  income, compared to $63.0  million in 1999.  At year end,  the Company  earned  residual income on  approximately  6.1 million  service  provider  subscribers.  Residual income is expected to continue  to  increase  in 2001;  however,  increases  are dependent upon such factors as continued usage of certain services and stability of average revenue per subscriber, among other factors.  Think Growth Initiative:  In December 2000,  RadioShack  announced its new Think Growth initiative. This initiative is designed to generate incremental sales and profit  opportunities  beyond the Company's existing category and customer base. Three Strategic Business Units were formed to better align the organization with its  business  strategy  of  demystifying  technology  for the mass  market and, ultimately,  to become America's  Connectivity  Solution.  The three SBUs formed were The  Connecting  People SBU, The  Connecting  Places SBU and The Connecting Things SBU.  The Connecting  Things SBU will focus on RadioShack's  core product offerings of parts and accessories,  seasonal products including toys,  personal  electronics and  batteries,  in  addition  to parts and  components  offered  to  commercial customers.  In light of  increased  sales of  giftable  items  and an  increased business to business  customer focus through  RadioShack's  online  presence and planned direct marketing efforts,  along with the advent of digital  convergence which requires additional  accessories,  management  anticipates  enhanced sales growth for these highly profitable products.  The Connecting People SBU will concentrate on communications  products and third party services which not only include current  offerings,  but also capture such emerging  technologies as combining wireless products and the Internet,  as well as  high-speed  video  phones.  The  various  products  included in this SBU are telephone and telephone accessories, wireless phones and accessories, pagers and other related services,  as well as radio communications  devices. The Company's strategic allies for the Connecting People SBU include both Sprint and Verizon.  The  Connecting  Places SBU's focus will include  personal  computers,  Internet appliances,  hand-held  computer devices and related  products,  audio and video products and services, including DTH satellite systems and services and  dial-up and broadband Internet access,  among others.  Many of the products and services in this SBU are aimed at providing  customer  solutions  for  connecting  to and utilizing high-speed bandwidth.  Bandwidth refers to volume at which data can be transmitted and, depending on the volume delivered, may enable consumers to have such capabilities as instant and/or high-speed Internet access, movies on demand and multiple  phone/fax  connections  through a single phone or cable line. This SBU  utilizes  the  Company's   strategic   alliances   with  Compaq,   DIRECTV, Excite@Home,  Microsoft  and Thomson to offer  convenience,  service and product specialties.  Each  SBU is  designed  to find  more  efficient  and  convenient  ways to serve RadioShack  sales channels.  In addition to its 5,100  company-owned  stores and 2,100  dealer/franchise  outlets,   RadioShack's  existing  and  emerging  sales channels include the www.RadioShack.com  website and catalog operations, as well as a sophisticated outbound and inbound telephone call center.  In terms of its online  presence,  the Company's  clicks and mortar  strategy is designed  to  not  only  draw  repeat  traffic  to  its  website,  but  also  to RadioShack's retail stores.  RadioShack.com derives a significant portion of its revenue  from  sales  to  businesses,   government   agencies  and   educational institutions.  These commercial  customers may order product via the web, phone, mail or fax with no minimum order required. In 2001, RadioShack plans to further enhance its sales to  commercial  customers  via direct  mail and  telemarketing efforts.  On February 27, 2001,  RadioShack  announced an alliance  with  Blockbuster,  to introduce  a  RadioShack   "store-within-a-store"   concept  within  Blockbuster locations. The size of the RadioShack merchandising areas will vary depending on the size of the participating  Blockbuster  store, but may range from 600-square foot sections to smaller kiosks.  A wide selection of RadioShack's  most popular product and service offerings will be featured;  however, specific inventory for the stores will be  determined as the program  moves  forward.  The initial test phase  calls for 130  select  Blockbuster  stores  in four  markets  to  contain "store-within-a-store"  fixtures  by  summer  2001.  If the  test  phase  proves successful and the alliance goes forward, management believes that this alliance could  provide  access  to  complementary  demographics,   as  well  as   expand RadioShack's current outlet base.  GROSS PROFIT  Gross  profit  for  RadioShack  was  $2,369.6  million or 49.4% of net sales and operating  revenues,  compared with  $2,083.5  million or 50.5% of net sales and operating revenues in 1999. This gross profit percentage  decrease was partially due to a shift within RadioShack's product offerings to increased sales of third party branded audio and video products,  primarily DTH satellite systems,  which have a lower gross margin than RadioShack overall. To a lesser degree, the gross profit percentage decrease was due to a decrease in the wireless  communications gross  margin.   The  decrease  was  further  impacted  by  increased  sales  to dealer/franchise  stores,  which have a lower gross margin percentage than sales to retail  customers.  This  decrease  was  partially  offset by an  increase in residual income,  which has 100% gross margin,  as well as by an increase in the gross profit percentages for both the personal computer and peripherals category and  the  parts,  accessories  and  specialty  equipment  category.   Management anticipates  that  gross  profit as a  percentage  of net  sales  and  operating revenues  could  continue to decrease  during 2001,  when  compared to 2000.  An expected increase in residual income should partially offset this decrease.

(2)  Includes  expenses  related to Computer City, Inc. ("Computer City") before      its sale to CompUSA Inc.("CompUSA") on August 31, 1998.   RadioShack's SG&A expense increased 9.9% in dollars,  but decreased as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues to 34.1% for the year ended  December  31, 2000 from 36.0% for the year ended December 31, 1999. This 1.9 percentage  point decrease  in the SG&A  percentage  in 2000 was due  primarily  to the  favorable effect of increased sales at RadioShack during 2000.  Payroll  expense for RadioShack  increased by $94.4 million to $836.2 million in 2000, but decreased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to 17.4% in 2000,  compared to 18.0% in 1999.  This dollar  increase  was due  primarily  to RadioShack  retail store  expansions  and increases in  personnel,  commissions, bonuses and other incentives resulting from RadioShack's strong comparable store sales and profits.  Rent  expense for the  Company  increased  in dollars by $9.7  million to $215.2 million  in 2000,  but  decreased  as a percent  of  RadioShack's  net sales and operating  revenues to 4.5% in 2000 from 5.0% in 1999. The rent increase was due primarily to 22 new RadioShack store openings, net of store closures, throughout the year, as well as lease renewals at slightly higher rates. The 0.5 percentage point decrease was due primarily to the favorable effect of increased comparable RadioShack stores sales on the expense rate structure.  Advertising  expense for  RadioShack  increased  $27.2  million in dollars,  but decreased as a percentage of  RadioShack's  net sales and operating  revenues to $227.1 million and 4.7% of sales in 2000, compared to $199.9 million and 4.8% of sales in 1999.  The dollar  increase was due primarily to a shift in advertising from print to television advertising.  In addition, the decrease as a percentage of sales  and  operating  revenues  reflects  the  sales  leverage  gained  from RadioShack's sales increase.  In 2001,  RadioShack's  SG&A  expense is  expected to increase in dollars due to additional  sales volume and normal  inflation,  but decrease as a percentage of net sales and operating  revenues.  This  decreased  percentage of net sales and operating  revenue is expected as a result of increased  sales  leverage  gained from anticipated  comparable  store sales increases and, to a lesser extent,  an increase in new store openings.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $36.1  million for 2000 versus $16.8 million for 1999.  Interest expense increased to $53.9 million in 2000, from $37.2 million in 1999. This increase was primarily  the result of an increase in  RadioShack's  average debt  outstanding  throughout  2000, due to share  repurchases and the Company's investment in inventory,  as well as to an increase in short-term interest rates when compared to the prior year.  Interest income  decreased almost 13% to $17.8 million in 2000 from $20.4  million  in 1999,  due  primarily  to  repayment  of various notes  receivable  associated  with the Company's  liquidation  of other retail formats.  Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  is  expected to decrease  slightly during 2001, primarily due to an anticipated decrease in short-term debt levels.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  The provision for income taxes  reflects an effective tax rate of 38.0% for both 2000 and 1999.  1999 COMPARED WITH 1998 - -----------------------  NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES  Consolidated  net sales and  operating  revenues  decreased  13.8% from $4,787.9 million in 1998 to $4,126.2  million in 1999;  this  decrease  was  attributable primarily  to the  sale  of  Computer  City  to  CompUSA  on  August  31,  1998. Consolidated  comparable  store sales for 1999 are not  meaningful,  due to this sale. Prior to 1999, the Company operated two segments,  RadioShack and Computer City.  RadioShack Segment - ------------------  Sales for the RadioShack  segment in 1999 increased 14.9% from $3,591.2  million in 1998 to $4,126.2  million in 1999; this increase was due primarily to a 12.2% comparable  company-owned store sales gain and the opening of 48 new stores, net of store  closures.  RadioShack's  comparable  store sales  increase  was driven primarily  by  increased  sales of  communications  products,  prepaid  wireless airtime and sales of audio and video equipment,  including DTH satellite systems and services.  The  communications  category,  the largest  product  category of RadioShack's retail sales mix in 1999, increased as a percentage of total retail sales in 1999, primarily due to a 50% increase in unit sales of PCS and cellular telephones.  Sales of electronic  parts,  accessories  and  specialty  equipment decreased  2.8  percentage  points of total retail  sales in 1999,  despite a 4% sales gain. Personal  electronics and seasonal products decreased 1.0 percentage point of RadioShack's retail sales mix in 1999. Both of these product categories decreased  as  a  percent  of  total  retail   sales,   due   primarily  to  the communications  category and the services and other  category  becoming a higher percent of the product mix in 1999. The audio and video  category  experienced a sales  increase of  approximately  27% during  1999,  due  primarily to a strong increase  in sales of DTH  satellite  systems  and  services.  Sales of personal computers  and  peripherals  were  8.7% of  RadioShack's  retail  sales in 1999, compared to 9.1% in 1998, despite a large unit gain and a 10% sales gain for the year. The average  selling price of CPUs decreased 16% in 1999, in line with the general market  decline.  Sales in the services and other category  increased in 1999 in dollars and as a percent of RadioShack  retail sales, due to an increase in sales of prepaid  wireless  airtime,  as well as to an  increase  in residual income received from RadioShack's  third party providers of  communications  and DTH satellite  programming  services.  In 1999,  RadioShack earned approximately $63.0 million of residual income, compared to $34.2 million in 1998.  Computer City Segment - ---------------------  Computer City was sold to CompUSA effective August 31, 1998.  GROSS PROFIT  Gross profit for RadioShack Corporation in 1999 was $2,083.5 million or 50.5% of net sales and operating revenues, compared with $2,004.4 million or 41.9% of net sales  and  operating  revenues  in 1998.  This  increase  in gross  profit as a percentage  of net sales and  operating  revenues  was  primarily  the result of RadioShack retail sales constituting all of the Company's consolidated net sales and operating revenues in 1999, when compared to 1998. Computer City was sold to CompUSA on August 31, 1998.  Computer City had an inherently  lower gross margin percentage than consolidated RadioShack Corporation.  The RadioShack segment's gross profit increased 11.4% in dollars for 1999 versus 1998,  but  decreased  as a  percentage  of  RadioShack's  total  sales  by  1.6 percentage  points  for  the  same  period.  This  percentage  decrease  was due primarily to mix shifts within RadioShack's  product offerings as sales of lower margin  categories  increased  as a portion of the  overall  sales  volume.  The decrease in gross margin was partially offset by an increase in residual income, which has 100% gross margin.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  RadioShack  Corporation's 1999 SG&A expense decreased  slightly in dollars,  but increased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to 36.0% versus 33.0% in 1998. The higher SG&A  percentage in 1999 was due to RadioShack  becoming the only operating unit in 1999 (see "Gross Profit" above).  The RadioShack  segment operated at a higher  relative  SG&A expense  level than the Company as whole in 1998. Excluding Computer City and other closed units, the Company's SG&A expense as a percentage of sales would have approximated 37.7% in 1998.  Despite  the sale of  Computer  City in 1998,  payroll  expense  for the Company increased  in dollars  and as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues to 18.0% in 1999 from 15.3% in 1998.  This increase was due primarily to RadioShack retail  store  expansions,  changes  in  compensation  plans  and  increases  in personnel, commissions, bonuses and other incentives resulting from RadioShack's strong  comparable  store  sales  and  profits.   Rent  expense  for  RadioShack Corporation  decreased in dollars in  comparison  with 1998,  but increased as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues to 5.0% in 1999 from 4.5% in 1998. This increase was due to the sale of Computer City, which had lower rent expense as a  percentage  of sales than the  Company as a whole.  Rent  expense  for the RadioShack  segment  increased in dollars in 1999, but decreased as a percent of sales.  Advertising expense for consolidated RadioShack Corporation decreased in dollars, but increased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues in 1999, when compared to 1998, due to the sale of Computer City. There was also a dollar decrease in advertising  expense for the  RadioShack  segment in 1999 from 1998. The dollar  decrease  resulted from an increase in marketing  development  funds received from third party service providers.  RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS  On  February  1, 1998,  RadioShack  Corporation  granted  approximately  649,500 restricted stock awards  consisting of 500 shares each to 1,299 RadioShack store managers  not  included in the  February 1, 1997  restricted  stock  grant.  The February 1998 restricted  stock awards had a weighted  average fair market value of $19.61 per share when  granted.  This  restricted  stock grant was to vest on February 2, 2003, if managers  receiving the grants were employed by the Company at a store  manager  or higher  position,  at that  time.  However,  the  grants provided that the restricted  shares would vest early if RadioShack common stock closed  at  $29.0625  or more  for any 20  consecutive  trading  days  beginning February 1, 2000. At December 31, 1999, it was probable that the 348,000  shares that  remained  outstanding  under this grant would vest under the early vesting provisions.  The  resulting  charge to  compensation  expense of $14.7  million, including related payroll taxes, was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1999.  Vesting of these  restricted  stock awards  occurred on February 29, 2000,  when RadioShack's  common stock closed  above the targeted  amount for the  twentieth consecutive  trading day.  Vesting resulted in the issuance of 336,000 shares of RadioShack's common stock at a fair market value of $37.53 per share.  In the  fourth  quarter  of  1998,  RadioShack  Corporation  recorded  estimated compensation expense of $82.6 million related to the early vesting of restricted stock awards that had been granted to 4,907 store  managers on February 1, 1997. These  awards  vested on March 1, 1999 and the actual price of the stock and the number of shares  vested  differed  from the  estimated  accrual at December 31, 1998. The amount of this difference,  $5.1 million,  was recorded as a credit to expense in the first quarter of 1999.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE  Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $16.8  million for 1999 versus $34.6  million  for  1998.  Interest  expense  decreased  18.1% in 1999,  due to RadioShack no longer having to incur  interest  expense on Computer City capital lease  obligations,  as well as to a  corresponding  decrease  in the  Company's average debt outstanding during 1999.  Interest income increased almost 90% to $20.4 million in 1999 from $10.8 million in 1998,  due  primarily  to  interest  from the  $136.0  million  CompUSA  note receivable which was outstanding for a full year.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  The provision for income taxes  reflects an effective tax rate of 38.0% for 1999 compared  with 38.5% for 1998.  The  decrease in 1999  resulted  primarily  from improved  utilization of foreign tax credits and implementation of certain state income tax initiatives.  IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting  for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities"  ("SFAS 133"), which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative  instruments  embedded in other contracts,  and for hedging activities.  RadioShack uses derivatives only in limited  circumstances. The Company  adopted SFAS 133  effective  January 1, 2001 and the impact was not material.  CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY                                     Year Ended December 31,                               -------------------------------- (In millions)                   2000        1999        1998                               --------    --------    -------- Operating activities          $ 116.5     $ 561.6     $ 414.8 Investing activities            (34.0)     (121.0)      (93.0) Financing activities           (116.4)     (340.5)     (363.2)  In 2000, cash flow provided by operating activities was $116.5 million, compared to $561.6 million and $414.8 million in 1999 and 1998,  respectively.  Cash flow from net income,  adjusted for non-cash items, increased $63.4 million from 1999 to 2000.  This  increase  was  primarily  due to increased  operating  profit at RadioShack.  The decrease in cash flow from operating  activities was the result of a  $508.5  million  use of  cash by  working  capital  components.  Inventory increased  $302.9  million over the prior year period,  reflecting  an increased level of  inventory  required by higher  sales  levels and  increased  inventory levels  of  wireless  phones,  DTH  satellite  systems,   and  landline  phones. Additionally,  an increase of $149.0  million in accounts  receivable  consisted primarily  of  amounts  due from  RadioShack's  strategic  allies in the form of consumer acquisition fees, marketing support and rebate programs.  Investing  activities  used $34.0  million in cash in 2000,  compared  to $121.0 million  and  $93.0  million  used  in  1999  and  1998,  respectively.  Capital expenditures  approximated $119.6 million in 2000, compared to $102.4 million in 1999  and  $131.5  million  in 1998.  Capital  expenditures  for 2000  consisted primarily of RadioShack  store  expansions and remodels,  costs related to a new distribution  facility,  upgrades of  information  systems,  and the purchase of vehicles for the RadioShack Installation Services division. Capital expenditures for 1999 and 1998  were  used  primarily  for  retail  expansion  and  upgrading information   systems,   including  Year  2000  (Y2K)  initiatives.   Management anticipates that the capital  expenditure  requirement for 2001 will approximate $130.0 million to $135.0 million.  These  expenditures  will primarily relate to RadioShack  future store expansions and remodels,  updated  information  systems and, to a lesser extent,  upgrades  relating to  RadioShack's  distribution  and manufacturing facilities. On January 4, 2000, RadioShack received $100.0 million in  cash  from   Microsoft,   which   related  to   Microsoft's   investment  in RadioShack.com,  LLC,  a limited  liability  company  formed by  RadioShack  and Microsoft for the purpose of marketing and selling  electronics  products on the Internet.  In June 2000,  RadioShack  made a $30.0 million dollar  investment in Digital:Convergence  Corporation,   an Internet technology company. In addition, the Company  generated $17.9 million in cash during 2000 from the sale of equity securities.  Cash used by financing activities was $116.4 million in 2000, compared to $340.5 million and $363.2 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively. Purchases of treasury stock  required cash of $400.6  million,  $422.2  million and $337.4  million in 2000,  1999 and  1998,  respectively.  (See  "Capital  Structure  and  Financial Condition"  below for  further  information  on  RadioShack's  stock  repurchase programs.) The 2000, 1999 and 1998 stock  repurchases  were partially  funded by $66.3 million, $81.5 million and $57.8 million, respectively,  received from the sale of treasury stock to employee stock plans and from stock option  exercises. Dividends  paid,  net of tax, in 2000,  1999 and 1998 amounted to $44.7 million, $42.5 million and $44.8 million, respectively. The increase in dividends paid in 2000  resulted  from an increase in the per share  dividend.  Medium-term  notes issued by RadioShack provided  approximately $101.6 million and $45.7 million in cash in 1999 and 1998,  respectively,  the  majority  of which was used to repay current  maturities of long-term  debt. In 2000, the increase in short-term debt was used primarily to fund increases in accounts  receivable,  share repurchases and additional inventory.  In 1999, RadioShack used excess cash flow to decrease its short-term debt from the prior year by $42.3 million.  The  current  credit  ratings for  RadioShack,  which are  generally  considered investment grade, follow:                                                    Standard        Category                     Moody's      and Poor's       Fitch        --------                     -------      ----------       -----        Medium-Term Notes             Baa1            A-             A        ESOP Senior Notes             Baa1            A-             A        Commercial Paper              P-2             A-2            F1  CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION RadioShack's available borrowing facilities as of December 31, 2000 are detailed in Note 6 - "Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities" of the Notes.  On December  14, 2000,  RadioShack  announced  that its Board of  Directors  had authorized  management to purchase up to 10.0 million  additional  shares of its common  stock  with a new  share  repurchase  program,  upon  completion  of its existing  60.0 million share  program in December  2000.  The new program has no expiration  date.  During 2000, 3.4 million shares were  repurchased  for $167.4 million under both programs, including 0.1 million shares for $6.6 million under the new 10.0  million  share  program.  An  additional  0.2 million  shares were repurchased for $9.5 million from January 1, 2001 to March 19, 2001.  Additionally,  on  October  26,  1998,  RadioShack  announced  that its Board of Directors  had  authorized  the  repurchase  of up to  10.0  million  shares  of RadioShack's  common stock for an indefinite period of time to be used to offset the dilution of grants under  RadioShack's  incentive stock plans (see Note 13 - "Stock Options and Performance Awards" of the Notes).  Approximately 3.0 million shares were  repurchased  in 2000 for $144.4  million,  bringing the total share repurchases  at December  31,  2000 under this  program to 10.0  million  shares totaling $398.9 million. No more shares may be repurchased under this program.  The  purchases  under  the  share  repurchase  programs  described  above are in addition to the shares  required for employee  stock purchase  plans,  which are purchased throughout the year. Purchases will continue to be made in 2001 in the open market with funding of the  programs  coming from excess free cash flow and short-term borrowings, if needed.  RadioShack's  primary source of short-term debt consists of short-term  seasonal bank debt and commercial  paper,  which have maturities of less than 90 days. In the second  quarter of 2000,  RadioShack  increased its $200.0  million  364-day revolving  credit facility to $300.0 million and also extended the maturity date to June 2001. The terms of the 364-day  revolving credit facility remain similar to the  previous  facility.  RadioShack  also  has a  $300.0  million  five-year revolving credit facility  maturing June 2003. The revolving  credit  facilities are used as backup for the commercial paper program and may also be utilized for general corporate purposes.  Annual commitment fees for the facilities are 0.07% of the  $300.0  million  364-day  facility  and  0.085%  of the  $300.0  million multiyear facility,  whether used or unused.  During the second quarter of 2001, RadioShack plans to extend the 364-day facility to June 2002.  The total  debt-to-capitalization ratio was 47.0% at December 31, 2000, 38.0% at December  31,  1999 and 35.6% at  December  31,  1998.  These  increases  in the debt-to-capitalization  ratios  result from an  increase in debt levels  related primarily to the share repurchase  program and increased  inventory and accounts receivable levels.  RadioShack  has a $300.0  million  Debt  Shelf  Registration  Statement  ("Shelf Registration").  In August 1997,  RadioShack  issued  $150.0  million of 10 year unsecured notes under the Shelf Registration.  The interest rate on the notes is 6.95% per annum with  interest  payable on September 1 and March 1 of each year, commencing  March 1, 1998. The notes are due September 1, 2007. In December 1997 and  January   1998,   RadioShack   issued  $4.0  million  and  $45.0   million, respectively,  in  medium-term  notes under the remaining  $150.0  million Shelf Registration.  An additional  $32.0 million,  $37.0 million and $32.0 million of medium-term  notes were issued in January 1999,  August 1999 and September 1999, respectively,  completing  the remaining 1997 Shelf  Registration.  RadioShack's medium and long-term notes outstanding at December 31, 2000 under the 1997 Shelf Registration totaled $300.0 million. The interest rates at December 31, 2000 for the outstanding  $150.0 million in medium-term notes ranged from 6.09% to 7.35%, with a  weighted  average  coupon  rate of 6.6%.  These  medium-term  notes have varying maturities ranging from 2001 to 2008.  RadioShack's  management believes that its present borrowing capacity is greater than the established credit lines and long-term debt in place. It is anticipated that RadioShack  will review the medium to longer-term  debt markets in calendar 2001. If these markets are  available to the Company at favorable  terms,  it is likely that longer maturity debt will be issued to repay  short-term debt and to adjust the mix of short-term versus long-term debt.  INFLATION Inflation has not significantly  impacted  RadioShack over the past three years. Management does not expect inflation to have a significant  impact on operations in the foreseeable  future,  unless global situations  substantially  affect the world economy.  ITEM 7a.   QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  RadioShack does not have any derivative instruments that materially increase the Company's  exposure to market risks for interest rates,  foreign currency rates, commodity  prices  or  other  market  price  risks.   RadioShack  does  not  use derivatives for speculative purposes.  The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest  rates.  Interest rate  risk  exists   principally  with  respect  to  the  Company's   short-term indebtedness  that bears  interest at floating  rates.  At  December  31,  2000, RadioShack  had $461.3  million of  indebtedness  bearing  interest  at floating rates. A hypothetical,  instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate  applicable to  floating-rate  indebtedness at December 31, 2000 would have resulted in additional interest expense of $4.6 million assuming no change in the principal or a reduction of such indebtedness.  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
