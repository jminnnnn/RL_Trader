ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following discussion of the Company's historical results of operations and of its liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements of the Company and related notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report.  GENERAL       The Company's fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to fiscal years of the Company refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, the Company's "Fiscal 2000" ended on January 31, 2000. The comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion are calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented.       The Company operates two business segments - a lifestyle-oriented general merchandise retailing segment and a wholesale apparel business ("Wholesale"). The retailing segment operates through retail stores and direct response, including a catalog and two web sites. The two retail concepts are Urban Outfitters ("Urban Retail") and Anthropologie. Urban Retail is the larger of the two and generates the majority of the Company's revenues and profits. Urban Retail had 37 stores open at January 31, 2000 and 32 at January 31, 1999. Anthropologie had 20 stores open at January 31, 2000 and 14 at January 31, 1999. The Company has plans to open approximately eight Urban Retail stores and approximately seven Anthropologie stores in Fiscal 2001.       Fiscal 2000 and 1999 continued as profitable years for Urban Outfitters with net income to net sales of 6.8% and 7.6%, respectively, as well as return on beginning shareholders' equity of 17.7% for Fiscal 2000 and 17.4% for Fiscal 1999. The contraction of net income as a percentage of sales in Fiscal 2000 resulted primarily from a net charge to earnings of $4.4 million to recognize a required accounting reserve for the Company's portion of operating losses relating to its minority investment in MXG Media, Inc. (see "Other Matters - MXG Media, Inc." below). Although net income as a percentage of sales contracted, the return on beginning shareholders' equity increased for Fiscal 2000 over the prior year due primarily to the Company's sales growth. In part, the increase in return on beginning equity reflects the repurchase during Fiscal 1999 of 167,200 shares of its common stock at an open market value of $2.3 million.                                          13           The Company has wholly-owned subsidiaries that operate Urban Retail stores in London, England and Montreal and Toronto, Canada. The results of operations and financial position for the London and Canadian stores are included in the Company's retail operations segment results. The Company plans to open a store in Dublin, Ireland during Fiscal 2001 and additional stores in Canada and Europe in the future.       For Fiscal 2000, the Wholesale company recorded sales growth of 12% after elimination of intersegment sales to Urban Retail and Anthropologie. The Wholesale company anticipates modest sales growth in Fiscal 2001.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of the Company's net sales represented by certain income statement data and the growth of certain income statement data from period to period. The Company has revised its manner of reporting gross profit to group certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs with cost of sales in order to enhance the comparability of its results with other specialty apparel retailers. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.                                                                           FISCAL YEAR ENDED                                                                           JANUARY 31,                                                               ----------------------------------- AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES                                   2000           1999         1998                                                                ----           ----         ----        Net sales ...........................................          100.0%         100.0%        100.0% Cost of sales, including certain buying, distribution    and occupancy costs ..............................           62.2           62.4          65.3                                                                -----          -----         -----   Gross profit ......................................           37.8           37.6          34.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses ........           24.2           25.6          22.0                                                                -----          -----         -----   Income from operations ............................           13.6           12.0          12.7 Other income (expense), net .........................

The $67.1 million increase was attributable to: (1) net sales increases of $39.4 million from stores opened during Fiscal 1999 and Fiscal 2000, (2) comparable store net sales increases of 10%, aggregating $15.8 million, (3) direct response (catalog and e-commerce) revenue increases of $9.5 million, and (4) an increase of $2.4 million in net sales from the Wholesale company.       In Fiscal 2000, increases in the number of transactions in comparable stores and an increase in average sales prices resulting from reducing the level of lower priced items such as greeting cards, as well as a lower proportion of markdowns, accounted for the comparable store sales dollar increase. During Fiscal 2000, twelve new stores were opened, one store was relocated, and one store was closed due to a lease expiration. Eleven stores were opened in Fiscal 1999. Direct response revenue growth was due to increased catalog circulation and web site traffic. The Company believes increased net sales from the Wholesale company during Fiscal 2000 were due to increased popularity of its fashion offerings combined with improved delivery and quality of merchandise.       Gross profit margins increased slightly to 37.8% of sales in Fiscal 2000 from 37.6% of sales in Fiscal 1999. This increase is attributable to higher initial mark-ups in the Urban Retail and Anthropologie stores offset by increased occupancy costs and investments in additional merchandising, design and production staff.       Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 24.2% of sales in Fiscal 2000 from 25.6% of sales in Fiscal 1999. Aggressive store cost containment combined with the comparable store sales increases resulted in the leveraging of operating expenses in the retail segment. Additionally, direct response operations experienced a similar reduction in operating expense percentages for the year due to: (1) the significant increase in sales, (2) improvements in catalog production costs, and (3) the efficiencies attributable to moving the catalog call center in-house during the second quarter of Fiscal 2000. The increase in sales by the Wholesale company also resulted in the leveraging of its operating expenses.       Other income (expense) for Fiscal 2000 includes a net charge to earnings of $4.4 million to reserve for the Company's portion of operating losses related to the minority investment in MXG Media, Inc. (see "Other Matters - MXG Media, Inc." below). Income tax expense for Fiscal 2000 does not include a tax benefit related to this reserve which, in part, has caused an increase in income tax expense along with the Company's effective tax rate.   FISCAL 1999 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1998       Net sales in Fiscal 1999 increased to $209.0 million from $173.1 million in the prior fiscal year, a 20.7% increase. The $35.9 million increase was attributable to a combination of                                         15     comparable store net sales increases of $15.1 million, net sales increases of $25.6 million from stores opened during Fiscal 1998 and Fiscal 1999, and catalog and e-commerce revenues of $5.7 million, offset in part by a decrease of $10.5 million from the Wholesale company.       In Fiscal 1999, increases in the number of transactions in comparable stores and an increase in average sales prices resulting from a lower proportion of markdowns accounted for the comparable store sales dollar increase. Eleven new stores were opened in Fiscal 1999 and three new stores were opened in Fiscal 1998. The Wholesale sales decrease reflected lower purchases by larger retail chains, as well as customer issues regarding quality, delivery and fashion, which have been addressed by management.       Gross profit margins increased to 37.6% of sales in Fiscal 1999 from 34.7% of sales in Fiscal 1998. This increase is attributable to higher initial mark-ups and lower markdown percentages in the Urban Retail and Anthropologie stores. Comparable store sales increases in existing stores offset the higher occupancy costs of noncomparable and new stores. Reduced sales in the wholesale segment necessitated an increased proportion of merchandise to be sold in the "off-price" sector, offsetting in part, the higher retail segment performance.       Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 25.6% of sales in Fiscal 1999 from 22.0% of sales in Fiscal 1998 due to the costs incurred for the start-up of the catalog and European operations as well as the substantial negative leverage associated with the decline in wholesale segment sales. The increase in dollars in selling, general and administrative expenses is attributable to the opening of additional stores as well as the catalog start-up.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       During the last three years, the Company has satisfied its cash requirements through cash flow from operations and accumulated cash. The Company's primary uses of cash have been to open new stores, purchase inventories, and repurchase its common stock. Additionally, during the last two years, the Company has invested in the Anthropologie direct response effort, a new European subsidiary, and a direct response company aimed at teen shoppers (see "Other Matters - MXG Media, Inc." below). In addition to cash generated from operations, sources of cash have included the net proceeds from the exercise of certain employee stock options in each of Fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998. The Company expects to incur additional capital expenditures in support of its expansion program and the establishment of commerce capability on its www.urbn.com web site. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations are expected to fund such expansion-related uses of cash.       Although the Company has not borrowed short-term or long-term funds during the last five fiscal years, it maintains a line of credit of $16.2 million, all of which is available for cash borrowings or for the issuance of letters of credit. The line is unsecured and any cash borrowings under the line would accrue interest at a rate not to exceed LIBOR plus 1/2 of 1 percent. The Company uses letters of credit to purchase merchandise for the retail and wholesale segments.                                         16     Outstanding balances of letters of credit at January 31, 2000 and 1999 were $6.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively. There were no short-term or long-term borrowings outstanding at January 31, 2000 or at January 31, 1999. The Company expects that accumulated cash and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash needs for the next year. However, accelerated expansion beyond the fifteen store openings planned for Fiscal 2001 may necessitate borrowings on the credit line.   OTHER MATTERS  Year 2000       As of the date of this report, the Company has not incurred and is not expected to incur any material business disruptions as a result of Year 2000 information technology issues.       Prior to January 1, 2000, the Company conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify those systems that could be affected by the Year 2000 issue. As a result of this review, major information technology systems, less critical systems and non-information technology systems, including those with embedded processor chips (such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, elevators, etc.) were evaluated, modified and/or upgraded and tested for Year 2000 compliance prior to December 31, 1999. In addition, the Company evaluated the Year 2000 capabilities of its major suppliers and key vendors by conducting interviews, obtaining compliance letters and, if necessary, conducting comprehensive tests. In most circumstances, the information that the Company received from key suppliers and vendors indicated that they would be Year 2000 compliant by the end of 1999. As of the date of this report, the Company has not been adversely affected by a major supplier's or key vendor's inability to provide merchandise or services. Amounts expended by the Company related to Year 2000 issues were not material.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements       In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133") which is required to be adopted in Fiscal 2002. The Company currently enters into short-term foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures related to its Canadian dollar denominated investments and anticipated cash flow. The amounts of the contracts and related gains and losses have not been material. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 is not expected to have a significant effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.                                          17      MXG Media, Inc.       On February 5, 1998 the Company entered into an agreement with MXG Media, Inc. ("MXG," formerly HMB Publishing, Inc.) for the purchase of securities convertible into a minority interest in the company through Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and certain convertible debentures. The agreement called for additional investments and ownership if MXG met certain performance milestones. MXG publishes the "MXG magalog" and operates the www.MXGonline.com and www.MXGtv.com web sites, all of which cater to teenage girls.       As of January 31, 2000, the Company has invested approximately $2.0 million in Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and $2.4 million in convertible debentures. MXG has incurred losses since its inception and, accordingly, during Fiscal 2000, the Company has recorded reserves for its portion of operating losses related to the minority interest in MXG. Included in other income (expense) for Fiscal 2000 is a net charge to earnings of $4.4 million to fully reserve for the Company's investment. Additionally, from March 1999 through October 1999, the Company advanced $7.6 million of bridge financing to MXG in the form of promissory notes.       Pursuant to an agreement dated October 31, 1999, MXG received an additional equity investment of $26 million from USA Networks Interactive, a USA company (USA Networks, Inc. - NASDAQ:USAI), reducing the Company's proportionate ownership. On November 1, 1999, the full amount of the bridge financing of $7.6 million was repaid with interest at 8%. The Company has no plans to increase its investment in MXG or advance additional funds.  Subsequent Event       In January 2000, the Board of Directors approved a stock buyback program that authorized the Company to repurchase up to 1,000,000 of its shares. During the period from February 1, 2000 through February 25, 2000, in a series of individual open market transactions, the Company repurchased 104,700 shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.4 million.  Forward-Looking Statements       Pursuant to the "Safe Harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, this report contains forward-looking statements which may be identified by their use of words such as "plans," "expects," "will," "anticipates," "intends," "projects," "estimates" or other words of similar meaning. Any one or all of the following factors could cause actual financial results to differ materially from those financial results mentioned in the forward-looking statements: industry competition factors, availability of suitable retail space for expansion, difficulty in predicting and responding to fashion trend shifts, seasonal fluctuations in gross sales, the level of returns experienced by the business segments, the levels of margins achievable in the marketplace, the departure of one or more key senior managers, and other risks identified in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update forward-looking statements and cannot guarantee that the assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be realized.                                         18      SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS       While Urban Outfitters has been profitable in each of its last 40 operating quarters, its operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. The Company's highest sales levels have historically occurred during the five-month period from August 1 to December 31 of each year (the Back-to-School and Holiday periods). Sales generated during these periods have traditionally had a significant impact on the Company's results of operations. Any decreases in sales for these periods or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding these periods could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. The Company's results of operations in any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that can be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year.       The Company's results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of expenses incurred in connection with, and sales contributed by, new stores, store expansions and the integration of new stores into the operations of the Company or by the size and timing of catalog mailings and web site traffic for the Company's direct response operations. Fluctuations in the bookings and shipments of Wholesale merchandise between quarters can also have positive or negative effects on earnings during the quarters.       The following tables, which are unaudited, set forth the Company's net sales, gross profit, net income and income per share for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The Company has revised its manner of reporting gross profit to group certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs with cost of sales in order to enhance comparability of its results with other specialty apparel retailers. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks - fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Company's inventory turn and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases substantially all its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and the United Kingdom. As explained in the section above on "Recent Accounting Pronouncements," the market risk is further limited by the Company's purchase of foreign currency forward exchange contracts.       Since the Company has not been a borrower, its exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to the impact on its marketable securities portfolio. This exposure is minimized by the limited investment maturities and "put" options available to the Company as explained in the notes to the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. The impact of a hypothetical two percent increase or decrease in prevailing interest rates would not materially affect the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.   ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
