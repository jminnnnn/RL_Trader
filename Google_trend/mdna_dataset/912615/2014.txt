Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations    Overview    We are an omni-channel retailer operating two reportable segments: a leading lifestyle specialty Retail segment and a Wholesale segment. Our Retail segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie,Free People, Terrain and Bhldn brands, whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through retail stores, websites, mobile applications, catalogs and customer contact centers. Our Wholesale segment consists of the Free People wholesaledivision that primarily designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel.    Our fiscal year ends onJanuary 31. All references to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal year 2014 ended on January 31, 2014.   Our omni-channel strategy enhances our customers brand experience by providing a seamless approach to the customer shoppingexperience. We have substantially integrated all available shopping channels, including stores, websites (online and through mobile devices) and catalogs. Our investments in areas such as marketing campaigns and technology advancements are designedto generate demand for the omni-channel and not the separate store or direct-to-consumer channels. Store sales are primarily fulfilled from that stores inventory, but may also be shipped from any of our fulfillment centers or from a differentstore location if an item is not available at the original store. Direct-to-consumer orders are primarily shipped to our customers through our fulfillment centers, but may also be shipped from any store, or a combination of fulfillment centers andstores depending on the availability of a particular item. As our customers continue to shop across multiple channels, we have adapted our approach towards meeting this demand. Due to the availability of like product in a variety of shoppingchannels, we now source these products utilizing single SKUs based on the omni-channel demand rather than the demand of the separate channels. These and other technological capabilities allow us to better serve our customers and help us to fillorders that otherwise may have been cancelled due to out-of-stock positions. As a result of changing customer behavior and the substantial integration of the operations of our store and direct-to-consumer channels, we manage and analyze ourperformance based on a single omni-channel rather than separate channels and believe that the omni-channel results present the most meaningful and appropriate measure of our performance.   Our comparable Retail segment net sales data is equal to the sum of our comparable store plus comparable direct-to-consumer channels. Astore is considered to be comparable if it has been open at least one full fiscal year, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. A direct-to-consumerchannel is considered to be comparable if it has been operational for at least one full fiscal year. There is no overlap between comparable store net sales and comparable direct-to-consumer net sales. Sales from stores and direct-to-consumerchannels that do not fall within the definition of comparable store or channel are considered to be non-comparable. The effects of foreign currency translation are also considered non-comparable.   Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates within our stores, we believethat, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume in our stores, as discussed in our results of operations, may correlate to changes in customer traffic. We are able to monitor customer visits, average order value and conversionrate on       23     our websites. We believe that changes in any of these metrics may be caused by a response to our brands fashion offerings, our marketing campaigns, circulation of our catalogs and anoverall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base.    Retail Segment   As of January 31, 2014, we operated 230 Urban Outfitters stores of which 176 were located in the United States, 14 were located inCanada and 40 were located in Europe. During fiscal 2014, we opened 16 new Urban Outfitters stores, of which 10 were located in the United States, one was located in Canada, and five were located in Europe. During the year ended January 31,2014, Urban Outfitters closed one store located in the United States. Urban Outfitters operates websites in North America and Europe that capture the spirit of the brand by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in ourstores. Urban Outfitters offers a catalog in North America and in Europe offering select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 28 through a unique merchandisemix and compelling store environment. Urban Outfitters product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear, beauty, accessories and sporting apparel and gear, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts.We plan to open additional stores over the next several years. Urban Outfitters North American and European Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 36.3% and 8.1% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2014, comparedto 39.2% and 8.2%, respectively, for fiscal 2013.    As of January 31, 2014, we operated 187 Anthropologie stores, of which174 were located in the United States, nine were located in Canada and four were located in Europe. During fiscal 2014, we opened nine new Anthropologie stores, of which seven were located in the United States, one was located in Canada and one waslocated in Europe. During the year ended January 31, 2014, Anthropologie closed two stores located in the United States due to lease expirations. Anthropologie operates websites in North America and Europe that capture the spirit of the brandby offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in our stores. Anthropologie also offers a catalog in North America and in Europe that markets select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Anthropologie stores.Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 28 to 45. Anthropologies product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, shoes, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts anddecorative items. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years. Anthropologies North American and European Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 39.8% and 1.2% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal2014, compared to 38.8% and 1.1%, respectively, for fiscal 2013.    As of January 31, 2014, we operated 90 Free Peoplestores, of which 88 were located in the United States and two were located in Canada. During fiscal 2014, we opened 13 new Free People stores, all of which were located in the United States. Free People operates websites in North America and inEurope that capture the spirit of the brand by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in our stores, as well as all of the Free People wholesale offerings. Free People also offers a catalog offering select merchandise, mostof which is also available in our Free People stores. Free People primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel,intimates, shoes, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Free Peoples Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 7.7% of consolidated netsales for fiscal 2014, compared to approximately 6.2% for fiscal 2013.       24     As of January 31, 2014, we operated two Terrain garden centers and a website thatoffers customers a portion of the product assortment found at the Terrain garden centers. Terrain is designed to appeal to women and men interested in a creative, sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Terrain creates a compellingshopping environment through its large and freestanding sites. Merchandise includes lifestyle home and garden products combined with antiques, live plants, flowers, wellness products and accessories. Both Terrain locations offer a full-servicerestaurant and coffee bar. Terrain also offers a variety of landscape and design services. Terrains Retail segment net sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.   As of January 31, 2014, we operated two Bhldn stores and a website that offers customers access to all product offerings of theBhldn brand. We also operate shop-within-shop locations within our Anthropologie stores that offer a comparable product assortment to our standalone stores and website. Bhldn offers a curated collection of heirloom quality wedding gowns, bridesmaidfrocks, party dresses, assorted jewelry, headpieces, footwear, lingerie and decorations. Bhldns Retail segment net sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.   For all brands combined, we plan to open approximately 35 to 40 new stores during fiscal 2015, including 13 Urban Outfitters stores, 13Anthropologie stores and 12 Free People stores.    Wholesale Segment   The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Free Peoples rangeof tops, bottoms, sweaters and dresses are sold worldwide through approximately 1,400 better department and specialty stores worldwide, including Macys, Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, Lord & Taylor, Selfridges, our own Free Peoplestores, and in Japan through an exclusive distribution and marketing agreement with World Co., Ltd. Free Peoples Wholesale segment net sales accounted for approximately 5.8% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2014, compared to 5.3% in fiscal2013.    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require managementto make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during thereporting period.    Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee.Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accountingpolicies, which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and cash flows and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about theeffect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances thatwould cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates.       25     Revenue Recognition   Revenue is recognized by the Retail segment at the point-of-sale for merchandise the customer takes possession of at the retail store orwhen merchandise is shipped to the customer, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized by the Wholesale segment when merchandise is shipped to the customer, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized at the completion ofa job or service for landscape sales. Revenue is presented on a net basis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental or municipal authority. Payment for merchandise in our Retail segment is tendered by cash, check, credit card, debitcard or gift card. Therefore, our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable for our Retail segment is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accountsfor our Wholesale segment and landscape service accounts receivable, which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as aliability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, are not material. Deposits for landscape services are recorded as a liability and recognized as a saleupon completion of service. Landscape services and related deposits are not material.    We account for a gift card transactionby recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. A liability is established and remains on our books until the card is redeemed by the customer, at which time we record theredemption of the card for merchandise as a sale, or when we determine the likelihood of redemption is remote. We determine the probability of the gift cards being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns. Revenues attributableto the reduction of gift card liabilities for which the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and are not material. Our gift cards do not expire.    Sales Return Reserve    We record a reserve for estimated product returnswhere the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported. The reserve for estimated product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate orexperience is materially higher than our estimate, sales returns would be adjusted in the future. As of January 31, 2014 and 2013, reserves for estimated sales returns totaled $17.1 million and $14.4 million, representing 3.2% and 3.3% of totalliabilities, respectively.    Marketable Securities   All of our marketable securities as of January 31, 2014 and January 31, 2013 are classified as available-for-sale and arecarried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost. Interest on these securities, as well as the amortization of discounts and premiums, is included in Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Unrealized gains andlosses on these securities (other than mutual funds held in the rabbi trust for the Urban Outfitters, Inc. Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (See Note 3, Marketable Securities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements))are considered temporary and therefore are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of  Other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and in accumulated other comprehensive loss inshareholders equity until realized. Mutual funds held in the rabbi trust have been accounted for under the fair value option, which results in all unrealized gains and losses being recorded in Interest income in the ConsolidatedStatements of Income. Other than temporary impairment losses related to credit losses are considered to be realized       26     losses. When available-for-sale securities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically identified and is used to determine the realized gain or loss. Securities classified as currentassets have maturity dates of less than one year from the balance sheet date. Securities classified as non-current assets have maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. Available-for-sale securities such as auction ratesecurities that fail at auction and do not liquidate in the normal course are classified as non-current assets.   Inventories    We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method and includes the costof merchandise and import related costs, including freight, import taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related tocurrent inventories such as future expected consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value.Criteria that we utilize to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle and the value and natureof merchandise currently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values, if appropriate. The majority of inventory at January 31, 2014 and 2013 consisted of finishedgoods. Unfinished goods and work-in-process were not material to the overall net inventory value. Net inventories as of January 31, 2014 and January 31, 2013 totaled $311.2 million and $282.4 million, representing 14.0% and 15.7% oftotal assets, respectively. Any significant unanticipated changes in the risk factors noted within this report could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results.   Adjustments to provisions related to the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on the market value of our annualphysical inventories, cycle counts and recent historical trends. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our reserves and related inventories to increaseover time as we increase our sales.    Long-Lived Assets   Our long-lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, buildings and furniture and fixtures, and are included in theProperty and equipment, net line item in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term, includinglease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Buildings are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2014 and January 31, 2013 totaled$806.9 million and $733.4 million, representing 36.3% and 40.8% of total assets, respectively.    In assessing potentialimpairment of these assets, we make estimates regarding forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store-by-store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g.,mall versus free-      27     standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are allconsidered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be within three years from the date a store location has opened. We record impairment losses when events indicatethat an asset may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets. For fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, impairment losses were not material.   We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long-lived assets. The cost of assets sold orretired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renovations or improvements thatextend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less.   Accounting for Income Taxes    As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involvesestimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation ofinventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxableincome. We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals ofexisting taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Netdeferred tax assets as of January 31, 2014 and January 31, 2013 totaled $66.8 million and $41.1 million representing, 3.0% and 2.3% of total assets, respectively.   To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuationallowances or increase the allowances in a period, we record additional income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Valuation allowances were $0.1 million as of January 31, 2014 and $2.1 million as of January 31, 2013.Valuation allowances are based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in certain foreign and state jurisdictions. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in thesejurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we willrealize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate.    We record uncertain tax positions onthe basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet themore-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.       28     Our tax liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because we are requiredto make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ, and we may be exposedto losses or gains that could be material.    We consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitelyinvested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings. Should we decide torepatriate the foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the United States.   Accounting for Contingencies    From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We are required to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior toissuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising fromcontractual disputes or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, therebycreating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on ouroperating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known.    Share-Based Compensation   Accounting for share-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all share-based awards at fair value on the date ofgrant and recognition of compensation over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures.    We use a lattice binomialpricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights. This model uses assumptions including the risk free rate of interest, expected volatility of our stock price and expected life of the awards. A Monte Carlosimulation, which utilizes similar assumptions, is used to determine the fair value of performance-based awards. We review our assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third-party valuation advisors in order to determine the fair valueof share-based compensation awards at the date of grant. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these share-based payment awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application ofjudgment. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.    Additionally, we make certain estimatesabout the number of awards which will become vested under performance-based incentive plans. We record expense for performance-based awards based on our current expectations of the probable number of shares that will ultimately vest. The estimationof share-based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revisedand could be materially different from share-based compensation expense recorded in prior periods.       29     We also estimate the expected forfeiture rate. We consider many factors when estimatingexpected forfeitures, including types of awards and historical experience. We revise our forfeiture rates, when necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those originally estimated. As a result, if the actual forfeiture rateis different from the estimate at the completion of the vesting period, the share-based compensation expense may not be comparable to amounts recorded in prior periods.    Results of Operations    As a Percentage of Net Sales   The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement dataand the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows:                              Fiscal Year Ended January 31,          2014        2013        2012        Net sales         100.0  %         100.0  %         100.0  %      Cost of sales         62.4            63.1            65.2                                                            Gross profit         37.6            36.9            34.8         Selling, general and administrative expenses         23.8            23.5            23.3                                                            Income from operations         13.8            13.4            11.5         Interest income         0.1            0.1            0.2         Other income                                                Other expenses                       (0.1  )                                                                       Income before income taxes         13.9            13.4            11.7         Income tax expense         4.7            4.9            4.2                                                            Net income         9.2  %         8.5  %         7.5  %                                                         Period over Period Change:                        Net sales         10.4  %         13.0  %         8.8  %      Gross profit         12.6  %         19.9  %         -8.1  %      Income from operations         14.0  %         31.5  %         -31.3  %      Net income         19.0  %         28.1  %         -32.1  %     Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013    Net sales in fiscal 2014 increased by 10.4% to $3.1 billion, from $2.8 billion in fiscal 2013. The $291.7 million increase was attributable to a $262.7 million, or 9.9%, increase in Retail segment netsales and a $29.0 million, or 19.5%, increase in Wholesale segment net sales.    The growth in Retail segment net sales duringfiscal 2014 was driven by increases of $144.2 million, or 6.0%, in Retail segment comparable net sales, which includes our direct-to-consumer channel, and $118.5 million in non-comparable and new store net sales. Our total company comparable Retailsegment net sales increase was comprised of increases of 31.7% and 10.1% at Free       30     People and Anthropologie, respectively, and was partially offset by a decrease of 0.6% at Urban Outfitters. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by continued growth inthe direct-to-consumer channel for all brands and positive comparable store net sales at Anthropologie and Free People. Direct-to-consumer net sales were driven by an increase in website and mobile application traffic, a higher average order valueand an improved conversion rate. The positive comparable store net sales resulted from increases in units per transaction and transactions, which were partially offset by a decrease in average unit selling price. The increase in net salesattributable to non-comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 87 new stores in fiscal 2014 and 2013 that were not in operation for the full comparable periods. Thus far during the first quarter of fiscal 2015, comparable Retailsegment net sales are low single-digit negative.    The increase in Wholesale segment net sales in fiscal 2014 was due to highersales to both specialty and department stores driven by increases in transactions.    Gross profit rates in fiscal 2014increased to 37.6% of net sales, or $1.2 billion, from 36.9% of net sales, or $1.0 billion, in fiscal 2013. The increase in the gross profit rate was primarily due to improved merchandise margins largely due to significant improvement in theAnthropologie brand markdown rate. This improvement was partially offset by increased markdowns at the Urban Outfitters brand in North America. The increased penetration of the direct-to-consumer channel continued to drive store occupancy leverageand delivery expense deleverage. Total inventories at January 31, 2014 increased by $28.8 million, or 10.2%, to $311.2 million from $282.4 million at January 31, 2013. This increase was primarily related to the acquisition of inventoriesto stock new and non-comparable stores. Comparable Retail segment inventories as of January 31, 2014 grew 2.5%.    Selling,general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased during fiscal 2014 to 23.8%, compared to 23.5% for fiscal 2013, primarily due to increases in marketing expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by$77.3 million, or 11.8%, to $734.5 million in fiscal 2014, from $657.2 million in fiscal 2013. The dollar increase over the prior year was primarily related to the operating expenses of new stores and increased marketing expenses to support ourcustomer acquisition and retention programs.    Income from operations increased to 13.8% of net sales, or $426.8 million, forfiscal 2014 compared to 13.4% of net sales, or $374.3 million, for fiscal 2013.    Our annual effective income tax rate forfiscal 2014 decreased to 34.0% of income before income taxes compared to 36.8% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2013. The decrease in the fiscal 2014 effective tax rate is due to a higher percentage of foreign taxable income in fiscal 2014,which carries a lower tax rate, a decrease in valuation allowances for foreign operating loss carryforwards and certain nonrecurring tax adjustments. See Note 8, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for areconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2015 to be approximately 35.0%.    Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012    Net sales in fiscal 2013 increased by13.0% to $2.8 billion, from $2.5 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $321.1 million increase was attributable to a $305.5 million, or 13.1%, increase in Retail segment net sales and a $15.6 million, or 11.8%, increase in our Wholesale segment netsales.       31     The growth in Retail segment net sales during fiscal 2013 was driven by increases of$157.7 million in non-comparable and new store net sales and $147.8 million, or 6.9%, in Retail segment comparable net sales, which includes our direct-to-consumer channel. Our total company comparable Retail segment net sales increase wascomprised of increases of 21.8%, 8.0% and 3.6% at Free People, Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie, respectively, and was driven by continued growth in the direct-to-consumer channel partially offset by negative comparable store net sales. Theincrease in net sales attributable to non-comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 106 new stores in fiscal 2013 and 2012 that were not in operation for the full comparable periods. The direct-to-consumer net sales increase wasdriven by increased traffic to our websites, which was partially offset by a decline in average order value and conversion rate. The negative comparable store net sales resulted from decreases in average units per transaction and average unit salesprices, partially offset by an increase in transactions.    The increase in our Free People wholesale net sales of $21.1million, or 16.6%, was driven by an increase in transactions, which was partially offset by a decline in average unit selling prices. The Free People wholesale net sales increase was partially offset by a $5.5 million decline in Leifsdottir netsales resulting from the discontinuation of wholesale distribution of the Leifsdottir brand, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and was principally completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2012.   Gross profit rates in fiscal 2013 increased to 36.9% of net sales, or $1.0 billion, from 34.8% of net sales, or $860.5 million, in fiscal2012. The increase in the rate was primarily due to a reduction in merchandise markdowns. Total Company inventories at January 31, 2013 increased by $32.3 million, or 12.9%, to $282.4 million from $250.1 million at January 31, 2012. Thisincrease was primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new and non-comparable stores and to support the significant growth in the direct-to-consumer channel. Comparable Retail segment inventories as of January 31, 2013 grew5.7%.    Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2013, increased to 23.5% of netsales versus 23.3% of net sales for fiscal 2012. This increase was primarily due to the deleveraging of direct selling controllable expenses driven by negative comparable store net sales. In fiscal 2013, selling, general and administrativeexpenses increased by $81.4 million, or 14.1%, to $657.2 million, from $575.8 million in fiscal 2012. The dollar increase over the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non-comparable stores.   Income from operations increased to 13.4% of net sales, or $374.3 million, for fiscal 2013 compared to 11.5% of net sales, or $284.7million, for fiscal 2012.    Our annual effective income tax rate for fiscal 2013 increased to 36.8% of income before incometaxes compared to 35.9% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2012. The increase in the fiscal 2013 effective tax rate is partially due to certain nonrecurring state and foreign tax adjustments. See Note 8, Income Taxes, in the Notesto Consolidated Financial Statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate.   Liquidity and Capital Resources    Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $890.3 million as of January 31, 2014 as compared to $623.4 million as of January 31, 2013 and $362.0 million as of January 31, 2012.The       32     $266.9 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal 2014 was primarily a result of $423.2 million from cash provided by operating activities, partiallyoffset by $186.1 million cash paid for property and equipment.    Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2014,increased by $27.5 million to $423.2 million from $395.7 million in fiscal 2013. The increase primarily consists of changes in working capital driven by the timing of accounts payable disbursements. Our working capital as of year-end for fiscalyears 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $663.2 million, $622.1 million and $363.5 million, respectively. Changes in working capital primarily relate to changes in the volume of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.   Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2014 was $462.2 million, consisting of $186.1 million used primarily for the constructionof new stores and the expansion of our home offices and $276.1 million in net purchases of marketable securities.    Cashprovided by financing activities during fiscal 2014 of $33.7 million was primarily related to the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits on stock option exercises.    During the last three years, we have satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operating activities. Our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores, purchase inventories and expandour fulfillment and home office facilities. We have also continued to invest in our omni-channel efforts, technology and our international operations. Cash paid for property and equipment for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $186.1 million, $168.9million, and $190.0 million, respectively, and were primarily used to expand and support our store base, home offices and distribution and fulfillment facilities.    During fiscal 2015, we plan to construct and open approximately 35 to 40 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, continue to expand our home offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, increase ourfulfillment capabilities, upgrade our systems, increase our investments in omni-channel marketing and purchase inventories for our Retail and Wholesale segments at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We believe that ourmarketing, social media, merchandise expansion, website and mobile initiatives are a significant contributor to our Retail segment sales growth. During fiscal 2015, we plan to continue our investment in these initiatives for all brands. We plan toincrease the level of capital expenditures during fiscal 2015 to approximately $215 to $235 million. We believe that our new store investments have the potential to generate positive cash flow within a year. We believe the expansion of ourfulfillment and home office facilities is necessary to adequately support our growth. We may also enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of our brand offerings.   On August 27, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 10.0 million common shares under a share repurchaseprogram. We repurchased and subsequently retired 0.3 million common shares at a total cost of $10.7 million during fiscal 2014. The average cost per share of the repurchases for fiscal 2014 was $35.61, including commissions.   On February 28, 2006, a stock repurchase authorization by our Board of Directors allowed us to repurchase up to 8.0 millioncommon shares. On November 16, 2010 and August 25, 2011, two additional stock repurchase authorizations by our Board of Directors allowed us to repurchase, in       33     aggregate, 20.0 million additional common shares. We repurchased all of the remaining outstanding shares available under these authorizations during fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2012, werepurchased and retired 20.5 million common shares for approximately $538.3 million.    In addition to the sharesrepurchased under the share repurchase program, during fiscal 2014 and 2012, we acquired and subsequently retired 9,520 and 282,813 common shares at a total cost of $0.4 million and $7.2 million, respectively, from employees to meet minimumstatutory tax withholding requirements.    Subsequent to January 31, 2014, we repurchased and retired 4,523,220 commonshares at a total cost of $162.0 million or an average cost of $35.83 per share, including commissions.    On April 25,2011, we amended our line of credit facility (the Line) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. This amendment extended the term of the Line for three years, increased the accordion feature from $100.0 million to $175.0 million,reduced the interest rate margin for certain cash advances and modified certain financial covenants and terms. The Line has been subsequently amended from time to time to join certain subsidiaries as borrowers and guarantors, to revise certainfinancial covenants, and to use the accordion feature of the Line to increase the total available credit under the Line to $175.0 million. The Line contains a sub-limit for borrowings by our European subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us. Cashadvances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.50% based on the Companys achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios such as adjusteddebt. The covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures and the payment of cash dividends. As of and during the year ended January 31, 2014, there were no borrowings under the Line and we were in compliance with all covenantsunder the Line. Outstanding letters of credit and stand-by letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $69.8 million as of January 31, 2014. The available credit under the Line was $105.2 million as of January 31, 2014.   On March 27, 2014, we amended and restated our existing line of credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, NationalAssociation (the Amended and Restated Line). The Amended and Restated Line is a five year $175.0 million revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing for an increase of up to $50.0 million at our discretion. The Amendedand Restated Line contains a sub-limit for borrowings by our subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Line, at the borrowers option, the aggregate principal balance of the amounts advanced or portionsthereof will bear interest at (a) the base rate, or (b) the applicable LIBOR Rate plus a margin that can range from 0.50% to 1.50%. The Amended and Restated Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance ofcertified financial covenants. We expect the Amended and Restated Line to satisfy our credit needs through at least fiscal 2015.       34     Contractual Obligations                                               Payments Due by Period (in thousands)        Description      Total Obligations         Less Than One Year         One to Three Years         Three to Five Years         More Than Five Years        Operating leases (1)      $  1,801,125          $  244,145          $  451,971          $  379,733          $  725,276         Purchase orders (2)         367,003             367,003                                                      Construction contracts (3)         29,350             29,350                                                      Tax contingencies (4)         1,614             1,614                                                                                                                                             Total contractual obligations      $  2,199,092          $  642,112          $  451,971          $  379,733          $  725,276                                                                                                    (1)  Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect ourfuture minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are 26 locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table.Total rent expense related to these 26 locations was approximately $4,036 for fiscal 2014. It is common for the lease agreements for our European locations to adjust the minimum rental due to the current market rate multiple times during the term.The table above includes our current contractual payments for these locations. Amounts noted above include commitments for 27 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2014.     (2)  Our merchandise commitments are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until the merchandise shipping date.     (3)  Includes construction contracts with contractors that are fully liquidated upon the completion of construction, which is typically within 12 months.    (4)  Tax contingencies include $1,614 that is classified as a current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2014. Taxcontingencies in the table above do not show an existing liability of $4,306 because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled. As a result, the $4,306 liability was classified as a non-currentliability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2014.

(2)  Consists primarily of standby letters of credit for customs, construction and insurance.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    As of and for the three fiscal years endedJanuary 31, 2014, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financialcondition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.       35     Other Matters    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    See Note 2, Summary ofSignificant Accounting PoliciesRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adoptedaccounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impacts on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.   Seasonality and Quarterly Results    Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations in net sales and operating income, with a more significant portion typically realized from August 1 to December 31 of each year (the back-to-schooland holiday periods). Historically, and consistent with the retail industry, this seasonality also impacts our working capital requirements, particularly with regard to inventory. The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, netincome and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The unauditedfinancial information has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion ofmanagement, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.                                  Fiscal 2014 Quarter Ended (1)          April 30, 2013        July 31, 2013        Oct. 31, 2013        Jan. 31, 2014          (dollars in thousands, except per share data)        Net sales      $  648,177         $  758,524         $  774,049         $  905,858         Gross profit         238,809            298,243            292,285            332,005         Net income         47,058            76,363            70,257            88,682         Net income per common sharebasic         0.32            0.52            0.48            0.60         Net income per common sharediluted         0.32            0.51            0.47            0.59               As a Percentage of Fiscal Year:                              Net sales         21  %         25  %         25  %         29  %      Net income         17  %         27  %         25  %         31  %                                   Fiscal 2013 Quarter Ended (1)          April 30, 2012        July 31, 2012        Oct. 31, 2012        Jan. 31, 2013          (dollars in thousands, except per share data)        Net sales      $  568,930         $  676,269         $  692,894         $  856,832         Gross profit         202,479            254,505            260,851            313,696         Net income         33,957            61,292            59,517            82,548         Net income per common sharebasic         0.24            0.42            0.41            0.57         Net income per common sharediluted         0.23            0.42            0.40            0.56               As a Percentage of Fiscal Year:                              Net sales         20  %         24  %         25  %         31  %      Net income         14  %         26  %         25  %         35  %          (1)  The sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal per share amounts reported for year-to-date periods. This is due to changes in the number of weighted-averageshares outstanding and the effects of rounding for each period.       36     Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   We are exposed to the following types of market risksfluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well asother goods and services, the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar, and changes in interest rates. Due to our inventory turnover rate and our historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in our costof goods to our customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. We purchase the majority of our merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for our stores located in Canadaand Europe.    Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents andmarketable securities. As of January 31, 2014 and 2013, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of cash on hand and in banks, money market accounts, corporate bonds rated A or better, municipal andpre-refunded municipal bonds rated A or better, treasury bills, certificates of deposit, federal government agencies, commercial paper rated A or better, which bear interest at variable rates, and mutual funds. Due to theshort average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, we believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. As the interest rates on a material portionof our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would not impact the fair marketvalue of the related underlying instruments.    During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we sold all of our remaining AuctionRate Securities (ARS) for $4,580 in cash. Our ARS had a par value and a recorded fair value of $4,925 and $4,330, respectively, prior to the sale and as of January 31, 2013.
