Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis         of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       The following discussion of the Company's historical results of operations and of its liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements of the Company and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  General       The Company's fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to fiscal years of the Company refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, the Company's "Fiscal 1999" ended on January 31, 1999. The comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion are calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented.       The Company operates two business segments - a lifestyle-oriented general merchandise retailing segment and a wholesale apparel business ("Wholesale"). The retailing segment operates through retail stores and through direct response, including a catalog and a website. The two retail concepts are Urban Outfitters ("Urban Retail") and Anthropologie. Urban Retail is the larger of the two and generates most of the Company's revenues and profits. Urban Retail had 32 stores open at January 31, 1999 and 26 at January 31, 1998. The Company's first Anthropologie store opened in October 1992. Anthropologie had 14 stores open at January 31, 1999 and 9 at January 31, 1998. The Company has plans to open six Urban Retail stores and five Anthropologie stores in Fiscal 2000. An Anthropologie catalog was tested in the first half of Fiscal 1999 and, based upon the success of the test, was launched during the second half of the year. To support the catalog, a website was established in August 1998. In response to customer requests, the site began accepting orders in December 1998. The direct response operation incurred a loss for the year, and management expects the catalog and the Company's "e-commerce" efforts to also incur a loss for Fiscal 2000.       Fiscal 1999 and 1998 continued as profitable years for Urban Outfitters with earnings to net sales of 7.6% and 8.0%, respectively, as well as return on beginning shareholders' equity of 17.4% and 18.3%, respectively. The slight contraction of earnings as a percent of sales in Fiscal 1999 and the reduction in return on shareholders' equity in that year resulted primarily from the start-up costs of the catalog effort and the 35% decrease in sales by Wholesale to unrelated entities. The Wholesale company had recorded sales growth of 8% in Fiscal 1998. The Wholesale company is anticipated to grow at a modest rate in Fiscal 2000.       The Company previously established a European subsidiary - Urban Outfitters (U.K.) Ltd. - and opened its first Urban Retail store in London in June 1998.  The success of the London store opening enabled the subsidiary to make a small profit during Fiscal 1999.                                         14   Results of Operations       The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of the Company's net sales represented by certain income statement data and the growth of certain income statement data from period to period. The Company has revised its manner of reporting gross profit to group certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs with cost of goods sold in order to enhance the comparability of its results with other specialty apparel retailers. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.

The $35.9 million increase was attributable to a combination of comparable store net sales increases of $15.1 million, net sales increases of $25.6 million from stores opened during Fiscal 1998 and Fiscal 1999, and catalog and e-commerce revenues of $5.7 million, offset in part by a decrease of $10.5 million from the Wholesale company.                                         15        In Fiscal 1999, increases in the number of transactions in comparable stores and an increase in average sales prices resulting from a lower proportion of markdowns accounted for the comparable store sales dollar increase. Eleven new stores were opened in Fiscal 1999 and three new stores were opened in Fiscal 1998. The Wholesale sales decrease reflected lower purchases by larger retail chains, as well as customer issues regarding quality, delivery and fashion, which have been addressed by management.       Gross profit margins increased to 38.0% of sales in Fiscal 1999 from 35.0% of sales in Fiscal 1998. This increase is attributable to higher initial mark-ups and lower markdown percentages in the Urban Retail and Anthropologie stores. Comparable store sales increases in existing stores offset the higher occupancy costs of noncomparable and new stores. Reduced sales in the Wholesale segment necessitated an increased proportion of merchandise to be sold in the "off-price" sector, offsetting in part, the higher retail segment performance.       Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 26.0% of sales in Fiscal 1999 from 22.3% of sales in Fiscal 1998 due to the costs incurred for the start-up of the catalog and European operations as well as the substantial negative leverage associated with the decline in Wholesale segment sales. The increase in dollars in selling, general and administrative expenses is attributable to the opening of additional stores as well as the catalog start-up.   Fiscal 1998 Compared to Fiscal 1997       Net sales in Fiscal 1998 increased to $173.1 million from $156.4 million in the prior fiscal year, a 10.7% increase. The $16.7 million increase was attributable to a combination of comparable store net sales decreases of $1.6 million, net sales increases of $16.1 million from stores opened or enlarged during Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal 1998 and net sales increases of $2.2 million from the Wholesale company.       The decrease in comparable store sales of 1% or $1.6 million resulted primarily from one merchandise division that did not perform to prior year levels. Average selling prices were not a significant determinant of Fiscal 1998 sales levels. New and enlarged stores included seven stores opened in Fiscal 1997 and three opened in Fiscal 1998. The Company believes increased net sales from the Wholesale subsidiary during Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal 1998 were attributable to increased orders and order size due to the popularity of its product lines.       The Company's gross profit margin declined from 36.5% in Fiscal 1997 to 35.0% in Fiscal 1998 due to higher cost of goods sold and higher occupancy costs. The primary contributor to the cost of goods sold increase was higher markdowns in the retail segment. Markdowns were triggered by lower than planned comparable store sales. Occupancy costs as a percentage of sales increased due to the impact of new stores and the comparable store sales decline.                                         16        Selling, general and administrative expenses grew to $38.5 million in Fiscal 1998 from $35.7 million in the prior fiscal year, a 7.7% increase. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative costs decreased from 22.8% of sales in Fiscal 1997 to 22.3% of sales in Fiscal 1998. The increase in dollars is due to the opening of new stores during Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal 1998. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of sales was attributable to cost containment measures at store level.   Liquidity and Capital Resources       During the last three years, the Company has satisfied its cash requirements through cash flow from operations. The Company's primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories. Most recently, the Company invested in the Anthropologie direct response effort and in a new European subsidiary. An investment has also been made in a direct response company aimed at teen shoppers (see "HMB Publishing" below). In addition to cash generated from operations, sources of cash have included the net proceeds from the exercise of certain employee stock options in each of Fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997. Over the next few years, the Company expects to incur capital expenditures in support of its expansion program. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations are expected to fund such expansion-related uses of cash, including additional investments in the direct response operations.       Although the Company has not borrowed short-term or long-term funds during the last five fiscal years, it maintains a line of credit of $16.2 million, all of which is available for cash borrowings or for the issuance of letters of credit. The line is unsecured and any cash borrowings under the line would accrue interest upon an as-offered basis not to exceed LIBOR plus 1/2 of 1 percent. The Company uses letters of credit primarily to purchase private label and Wholesale merchandise from offshore suppliers. Outstanding balances of letters of credit at January 31, 1999 and 1998 were $4.1 million and $4.7 million, respectively. There were no short-term or long-term borrowings outstanding at January 31, 1999 or at January 31, 1998. The Company expects that accumulated cash and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash needs for at least the next three years.   Other Matters  Year 2000       The Year 2000 problem concerns the inability of information and technology- based operating systems to function properly after December 31, 1999. This could result in system failures and miscalculations which may cause business disruptions.                                         17        The Company does not generally sell products that must be brought into Year 2000 compliance. However, the Company does rely upon many vendors and suppliers for their products and services, as well as utilities, financial institutions and governmental entities that provide critical services to the Company and to its customers. The Company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the Year 2000 issue. Based on the review, the Company's major information technology systems ("IT") that would be adversely affected by Year 2000 dates will be upgraded or replaced through the normal course of business prior to December 31, 1999. Internal resources will be used in a timely manner to evaluate, modify and test the Company's less critical systems that are not scheduled to be upgraded or replaced through the normal course of business. The Company's core merchandising and financial system upgrade and the store register system upgrades have been completed; testing of these upgrades is substantially completed. In addition, the Company is in the process of completing the inventory and assessment of its non-information technology systems ("non-IT"), including those with embedded processor chips -- heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, elevators, etc.       The Company has also reviewed and continues to monitor the implemented changes or planned changes of its major suppliers that management believes could be affected by Year 2000 dates. The Company is evaluating key vendor preparedness by conducting interviews, obtaining compliance representation letters and, if deemed necessary, conducting comprehensive tests.       The Company expects to complete its Year 2000 compliance evaluation program by June 30, 1999. At this time, management continues to believe that the incremental costs associated with major system upgrades and/or replacements, as well as internal efforts to evaluate, modify and test the Company's other systems to ensure Year 2000 compliance, will not be material to the Company. There can be no guarantee, however, that the Company's efforts will prevent Year 2000 issues from having a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The possible consequences to the Company if its vendors and suppliers are not fully Year 2000 compliant (including the global banking systems, communications and other public utilities and the transportation industry) include temporary store closings and delays in the receipt of key merchandise. Accordingly, the Company is in the process of developing contingency plans to mitigate the potential disruptions that may result from the Year 2000 issue. Such plans may include earlier receipt of key merchandise, preparing alternative merchandise delivery methodologies and securing alternative suppliers. It is anticipated that these contingency plans to manage identified IT and non-IT areas of high risk will be completed by June 30, 1999. There can be no guarantee, however, that any contingency plans developed by the Company will prevent such material adverse effects.                                         18   Recent Accounting Pronouncements       In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133") which is required to be adopted in fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 133 effective February 1, 2000. The Company currently enters into short-term foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures related to its Canadian dollar denominated investments and anticipated cash flow. The amounts of the contracts and related gains and losses have not been material. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 is not expected to have a significant effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.  Market Risks       The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks - fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Company's inventory turn and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases substantially all its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and the United Kingdom. As explained in the section above on "Recent Accounting Pronouncements," the market risk is further limited by the Company's purchase of foreign currency forward exchange contracts.       Since the Company has not been a borrower, its exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to the impact on its marketable securities portfolio. This exposure is minimized by the limited investment maturities and "put" options available to the Company as explained in the notes to the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. The impact of a hypothetical two percent increase or decrease in prevailing interest rates would not materially affect the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.  HMB Publishing, Inc.       On February 5, 1998 the Company entered into an agreement with HMB Publishing, Inc. ("HMB") for the purchase of securities convertible into a minority interest in the company through Series B Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series B Preferred") and certain convertible debentures. The agreement called for additional investments and ownership if HMB met certain performance milestones. HMB is a development stage company that publishes mXg(TM), a combination magazine and catalog and operates a website - www.mXgonline.com - that caters to teenage girls. The original business plan contemplated substantial losses in the first two fiscal years.                                         19        As of January 31, 1999, the Company has invested approximately $2.0 million in the Series B Preferred and an additional $1.75 million in the convertible debentures. Since January 31, 1999, the Company has advanced an additional $1.1 million to fund further marketing efforts and additional development of the website and, together with additional investors, will seek to position HMB for more rapid expansion. The Company expects to realize a return on its investment, and it is the Company's intent to maintain an equity interest following any public offering by HMB.  Subsequent Event        In accordance with its previously announced stock buyback program, that authorized the Company to repurchase up to 800,000 of its shares, the Company has repurchased 279,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of $3.7 million during the period from February 1, 1999 through March 12, 1999 in a series of individual open market transactions.  Forward-Looking Statements       Pursuant to the "Safe Harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, this report contains forward-looking statements which may be identified by their use of words such as "plans," "expects," "will," "anticipates," "intends," "projects," "estimates" or other words of similar meaning. Any one or all of the following factors could cause actual financial results to differ materially from those financial results mentioned in the forward-looking statements: industry competition factors, unavailability of suitable retail space for expansion, difficulty in predicting and responding to fashion trend shifts, seasonal fluctuations in gross sales, the level of returns experienced by the business segments, the levels of margins achievable in the marketplace, the departure of one or more key senior managers, the failure of the Company or third parties to become Year 2000 capable and other risks identified in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update forward-looking statements and cannot guarantee that the assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be realized.                                         20   Seasonality and Quarterly Results       While Urban Outfitters has been profitable in each of its last 36 operating quarters, its operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. The Company's highest sales levels have historically occurred during the five-month period from August 1 to December 31 of each year (the "Back-to-School" and Holiday periods). Sales generated during these periods have traditionally had a significant impact on the Company's results of operations. Any decreases in sales for these periods or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding these periods could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. The Company's results of operations in any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that can be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year.       The Company's results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of expenses incurred in connection with, and sales contributed by, new stores, store expansions and the integration of new stores into the operations of the Company or by the size and timing of mailings of the Company's Anthropologie catalog. Fluctuations in the bookings and shipments of Wholesale products between quarters can also have positive or negative effects on earnings during the quarters.                                         21        The following tables, which are unaudited, set forth the Company's net sales, gross profit, net income and income per share for each quarter during the last three fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The Company has revised its manner of reporting gross profit to group certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs with cost of goods sold in order to enhance comparability of its results with other specialty apparel retailers. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.
