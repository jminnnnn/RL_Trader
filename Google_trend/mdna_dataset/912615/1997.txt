Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results         of Operations       The following discussion of the Company's historical results of operations and of its liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements of the Company and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  General       The Company is composed of two retail subsidiaries, Urban Retail and Anthropologie, and a Wholesale subsidiary. Urban Retail is the largest of the three, has the highest gross profit margins and generates most of the Company's revenues and profits. Urban Retail had 25 stores opened at January 31, 1997 and 23 at January 31, 1996. The Company's first Anthropologie store opened in October 1992. Two Anthropologie stores were added in fiscal 1995. Due to protracted lease negotiations, no new stores were opened in fiscal 1996, while five Anthropologie stores were opened in fiscal 1997. Negotiations for additional leases continue. The Wholesale company's growth is from both the domestic and international markets.       Fiscal 1997 and 1996 continued as very profitable years for Urban Outfitters with earnings to net sales of 8.5% and 9.3%, respectively, as well as return on shareholders' equity of 17.5% and 20.7%, respectively. The slight contraction of earning to net sales in fiscal 1997 and the direction of return on shareholders' equity in that year resulted primarily from a slowdown in retail sales growth in both fiscal 1997 and 1996. A combination of lower comparable store sales growth in the two years and planned new stores either not opened (fiscal 1996) or opened late (fiscal 1997) caused the slowdown in sales growth. The Wholesale company has, by contrast, continued to record exceptional sales growth throughout the two fiscal years.       The Company's fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to fiscal years of the Company refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, the Company's 1997 fiscal year is its fiscal year ended January 31, 1997. The comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion are calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented.  Results of Operations       The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of the Company's net sales represented by certain income statement data and the growth of certain of such income statement data from period to period.                                          13                                                                    Fiscal Year Ended                                                                January 31,                                                      ------------------------------ As a Percentage of Net Sales                         1995         1996         1997                                                      ----         ----         ----        Net sales ..................................        100.0%       100.0%       100.0% Cost of goods sold .........................         47.9         49.2         49.8                                                     -----        -----        -----   Gross profit .............................         52.1         50.8         50.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses         36.1         35.9         36.5                                                     -----        -----        -----   Income from operations ...................         16.0         14.9         13.7 Net interest and other expenses (income) ...

The $23.4 million increase was attributable to comparable store net sales increases of $2.2 million, net sales of $14.5 million from stores opened or enlarged during fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1997 and net sales increases of $6.7 million from the Wholesale company. The comparable store sales increase of 2.1% or $2.2 million in fiscal 1997 over 1996 results from the inverse relationship of higher average selling prices and fewer pieces sold. The higher average selling prices representing approximately $12.1 million and the fewer pieces sold approximately $9.9 million leaving the $2.2 million in comparable store sales. New and enlarged stores included four stores opened in fiscal 1996 and seven opened in fiscal 1997. The Company believes increased net sales from the Wholesale subsidiary during fiscal 1997 were attributable to increased orders and order size due to the popularity of its product lines as well as growth in number of orders and size of orders from international customers.                                          14          The Company's gross profit margin declined from 50.8% in fiscal 1996 to 50.2% in fiscal 1997. The primary contributors to the decline were higher markdowns in the retail companies, high growth of a new, lower margin product line in the Wholesale company, and a mix swing to higher sales in the lower gross profit margin companies -- Anthropologie and Wholesale. Markdowns were triggered by lower than plan comparable store sales and by late openings of two Urban Retail stores. The new Wholesale product line did not have production economies of scale enjoyed by its larger and more established product lines.       Selling, general and administrative expenses grew to $57.1 million in fiscal 1997 from $47.7 million in the prior fiscal year, a 19.8% increase. As a percentage of net sales, the expenses increased to 36.5% in fiscal 1997 from 35.9% in the prior fiscal year. The increase in percentage was attributable to Urban Retail due to lower comparable store sales. Conversely, both Anthropologie and Wholesale experienced selling, general and administrative expense leveraging on significant sales growth.       Net income increased to $13.3 million in fiscal 1997 from $12.3 million in the prior fiscal year, a 7.7% increase. This increase was principally achieved through increases in net sales.   Fiscal 1996 Compared to Fiscal 1995       Net sales in fiscal 1996 increased to $133.0 million from $110.1 million in the prior fiscal year, a 20.8% increase. The $22.9 million increase was attributable to comparable store net sales increases of $2.3 million, net sales of $19.0 million from stores opened or enlarged during fiscal 1995 and fiscal 1996 and net sales increases of $1.6 million from Wholesale. The comparable store sales increase of 3.3% over fiscal 1995 levels was created by an inverse relationship between a decline in the average selling price and a greater increase in the pieces sold. The average selling price decline of 3.5% was a combination of lower initial selling prices from a mix of lower priced merchandise (not lower markups) and higher markdowns in fiscal 1996 when compared to fiscal 1995. Pieces sold, on the other hand, increased by 7.1%. The increases from new and enlarged store sales growth in fiscal 1996 were attributed to three Urban Retail stores and two Anthropologie stores opened in the second half of fiscal 1995 and four Urban Retail stores opened in fiscal 1996. The Company believes increased net sales from the Wholesale subsidiary during fiscal 1996 were attributable to increased orders and order size due to the popularity of its product lines.       The Company's gross profit margin declined from 52.1% in fiscal 1995 to 50.8% in fiscal 1996. The primary contributors to the decline were higher markdowns across all three companies in fiscal 1996. Contrary to the markdown trend, initial markups were higher in each company than in the prior year. Anthropologie stores opened prior to the beginning of fiscal 1996 sold well against their sales plan, but had bought inventory for expected store openings that did not take place in fiscal 1996. This added to the markdowns. Anthropologie sales grew at a faster rate than Urban Retail but, at the same time, had a lower gross profit margin thus contributing to the overall decline. Freight rates on a growing group of West Coast and Southwest stores contributed slightly.                                          15          Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $47.7 million in fiscal 1996 from $39.8 million in the prior fiscal year, a 20.0% increase. As a percentage of net sales, the expenses decreased to 35.9% in fiscal 1996 from 36.1% in the prior fiscal year. All three companies contributed to the decrease. The companies were subject to expense control programs initiated when it became apparent, early in the year, that sales were not going to meet planned levels during the first half. The year-to-year aggregate dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was almost entirely attributable to rent and other costs of operating new stores.       Net income increased to $12.3 million in fiscal 1996 from $10.8 million in the prior fiscal year, a 13.8% increase. This increase was principally achieved through increases in net sales, a small percentage reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, higher net interest income and lower nonoperating expenses.  Liquidity and Capital Resources       During the last three years the Company has satisfied its cash requirements through cash flow from operations. The Company's primary uses of cash have been to open new stores, build a new distribution center and purchase inventories. In addition to cash generated from operations, sources of cash have included the net proceeds from the exercise of certain warrants and employee stock options in each of fiscal 1995, 1996 and 1997. Over the next few years, the Company expects to incur capital expenditures in support of its expansion program. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations are expected to fund such expansion-related uses of cash.       Although the Company has not borrowed short-term or long-term funds during the last five fiscal years, it maintains a line of credit of $10.0 million, of which all is available for cash borrowings or for the issuance of letters of credit. The line is unsecured and any cash borrowings under the line would accrue interest at the LIBOR rate plus 1/2 of one percent. The Company uses letters of credit primarily to purchase private label and Wholesale merchandise from offshore suppliers. Outstanding balances of letters of credit at January 31, 1996 and 1997 were $5.3 million and $4.3 million, respectively. There were no short-term or long-term debts outstanding at January 31, 1996 or at January 31, 1997.       The Company expects that accumulated cash and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash needs for at least the next three years.                                          16     Seasonality and Quarterly Results       While Urban Outfitters has been profitable in each of its last 28 operating quarters, its operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. The Company's highest sales levels have historically occurred during the five-month period from August 1 to December 31 of each year (the "Back-to-School" and Holiday periods). Sales generated during these periods have traditionally had a significant impact on the Company's results of operations. Any decreases in sales for these periods or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding these periods could have a material, adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. The Company's results of operations in any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that can be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year.       The Company's results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of expenses incurred in connection with, and sales contributed by, new stores, store expansions and the integration of new stores into the operations of the Company, as well as other factors. The addition of a large number of new stores can therefore significantly affect results of operations on a quarter-to-quarter basis.       The following tables, which are unaudited, set forth the Company's net sales, gross profit, net income and earnings per share for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income.
