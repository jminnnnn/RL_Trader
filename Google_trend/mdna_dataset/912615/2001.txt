Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    The following discussion of the Company's historical results of operations and of its liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements of the Company and related notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report.  General    The Company's fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to fiscal years of the Company refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, the Company's "Fiscal 2001" ended on January 31, 2001. The comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion is calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented.    The Company operates two business segments--a lifestyle-oriented general merchandise retailing segment and a wholesale apparel business ("Wholesale"). The retailing segment operates through retail stores and direct response, including a catalog and two web sites. The two retail concepts are Urban Outfitters ("Urban Retail") and Anthropologie. Urban Retail is the larger of the two and generates the majority of the Company's revenues and profits. Urban Retail had 42 stores open at January 31, 2001 and 37 at January 31, 2000. Anthropologie had 26 stores open at January 31, 2001 and 20 at January 31, 2000. The Company has plans to open approximately 10 stores during Fiscal 2002.    Fiscal 2001 and 2000 continued as profitable years for Urban Outfitters with net income to net sales of 3.6% and 6.7%, respectively, as well as return on beginning shareholders' equity of 8.7% for Fiscal 2001 and 17.7% for Fiscal 2000. The Company experienced total sales growth of 6.2% during Fiscal 2001, however, net income as a percentage of sales and return on beginning shareholders equity for Fiscal 2001 declined primarily as a result of a decrease in comparable store sales and an increase in occupancy costs. Weaker sales created a greater proportionate need for clearance markdowns and a deleveraging of store-related expenses, which combined with increased occupancy costs, ultimately resulted in a negative impact on earnings that more than offset the impact of overall sales growth and the Company's cost containment efforts. The reduction in net income as a percentage                                         8   of sales in Fiscal 2000 compared to Fiscal 1999 resulted primarily from a net charge to earnings of $4.4 million to recognize a required accounting reserve for the Company's portion of operating losses relating to its minority investment in MXG Media, Inc. (see "Other Matters--MXG Media, Inc." below). Although net income as a percentage of sales declined during Fiscal 2000, the return on beginning shareholders' equity increased over the prior year due primarily to the Company's sales growth.  The Company has wholly-owned subsidiaries that operate Urban Retail stores in London, England, Dublin, Ireland and Montreal and Toronto, Canada. The results of operations and financial position for the European and Canadian stores are included in the Company's retail operations segment results. The Company plans to open a store in Glasgow, Scotland during Fiscal 2002 and additional stores in Canada and Europe in the future.    For Fiscal 2001, the Wholesale company experienced a sales decline of 7.7% over the prior year, after elimination of intersegment sales to Urban Retail and Anthropologie. Wholesale company sales are expected to remain level for Fiscal 2002.  Results of Operations    The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of the Company's net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. During Fiscal 2001, to comply with new FASB requirements (Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-10), the Company has restated net sales and gross profit in its treatment of shipping and handling revenues and expenses. Shipping and handling revenues had been previously offset against related costs in cost of sales for direct response (catalog and e-commerce) activities, or offset against store level costs within selling, general and administrative expenses for revenues generated by retail stores from delivery activities. Shipping and handling revenues now appear in net sales and all such related costs are included in cost of sales. The restatement does not affect income from operations. During Fiscal 1999, the Company revised its manner of reporting gross profit to group certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs with cost of sales in order to enhance the comparability of its results with other specialty apparel retailers. The prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

The $17.2 million increase was primarily attributable to non-comparable and new store net sales increases of $29.4 million. In addition, direct response net sales increased by $4.7 million due to increased customer demand from the Anthropologie catalog and web site (principally due to a 44% increase in catalog circulation) and the new Urban web site. These increases more than offset the 7% comparable store net sales decrease of $15.2 million and a decrease of $1.7 million in external sales by the Wholesale company.    In Fiscal 2001, the Company experienced a decrease in comparable store sales, which was caused by a lackluster response to the Company's product offerings. Consequently, the Company experienced lower average sales prices, primarily resulting from a higher proportion of markdowns. Eleven new stores were opened in Fiscal 2001, and twelve new stores were opened and one store was closed due to a lease expiration in Fiscal 2000. The Wholesale sales decrease was due to a reduction in purchases by certain catalog customers.    Gross profit margins decreased to 32.3% of sales in Fiscal 2001 from 37.6% of sales in Fiscal 2000. Retail clearance markdowns to move seasonal merchandise reduced gross margins, expressed as a percentage of sales, by 2.4% for the year. The impact on occupancy costs as a percentage of sales due to the negative comparable store sales results and increased percentage occupancy costs of noncomparable and new stores accounted for most of the remainder of the margin decline. Total inventories at January 31, 2001 increased by 29.5%, principally attributable to new store requirements. Comparable store inventory levels were flat.    Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 26.2% of sales in Fiscal 2001 from 24.1% of sales in Fiscal 2000 due principally to the following three factors: (1) noncomparable and new stores with lower average sales volumes have higher proportionate expenses than comparable stores and accounted for the bulk of the increase in dollars as well as the majority of the percentage increase, (2) the deleveraging impact of the comparable store sales decreases at the retail operations, and (3) Anthropologie direct response operations experienced an increase in operating expense percentages due to the deleveraging of catalog production costs caused by reduced customer response rates and increased catalog circulation. These increases in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were partially offset by the leveraging of catalog fulfillment costs due to the elimination of third-party service fulfillment providers in July 1999. Additionally, start up costs were incurred for the design, production and administration of the Urban e-commerce web site (www.urbn.com) which launched in May 2000.    Other income (expense) for Fiscal 2000 includes a net charge to earnings of $4.4 million to reserve for the Company's portion of operating losses related to the minority investment in MXG Media, Inc. (see "Other Matters--MXG Media, Inc." below). Income tax expense for Fiscal 2000 does not include a tax benefit related to this reserve which, in part, has caused an increase in the Company's effective income tax rate.  Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999    Net sales in Fiscal 2000 increased to $278.1 million from $209.9 million in the prior fiscal year, a 32.5% increase. The $68.2 million increase was attributable to noncomparable and new stores net sales increases of $39.5 million, comparable store net sales increases aggregating $15.8 million, direct response (Anthropologie catalog and e-commerce) revenue increases of $10.5 million and an increase of $2.4 million in net sales from the Wholesale company.    In Fiscal 2000, increases in the number of transactions in comparable stores and an increase in average sales prices resulting from reducing the level of lower priced items such as greeting cards, as well as a lower proportion of markdowns, accounted for the comparable store sales dollar increase. During Fiscal 2000, twelve new stores were opened, one store was relocated, and one store was closed due to a lease expiration. Eleven stores were opened in Fiscal 1999. Direct response revenue growth was due to increased catalog circulation and web site traffic. The Company believes increased net sales from the Wholesale company during Fiscal 2000 were due to increased popularity of its fashion offerings combined with improved delivery and quality of merchandise.                                         10     Gross profit margins remained the same at 37.6% of sales in Fiscal 2000 and Fiscal 1999, principally attributable to higher initial mark-ups in the Urban Retail and Anthropologie stores offset by increased occupancy costs and investments in additional merchandising, design and production staff.    Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 24.1% of sales in Fiscal 2000 from 25.6% of sales in Fiscal 1999. Aggressive store cost containment combined with the comparable store sales increases resulted in the leveraging of operating expenses in the retail segment. Additionally, direct response operations experienced a similar reduction in operating expense percentages for the year due to the significant increase in sales, improvements in catalog production costs, and the efficiencies attributable to moving the Anthropologie catalog call center in-house in July 1999. The increase in sales by the Wholesale company also resulted in the leveraging of its operating expenses.    Other income (expense) for Fiscal 2000 includes a net charge to earnings of $4.4 million to reserve for the Company's portion of operating losses related to the minority investment in MXG Media, Inc. (see "Other Matters--MXG Media, Inc." below). Income tax expense for Fiscal 2000 does not include a tax benefit related to this reserve which, in part, has caused an increase in the Company's effective income tax rate.  Liquidity and Capital Resources    During the last three years, the Company had satisfied its cash requirements through cash flow from operations, accumulated cash and the sales of marketable securities. The Company's primary uses of cash have been to open new stores, purchase inventories, and purchase its common stock. Additionally, during the last two years, the Company has continued to invest in the direct response effort and its European subsidiaries. In addition to cash generated from operations, sources of cash included the net proceeds from the exercise of certain employee stock options in Fiscal 2000 and Fiscal 1999. The Company expects to incur additional capital expenditures in support of its store expansion program. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations, as well as available credit under the Company's line of credit facilities, are expected to fund such expansion-related uses of cash.    Although the Company has not borrowed short-term or long-term funds during the last five fiscal years, it maintains discretionary line of credit facilities aggregating $26.2 million, all of which are available for cash borrowings or for the issuance of letters of credit. The credit facilities are unsecured and any cash borrowings under the facilities would accrue interest at a rate not to exceed LIBOR plus 1/2 of one percent. The Company uses letters of credit to purchase merchandise for the retail and wholesale segments. Outstanding balances of letters of credit at January 31, 2001 and 2000 were $8.0 million and $6.6 million, respectively. There were no short- term or long-term borrowings outstanding at January 31, 2001 or at January 31, 2000. The Company expects that accumulated cash, cash from operations and available credit under the Company's line of credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash needs for the next year.  Other Matters   Recent Accounting Pronouncements    In July 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued No. 00-10, "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs" ("EITF 00-10"). Under the provisions of EITF 00-10, amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping and handling should be classified as revenue. As required, the Company adopted EITF 00-10 in its consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2001 and has restated all comparative prior period financial statements.    In its financial statements, the Company includes shipping and handling revenues in net sales and shipping and handling costs in cost of sales. Previously, the Company had offset shipping and handling revenues earned from its direct response (catalog and e-commerce) activities against shipping and handling costs incurred within cost of sales. Additionally, revenues earned from delivery transactions generated by retail stores were offset against store level costs within selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company's shipping and handling revenues consist of amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling merchandise. Shipping and handling costs include shipping supplies, related labor costs and third-party shipping costs.                                        11     In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101"). This pronouncement provides the staff's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues. Accordingly, guidance is provided with respect to the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in the financial statements. Adoption of SAB 101, as amended by SAB Nos. 101A and 101B, was effective in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2000. The adoption had no material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.    In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133"), which is required to be adopted in Fiscal 2002. The Company currently enters into short-term foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures related to its Canadian dollar denominated investments and anticipated cash flow. The amounts of the contracts and related gains and losses have not been material. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on February 1, 2001 did not have a significant effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.   MXG Media, Inc.    As of January 31, 2000, the Company had invested approximately $2.0 million in Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and $2.4 million in convertible debentures of MXG Media, Inc. ("MXG"). MXG incurred losses from its inception, and, in accordance with the equity method of accounting, the Company recorded charges to earnings of $4.4 million for its portion of operating losses related to the minority interest in MXG during Fiscal Year 2000. These charges in Fiscal 2000 fully reserved for the Company's investment, and the Company made no additional investments in Fiscal 2001 in MXG.    On September 13, 2000, MXG ceased operations and filed a petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. MXG had been unsuccessful in attempts to raise additional capital. The Company does not expect to recover any material portion of its investment in MXG.   Forward-Looking Statements    Pursuant to the "Safe Harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, this report contains forward-looking statements which may be identified by their use of words such as "plans," "expects," "will," "anticipates," "intends," "projects," "estimates" or other words of similar meaning. Any one or all of the following factors could cause actual financial results to differ materially from those financial results mentioned in the forward-looking statements: industry competition factors, availability of suitable retail space for expansion, difficulty in predicting and responding to fashion trend shifts, seasonal fluctuations in gross sales, the level of returns experienced by the business segments, the levels of margins achievable in the marketplace, trade restrictions and political or financial instability in countries where the Company's goods are manufactured, the departure of one or more key senior managers, and other risks identified in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update forward-looking statements and cannot guarantee that the assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be realized.  Seasonality and Quarterly Results    While Urban Outfitters has been profitable in each of its last 44 operating quarters, its operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. The Company's highest sales levels have historically occurred during the five- month period from August 1 to December 31 of each year (the Back-to-School and Holiday periods). Sales generated during these periods have traditionally had a significant impact on the Company's results of operations. Any decreases in sales for these periods or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding these periods could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. While the Company's negative comparable store sales trend has continued since January 31, 2001 and net income in the first quarter of Fiscal 2002 is expected to be substantially lower than the $0.17 per share earned in the comparable quarter of Fiscal 2001, the Company's results of operations in any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that can be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year.                                        12     The Company's results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of expenses incurred in connection with, and sales contributed by, new stores, store expansions and the integration of new stores into the operations of the Company or by the size and timing of catalog mailings and web site traffic for the Company's direct response operations. Fluctuations in the bookings and shipments of Wholesale merchandise between quarters can also have positive or negative effects on earnings during the quarters.    The following tables, which are unaudited, set forth the Company's net sales, gross profit, net income and income per share for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. During Fiscal 2001, to comply with new FASB requirements (Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-10), the Company has restated net sales and gross profit in its treatment of shipping and handling revenues and expenses. Shipping and handling revenues had been previously offset against related costs in cost of sales for direct response (catalog and e-commerce) activities, or offset against store level costs within selling, general and administrative expenses for revenues generated by retail stores from delivery activities. Shipping and handling revenues now appear in net sales and all such related costs are included in cost of sales. The restatement does not effect income from operations. Absent adoption of EITF Issue No. 00-10, net sales and gross profit (in thousands) during Fiscal 2001 would have been $65,291 and $23,211 in the quarter ended April 30, 2000, $66,301 and $19,781 in the quarter ended July 31, 2000, $76,501 and $24,471 in the quarter ended October 31, 2000, and $84,732 and $27,613 in the quarter ended January 31, 2001, respectively. During Fiscal 2000, net sales and gross profit (in thousands) would have been $57,991 and $21,428 in the quarter ended April 30, 1999, $67,976 and $26,296 in the quarter ended July 31, 1999, $75,384 and $28,668 in the quarter ended October 31, 1999, and $74,755 and $28,058 in the quarter ended January 31, 2000, respectively. During Fiscal 1999, the Company revised its manner of reporting gross profit to group certain buying, distribution and occupancy costs with cost of sales in order to enhance comparability of its results with other specialty apparel retailers. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    The Company is exposed to the following types of market risks--fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to the Company's inventory turn and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. The Company purchases substantially all its merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for its stores located in Canada and Europe. As explained in Item 7: Other Matters--Recent Accounting Pronouncements, the market risk is further limited by the Company's purchase of foreign currency forward exchange contracts.    Since the Company has not been a borrower, its exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to the impact on its holdings. The impact of a hypothetical two percent increase or decrease in prevailing interest rates would not materially affect the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.  Item 8.
