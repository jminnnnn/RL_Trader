Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditionand Results of Operations    Overview    We operate two reportable segments: a leading lifestyle specialty Retail segment and a Wholesale segment. Our Retail segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People, Terrain and Bhldnbrands, whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through retail stores, websites, mobile applications, catalogs and customer contact centers. Our Wholesale segment consists of the Free People wholesale division that primarily designs,develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel and shoes through individual and chain specialty stores and department stores.    Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal year 2016 ended on January 31,2016.    Retail Segment    Our omni-channel strategy enhances our customers brand experience by providing a seamless approach to the customer shopping experience. We have substantially integrated all available shoppingchannels, including stores, websites (online and through mobile devices) and catalogs. Our investments in areas such as marketing campaigns and technology advancements are designed to generate demand for the omni-channel and not the separate storeor direct-to-consumer channels. Store sales are primarily fulfilled from that stores inventory, but may also be shipped from any of our fulfillment centers or from a different store location if an item is not available at the original store.Direct-to-consumer orders are primarily shipped to our customers through our fulfillment centers, but may also be shipped from any store, or a combination of fulfillment centers and stores depending on the availability of particular items.Direct-to-consumer orders may also be picked up at a store location. As our customers continue to shop across multiple channels, we have adapted our approach towards meeting this demand. Due to the availability of like product in a variety ofshopping channels, we now source these products utilizing single stock keeping units based on the omni-channel demand rather than the demand of the separate channels. These and other technological capabilities allow us to better serve our customersand help us complete sales that otherwise may not have occurred due to out-of-stock positions. As a result of changing customer behavior and the substantial integration of the operations of our store and direct-to-consumer channels, we manage andanalyze our performance based on a single omni-channel rather than separate channels and believe that the omni-channel results present the most meaningful and appropriate measure of our performance.   Our comparable Retail segment net sales data is equal to the sum of our comparable store and comparable direct-to-consumer channel netsales. A store is considered to be comparable if it has been open at least twelve full months, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. A direct-to-consumerchannel is considered to be comparable if it has been operational for at least twelve full months. There is no overlap between comparable store net sales and comparable direct-to-consumer net sales. Sales from stores and direct-to-consumer channelsthat do not fall within the definition of comparable store or channel are considered to be non-comparable. The effects of foreign currency translation are also considered non-comparable.   We monitor customer traffic and customer conversion rates at our stores, and customer sessions, average order value and conversion rateson our websites. We believe that changes in any of these       25     metrics may be caused by a response to our brands fashion offerings, our marketing campaigns, circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our storebase.    As of January 31, 2016, we operated 240 Urban Outfitters stores of which 179 were located in the United States, 18were located in Canada and 43 were located in Europe. During fiscal 2016, we opened four new Urban Outfitters stores, of which two were located in the United States and two were located in Canada, and we closed two stores in the United States. Totalstore selling square footage as of January 31, 2016 was 2.2 million and was flat as compared to the prior year. Urban Outfitters operates websites in North America and Europe that capture the spirit of the brand by offering a similar yetbroader selection of merchandise as found in our stores. Urban Outfitters offers a catalog in Europe offering select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 28through a unique merchandise mix, compelling store environment and websites. Urban Outfitters product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, intimates, footwear, beauty and accessories, activewear and gear, electronics,as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years. Urban Outfitters North American and European Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 32.5% and 8.0% ofconsolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2016, compared to 32.9% and 8.8%, respectively, for fiscal 2015.    TheAnthropologie Group consists of the Anthropologie, Bhldn and Terrain brands. We initially operated the Bhldn and Terrain brands as standalone concepts and opened two Bhldn stores and two Terrain garden centers. We ultimately determined that theBhldn and Terrain brands were complementary to the Anthropologie brand and integrated those brands with the Anthropologie brand during fiscal 2015 and 2016, respectively, to form the Anthropologie Group. As of January 31, 2016, we operated 218Anthropologie Group stores, of which 197 were located in the United States, 12 were located in Canada and nine were located in Europe. During fiscal 2016, we opened 14 new Anthropologie Group stores, of which 12 were located in the United States andtwo were located in Europe, and we closed two stores in the United States. Total store selling square footage as of January 31, 2016 increased 4.7% over the prior year period to 1.5 million. The Anthropologie Group operates websites in NorthAmerica and Europe that capture the spirit of our brands by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in our stores. The Anthropologie brand offers registry services through our website and mobile applications and in all ofour stores throughout the United States, allowing our customers to create gift registries for any occasion. The Anthropologie brand offers a catalog in North America and in Europe that markets select merchandise, most of which is also available inour Anthropologie brand stores. The Anthropologie brand tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 28 to 45. The Anthropologie brands product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, intimates,shoes, beauty, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. The Bhldn brand offers a curated collection of heirloom quality wedding gowns, bridesmaid frocks, party dresses, assorted jewelry, headpieces, footwear, lingerie anddecorations. The Terrain brand is designed to appeal to women and men interested in a creative and sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Merchandise includes lifestyle home and garden products combined with antiques, live plants,flowers, wellness products and accessories. Both Terrain garden centers also offer a full service restaurant and coffee bar. We plan to open additional Anthropologie brand stores over the next several years, some of which will include Bhldn orTerrain shop-within-shop concepts. The Anthropologie Groups North American and European Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 40.2% and 1.6% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2016, compared to 40.1% and 1.5%,respectively, for fiscal 2015.       26     As of January 31, 2016, we operated 114 Free People stores, of which 109 were locatedin the United States and five were located in Canada. During fiscal 2016, we opened 13 new Free People stores, of which 12 were located in the United States and one was located in Canada, and we closed one store located in the United States due tolease expiration. Total store selling square footage as of January 31, 2016, increased 27.8% over the prior year period to 203,000. Free People operates websites in North America, Europe and Asia that capture the spirit of the brand by offeringa similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in our stores, as well as substantially all of the Free People wholesale offerings. Free People also offers a catalog that markets select merchandise, most of which is also available in ourFree People stores. Free People focuses its product offering on private label merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, intimates, shoes, activewear,accessories, home products and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years. Free Peoples Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 10.1% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016, compared to approximately9.2% for fiscal 2015.    For all brands combined, we plan to open approximately 27 new stores during fiscal 2017, including fiveUrban Outfitters stores, ten Anthropologie Group stores and 12 Free People stores.    Wholesale Segment   Our Wholesale segment consists of the Free People wholesale division that designs, develops and markets young womens contemporarycasual apparel. Free Peoples range of tops, bottoms, sweaters, dresses, intimates, shoes and activewear are sold through approximately 1,800 better department and specialty stores worldwide, and our own Free People stores. Our Wholesalesegment net sales accounted for approximately 7.6% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016, compared to 6.8% for fiscal 2015.    CriticalAccounting Policies and Estimates    Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generallyaccepted accounting principles in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses during thereporting period.    Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee.Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accountingpolicies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to makeestimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events orcircumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates.       27     Revenue Recognition   We recognize revenue in our Retail segment at the point-of-sale for merchandise the customer takes possession of at our store or whenmerchandise is shipped to the customer, in each case, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized by our Wholesale segment when merchandise is shipped to the customer, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is presented on a netbasis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental or municipal authority. Payment for merchandise in our Retail segment is tendered by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, uncollectible accounts receivable forour Retail segment is negligible and primarily results from unauthorized credit card transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for the Wholesale segment accounts receivable, which we review on a regular basis and believe issufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments.    We account for a gift card transaction by recording aliability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. A liability is established and remains on our books until the card is redeemed by the customer, at which time we record the redemption ofthe card for merchandise as a sale, or when we determine the likelihood of redemption is remote. We determine the probability of the gift cards being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns. Revenues attributable to thereduction of gift card liabilities for which the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and are not material. Our gift cards do not expire.    Sales Return Reserve    We record a reserve for estimated product returnswhere the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported. The reserve for estimated product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate ismaterially different than our estimate, sales returns would be adjusted in the future. As of January 31, 2016 and 2015, reserves for estimated sales returns totaled $24.4 million and $19.8 million, representing 3.5% and 3.5% of totalliabilities, respectively.    Marketable Securities   All of our marketable securities as of January 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015 are classified as available-for-sale and arecarried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost. Interest on these securities, as well as the amortization of discounts and premiums, is included in Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We record unrealizedgains and losses on these securities (other than mutual funds, held in the rabbi trust for the Urban Outfitters, Inc. Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (See Note 3, Marketable Securities, in the Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements)) as a component of Other comprehensive (loss) income in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and in Accumulated other comprehensive loss within Shareholders equity until realized,except when we consider declines in value to be other than temporary. Other than temporary impairment losses related to credit losses are considered to be realized losses. Mutual funds held in the rabbi trust have been accounted for under the fairvalue option, which results in all unrealized gains and losses being recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. When available-for-sale securities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically identifiedand is used to determine the realized gain or loss. Securities classified as current assets have maturity dates of less than or equal to one year from the balance sheet date. Securities classified as non-current assets have maturity dates greaterthan one year from the balance sheet date.       28     Inventory    We value our inventory, which consists primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method and includes the costof merchandise and import related costs, including freight, import taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors we consider inour review, such as future expected consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts and class or type of inventory, are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value. Criteriathat we consider in our review of aging trends include average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the prior twelve months and the value and nature of merchandisecurrently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventory to its estimated net realizable value, if appropriate. Any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact onthe value of our inventory and our reported operating results. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our provision and related inventory to increase overtime as we increase our sales. The majority of inventory at January 31, 2016, and 2015 consisted of finished goods. Raw materials and work-in-process were not material to the overall inventory value. Inventory as of January 31, 2016 and2015 totaled $330.2 million and $358.2 million, representing 18.0% and 19.0% of total assets, respectively.    Long-LivedAssets    Our long-lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, buildings, furniture and fixtures, andother operating equipment and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over thelesser of the applicable store lease term, including lease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Buildings are recorded at costand are amortized using the straight-line method over 39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Other operating equipment is recordedat cost and amortized using the straight-line method over its useful life, which is three to ten years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2016 and 2015 totaled $863.1 million and $889.2 million, representing 47.1% and 47.1% of totalassets, respectively.    We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long-livedassets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the lesser of the extension period, life of the improvement, or the remaining term of the lease.   Impairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible Assets   We periodically review the carrying values of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carryingvalue may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include plans to close a store, distribution or fulfillment center or a significant decrease in the operating results of a long-lived asset. Our retail stores are reviewed forimpairment at       29     the store level, which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors suchas store type (e.g., mall versus free-standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered indetermining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be within three years from the date a store location has opened. In assessing an asset for potential impairment, we makeestimates regarding future operating results, cash flows and estimated useful life. When events indicate that an asset may be impaired and the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the impaired asset isadjusted to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded. We have not made any material changes in the methodology to assess and calculate impairment of long-lived assets in the past three fiscal years. During fiscal 2016, we recordedimpairment charges for five retail stores, totaling $8.9 million, of which $7.4 million is in Cost of sales and $1.5 million is in Selling, general and administrative expenses, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Duringour assessment of current and future performance it was determined that these stores would not be able to generate sufficient cash flow over the expected remaining lease term to recover the carrying value of the respective store assets. Impairmentcharges for fiscal 2015 and 2014 were immaterial.    Accounting for Income Taxes   As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the taxjurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such asdepreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We then assess the likelihood that ourdeferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not berealized. In making such a determination, we consider all material available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and resultsof recent operations. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Net deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015 totaled $54.2 million and $68.7million, representing 3.0% and 3.6% of total assets, respectively.    To the extent we believe that recovery of a deferred taxasset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we record additional income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Valuation allowances were$6.6 million as of January 31, 2016 and $0.1 million as of January 31, 2015, respectively. Valuation allowances are based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in certain foreign and state jurisdictions. In thefuture, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in theConsolidated Statements of Income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate.   We record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more-likely-than-notthat the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical       30     merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percentlikely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.    Our tax liability for uncertain tax positionscontains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable,actual results may differ, and we may be exposed to income tax expenses or benefits that could be material.    We considercertain earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future United States cash generation will be sufficient to meet future United States cash needs and our specific plans forreinvestment of those subsidiaries earnings. Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outsidethe United States.    Accounting for Contingencies   From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We are required to record areserve for estimated losses when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can bereasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual disputes or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known,our reserves for loss contingencies could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds our reserve could have amaterial adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. We believe that our reserves adequately reflect the anticipated final outcome of any matter currently pending against us and the ultimatesettlement of such matters will not materially affect our financial position or results of operations.    Share-BasedCompensation    Accounting for share-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all share-based awardsat fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures.    Weuse a lattice binomial pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights. This model uses assumptions including the risk-free rate of interest, expected volatility of our stock price and expected life ofthe awards. A Monte Carlo simulation, which utilizes similar assumptions, is used to determine the fair value of performance-based awards. We review our assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third-party valuation advisors in orderto determine the fair value of share-based compensation awards at the date of grant. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these share-based payment awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherentuncertainties and the application of judgment. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.       31     Additionally, we make certain estimates about the number of awards which will become vestedunder performance-based incentive plans. We record expense for performance-based awards based on our current expectations of the probable number of awards that will ultimately vest. The estimation of awards that will ultimately vest requiresjudgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised and could be materially different from share-basedcompensation expense recorded in prior periods.    We also estimate the expected forfeiture rate. We consider many factors whenestimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards and historical experience. We revise our forfeiture rates, when necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those originally estimated. As a result, if the actualforfeiture rate is different from the estimate at the completion of the vesting period, the share-based compensation expense may not be comparable to amounts recorded in prior periods.    Results of Operations    As a Percentage of Net Sales   The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement dataand the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows:                              Fiscal Year Ended January 31,             2016        2015        2014        Net sales         100.0  %         100.0  %         100.0  %      Cost of sales         65.1            64.6            62.4                                                            Gross profit         34.9            35.4            37.6         Selling, general and administrative expenses         24.6            24.4            23.8                                                            Income from operations         10.3            11.0            13.8         Interest income                       0.1            0.1         Other expenses         (0.1  )         (0.2  )                                                                       Income before income taxes         10.2            10.9            13.9         Income tax expense         3.7            3.9            4.7                                                            Net income         6.5  %         7.0  %         9.2  %                                                         Period over Period Change:                        Net sales         3.7  %         7.7  %         10.4  %      Gross profit         2.3  %         1.2  %         12.6  %      Income from operations         -3.2  %         -14.4  %         14.0  %      Net income         -3.4  %         -17.7  %         19.0  %     Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015    Net sales in fiscal 2016 increased by 3.7% to $3.4 billion, from $3.3 billion in fiscal 2015. The $122.1 million increase was attributable to a $87.7 million, or 2.8%, increase in Retail segment net      32     sales and a $34.4 million, or 15.2%, increase in Wholesale segment net sales. Retail segment net sales for fiscal 2016 accounted for 92.4% of total net sales compared to 93.2% of total net salesduring fiscal 2015.    The growth in our Retail segment net sales during fiscal 2016 was due to an increase of $47.4 million, or1.6%, in Retail segment comparable net sales, which includes our direct-to-consumer channel, and an increase of $40.3 million in non-comparable and new store net sales. Our total company comparable Retail segment net sales increase was comprised ofincreases of 9.0%, 1.4% and 0.4% at Free People, Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie Group, respectively. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by continued growth in the direct-to-consumer channel which was partially offsetby negative comparable store net sales. Direct-to-consumer net sales were driven by an increase in sessions, orders, average order value and conversion rate. The negative comparable store net sales resulted from a reduction in store traffic,transactions and units per transaction, which were partially offset by an increase in average unit selling price. The increase in net sales attributable to non-comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 69 new stores in fiscal2016 and 2015 that were not in operation for the full comparable periods. Thus far during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, comparable Retail segment net sales are low single-digit positive which includes the benefit of a leap year.   The increase in Wholesale segment net sales during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was due to increased sales at both departmentstores and specialty accounts. Wholesale sales growth was driven by an increase in units that was partially offset by a decrease in average unit selling price.    Gross profit percentage in fiscal 2016 decreased to 34.9% of net sales, from 35.4% of net sales in fiscal 2015. Gross profit increased to $1.20 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $1.17 billion in fiscal2015. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was primarily driven by higher delivery and fulfillment center expenses largely related to incremental costs associated with the Gap, Pennsylvania fulfillment center transition and increaseddirect-to-consumer sales penetration. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was additionally driven by impairment charges for five retail stores. Total inventory at January 31, 2016 decreased by $28.0 million, or 7.8%, to $330.2 millionfrom $358.2 million at January 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily related to the decline in comparable Retail segment inventories, which decreased 6% at cost and 8% in units.   Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased during fiscal 2016 to 24.6% of net sales, compared to24.4% of net sales for fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased marketing expenses to support our customer acquisition and retention efforts and an increase in technology related expenses used to support our omni-channel initiatives.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $38.8 million, or 4.8%, to $848.3 million, in fiscal 2016, from $809.5 million in fiscal 2015. The dollar increase versus the prior year was primarily related to increased marketing andtechnology expenses and the operating expenses of new stores.    Income from operations decreased to 10.3% of net sales, or$353.6 million, for fiscal 2016 compared to 11.0%, or $365.4 million, for fiscal 2015.    Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016was 35.9% of income before income taxes compared to 36.0% of income before income taxes in fiscal 2015. See Note 8, Income Taxes, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federalincome tax rate to our effective tax rate.       33     Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014   Net sales in fiscal 2015 increased by 7.7% to $3.3 billion, from $3.1 billion in fiscal 2014. The $236.5 million increase was attributableto a $188.3 million, or 6.5%, increase in Retail segment net sales and a $48.2 million, or 27.1%, increase in Wholesale segment net sales. Retail segment net sales for fiscal 2015 accounted for 93.2% of total net sales compared to 94.2% of total netsales during fiscal 2014.    The growth in Retail segment net sales during fiscal 2015 was driven by an increase of $144.7million in non-comparable and new store net sales and an increase of $43.6 million, or 1.6%, in Retail segment comparable net sales, which includes our direct-to-consumer channel. Our total company comparable Retail segment net sales increase wascomprised of increases of 19.2% and 5.8% at Free People and the Anthropologie Group, respectively, and was partially offset by a decrease of 5.6% at Urban Outfitters. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by continued growthin the direct-to-consumer channel for all brands partially offset by negative comparable store net sales. Direct-to-consumer net sales were driven by an increase in sessions, orders, average order value and conversion rate. The negative comparablestore net sales resulted from a reduction in transactions and units per transaction, which were partially offset by an increase in average unit selling price. The increase in net sales attributable to non-comparable and new stores was primarily theresult of opening 76 new stores in fiscal 2015 and 2014 that were not in operation for the full comparable periods.    Theincrease in Wholesale segment net sales during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was due to increased sales at both department stores and specialty accounts. Wholesale sales growth was driven by an increase in units that was partially offsetby a decrease in average unit selling price.    Gross profit percentage in fiscal 2015 decreased to 35.4% of net sales, from37.6% of net sales in fiscal 2014. Gross profit increased to $1.17 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $1.16 billion in fiscal 2014. The decrease in gross profit percentage occurred primarily due to lower initial merchandise markups, store occupancydeleverage due to negative store comparable net sales and higher markdowns, which were primarily driven by the underperformance at the Urban Outfitters brand. Total inventories at January 31, 2015 increased by $47.0 million, or 15.1%, to $358.2million from $311.2 million at January 31, 2014. This increase was primarily related to the acquisition of inventories to stock new and non-comparable stores and comparable Retail segment inventories. Comparable Retail segment inventories as ofJanuary 31, 2015 increased 6.5% at cost while decreasing 7.2% in units.    Selling, general and administrative expenses asa percentage of net sales increased during fiscal 2015 to 24.4% of net sales, compared to 23.8% of net sales for fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily due to increased marketing and technology expenses that were used to drive higherdirect-to-consumer traffic. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $75.0 million, or 10.2%, to $809.5 million, in fiscal 2015, from $734.5 million in fiscal 2014. The dollar increase versus the prior year was primarily related toincreased marketing and technology expenses and the operating expenses of new stores.    Income from operations decreased to11.0% of net sales, or $365.4 million, for fiscal 2015 compared to 13.8%, or $426.8 million, for fiscal 2014.    Our effectivetax rate for fiscal 2015 was 36.0% of income before income taxes compared to 34.0% of income before taxes in fiscal 2014. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to       34     the recognition of a one-time federal rehabilitation credit in fiscal 2014 related to the expansion of the Companys home office and the release of foreign valuation allowances. See Note 8,Income Taxes, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    Cash, cash equivalents and marketablesecurities were $362.9 million as of January 31, 2016, as compared to $363.3 million as of January 31, 2015 and $890.3 million as of January 31, 2014. We generated $413.4 million in cash from operations, received $46.4 million inproceeds from stock option exercises and borrowed $150.0 million on our long-term debt facility to repurchase $465.3 million in common shares under the share repurchase programs and to invest $135.0 million in property and equipment. Our workingcapital was $505.1 million at January 31, 2016 compared to $455.4 million at January 31, 2015 and $663.2 million at January 31, 2014. The increase in working capital as compared to January 31, 2015 was primarily due to the netincrease in cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities.    During the last three years, we have satisfied our cashrequirements primarily through our cash flow from operating activities. In fiscal 2016 we utilized borrowings on our long-term debt facility as an additional source of cash that were used for the repurchase of our common shares. Our primary uses ofcash have been to repurchase common shares, open new stores, purchase inventory and expand our home offices and fulfillment facilities. We have also continued to invest in our omni-channel capabilities, technology and our international operations.Cash paid for property and equipment for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $135.0 million, $229.8 million and $186.1 million, respectively, and was used primarily to expand our store base and home offices and increase our fulfillment capabilities.   Cash Flows from Operating Activities    Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2016 increased by $91.1 million to $413.4 million from $322.3 million in fiscal 2015. For both periods, our major source of cash from operations wasmerchandise sales and our primary use of cash was for the payment of operational costs. This increase in cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to lower inventory levels in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.   Cash Flows from Investing Activities    Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2016 was $26.8 million, primarily related to purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment, partially offset by the sales and maturities ofmarketable securities.    Cash Flows from Financing Activities   Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2016 was $272.8 million, primarily related to the repurchase of our common shares underthe Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs, partially offset by net borrowings under our long-term debt facility.       35     Credit Facilities   On July 1, 2015, we entered into a five-year asset-based revolving Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with certainlenders, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as joint lead arrangers and co-book managers. The Credit Agreement replaced our unsecured $175.0million revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, which was set to expire in March 2019.    TheCredit Agreement provides senior secured revolving credit for loans and letters of credit up to $400.0 million (the Credit Facility), subject to a borrowing base that is comprised of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory. TheCredit Facility includes a swing-line sub-facility, a multicurrency sub-facility and the option to expand the facility by up to $150.0 million. The funds available under the Credit Facility may be used for working capital and other general corporatepurposes.    The Credit Facility provides for interest on borrowings, at our option, at either (i) adjusted LIBOR, CDOR orEURIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.125% to 1.625%, or (ii) an adjusted ABR plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.125% to 0.625%, each such rate depending on the level of availability under the Credit Facility and our adjustedleverage ratio. Interest is payable either monthly or quarterly depending on the type of borrowing. A commitment fee is payable quarterly, on the unused portion of the Credit Facility, based on our adjusted leverage ratio.   All obligations under the Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by us and our domestic subsidiaries. The obligations under theCredit Facility are secured by a first-priority security interest in inventory, accounts receivable, and certain other assets of the borrowers and guarantors. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, negative andaffirmative covenants and provisions relating to events of default.    As of January 31, 2016, we were in compliance withall terms of the Credit Agreement, borrowings on the Credit Facility totaled $150.0 million and stand-by letters of credit outstanding were $13.8 million.    Additionally, we have borrowing agreements with two separate financial institutions under which we may borrow an aggregate of $130.0 million for the purposes of trade letter of credit issuances. Theavailability of any future borrowings under the trade letter of credit facilities is subject to acceptance by the respective financial institutions. As of January 31, 2016, we had outstanding trade letters of credit of $65.0 million, andavailable trade letters of credit of $65.0 million under these facilities.    Capital and Operating Expenditures   During fiscal 2017, we plan to construct and open approximately 27 new stores, expand certain existing stores, upgrade oursystems, increase our investments in omni-channel marketing and purchase inventories for our Retail and Wholesale segments at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We believe that our marketing, social media, merchandiseexpansion, website and mobile initiatives are a significant contributor to our Retail segment sales growth. During fiscal 2017, we plan to continue our investment in these initiatives for all brands. We anticipate our capital expenditures duringfiscal 2017 to be approximately $160 million, all of which are expected to be       36     financed by cash flow from operating activities. We believe that our new store investments have the potential to generate positive cash flow within a year. We may also enter into one or moreacquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of our brand offerings. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, available credit facilities and future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund these initiatives.   Share Repurchases    On February 23, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 20.0 million common shares under a share repurchase program. Under this authorization, during fiscal 2016, werepurchased and subsequently retired 12.7 million common shares at a total cost of $382.5 million for an average cost per share of $30.16, including commissions.    On May 27, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 10.0 million common shares under a share repurchase program. Under this authorization, the Company repurchased andsubsequently retired 7.7 million common shares at a total cost of $258.2 million during fiscal 2015. The average cost per share of these repurchases for fiscal 2015 was $33.45, including commissions. During fiscal 2016, we repurchased andsubsequently retired 2.3 million shares at a total cost of $82.8 million at an average cost per share of $36.30, including commissions, which completed this authorization.   On August 27, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 10.0 million common shares under a share repurchaseprogram. We repurchased and subsequently retired all of the remaining 9.7 million outstanding common shares available under this authorization during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 at a total cost of $353.3 million for an average cost pershare of $36.43, including commissions.    Contractual Obligations   The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 31, 2016:                                               Payments Due by Period (in thousands)        Description      Total Obligations         LessThan One Year         One to Three Years         Threeto Five Years         More Than Five Years        Operating leases (1)      $  1,982,176          $  272,255          $  509,919          $  427,776          $  772,226         Purchase orders (2)         407,833             407,833                                                      Construction contracts (3)         1,535             1,535                                                      Tax contingencies (4)         436             436                                                                                                                                             Total contractual obligations      $  2,391,980          $  682,059          $  509,919          $  427,776          $  772,226                                                                                                    (1)    Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown aboveonly reflect our future minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are 26 locations where a percentage of sales are paid, in lieu of a fixed minimum rent, that are not reflected inthe above table. Total rent expense related to these 26 locations was approximately $3,498 for fiscal 2016. It is common for the lease agreements for our European locations to allow      37            for the landlord to adjust the minimum rental due to the current market rates multiple times during the lease term. The table above includes our current contractual payments for these locations.Amounts noted above include commitments for 37 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2016.     (2)  Our merchandise commitments are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until the merchandise shipping date.     (3)  Includes construction contracts with contractors that are fully satisfied upon the completion of construction, which is typically within twelve months.    (4)  Tax contingencies include $436 that is classified as a current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2016. Taxcontingencies in the table above do not show an existing liability of $8,234 because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled. As a result, the $8,234 liability was classified as a non-currentliability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2016.    Commercial Commitments   The following table summarizes our commercial commitments as of January 31, 2016:                                               Amount of Commitment PerPeriod (in thousands)        Description      Total Amounts Committed         Less Than One Year         One to Three Years         Three to Five Years         More Than Five Years        Trade letters of credit (1)      $  65,047          $  65,047          $              $              $             Standby letters of credit (2)         13,782             13,782                                                                                                                                             Total commercial commitments      $  78,829          $  78,829          $              $              $                                                                                                        (1)  Consists primarily of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with import inventory purchases.     (2)  Consists primarily of standby letters of credit for customs, construction and insurance.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    As of and for the three fiscal years endedJanuary 31, 2016, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financialcondition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.    Other Matters   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Reporton Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.    Seasonality and Quarterly Results   Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations in net sales and operating income, with a more significant portion typically realized inthe fourth quarter of each year reflecting the year-end holiday       38     period. Historically, and consistent with the retail industry, the seasonality also impacts our working capital requirements, particularly with regard to inventory. The following tables set forthour net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales andannual net income. The unaudited financial information has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 ofRegulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.                                 Fiscal 2016 Quarter Ended (1)          April 30, 2015        July 31, 2015        Oct. 31, 2015        Jan. 31, 2016          (dollars in thousands, except per share data)        Net sales      $  739,010         $  867,460         $  825,258         $  1,013,406         Gross profit         246,421            318,105            288,188            349,188         Net income         32,776            66,841            51,994            72,878         Net income per common sharebasic         0.25            0.52            0.42            0.61         Net income per common sharediluted         0.25            0.52            0.42            0.61               As a Percentage of Fiscal Year:                              Net sales         22  %         25  %         24  %         29  %      Net income         15  %         30  %         23  %         32  %                                   Fiscal 2015 Quarter Ended (1)             April 30, 2014        July 31, 2014        Oct. 31, 2014        Jan. 31, 2015             (dollars in thousands, except per share data)        Net sales      $  686,310         $  811,253         $  814,470         $  1,011,044         Gross profit         238,511            303,258            283,524            349,637         Net income         37,478            67,509            47,143            80,298         Net income per common sharebasic         0.26            0.49            0.35            0.61         Net income per common sharediluted         0.26            0.49            0.35            0.60               As a Percentage of Fiscal Year:                              Net sales         21  %         24  %         25  %         30  %      Net income         16  %         29  %         20  %         35  %          (1)  The sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal per share amounts reported for year-to-date periods due to changes in the number of weighted-average sharesoutstanding and the effects of rounding for each period.    Item 7A. Quantitative andQualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    We are exposed to the following types of market risksfluctuations in thepurchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services, the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar, and changes in interest rates. Due to our inventory turnover rate and our historical ability to pass through theimpact of any generalized changes in our cost of goods to our customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. We purchase the majority of our merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a majorityof the goods for our stores located in Canada and a portion of the goods for our stores located in Europe.       39     Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currencies is due to our financialstatements being presented in U.S. dollars and our international subsidiaries transacting in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates in effect during or at the end of the reporting period may affect the value of thereported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. As we expand our international operations, the potential impact of currency fluctuations increases.    Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the Credit Facility. As of January 31, 2016 and 2015, our cash, cashequivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of cash on hand and in banks, money market accounts, municipal and pre-refunded municipal bonds rated BBB or better, corporate bonds rated BBB or better, certificatesof deposit, and mutual funds. Due to the short average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, we believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Asthe interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cashflows, but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments.    We are exposed to market risksrelating to changes in interest rates on outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility because these borrowings bear interest at variable rates. A 100 basis point change in our applicable interest rate would not have a material impact to interestexpense for the year ended January 31, 2016.    Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
