Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations    Overview    We are an omni-channel retailer and operate two reportable segments: a leading lifestyle specialty Retail segment and a Wholesale segment. Our Retail segment consists of our Urban Outfitters,Anthropologie Group, Free People, and Terrain brands, whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through retail stores, websites, mobile applications, catalogs and customer contact centers. Our Wholesale segment consists of the Free Peoplewholesale division that primarily designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel.    Our fiscalyear ends on January 31. All references to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal year 2015 ended on January 31, 2015.   Our omni-channel strategy enhances our customers brand experience by providing a seamless approach to the customer shoppingexperience. We have substantially integrated all available shopping channels, including stores, websites (online and through mobile devices) and catalogs. Our investments in areas such as marketing campaigns and technology advancements are designedto generate demand for the omni-channel and not the separate store or direct-to-consumer channels. Store sales are primarily fulfilled from that stores inventory, but may also be shipped from any of our fulfillment centers or from a differentstore location if an item is not available at the original store. Direct-to-consumer orders are primarily shipped to our customers through our fulfillment centers, but may also be shipped from any store, or a combination of fulfillment centers andstores depending on the availability of a particular item. Direct-to-consumer orders may also be picked up at a store location. As our customers continue to shop across multiple channels, we have adapted our approach towards meeting this demand. Dueto the availability of like product in a variety of shopping channels, we now source these products utilizing single stock keeping units based on the omni-channel demand rather than the demand of the separate channels. These and other technologicalcapabilities allow us to better serve our customers and help us complete sales that otherwise may not have occurred due to out-of-stock positions. As a result of changing customer behavior and the substantial integration of the operations of ourstore and direct-to-consumer channels, we manage and analyze our performance based on a single omni-channel rather than separate channels and believe that the omni-channel results present the most meaningful and appropriate measure of ourperformance.    Our comparable Retail segment net sales data is equal to the sum of our comparable store and comparabledirect-to-consumer channel net sales. A store is considered to be comparable if it has been open at least one full fiscal year, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacitywithin that year. A direct-to-consumer channel is considered to be comparable if it has been operational for at least one full fiscal year. There is no overlap between comparable store net sales and comparable direct-to-consumer net sales. Salesfrom stores and direct-to-consumer channels that do not fall within the definition of comparable store or channel are considered to be non-comparable. The effects of foreign currency translation are also considered non-comparable.   Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates within our stores, we believethat, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume in our stores, as discussed in our results of operations, may correlate to changes in customer traffic. We are able to monitor customer visits, average order value and conversionrate on       24     our websites. We believe that changes in any of these metrics may be caused by a response to our brands fashion offerings, our marketing campaigns, circulation of our catalogs and anoverall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base.    Retail Segment   As of January 31, 2015, we operated 238 Urban Outfitters stores of which 179 were located in the United States, 16 were locatedin Canada and 43 were located in Europe. During fiscal 2015, we opened 11 new Urban Outfitters stores, of which six were located in the United States, two were located in Canada and three were located in Europe. During fiscal 2015, Urban Outfittersclosed three stores in the United States due to lease expiration. Urban Outfitters operates websites in North America and Europe that capture the spirit of the brand by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in ourstores. Urban Outfitters offers a catalog in Europe offering select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 28 through a unique merchandise mix and compellingstore environment and website. Urban Outfitters product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, intimates, footwear, beauty, accessories, activewear and gear, electronics, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment waresand gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years. Urban Outfitters North American and European Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 32.9% and 8.8% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal2015, compared to 36.3% and 8.1%, respectively, for fiscal 2014.    The Anthropologie Group consists of the Anthropologie andBhldn brands. We initially operated the Bhldn brand as a standalone concept and opened two Bhldn stores. We determined that the Bhldn brand was complementary to the Anthropologie brand and during fiscal 2015 integrated the Bhldn and Anthropologiebrands to form the Anthropologie Group. As of January 31, 2015, we operated 204 Anthropologie Group stores, of which 185 were located in the United States, 12 were located in Canada and seven were located in Europe. During fiscal 2015, weopened 15 new Anthropologie Group stores, of which nine were located in the United States, three were located in Canada and three were located in Europe. The Anthropologie Group operates websites in North America and Europe that capture the spiritof the brands by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in our stores. Anthropologie offers registry services through our website and mobile applications and in all of our stores throughout the United States. Registryservices allow our customers to create gift registries for any occasion and customers can select from any of the products offered by the brand. The Anthropologie brand offers a catalog in North America and in Europe that markets select merchandise,most of which is also available in our Anthropologie stores. Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 28 to 45. Anthropologies product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories,intimates, shoes, beauty, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. Bhldn offers a curated collection of heirloom quality wedding gowns, bridesmaid frocks, party dresses, assorted jewelry, headpieces, footwear, lingerie anddecorations. We plan to open additional Anthropologie stores over the next several years, some of which will include Bhldn shop-within-shop locations. The Anthropologie Groups North American and European Retail segment net sales accounted forapproximately 40.1% and 1.5% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2015, compared to 40.3% and 1.2%, respectively, for fiscal 2014.    As of January 31, 2015, we operated 102 Free People stores, of which 98 were located in the United States and four were located in Canada. During fiscal 2015, we opened 12 new Free People stores, ofwhich 10 were located in the United States and two were located in Canada. Free People       25     operates websites in North America, Europe and Asia that capture the spirit of the brand by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in our stores, as well as all ofthe Free People wholesale offerings. Free People also offers a catalog that markets select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Free People stores. Free People primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to youngcontemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, intimates, shoes, activewear, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may beoutside the United States. Free Peoples Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 9.2% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2015, compared to approximately 7.7% for fiscal 2014.   As of January 31, 2015, we operated two Terrain garden centers and a website that offers customers a portion of the productassortment found at the Terrain garden centers. Terrain is designed to appeal to women and men interested in a creative, sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Terrain creates a compelling shopping environment through its large andfreestanding sites. Terrains product offering includes home furnishings and decorative items, garden products including live plants and flowers, outdoor living furnishings and entertainment products and a wide variety of gifts. Both Terrainlocations offer a full-service restaurant and coffee bar. Terrain also offers a variety of landscape and design services. Terrains Retail segment net sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2015 and 2014,respectively.    For all brands combined, we plan to open approximately 30 to 35 new stores during fiscal 2016, including 4Urban Outfitters stores, 13 Anthropologie Group stores and 15 Free People stores.    Wholesale Segment   The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Free Peoples rangeof tops, bottoms, sweaters, dresses, intimate apparel and shoes are sold through approximately 1,600 better department and specialty stores worldwide, including in North America, Europe and Asia, and our own Free People stores. Free PeoplesWholesale segment net sales accounted for approximately 6.8% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2015, compared to 5.8% for fiscal 2014.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require managementto make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during thereporting period.    Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee.Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accountingpolicies, which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and cash flows and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about theeffect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances thatwould cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates.       26     Revenue Recognition   Revenue is recognized by the Retail segment at the point-of-sale for merchandise the customer takes possession of at the retail store orwhen merchandise is shipped to the customer, in each case, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized by the Wholesale segment when merchandise is shipped to the customer, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is presented on anet basis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental or municipal authority. Payment for merchandise in our Retail segment is tendered by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, our need to collect outstandingaccounts receivable for our Retail segment is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for the Wholesale segment accounts receivable, which managementreviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments.    We accountfor a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. A liability is established and remains on our books until the card is redeemed by the customer,at which time we record the redemption of the card for merchandise as a sale, or when we determine the likelihood of redemption is remote. We determine the probability of the gift cards being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemptionpatterns. Revenues attributable to the reduction of gift card liabilities for which the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and are not material. Our gift cards do not expire.   Sales Return Reserve    We record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported. The reserve for estimatedproduct returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate or experience is materially different than our estimate, sales returns would be adjusted in the future. As of January 31, 2015 and 2014, reservesfor estimated sales returns totaled $19.8 million and $17.1 million, representing 3.5% and 3.2% of total liabilities, respectively.    Marketable Securities    All of our marketable securities as ofJanuary 31, 2015 and January 31, 2014 are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost. Interest on these securities, as well as the amortization of discounts and premiums, is includedin Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities (other than mutual funds, held in the rabbi trust for the Urban Outfitters, Inc. Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (SeeNote 3, Marketable Securities, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements)) are considered temporary and therefore are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of Other comprehensive income in theConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity until realized. Mutual funds held in the rabbi trust have been accounted for under the fair value option, which results in allunrealized gains and losses being recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Other than temporary impairment losses related to credit losses are considered to be realized losses. When available-for-salesecurities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically identified and is used to determine the realized gain or loss. Securities classified as current assets have maturity dates of less than one year from the balance sheet date.       27     Inventories    We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method and includes the costof merchandise and import related costs, including freight, import taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related tocurrent inventories such as future expected consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value.Criteria that we utilize to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle and the value and natureof merchandise currently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values, if appropriate. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have beenapplied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our reserves and related inventories to increase over time as we increase our sales. The majority of inventory at January 31, 2015, and 2014 consisted of finished goods. Raw materials andwork-in-process were not material to the overall net inventory value. Net inventories as of January 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $358.2 million and $311.2 million, representing 19.0% and 14.0% of total assets, respectively. Any significantunanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results.    Long-Lived Assets    Our long-lived assets consist principally of storeleasehold improvements, buildings and furniture and fixtures, and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using thestraight-line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term, including lease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years.Buildings are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over 39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Netproperty and equipment as of January 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $889.2 million and $806.9 million, representing 47.1% and 36.3% of total assets, respectively.    In assessing potential impairment of these assets, we make estimates regarding forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store-by-store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positiveoperating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free-standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data andcurrent fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be within three years from the date a store location has opened. We recordimpairment losses when events indicate that an asset may be impaired and the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets. For fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, impairment losses were not material.   We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long-lived assets. The cost of assets sold orretired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is       28     removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renovations or improvements that extend theservice lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less.   Accounting for Income Taxes    As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involvesestimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation ofinventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxableincome. We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals ofexisting taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Netdeferred tax assets as of January 31, 2015 and January 31, 2014 totaled $68.7 million and $66.8 million representing, 3.6% and 3.0% of total assets, respectively.   To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuationallowances or increase the allowances in a period, we record additional income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Valuation allowances were $0.1 million as of January 31, 2015 and January 31, 2014, respectively.Valuation allowances are based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in certain foreign and state jurisdictions. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in thesejurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we willrealize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate.    We record uncertain tax positions onthe basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet themore-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.   Our tax liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment toestimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ, and we may be exposed to expenses or benefits that could bematerial.    We consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States onthe basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings.       29     Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outsidethe United States.    Accounting for Contingencies   From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We are required to record anestimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonablyestimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual disputes or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, ouraccrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our financialstatements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known.    Share-Based Compensation    Accounting for share-based compensation requiresmeasurement of compensation cost for all share-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures.   We use a lattice binomial pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights. This model usesassumptions including the risk free rate of interest, expected volatility of our stock price and expected life of the awards. A Monte Carlo simulation, which utilizes similar assumptions, is used to determine the fair value of performance-basedawards. We review our assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third-party valuation advisors in order to determine the fair value of share-based compensation awards at the date of grant. The assumptions used in calculating the fairvalue of these share-based payment awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.   Additionally, we make certain estimates about the number of awards which will become vested under performance-based incentive plans. Werecord expense for performance-based awards based on our current expectations of the probable number of shares that will ultimately vest. The estimation of share-based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actualresults or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised and could be materially different from share-based compensation expense recorded in priorperiods.    We also estimate the expected forfeiture rate. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures,including types of awards and historical experience. We revise our forfeiture rates, when necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those originally estimated. As a result, if the actual forfeiture rate is different from theestimate at the completion of the vesting period, the share-based compensation expense may not be comparable to amounts recorded in prior periods.       30     Results of Operations    As a Percentage of Net Sales    The following table sets forth, for theperiods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows:                             Fiscal Year Ended January 31,             2015        2014        2013        Net sales         100.0  %         100.0  %         100.0  %      Cost of sales         64.6            62.4            63.1                                                            Gross profit         35.4            37.6            36.9         Selling, general and administrative expenses         24.4            23.8            23.5                                                            Income from operations         11.0            13.8            13.4         Interest income         0.1            0.1            0.1         Other income                                                Other expenses         (0.2  )                       (0.1  )                                                         Income before income taxes         10.9            13.9            13.4         Income tax expense         3.9            4.7            4.9                                                            Net income         7.0  %         9.2  %         8.5  %                                                         Period over Period Change:                        Net sales         7.7  %         10.4  %         13.0  %      Gross profit         1.2  %         12.6  %         19.9  %      Income from operations         -14.4  %         14.0  %         31.5  %      Net income         -17.7  %         19.0  %         28.1  %     Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014    Net sales in fiscal 2015 increased by 7.7% to $3.3 billion, from $3.1 billion in fiscal 2014. The $236.5 million increase was attributable to a $188.3 million, or 6.5%, increase in Retail segment netsales and a $48.2 million, or 27.1%, increase in Wholesale segment net sales. Retail segment net sales for fiscal 2015 accounted for 93.2% of total net sales compared to 94.2% of total net sales during fiscal 2014.   The growth in Retail segment net sales during fiscal 2015 was driven by an increase of $144.7 million in non-comparable and new store netsales and an increase of $43.6 million, or 1.6%, in Retail segment comparable net sales, which includes our direct-to-consumer channel. Our total company comparable Retail segment net sales increase was comprised of increases of 19.2% and 5.8% atFree People and the Anthropologie Group, respectively, and was partially offset by a decrease of 5.6% at Urban Outfitters. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by continued growth in the direct-to-consumer channel for allbrands partially offset by negative comparable store net sales. Direct-to-consumer net sales were driven by an increase in sessions, orders, average order value and conversion rate. The negative comparable store net sales resulted from a reductionin transactions and units per transaction, which were partially offset by an increase in average unit selling price. The increase in net sales attributable to non-comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening      31     76 new stores in fiscal 2015 and 2014 that were not in operation for the full comparable periods. Thus far during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, comparable Retail segment net sales are midsingle-digit positive.    The increase in Wholesale segment net sales during fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, was due toincreased sales at both department stores and specialty accounts. Wholesale sales growth was driven by an increase in units that was partially offset by a decrease in average unit selling price.   Gross profit rate in fiscal 2015 decreased to 35.4% of net sales, from 37.6% of net sales in fiscal 2014. Gross profit increased to $1.17billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $1.16 billion in fiscal 2014. The deleverage occurred primarily due to lower initial merchandise markups, store occupancy deleverage due to negative store comparable net sales and higher markdowns, which wereprimarily driven by the underperformance at the Urban Outfitters brand. Total inventories at January 31, 2015 increased by $47.0 million, or 15.1%, to $358.2 million from $311.2 million at January 31, 2014. This increase was primarilyrelated to the acquisition of inventories to stock new and non-comparable stores and comparable Retail segment inventories. Comparable Retail segment inventories as of January 31, 2015 increased 6.5% at cost while decreasing 7.2% in units.   Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased during fiscal 2015 to 24.4% of net sales,compared to 23.8% of net sales for fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily due to increased marketing and technology expenses that were used to drive higher direct-to-consumer traffic. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $75.0million, or 10.2%, to $809.5 million, in fiscal 2015, from $734.5 million in fiscal 2014. The dollar increase versus the prior year was primarily related to increased marketing and technology expenses and the operating expenses of new stores.   Income from operations decreased to 11.0% of net sales, or $365.4 million, for fiscal 2015 compared to 13.8%, or $426.8million, for fiscal 2014.    Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 36.0% of income before income taxes compared to 34.0% ofincome before taxes in fiscal 2014. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the recognition of a one-time federal rehabilitation credit in fiscal 2014 related to the expansion of the Companys home office and the release offoreign valuation allowances. See Note 8, Income Taxes, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate.   Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013    Net sales in fiscal 2014 increased by 10.4% to $3.1 billion, from $2.8 billion in fiscal 2013. The $291.7 million increase was attributable to a $262.7 million, or 9.9%, increase in Retail segment netsales and a $29.0 million, or 19.5%, increase in Wholesale segment net sales.    The growth in Retail segment net sales duringfiscal 2014 was driven by increases of $144.2 million, or 6.0%, in Retail segment comparable net sales, which includes our direct-to-consumer channel, and $118.5 million in non-comparable and new store net sales. Our total company comparable Retailsegment net sales increase was comprised of increases of 31.7% and 10.1% at Free People and Anthropologie, respectively, and was partially offset by a decrease of 0.6% at Urban Outfitters. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales wasdriven by continued growth in the       32     direct-to-consumer channel for all brands and positive comparable store net sales at Anthropologie and Free People. Direct-to-consumer net sales were driven by an increase in website and mobileapplication traffic, a higher average order value and an improved conversion rate. The positive comparable store net sales resulted from increases in units per transaction and transactions, which were partially offset by a decrease in average unitselling price. The increase in net sales attributable to non-comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 87 new stores in fiscal 2014 and 2013 that were not in operation for the full comparable periods.   The increase in Wholesale segment net sales in fiscal 2014 was due to higher sales to both specialty and department stores driven byincreases in transactions.    Gross profit rates in fiscal 2014 increased to 37.6% of net sales, or $1.16 billion, from 36.9% ofnet sales, or $1.03 billion, in fiscal 2013. The increase in the gross profit rate was primarily due to improved merchandise margin largely due to significant improvement in the Anthropologie brand markdown rate. This improvement was partiallyoffset by increased markdowns at the Urban Outfitters brand in North America. The increased penetration of the direct-to-consumer channel continued to drive store occupancy leverage and delivery expense deleverage. Total inventories atJanuary 31, 2014 increased by $28.8 million, or 10.2%, to $311.2 million from $282.4 million at January 31, 2013. This increase was primarily related to the acquisition of inventories to stock new and non-comparable stores. ComparableRetail segment inventories as of January 31, 2014 grew 2.5%.    Selling, general and administrative expenses as apercentage of net sales increased during fiscal 2014 to 23.8%, compared to 23.5% for fiscal 2013, primarily due to increases in marketing expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $77.3 million, or 11.8%, to $734.5 millionin fiscal 2014, from $657.2 million in fiscal 2013. The dollar increase over the prior year was primarily related to the operating expenses of new stores and increased marketing expenses to support our customer acquisition and retention programs.   Income from operations increased to 13.8% of net sales, or $426.8 million, for fiscal 2014 compared to 13.4% of net sales, or$374.3 million, for fiscal 2013.    Our annual effective income tax rate for fiscal 2014 decreased to 34.0% of income beforeincome taxes compared to 36.8% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2013. The decrease in the fiscal 2014 effective tax rate is due to a higher percentage of foreign taxable income in fiscal 2014, which carries a lower tax rate, a decrease invaluation allowances for foreign operating loss carryforwards and certain nonrecurring tax adjustments. See Note 8, Income Taxes, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federalincome tax rate to our effective tax rate.    Liquidity and Capital Resources   Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $363.3 million as of January 31, 2015, as compared to $890.3 million as ofJanuary 31, 2014 and $623.4 million as of January 31, 2013. The $527.0 million decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal 2015 was primarily a result of $611.5 million cash used for share repurchases underthe share repurchase program and $229.8 million cash paid for property and equipment, partially offset by $322.3 million from cash provided by operating activities.       33     Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2015 decreased by $100.9 million to$322.3 million from $423.2 million in fiscal 2014. This decrease was primarily due to lower net income and increases in inventories in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. Our working capital was $455.4 million at January 31,2015 compared to $663.2 million at January 31, 2014 and $622.1 million at January 31, 2013. Changes in working capital primarily relate to changes in the volume of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The decrease inworking capital during fiscal 2015 was a result of our common share repurchases.    Cash provided by investing activities duringfiscal 2015 was $194.8 million, primarily related to the sales and maturities of marketable securities and was partially offset by purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment.   Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2015 was $600.9 million, primarily related to the repurchase of our common shares underthe Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs.    During the last three years, we have satisfied our cashrequirements through our cash flow from operating activities. Our primary uses of cash have been to repurchase common shares, open new stores, purchase inventories and expand our home offices and distribution and fulfillment facilities. We have alsocontinued to invest in our omni-channel efforts, technology and our international operations. Cash paid for property and equipment for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $229.8 million, $186.1 and $168.9 million, respectively, and was used primarily toexpand or renovate our store base, home offices and distribution and fulfillment facilities.    During fiscal 2016, we plan toconstruct and open approximately 30 to 35 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, increase our fulfillment capabilities, upgrade our systems, increase our investments in omni-channel marketing and purchase inventories for our Retail andWholesale segments at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We believe that our marketing, social media, merchandise expansion, website and mobile initiatives are a significant contributor to our Retail segment sales growth.During fiscal 2016, we plan to continue our investment in these initiatives for all brands. We anticipate our capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 to be approximately $150 to $160 million, all of which are expected to be financed by cash flowfrom operating activities. We believe that our new store investments have the potential to generate positive cash flow within a year. We believe the expansion of our home offices and distribution and fulfillment facilities are necessary toadequately support our growth. We may also enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of our brand offerings.    On May 27, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 10.0 million common shares under a new share repurchase program. Under this authorization, during fiscal 2015, we repurchasedand subsequently retired 7.7 million shares at a total cost of $258.2 million for an average cost per share of $33.45, including commissions.    On August 27, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 10.0 million common shares under a share repurchase program. We repurchased and subsequently retired all of the remaining9.7 million outstanding shares available under this authorization during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 at a total cost of $353.3 million for an average cost per share of $36.43, including commissions.       34     On February 23, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of20.0 million shares under a new share repurchase program.    On March 27, 2014, we amended and restated our existingline of credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Line). The Line is a five-year $175.0 million revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing for an increase of up to $50.0 million at our discretion.The Line contains a sub-limit for borrowings by our subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us. Under the terms of the Line, at our option, the aggregate principal balance of the amounts advanced or portions thereof will bear interest at (a) thebase rate, or (b) the applicable LIBOR Rate plus a margin that can range from 0.50% to 1.50%. The Line subjects us to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial covenants. As of January 31, 2015, there wereno borrowings under the Line and we were in compliance with all covenants. Outstanding letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $83.5 million as of January 31, 2015. The available credit under the Line was $91.5 million as ofJanuary 31, 2015. We expect the Line to satisfy our credit needs through at least fiscal 2016.

The obligation amounts shown above only reflect ourfuture minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are 28 locations where a percentage of sales are paid, in lieu of a fixed minimum rent, that are not reflected in the above table.Total rent expense related to these 28 locations was approximately $4,263 for fiscal 2015. It is common for the lease agreements for our European locations to adjust the minimum rental due to the current market rate multiple times during the term.The table above includes our current contractual payments for these locations. Amounts noted above include commitments for 22 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2015.     (2)  Our merchandise commitments are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until the merchandise shipping date.     (3)  Includes construction contracts with contractors that are fully liquidated upon the completion of construction, which is typically within 12 months.    (4)  Tax contingencies include $1,357 that is classified as a current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2015. Taxcontingencies in the table above do not show an existing liability of $7,076 because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled. As a result, the $7,076 liability was classified as a non-currentliability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2015.       35     Commercial Commitments                                               Amount of Commitment Per Period (in thousands)        Description      Total Amounts Committed         Less Than One Year         One to Three Years         Three to Five Years         More Than Five Years        Line of credit (1)      $  70,135          $  70,135          $              $              $             Standby letters of credit (2)         13,398             13,398                                                                                                                                             Total commercial commitments      $  83,533          $  83,533          $              $              $                                                                                                        (1)  Consists primarily of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with import inventory purchases.     (2)  Consists primarily of standby letters of credit for customs, construction and insurance.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    As of and for the three fiscal years endedJanuary 31, 2015, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financialcondition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.    Other Matters   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements , in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this AnnualReport on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impacts on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.   Seasonality and Quarterly Results    Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations in net sales and operating income, with a more significant portion typically realized from August 1 to December 31 of each year (the back-to-schooland holiday periods). Historically, and consistent with the retail industry, the seasonality also impacts our working capital requirements, particularly with regard to inventory. The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net incomeand net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The unaudited financialinformation has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management,all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.       36                                Fiscal 2015 Quarter Ended (1)          April 30, 2014        July 31, 2014        Oct. 31, 2014        Jan. 31, 2015          (dollars in thousands, except per share data)        Net sales      $  686,310         $  811,253         $  814,470         $  1,011,044         Gross profit         238,511            303,258            283,524            349,637         Net income         37,478            67,509            47,143            80,298         Net income per common sharebasic         0.26            0.49            0.35            0.61         Net income per common sharediluted         0.26            0.49            0.35            0.60               As a Percentage of Fiscal Year:                              Net sales         21  %         24  %         25  %         30  %      Net income         16  %         29  %         20  %         35  %                                   Fiscal 2014 Quarter Ended (1)             April 30, 2013        July 31, 2013        Oct. 31, 2013        Jan. 31, 2014             (dollars in thousands, except per share data)        Net sales      $  648,177         $  758,524         $  774,049         $  905,858         Gross profit         238,809            298,243            292,285            332,005         Net income         47,058            76,363            70,257            88,682         Net income per common sharebasic         0.32            0.52            0.48            0.60         Net income per common sharediluted         0.32            0.51            0.47            0.59               As a Percentage of Fiscal Year:                              Net sales         21  %         25  %         25  %         29  %      Net income         17  %         27  %         25  %         31  %          (1)  The sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal per share amounts reported for year-to-date periods. This is due to changes in the number of weighted-averageshares outstanding and the effects of rounding for each period.    Item 7A. Quantitativeand Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    We are exposed to the following types of market risksfluctuations inthe purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services, the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar, and changes in interest rates. Due to our inventory turnover rate and our historical ability to pass through theimpact of any generalized changes in our cost of goods to our customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. We purchase the majority of our merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portionof the goods for our stores located in Canada and Europe.    Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currencies isdue to our financial statements being presented in U.S. Dollars but our international subsidiaries transact in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates in effect during or at the end of the reporting period may affect thevalue of the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. As we expand our international operations, the potential impact of currency fluctuations increases.   Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As ofJanuary 31, 2015 and 2014, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable       37     securities consisted primarily of cash on hand and in banks, money market accounts, corporate bonds rated BBB or better, municipal and pre-refunded municipal bonds ratedBBB or better, treasury bills, certificates of deposit, federal government agencies, commercial paper rated BBB or better, which bear interest at variable rates, and mutual funds. Due to the short average maturity andconservative nature of our investment portfolio, we believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cashequivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would not impact the fair market value of therelated underlying instruments.    During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we sold all of our remaining auction rate securities(ARS) for $4,580 in cash. Our ARS had a par value and a recorded fair value of $4,925 and $4,330, respectively, prior to the sale.   Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
