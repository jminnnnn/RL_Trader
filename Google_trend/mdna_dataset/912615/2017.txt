Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditionand Results of Operations    Overview    We operate two reportable segments: a leading lifestyle specialty Retail segment and a Wholesale segment. Our Retail segment consists of our Anthropologie, Bhldn, Free People, Terrain and Urban Outfittersbrands and our Food and Beverage division. Our Retail segment consumer products and services are sold directly to our customers through our stores, websites, mobile applications, catalogs and customer contact centers. Our Wholesale segment consistsof the Free People wholesale division that primarily designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel and shoes sold through specialty and department stores and third-party websites.   Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in thoseyears. For example, our fiscal year 2017 ended on January 31, 2017.    Retail Segment   Our omni-channel strategy enhances our customers brand experience by providing a seamless approach to the customer shoppingexperience. All available shopping channels are fully integrated, including stores, websites, mobile applications, catalogs and customer contact centers. Our investments in areas such as marketing campaigns and technology advancements are designedto generate demand for the omni-channel and not the separate store or  direct-to-consumer  channels. Store sales are primarily fulfilled from that stores inventory,but may also be shipped from any of our fulfillment centers or from a different store location if an item is not available at the original store.  Direct-to-consumer orders are primarily shipped to our customers through our fulfillment centers, but may also be shipped from any store, or a combination of fulfillment centers and stores depending on the availability of particular items.  Direct-to-consumer  orders may also be picked up at a store location. Customers may also return certain merchandise purchased through  direct-to-consumer  channels at store locations. As our customers continue to shop across multiple channels, we have adapted our approach towards meeting this demand. Due to the availability of like product ina variety of shopping channels, we source these products utilizing single SKUs based on the omni-channel demand rather than the demand of the separate channels. These and other technological capabilities allow us to better serve our customers andhelp us complete sales that otherwise may not have occurred due to  out-of-stock  positions. As a result of changing customer behavior and the substantial integration ofthe operations of our store and  direct-to-consumer  channels, we manage and analyze our performance based on a single omni-channel rather than separate channels andbelieve that the omni-channel results present the most meaningful and appropriate measure of our performance. Over the next several years we plan to continue to shift investment to the direct-to-consumer  channel to align with changing customer preferences.    Our comparable Retail segment net sales data is equal to the sum of our comparable store and comparable  direct-to-consumer channel net sales. A store is considered to be comparable if it has been open at least twelve full months, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. A  direct-to-consumer  channel is considered to be comparable if it has been operational for at least twelve full months. There is no overlap between comparable store net salesand comparable  direct-to-consumer  net sales. Sales from stores and  direct-to-consumer channels that do not fall within the definition of comparable store or channel are considered to be  non-comparable.  The effects of foreign currency translation are also considered  non-comparable.        25     We monitor customer traffic, average unit selling price, average transactions per store andaverage units per transaction at our stores, and customer sessions, average order value and conversion rates on our websites and mobile applications. We believe that changes in any of these metrics may be caused by a response to our brandsfashion offerings, our marketing and digital marketing campaigns, circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition.    As of January 31, 2017, we operated 242 Urban Outfitters stores of which 181 were located in the United States, 18 were located in Canada and 43 were located in Europe. During fiscal 2017, we openedfour new Urban Outfitters stores, three located in the United States and one located in Europe, and we closed two Urban Outfitters stores, one located in the United States and one located in Europe. Total store selling square footage increased 1.0%over the prior year period to 2.2 million square feet. Urban Outfitters operates websites and mobile applications in North America and Europe that capture the spirit of the brand by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise asfound in our stores. Urban Outfitters offers a catalog in Europe offering select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 28 through a unique merchandise mix,compelling store environment, websites and mobile applications. Urban Outfitters product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, intimates, footwear, beauty and accessories, home goods, activewear and electronics. Alarge portion of our merchandise is exclusive to Urban Outfitters, consisting of an assortment of product designed internally and designed in collaboration with third-party brands. Urban Outfitters North American and European Retail segmentnet sales accounted for approximately 32.5% and 7.4% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2017, compared to 32.5% and 8.0%, respectively, for fiscal 2016.    The Anthropologie Group consists of the Anthropologie, Bhldn and Terrain brands. We initially operated the Bhldn and Terrain brands as standalone concepts and opened two Bhldn stores and two Terraingarden centers. We ultimately determined that the Bhldn and Terrain brands were complementary to the Anthropologie brand and integrated those brands into the Anthropologie Group during fiscal 2015 and 2016, respectively. As of January 31, 2017,we operated 225 Anthropologie Group stores, of which 201 were located in the United States, 13 were located in Canada and 11 were located in Europe. During fiscal 2017, we opened ten new Anthropologie Group stores, seven in the United States, one inCanada and two in Europe, and we closed three Anthropologie Group stores located in the United States. Total store selling square footage increased 6.4% over the prior year period to 1.7 million square feet driven mainly by the opening ofexpanded format stores. The Anthropologie Group operates websites in North America and Europe and a mobile application in North America that capture the spirit of our brands by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in ourstores. The Anthropologie brand offers registry services through its website and mobile application and in all of its stores throughout the United States, allowing our customers to create gift registries for any occasion. In addition, the brandoffers catalogs in North America and Europe that market select merchandise, most of which is also available in Anthropologie brand stores. Merchandise at the Anthropologie brand is tailored to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 28 to 45.Product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, intimates, shoes, beauty, home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items. The Bhldn brand emphasizes every element that contributes to a wedding. The Bhldnbrand offers a curated collection of heirloom quality wedding gowns, bridesmaid frocks, party dresses, assorted jewelry, headpieces, footwear, lingerie and decorations. The Terrain brand is designed to appeal to women and men interested in acreative and sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Merchandise includes lifestyle home and garden products, antiques, live plants, flowers, wellness products and       26     accessories. We plan to open additional Anthropologie Group stores, which will include all Anthropologie Group brands and allow us to present an expanded assortment of products in certaincategories such as petites, jewelry and accessories, footwear, intimates, beauty and home furnishings. The Anthropologie Groups North American and European Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 39.3% and 1.5% of consolidated netsales, respectively, for fiscal 2017, compared to 40.2% and 1.6%, respectively, for fiscal 2016.    As of January 31, 2017,we operated 127 Free People stores, of which 121 were located in the United States and six were located in Canada. During fiscal 2017, we opened 15 new Free People stores, of which 14 were located in the United States and one was located in Canada,and we closed two Free People stores located in the United States. Total store selling square footage increased 26.8% over the prior year period to 257,000 square feet. The increase in selling square footage compared to the prior year period was aresult of operating 13 net new stores, including expanded format stores, that were not in operation during the prior twelve month period. Free People operates websites and mobile applications in North America, Europe and Asia that capture the spiritof the brand by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in our stores, as well as substantially all of the Free People wholesale offerings. Free People also offers a catalog that markets select merchandise, most of which isalso available in our Free People stores. Free People focuses its product offering on private label merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30 and provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, intimates,shoes, activewear, accessories, beauty and wellness, home products and gifts. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which will be expanded format stores that allow us to present an expanded assortment of intimates,shoes, party dresses and activewear. Free Peoples Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 10.6% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017, compared to approximately 10.1% for fiscal 2016.   As of January 31, 2017, we operated 12 Food and Beverage restaurants, all of which were located in the United States. In February2016, we acquired six restaurants as part of our acquisition of the Vetri Family group of restaurants, which were combined with our existing restaurants to form our Food and Beverage division. During fiscal 2017, we opened three restaurants andclosed one restaurant. The Food and Beverage division focuses on a dining experience that provides excellence in food, beverage and service. The Food and Beverage division net sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal2017.    We plan to open approximately 19 new stores during fiscal 2018, including four Urban Outfitters stores, fourAnthropologie Group stores, ten Free People stores and one Food and Beverage restaurant. We plan to close approximately seven stores during fiscal 2018, including two Urban Outfitters stores, two Anthropologie Group stores and three Free Peoplestores. Within the United States and Canada, future new store growth will be driven by the Free People brand, as both Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie brands are at or close to our total store count. Our growth strategy for Anthropologie will befocused on relocation or the conversion of existing stores into expanded format locations. In the future, we plan for new store growth for the Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People brands to come from modest expansion internationally.   Wholesale Segment    Our Wholesale segment consists of the Free People wholesale division that designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. Free Peoples range of tops, bottoms, sweaters,      27     dresses, intimates, shoes and activewear are sold through approximately 1,900 better department and specialty stores worldwide, third-party websites and our own Free People stores. Our Wholesalesegment net sales accounted for approximately 8.1% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017, compared to 7.6% for fiscal 2016.    CriticalAccounting Policies and Estimates    Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generallyaccepted accounting principles in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses during thereporting period.    Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committeeof our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form  10-K.  We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flowsand require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimatesmade, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates.   Revenue Recognition    We recognize revenue in our Retail segment at the  point-of-sale  for merchandise sold or services provided at our store orwhen merchandise is shipped to the customer, in each case, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized by our Wholesale segment when merchandise is shipped to the customer, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is presented on anet basis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental or municipal authority. Payment for merchandise in our Retail segment is tendered by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, uncollectible accounts receivablefor our Retail segment is negligible and primarily results from unauthorized credit card transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for the Wholesale segment accounts receivable, which we review on a regular basis and believe issufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments.    We account for a gift card transaction by recording aliability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. A liability is established and remains on our books until the card is redeemed by the customer, at which time we record the redemption ofthe card for merchandise as a sale, or when we determine the likelihood of redemption is remote. We determine the probability of the gift cards being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns. Revenues attributable to thereduction of gift card liabilities for which the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and are not material. Our gift cards do not expire.    Sales Return Reserve    We record a reserve for estimated product returnswhere the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported. The reserve for estimated       28     product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate is materially different than our estimate, sales returns would be adjusted in the future. As ofJanuary 31, 2017 and 2016, reserves for estimated sales returns totaled $24.9 million and $24.4 million, representing 4.2% and 3.5% of total liabilities, respectively.   Marketable Securities    All of our marketable securities as of January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016 are classified as  available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost. Interest on these securities, as well as the amortization of discounts and premiums, is included in Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We recordunrealized gains and losses on these securities (other than mutual funds, held in the rabbi trust for the Urban Outfitters, Inc.  Non-qualified  Deferred Compensation Plan (See Note 4, MarketableSecurities, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form  10-K))  as a component of Other comprehensive (loss) income in the ConsolidatedStatements of Comprehensive Income and in Accumulated other comprehensive loss within Shareholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets until realized, except when we consider declines in value to be other thantemporary. Other than temporary impairment losses related to credit losses are considered to be realized losses. Mutual funds held in the rabbi trust have been accounted for under the fair value option, which results in all unrealized gains andlosses being recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. When  available-for-sale  securities are sold, the cost of the securities isspecifically identified and is used to determine the realized gain or loss. Securities classified as current assets have maturity dates of less than or equal to one year from the balance sheet date. Securities classified as  non-current  assets have maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date.   Inventory   We value our inventory, which consists primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or net realizablevalue. Cost is determined on the  first-in,   first-out  method and includes the cost of merchandise and import related costs, including freight, import taxes and agentcommissions. A periodic review of inventory is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Factors we consider in our review, such as future expected consumer demand and fashiontrends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts and class or type of inventory, are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value. Criteria that we consider in our review of aging trends include averageselling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the prior twelve months and the value and nature of merchandise currently held in inventory and priced below original cost. A provisionis recorded to reduce the cost of inventory to its estimated net realizable value, if appropriate. Any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reportedoperating results. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our provision and related inventory to increase over time as we increase our sales. The majorityof inventory at January 31, 2017 and 2016 consisted of finished goods. Raw materials and  work-in-process  were not material to the overall inventory value. Inventoryas of January 31, 2017 and 2016 totaled $338.6 million and $330.2 million, representing 17.8% and 18.0% of total assets, respectively.       29     Long-Lived Assets   Our long-lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, buildings, furniture and fixtures, and other operatingequipment and are included in the Property and equipment, net line item in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of theapplicable store lease term, including lease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Buildings are recorded at cost and areamortized using the straight-line method over 39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Other operating equipment is recorded at costand amortized using the straight-line method over its useful life, which is three to ten years. Net property and equipment as of January 31, 2017 and 2016 totaled $867.8 million and $863.1 million, representing 45.6% and 47.1% oftotal assets, respectively.    We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long-livedassets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the lesser of the extension period, life of the improvement, or the remaining term of the lease.   Impairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible Assets   We periodically review the carrying values of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carryingvalue may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include plans to close a store, distribution or fulfillment center or a significant decrease in the operating results of a long-lived asset. Our retail stores are reviewed forimpairment at the store level, which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versusfree-standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required fora store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be within three years from the date a store location has opened. In assessing an asset for potential impairment, we make estimates regarding future operating results,cash flows and estimated useful life. When events indicate that an asset may be impaired and the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the impaired asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value and animpairment loss is recorded. We have not made any material changes in the methodology to assess and calculate impairment of long-lived assets in the past three fiscal years. During fiscal 2017, we recorded impairment charges for three retail stores,totaling $4.3 million, all of which is in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During fiscal 2016, we recorded impairment charges for five retail stores, totaling $8.9 million, of which $7.4 million wasin Cost of sales and $1.5 million was in Selling, general and administrative expenses, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During our assessment of current and future performance it was determined that these storeswould not be able to generate sufficient cash flow over the expected remaining lease term to recover the carrying value of the respective store assets. Impairment charges for fiscal 2015 were immaterial.       30     Accounting for Income Taxes   As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the taxjurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such asdepreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We then assess the likelihood that ourdeferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is  more-likely-than-not  that some portion, or all, of thedeferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all material available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income,  tax-planning  strategies, and results of recent operations. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Net deferred tax assets as ofJanuary 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016 totaled $52.7 million and $54.2 million, representing 2.8% and 3.0% of total assets, respectively.    To the extent we believe that recovery of a deferred tax asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, werecord additional income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Valuation allowances were $6.7 million as of January 31, 2017 and $6.6 million as of January 31, 2016. Valuation allowances are based on evidence ofour ability to generate sufficient taxable income in certain foreign and state jurisdictions. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be requiredto reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts thevaluation allowances, if appropriate.    We record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step  process whereby (1) we determine whether it is  more-likely-than-not  that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of theposition and (2) for those tax positions that meet the  more-likely-than-not  recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realizedupon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.    Our tax liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertaintiesbecause we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results maydiffer, and we may be exposed to income tax expenses or benefits that could be material.    We consider certain earnings of  non-U.S.  subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future United States cash generation will be sufficient to meet future United States cash needs and ourspecific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiaries earnings. Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitelyinvested outside the United States.       31     Accounting for Contingencies   From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We are required to record areserve for estimated losses when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can bereasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual disputes or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known,our reserves for loss contingencies could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds our reserve could have amaterial adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. We believe that our reserves adequately reflect the anticipated final outcome of any matter currently pending against us and the ultimatesettlement of such matters will not materially affect our financial position or results of operations.    Share-BasedCompensation    Accounting for share-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all share-based awardsat fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures.    Weuse a lattice binomial pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights. This model uses assumptions including the risk-free rate of interest, expected volatility of our stock price and expected life ofthe awards. A Monte Carlo simulation, which utilizes similar assumptions, is used to determine the fair value of performance-based awards. We review our assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third-party valuation advisors in orderto determine the fair value of share-based compensation awards at the date of grant. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these share-based payment awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherentuncertainties and the application of judgment. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.   Additionally, we make certain estimates about the number of awards which will become vested under performance-based incentive plans. Werecord expense for performance-based awards based on our current expectations of the probable number of awards that will ultimately vest. The estimation of awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results orupdated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised and could be materially different from share-based compensation expense recorded in prior periods.   We also estimate the expected forfeiture rate. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including typesof awards and historical experience. We revise our forfeiture rates, when necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those originally estimated. As a result, if the actual forfeiture rate is different from the estimate at thecompletion of the vesting period, the share-based compensation expense may not be comparable to amounts recorded in prior periods.       32     See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recently IssuedAccounting Pronouncements , in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form  10-K  for a description of changes to the accounting for share-basedcompensation in fiscal 2018.    Results of Operations    As a Percentage of Net Sales    The following table sets forth, for theperiods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows:                             Fiscal Year Ended January 31,             2017        2016        2015        Net sales         100.0  %         100.0  %         100.0  %      Cost of sales         64.9           65.1           64.6                                                           Gross profit         35.1           34.9           35.4        Selling, general and administrative expenses         25.6           24.6           24.4                                                           Income from operations         9.5           10.3           11.0        Interest income         0.1                        0.1        Other income         0.1                                  Other expenses         (0.2  )         (0.1  )         (0.2  )                                                         Income before income taxes         9.5           10.2           10.9        Income tax expense         3.3           3.7           3.9                                                           Net income         6.2  %         6.5  %         7.0  %                                                         Period over Period Change:                        Net sales         2.9  %         3.7  %         7.7  %      Gross profit         3.6  %         2.3  %         1.2  %      Income from operations         -4.3  %         -3.2  %         -14.4  %      Net income         -2.8  %         -3.4  %         -17.7  %     Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016    Net sales in fiscal 2017 increased by 2.9% to $3.5 billion, from $3.4 billion in fiscal 2016. The $100.7 million increase was attributable to a $71.9 million, or 2.3%, increase inRetail segment net sales and a $28.8 million, or 11.0%, increase in Wholesale segment net sales. Retail segment net sales for fiscal 2017 accounted for 91.9% of total net sales compared to 92.4% of total net sales during fiscal 2016.   The growth in our Retail segment net sales during fiscal 2017 was due to an increase of $24.2 million, or 0.8%, inRetail segment comparable net sales, which includes our  direct-to-consumer  channel, and an increase of $47.7 million in non-comparable  net sales, including new store net sales. Retail segment comparable net sales increased 3.9% at Urban Outfitters, were flat at Free People and decreased 2.0% at Anthropologie Group. The increasein Retail segment comparable net sales was       33     driven by continued growth in the  direct-to-consumer  channel, which was partially offset by negative comparablestore net sales. The  direct-to-consumer  net sales increase was driven by an increase in sessions and conversion rate, which was offset by a decrease in average ordervalue. Negative comparable store net sales resulted from decreased transactions, average unit selling price, while units per transaction remained flat. The increase in net sales attributable to  non-comparable sales was primarily the result of operating 69 new stores and restaurants in fiscal 2017 and 2016 that were not in operation for the full comparable periods and sales from the newly acquired Vetri Family restaurants, partially offset by the negativeimpact of foreign currency translation. Thus far during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, comparable Retail segment net sales are mid single-digit negative.    The increase in Wholesale segment net sales during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to increased sales to department and specialty stores, driven by increased selling squarefootage at select department stores and growth in our international accounts. Wholesale sales growth was driven by an increase in units that was partially offset by a decrease in average unit selling price.   Gross profit percentage in fiscal 2017 increased to 35.1% of net sales, from 34.9% of net sales in fiscal 2016. Gross profit increased to$1.24 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $1.20 billion in fiscal 2016. The increase in gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvement in the Urban Outfitters brand maintained margins due to lower merchandise markdowns compared tothe prior year. This increase was partially offset by a lower gross profit rate at the Free People brand, which was primarily driven by lower maintained margins due to higher merchandise markdowns, and total Company deleverage in customer deliveryand logistics expense primarily related to the increased penetration of our  direct-to-consumer  channel. The dollar increase in gross profit was primarily due to highernet sales and the increase in gross profit rate. Total inventory at January 31, 2017 increased by $8.4 million, or 2.5%, to $338.6 million from $330.2 million at January 31, 2016. The increase in inventory is primarily dueto an increase in  non-comparable  inventory to support our new and expanded format stores. Comparable Retail segment inventory decreased 2.3% at cost.   Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased during fiscal 2017 to 25.6% of net sales, compared to24.6% of net sales for fiscal 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by direct store expenses to support our square footage growth and expanded format stores and anincrease in direct marketing expenses to support our  direct-to-consumer  growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $57.8 million, or 6.8%, to$906.1 million, in fiscal 2017, from $848.3 million in fiscal 2016. The dollar increase versus the prior year was primarily related to the operating expenses of  non-comparable  stores and increasedmarketing expenses, which helped to drive higher  direct-to-consumer  traffic.    Income from operations decreased to 9.5% of net sales, or $338.5 million, for fiscal 2017 compared to 10.3%, or $353.6 million, for fiscal 2016.   Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 35.5% of income before income taxes compared to 35.9% of income before income taxes in fiscal2016. See Note 9, Income Taxes, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form  10-K,  for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rateto our effective tax rate.       34     Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015   Net sales in fiscal 2016 increased by 3.7% to $3.4 billion, from $3.3 billion in fiscal 2015. The $122.1 million increasewas attributable to an $87.7 million, or 2.8%, increase in Retail segment net sales and a $34.4 million, or 15.2%, increase in Wholesale segment net sales. Retail segment net sales for fiscal 2016 accounted for 92.4% of total net salescompared to 93.2% of total net sales during fiscal 2015.    The growth in our Retail segment net sales during fiscal 2016 wasdue to an increase of $47.4 million, or 1.6%, in Retail segment comparable net sales, which includes our  direct-to-consumer  channel, and an increase of$40.3 million in  non-comparable  and new store net sales. Our total Company comparable Retail segment net sales increase was comprised of increases of 9.0%, 1.4% and 0.4% at Free People, Urban Outfittersand Anthropologie Group, respectively. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by continued growth in the  direct-to-consumer  channel which waspartially offset by negative comparable store net sales.  Direct-to-consumer  net sales were driven by an increase in sessions, orders, average order value and conversionrate. The negative comparable store net sales resulted from a reduction in store traffic, transactions and units per transaction, which were partially offset by an increase in average unit selling price. The increase in net sales attributable to  non-comparable  and new stores was primarily the result of opening 69 new stores in fiscal 2016 and 2015 that were not in operation for the full comparable periods.   The increase in Wholesale segment net sales during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was due to increased sales at both departmentstores and specialty accounts. Wholesale sales growth was driven by an increase in units that was partially offset by a decrease in average unit selling price.    Gross profit percentage in fiscal 2016 decreased to 34.9% of net sales, from 35.4% of net sales in fiscal 2015. Gross profit increased to $1.20 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $1.17 billionin fiscal 2015. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was primarily driven by higher delivery and fulfillment center expenses largely related to incremental costs associated with the Gap, Pennsylvania fulfillment center transition andincreased  direct-to-consumer  sales penetration. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was additionally driven by impairment charges for five retail stores. Totalinventory at January 31, 2016 decreased by $28.0 million, or 7.8%, to $330.2 million from $358.2 million at January 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily related to the decline in comparable Retail segment inventories, whichdecreased 6% at cost and 8% in units.    Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increasedduring fiscal 2016 to 24.6% of net sales, compared to 24.4% of net sales for fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased marketing expenses to support our customer acquisition and retention efforts and an increase in technology relatedexpenses used to support our omni-channel initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $38.8 million, or 4.8%, to $848.3 million, in fiscal 2016, from $809.5 million in fiscal 2015. The dollar increase versusthe prior year was primarily related to increased marketing and technology expenses and the operating expenses of new stores.   Income from operations decreased to 10.3% of net sales, or $353.6 million, for fiscal 2016 compared to 11.0%, or$365.4 million, for fiscal 2015.    Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 35.9% of income before income taxes comparedto 36.0% of income before income taxes in fiscal 2015. See Note 9, Income Taxes, in the Notes to our       35     Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form  10-K,  for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to oureffective tax rate.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $403.5 million as of January 31, 2017, as compared to $362.9 million as of January 31, 2016 and $363.3 million as ofJanuary 31, 2015. During fiscal 2017, we generated $414.9 million in cash from operations, repaid $150.0 million on our long-term debt facility, repurchased $45.8 million in common shares under the Board of Directors approvedshare repurchase programs and invested $143.7 million in property and equipment. Our working capital was $528.5 million at January 31, 2017 compared to $505.1 million at January 31, 2016 and $455.4 million atJanuary 31, 2015.    During the last three years, we have satisfied our cash requirements primarily through our cash flowfrom operating activities. In fiscal 2016, we utilized borrowings on our long-term debt facility as an additional source of cash to repurchase our common shares. In addition to repurchasing our common shares, our primary uses of cash have been toopen new stores, purchase inventory and expand our home offices and fulfillment facilities. We have also continued to invest in our omni-channel capabilities and technology.    Cash Flows from Operating Activities    Cash provided by operating activitiesfor fiscal 2017 increased by $1.5 million to $414.9 million from $413.4 million in fiscal 2016. For both periods, our major source of cash from operations was merchandise sales and our primary outflow of cash for operations was forthe payment of operational costs.    Cash Flows from Investing Activities   Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 increased by $207.8 million to $234.6 million from $26.8 million infiscal 2016. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2017 primarily related to purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment, partially offset by the sales and maturities of marketable securities. Cash paid for property andequipment for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $143.7 million, $135.0 million and $229.8 million, respectively. Cash paid for property and equipment in fiscal 2017 was primarily to expand our store base and in fiscal 2016 and 2015 toexpand our store base, home offices and fulfillment capabilities.    Cash Flows from Financing Activities   Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2017 decreased by $79.4 million to $193.4 million from $272.8 million infiscal 2016. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017 primarily related to $150.0 million in repayments of long-term debt and $45.8 million of repurchases of our common shares under the Board of Directors approved share repurchaseprogram. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily related to $465.3 million of repurchases of our common shares under the Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs, partially offset by $150.0 million in netborrowings under our long-debt debt facility.       36     Credit Facilities   On July 1, 2015, we entered into a five-year asset-based revolving Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with certainlenders, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as joint lead arrangers and  co-book  managers. The CreditAgreement provides senior secured revolving credit for loans and letters of credit up to $400.0 million (the Credit Facility), subject to a borrowing base that is comprised of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory. TheCredit Facility includes a swing-line  sub-facility,  a multicurrency  sub-facility  and the option to expand the facility by up to $150.0 million. The funds availableunder the Credit Facility may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.    The Credit Facility providesfor interest on borrowings, at our option, at either (i) adjusted LIBOR, CDOR or EURIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.125% to 1.625%, or (ii) an adjusted ABR plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.125% to 0.625%, each suchrate based on the level of availability under the Credit Facility and our adjusted leverage ratio. Interest is payable either monthly or quarterly depending on the type of borrowing. A commitment fee is payable quarterly on the unused portion of theCredit Facility, based on our adjusted leverage ratio.    All obligations under the Credit Facility are unconditionallyguaranteed by us and our domestic subsidiaries. The obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by a first-priority security interest in inventory, accounts receivable, and certain other assets of the borrowers and guarantors. The CreditAgreement contains customary representations and warranties, negative and affirmative covenants and provisions relating to events of default.    As of January 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all terms of the Credit Agreement and there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility. Outstanding stand-by  letters of credit, which reduce the funds available under the Credit Facility, were $12.9 million at January 31, 2017.   Additionally, we have borrowing agreements with two separate financial institutions under which we may borrow an aggregate of$130.0 million for the purposes of trade letter of credit issuances. The availability of any future borrowings under the trade letter of credit facilities is subject to acceptance by the respective financial institutions. As of January 31,2017, we had $60.5 million in outstanding trade letters of credit, and $69.5 million available for future trade letters of credit of under these facilities.    Capital and Operating Expenditures    During fiscal 2018, we plan toconstruct and open approximately 19 new stores, including one restaurant, expand certain existing stores, repurchase common shares, upgrade our systems, improve our capabilities in the digital channel, invest in omni-channel marketing and purchaseinventory for our Retail and Wholesale segments at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We believe that our marketing, social media, merchandise expansion, website and mobile initiatives are a significant contributor to ourRetail segment sales growth. During fiscal 2018, we plan to continue our investment in these initiatives for all brands. We anticipate our capital expenditures during fiscal 2018 to be approximately $90 million, all of which are expected to befinanced by cash flow from operating activities. We believe that our new store investments have the potential to generate positive cash flow within a year. We may also enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion      37     of our brand offerings. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, available credit facilities and future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund these initiatives.   Share Repurchases    See Note 11, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form  10-K  for certainfinancial information regarding the Companys share repurchases.    Contractual Obligations   The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 31, 2017:                                               Payments Due by Period (in thousands)        Description      Total Obligations         Less Than One Year         One to Three Years         Three to Five Years         More Than Five Years        Operating leases (1)      $  1,990,688         $  281,249         $  515,631         $  408,969         $  784,839        Purchase commitments (2)         418,221            414,825            2,445            951                      Construction contracts (3)         6,409            6,409                                                  Tax contingencies (4)                                                                                                                                                                  Total contractual obligations      $  2,415,318         $  702,483         $  518,076         $  409,920         $  784,839                                                                                                   (1)  Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect ourfuture minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are 33 locations where a percentage of sales are paid, in lieu of a fixed minimum rent, that are not reflected in the above table.Total rent expense related to these 33 locations was approximately $4,033 for fiscal 2017. It is common for the lease agreements for our European locations to allow for the landlord to adjust the minimum rental due to the current market ratesmultiple times during the lease term. The table above includes our current contractual payments for these locations. Amounts noted above include commitments for 13 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2017 as well as oneground lease with Waterloo Devon, LP, a related party. See Note 15, Related Party Transactions, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding theground lease.     (2)  Includes merchandise commitments, which are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until the merchandise shipping date, as well as commitmentsfor products and services including information technology contracts used in the normal course of business.     (3)  Includes construction contracts with contractors that are fully satisfied upon the completion of construction, which is typically within twelve months.    (4)  Tax contingencies include $0 that is classified as a current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2017. Tax contingenciesin the table above do not show an existing liability of $6,415 because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled. As a result, the $6,415 liability was classified as a non-current liability in theCompanys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2017.       38     Commercial Commitments    The following table summarizes our commercial commitments as of January 31, 2017:                                                Amount of Commitment Per Period (in thousands)        Description      Total Amounts Committed          Less Than One Year         One to Three Years         Three to Five Years         More Than Five Years        Trade letters of credit (1)      $  60,539         $  60,539         $             $             $            Stand-by letters of credit (2)         12,852            12,852                                                                                                                                         Total commercial commitments      $  73,391         $  73,391         $             $             $                                                                                                       (1)  Consists primarily of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with import inventory purchases.     (2)  Consists primarily of stand-by letters of credit for customs, construction and insurance.    Off-Balance  Sheet Arrangements    Asof and for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material  off-balance  sheet arrangements thatare reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.    Other Matters    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements , in the Notes toour Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form  10-K  for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.   Seasonality and Quarterly Results    Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations in net sales and net income, with a more significant portion typically realized in the second half of each year predominantly due to the  year-end  holiday period. Historically, and consistent with the retail industry, the seasonality also impacts our working capital requirements, particularly with regard to inventory. The following tables set forthour net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales andannual net income. The unaudited financial information has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form  10-Q  and Article 10 of Regulation  S-X.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentationhave been included.       39                                Fiscal 2017 Quarter Ended (1)          April 30, 2016        July 31, 2016        Oct. 31, 2016        Jan. 31, 2017          (dollars in thousands, except per share data)        Net sales      $  762,577        $  890,568        $  862,491        $  1,030,158        Gross profit         261,891           342,511           299,897           340,314        Net income         29,562           76,915           47,355           64,288        Net income per common sharebasic         0.25           0.66           0.41           0.55        Net income per common sharediluted         0.25           0.66           0.40           0.55              As a Percentage of Fiscal Year:                              Net sales         22  %         25  %         24  %         29  %      Net income         14  %         35  %         22  %         29  %                                   Fiscal 2016 Quarter Ended (1)             April 30, 2015        July 31, 2015        Oct. 31, 2015        Jan. 31, 2016             (dollars in thousands, except per share data)        Net sales      $  739,010        $  867,460        $  825,258        $  1,013,406        Gross profit         246,421           318,105           288,188           349,188        Net income         32,776           66,841           51,994           72,878        Net income per common sharebasic         0.25           0.52           0.42           0.61        Net income per common sharediluted         0.25           0.52           0.42           0.61              As a Percentage of Fiscal Year:                              Net sales         22  %         25  %         24  %         29  %      Net income         15  %         30  %         23  %         32  %          (1)  The sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal per share amounts reported for year-to-date  periods due to changes in the number of weighted-average shares outstanding and the effects of rounding for each period.   Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   We are exposed to the following types of market risksfluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods andservices, the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar, and changes in interest rates. Due to our inventory turnover rate and our historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in our cost of goods to ourcustomers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. We purchase the majority of our merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a majority of the goods for our stores located in Canada and a portionof the goods for our stores located in Europe.    Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currencies is due to ourfinancial statements being presented in U.S. dollars and our international subsidiaries transacting in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates in effect during or at the end of the reporting period may affect the value ofthe reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. As we expand our international operations, the potential impact of currency fluctuations increases.    Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the Credit Facility. As of January 31, 2017 and 2016, our cash, cash      40     equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of cash on hand and in banks, money market accounts, municipal and  pre-refunded  municipal bondsrated BBB or better, corporate bonds rated BBB or better, certificates of deposit, and mutual funds. Due to the short average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, we believe a 100 basis point changein interest rates would not have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on thecash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments.   We are exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates on outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility because theseborrowings bear interest at variable rates. A 100 basis point change in our applicable interest rate would not have a material impact to interest expense for the year ended January 31, 2017.   Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
