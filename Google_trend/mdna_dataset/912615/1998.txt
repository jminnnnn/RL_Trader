Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis           of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       The following discussion of the Company's historical results of operations and of its liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements of the Company and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  General       The Company is composed of two retail subsidiaries, Urban Retail and Anthropologie, and a Wholesale subsidiary. Urban Retail is the largest of the three, has the highest gross profit margins and generates most of the Company's revenues and profits. Urban Retail had 26 stores opened at January 31, 1998 and 25 at January 31, 1997. The Company's first Anthropologie store opened in October 1992. Anthropologie had nine stores opened at January 31, 1998 and eight at January 31, 1997. The Company has plans to open seven Urban Retail stores and five Anthropologie stores in Fiscal 1999. The recent growth in the Wholesale company is from both the domestic and international markets.       Fiscal 1998 and 1997 continued as very profitable years for Urban Outfitters with earnings to net sales of 8.0% and 8.5%, respectively, as well as return on shareholders' equity of 15.3% and 17.5%, respectively. The slight contraction of earnings as a percent of net sales in Fiscal 1998 and the direction of return on shareholders' equity in that year resulted primarily from a slowdown in retail sales growth in Fiscal 1998. The Wholesale company recorded sales growth of 8% and 30% in Fiscal years 1998 and 1997, respectively. The Wholesale company is not expected to grow at those rates in Fiscal 1999 and could experience a reduction in sales during Fiscal 1999.       The Company has established a European subsidiary (Urban Outfitters U.K. Ltd.) and expects to open its first Urban Retail store in London in May 1998. The European subsidiary incurred expenses without the benefit of sales during Fiscal 1998. While Fiscal 1999 is expected to have sales from the London store, the subsidiary will still operate at a loss during Fiscal 1999.       In late Fiscal 1998 and in early Fiscal 1999, the Company invested in two direct marketing concepts. The first is a 100% owned catalog under the Anthropologie retail subsidiary and carries the Anthropologie name. The second is a minority investment in a teenage catalog/magazine combination called moXIEgirl(TM). Both are expected to incur losses during their start-up phases. The period of start-up could encompass two years for either or both.                                  11          The Company's Fiscal year ends on January 31. All references in this discussion to Fiscal years of the Company refer to the Fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, the Company's 1998 Fiscal year ended on January 31, 1998. The comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion are calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented.   Results of Operations       The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of the Company's net sales represented by certain income statement data and the growth of certain income statement data from period to period.

The $16.7 million increase was attributable to a combination of comparable store net sales decreases of $1.6 million, net sales increases of $16.1 million from stores opened or enlarged during Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal 1998 and net sales increases of $2.2 million from the Wholesale company. The decrease in comparable store sales of 1% or $1.6 million results primarily from one merchandise division that did not perform to prior year levels. Average selling prices were                                 12    not a significant determinate of Fiscal 1998 sales levels. New and enlarged stores included seven stores opened in Fiscal 1997 and three opened in Fiscal 1998. The Company believes increased net sales from the Wholesale subsidiary during Fiscal 1997 and 1998 were attributable to increased orders and order size due to the popularity of its product lines as well as growth in number of orders and size of orders from international customers.       The Company's gross profit margin declined from 50.2% in Fiscal 1997 to 49.5% in Fiscal 1998. The primary contributors to the decline were higher markdowns in the retail companies and a higher sales mix in the lower gross profit margin companies -- Anthropologie and Wholesale. Markdowns were triggered by lower than planned comparable store sales.       Selling, general and administrative expenses grew to $63.7 million in Fiscal 1998 from $57.1 million in the prior Fiscal year, an 11.4% increase. As a percentage of net sales, the expenses increased to 36.8% in Fiscal 1998 from 36.5% in the prior Fiscal year. The increase in percentage was attributable to the Retail companies' lower comparable store sales and investments in people and systems to accommodate the sales growth in the Wholesale company over the last two years of 8% and 30%.       Net income increased to $13.9 million in Fiscal 1998 from $13.3 million in the prior Fiscal year, a 4.7% increase. This increase was principally achieved through increases in net sales.   Fiscal 1997 Compared to Fiscal 1996       Net sales in Fiscal 1997 increased to $156.4 million from $133.0 million in the prior Fiscal year, a 17.6% increase. The $23.4 million increase was attributable to comparable store net sales increases of $2.2 million, net sales of $14.5 million from stores opened or enlarged during Fiscal 1996 and Fiscal 1997 and net sales increases of $6.7 million from the Wholesale company. The comparable store sales increase of 2.1% or $2.2 million in Fiscal 1997 over 1996 results from the inverse relationship of higher average selling prices and fewer pieces sold. The higher average selling prices representing approximately $12.1 million and the fewer pieces sold approximately $9.9 million leaves $2.2 million in comparable store sales. New and enlarged stores included four stores opened in Fiscal 1996 and seven opened in Fiscal 1997. The Company believes increased net sales from the Wholesale subsidiary during Fiscal 1997 were attributable to increased orders and order size due to the popularity of its product lines as well as growth in number of orders and size of orders from international customers.       The Company's gross profit margin declined from 50.8% in Fiscal 1996 to 50.2% in Fiscal 1997. The primary contributors to the decline were higher markdowns in the retail companies, high growth of a new, lower margin product line in the Wholesale company, and a mix swing to higher sales in the lower gross profit margin companies -- Anthropologie and Wholesale. Markdowns were triggered by lower than plan comparable store sales and by late openings of two Urban Retail stores. The new Wholesale product line did not have production economies of scale enjoyed by its larger and more established product lines.                                          13         Selling, general and administrative expenses grew to $57.1 million in Fiscal 1997 from $47.7 million in the prior Fiscal year, a 19.8% increase. As a percentage of net sales, the expenses increased to 36.5% in Fiscal 1997 from 35.9% in the prior Fiscal year. The increase in percentage was attributable to Urban Retail due to lower comparable store sales. Conversely, both Anthropologie and Wholesale experienced selling, general and administrative expense leveraging on significant sales growth.       Net income increased to $13.3 million in Fiscal 1997 from $12.3 million in the prior Fiscal year, a 7.7% increase. This increase was principally achieved through increases in net sales.   Liquidity and Capital Resources       During the last three years the Company has satisfied its cash requirements through cash flow from operations. The Company's primary uses of cash have been to open new stores, build a new distribution center and purchase inventories. Most recently, the company invested in two direct response catalogs and in a new European subsidiary. In addition to cash generated from operations, sources of cash have included the net proceeds from the exercise of certain employee stock options in each of Fiscal 1996, 1997 and 1998. Over the next few years, the Company expects to incur capital expenditures in support of its expansion program. Accumulated cash and future cash from operations are expected to fund such expansion-related uses of cash, including investments in the catalog companies.       Although the Company has not borrowed short-term or long-term funds during the last five Fiscal years, it maintains a line of credit of $16.5 million, of which all is available for cash borrowings or for the issuance of letters of credit. The line is unsecured and any cash borrowings under the line would accrue interest at an as offered basis not to exceed LIBOR plus 3/8 of 1 percent. The Company uses letters of credit primarily to purchase private label and Wholesale merchandise from offshore suppliers. Outstanding balances of letters of credit at January 31, 1997 and 1998 were $4.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively. There were no short-term or long-term debts outstanding at January 31, 1997 or at January 31, 1998. The Company expects that accumulated cash and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash needs for at least the next three years.   Other Matters  Year 2000  The Company has examined each area of its business systems from IBM operating systems, to business application systems, to store register systems that it believes could be affected by the date change issue of the year 2000. It has also reviewed the implemented changes or planned changes of its major suppliers that it believes would be effected by the year 2000 date changes. Many of the needed changes are complete, some are still taking place and all are expected to be completed and in place before the critical times in calendar 1999. The expenses associated with the changes are not expected to be of a material nature to the Company.                                          14    Future Accounting Changes  In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income" and No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." The Company will adopt these new accounting standards in Fiscal 1999. While management has not yet completed its assessment of how and if SFAS 131 will impact the Company's existing segment disclosures, both standards are for disclosure purposes only and will have no adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows or results of operations.   Seasonality and Quarterly Results       While Urban Outfitters has been profitable in each of its last 32 operating quarters, its operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. The Company's highest sales levels have historically occurred during the five-month period from August 1 to December 31 of each year (the "Back-to-School" and Holiday periods). Sales generated during these periods have traditionally had a significant impact on the Company's results of operations. Any decreases in sales for these periods or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding these periods could have a material, adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. The Company's results of operations in any one Fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that can be expected for any other Fiscal quarter or for the full Fiscal year.       The Company's results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of expenses incurred in connection with, and sales contributed by, new stores, store expansions and the integration of new stores into the operations of the Company. Fluctuations in the bookings and shipments of the Wholesale products between quarters can also have positive or negative effects on earnings during the quarters.       The following tables, which are unaudited, set forth the Company's net sales, gross profit, net income and income per share for each quarter during the last two Fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income.
