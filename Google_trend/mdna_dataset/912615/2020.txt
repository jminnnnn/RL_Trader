Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview  We operate under three reportable segments – Retail, Wholesale and Subscription. Our Retail segment consists of our Anthropologie, Bhldn, Free People, Terrain and Urban Outfitters brands and our Menus & Venues (formerly known as “Food and Beverage”) division. Our Retail segment consumer products and services are sold directly to our customers through our stores, websites, mobile applications, catalogs and customer contact centers and franchised or third-party operated stores and digital businesses. The Wholesale segment consists of our Free People, Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters brands that sell through department and specialty stores worldwide, digital businesses and our Retail segment. The Wholesale segment primarily designs, develops and markets apparel, intimates, activewear and home goods. Our Subscription segment consists of the Nuuly brand, which is a monthly women’s apparel subscription rental service that launched on July 30, 2019.  Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal year 2020 ended on January 31, 2020.  Retail Segment  Our Retail segment omni-channel strategy enhances our customers’ brand experience by providing a seamless approach to the customer shopping experience. All available Company-owned Retail segment shopping channels are fully integrated, including stores, websites, mobile applications, catalogs and customer contact centers. Our investments in areas such as marketing campaigns and technology advancements are designed to generate demand for the Retail segment omni-channel and not the separate store or digital channels. We manage and analyze our performance based on a single Retail segment omni-channel rather than separate channels and believe that the Retail segment omni-channel results present the most meaningful and appropriate measure of our performance.  Our comparable Retail segment net sales data is equal to the sum of our comparable store and comparable digital channel net sales. A store is considered to be comparable if it has been open at least 12 full months, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. A digital channel is considered to be comparable if it has been operational for at least 12 full months. Sales from stores and digital channels that do not fall within the definition of comparable store or channel are considered to be non-comparable. Franchise net sales and the effects of foreign currency translation are also considered non-comparable.  We monitor Retail segment metrics including customer traffic and average units per transaction at our stores, websites and mobile applications. We additionally monitor average unit selling price and transactions at our stores and average order value and conversion rates on our websites and mobile applications. We believe that changes in any of these metrics may be caused by a response to our brands’ fashion offerings, our marketing campaigns, circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition.  Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18 to 28 through a unique merchandise mix, compelling store environment, websites and mobile applications and a product offering that includes women’s and men’s fashion apparel, activewear, intimates, footwear, accessories, home goods, electronics and beauty. A large portion of our merchandise is exclusive to Urban Outfitters, consisting of an assortment of products designed internally and designed in collaboration with third-party brands. Urban Outfitters stores are in street locations in large metropolitan areas and select university communities, specialty centers and enclosed malls that accommodate our customers’ propensity not only to shop, but also to congregate with their peers. Urban Outfitters operates websites and mobile applications in North America and Europe that capture the spirit of the brand by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in its stores, offers a catalog in Europe offering select merchandise, most of which is also available in its stores, sells merchandise through franchisee-owned stores in Israel and the United Arab Emirates, and partners with third-party digital businesses to offer a limited selection of merchandise, which is available globally. Urban Outfitters’ North American and European Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 29.5%   and 7.9%   of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2020, compared to 30.5% and 8.2%, respectively, for fiscal 2019.  The Anthropologie Group consists of the Anthropologie, Bhldn and Terrain brands. Merchandise at the Anthropologie brand is tailored to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 28 to 45. The product assortment includes women’s casual apparel, accessories, intimates, shoes, home furnishings, a diverse array of gifts and decorative items and beauty and wellness. APlus by Anthropologie, which was launched during fiscal 2020, is an apparel line that offers an extended size range within certain Anthropologie brand clothing collections. The Bhldn brand emphasizes every element that contributes to a wedding. The Bhldn brand offers a curated collection of heirloom quality wedding gowns, bridesmaid frocks, party dresses, assorted jewelry, headpieces, footwear, lingerie and decorations. The Terrain brand is designed to appeal to women and men interested in a creative and sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Merchandise includes lifestyle home, garden and outdoor living products, antiques, live plants, flowers, wellness products and accessories. In addition to individual brand stores, the Anthropologie Group operates expanded format stores that include multiple Anthropologie Group brands, which allows for the presentation of an expanded assortment of products in certain categories. Anthropologie Group stores are located in specialty centers, upscale street locations and enclosed malls. The Anthropologie Group operates websites and mobile applications in North America and Europe that capture the spirit of its brands by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in its stores, offers catalogs in North America and Europe that market select merchandise, most of which is also available in Anthropologie brand stores, sells merchandise through a franchisee-owned store in Israel, and partners   19      with third-party digital businesses to offer a limited selection of merchandise, which is available globally.  The Anthropologie Group’s North American and European Retail segment net sales accounted for  approximately  3 9.2 %  and  1.7 % of  consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal  20 20 , compared to  3 8 . 6 % and  1. 7 %, respectively, for fiscal  201 9 .  Free People focuses its product offering on private label merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30 and provides a unique merchandise mix of casual women’s apparel, intimates, FP Movement activewear, shoes, accessories, home products, gifts and beauty and wellness. Free People stores are located in enclosed malls, upscale street locations and specialty centers. We plan to open three standalone FP Movement stores in fiscal 2021 and expect to open more in the future. Free People operates websites and mobile applications in North America, Europe and Asia that capture the spirit of the brand by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in its stores, as well as substantially all of the Free People wholesale offerings. Free People also offers a catalog that markets select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Free People stores, sells merchandise through a franchisee-owned store in Israel, and partners with third-party digital businesses to offer a limited selection of merchandise, which is available globally. Free People opened its first European retail stores in fiscal 2019. Free People’s North American Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 12.5% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2020, compared to approximately 11.6% for fiscal 2019. European Retail segment net sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019.  The Menus & Venues division focuses on a dining experience that provides excellence in food, beverage and service. The Menus & Venues division net sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019.  Net sales from the Retail segment accounted for approximately 91.6%, 91.2% and 91.3% of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

We plan for future digital channel growth to come from expansion domestically and internationally.     Projected openings and closings for fiscal 2021 are as follows:              January 31,           Projected           Projected           January 31,                 2020           Openings           Closings           2021         Urban Outfitters           248               13               (4   )           257         Anthropologie Group           231               12               (4   )           239         Free People  (1)           144               13               (1   )           156         Menus & Venues           11               —               —               11         Total Company-Owned Stores           634               38               (9   )           663         Franchisee-Owned Stores           7               3               —               10         Total URBN  (2)           641               41               (9   )           673                (1)   Includes three standalone FP Movement stores.          (2)   All projected openings are currently being evaluated due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic.   Wholesale Segment  Our Wholesale segment consists of the Free People, Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters brands that sell through approximately 2,300 department and specialty stores worldwide, third-party digital businesses and our Retail segment. The Wholesale segment primarily designs, develops and markets young women’s contemporary casual apparel, intimates, FP Movement activewear and shoes under the Free People brand, home goods including gifts, tabletop and textiles under the Anthropologie brand and the BDG apparel collection under the Urban Outfitters brand. The Anthropologie wholesale division was established in fiscal 2018 and the Urban Outfitters wholesale division was established in fiscal 2019. Our Wholesale segment net sales accounted for approximately 8.2% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2020, compared to 8.8% for fiscal 2019.  Subscription Segment  Our Subscription segment consists of the Nuuly brand, which is a monthly women’s apparel subscription rental service that launched on July 30, 2019. For a monthly fee, Nuuly subscribers can select rental product from a wide selection of the Company’s own brands, third-party labels and one-of-a-kind vintage pieces via a custom-built, digital platform. Subscribers select their products each month, wear them as often as they like, then swap into new products the following month. Subscribers are also able to purchase the rented product. Our Subscription segment net sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2020.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses during the reporting period.  Our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates.  Revenue Recognition  Merchandise:  Merchandise is sold through retail stores, catalogs and the digital sales channel, as well as to wholesale customers, franchise partners and subscription customers. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to the customer. We have elected to treat shipping and handling as fulfillment activities and not a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, we will recognize merchandise revenue for the Retail segment for our single performance obligation at the point of sale or at the time of shipment, which is when transfer of control to the customer occurs. A Subscription segment customer may purchase merchandise in her possession that was included in the order that was delivered as part of the monthly subscription rental service. We recognize merchandise revenue for the Subscription segment for our single performance obligation when the customer purchases the merchandise   21      through the website or mobile application. Revenue does not include taxes assessed by governmental authorities, including value-added and other sales-related taxes, that are imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing activities. Revenue is recognized net of estimated customer returns. Retail segment return policies vary by brand, but generally provide for no time limit on returns and the refund to be issued in either the form of original payment or as a gift card. Payment for merchandise is tendered primarily by cash, check, credit card, debit card, gift card or alternative payment  method   (such as Afterpay and Alipay). Uncollectible accounts receivable primarily results from unauthorized credit card transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our Wholesale segment accounts receivable, which we review on a regular basis and believe is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Payment terms in our Wholesale segment vary by customer with the most common being a net 30-day policy.  Menus & Venues:  Revenue from restaurant sales and events is recognized upon completion of the service, when we satisfy our single performance obligation. Customer deposits may be received in advance for events, which represents a contract liability until we satisfy our performance obligation.  Subscription Fees:  Revenue for the Subscription segment is generated through monthly subscription fees and the purchase of merchandise in a customer’s possession. The monthly subscription rental fee is recognized as revenue on the date the customer is billed, which is the monthly anniversary of when the customer initially signed up for the subscription rental service. A customer may pause the monthly subscription, at which point the customer will not be billed for future months until the subscription is no longer on hold. Merchandise sales to Subscription segment customers are discussed above under Merchandise.  Franchise Fees:  Revenue from franchise operations primarily relates to merchandise sales to franchisees and royalty fees. Merchandise sales to franchisees are discussed above under Merchandise. Royalty fees are based upon a percentage of franchisee net sales to third party customers and are recognized when such sales occur.  Gift Cards:  We account for a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. At the time of issuance, we have an open performance obligation for the future delivery of promised goods or services. The liability remains outstanding until the card is redeemed by the customer, at which time we recognize revenue. Over time, a portion of the outstanding gift cards will not be redeemed by the customer which we refer to as “breakage”. Revenue is recognized from breakage over time in proportion to gift card redemptions. Judgment is used in determining the amount of breakage revenue to be recognized and is based on historical gift card redemption patterns. Gift card breakage revenue is included in net sales and is not material. Our gift cards do not expire.  Customer Loyalty Programs:  We maintain a customer loyalty program under our Urban Outfitters brand. Under this program, customers can earn and accumulate points that convert to a reward coupon upon reaching a specified point threshold. Reward coupons can be redeemed for merchandise discounts and expire 60 days after issuance. Outstanding reward coupons and points earned through sale activity represent a performance obligation. Revenue is deferred in an amount equal to the standalone selling price, taking into account expected future redemptions, and recognized at the earlier of redemption or expiration. Judgment is used in determining the expected future redemption rates. The redemption and expiration of reward coupons are included in net sales. There are no material accounting policies related to the AnthroPerks customer loyalty program outside of our general revenue recognition practices.  Sales Return Reserve  We record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported. The reserve for estimated product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate is materially different than our estimate, sales returns would be adjusted in the future. Beginning February 1, 2018, with the adoption of the accounting standards update for revenue from contracts with customers, costs of returns are recorded as a current asset rather than net with the sales return reserve liability. As of January 31, 2020 and 2019, reserves for estimated sales returns totaled $51.4   million and $52.0 million, representing 2.8% and 7.7% of total liabilities, respectively.  Inventory  We value our inventory, which consists primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method and includes the cost of merchandise and import-related costs, including freight, import duties and taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Factors we consider in our review, such as future expected consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts and class or type of inventory, are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value. Criteria that we consider in our review of aging trends include average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the prior 12 months and the value and nature of merchandise currently held in inventory and priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventory to its estimated net realizable value, if appropriate. Any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results. Our estimates generally have been accurate, and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expect the amount of our provision and related inventory to increase over time as we increase our sales. The majority of inventory at January 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of finished goods. Raw materials and work-in-process were not material to the overall inventory value. Inventory as of January 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $409.5   million and $370.5 million, representing 12.4% and 17.1% of total assets, respectively.  22      Rental Product  The cost of our Subscription segment rental product is amortized to cost of sales based on the cost of each unit rented, which is estimated based on the number of times the unit is expected to be rented and the cost of the rental product. Lost, damaged and retired rental product is also charged to cost of sales. We make assumptions as to the number of times each unit can be rented. If the actual number of times a unit can be rented were to vary significantly from our estimates, it could materially affect the amount of rental product amortization included in cost of sales. Rental product represented less than 1.0% of total assets at January 31, 2020.  Impairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible Assets  We review the carrying values of our definite-lived, long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include plans to close a retail location, distribution or fulfillment center or a significant decrease in the operating results of a long-lived asset. Our retail locations are reviewed for impairment at the retail location level, which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. Newly opened retail locations may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free-standing), location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), current marketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a retail location to achieve positive financial results. When events indicate that an asset may be impaired and the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the impaired asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded. Goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. We evaluate goodwill annually, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may exceed the fair value of the reporting unit. In assessing an asset for potential impairment, we make estimates regarding future operating results, cash flows and estimated useful life. We have not made any material changes in the methodology to assess and calculate impairment of long-lived assets in the past three fiscal years. During fiscal 2020, we recorded impairment charges for eight retail locations, totaling $14.6 million, with a carrying value after impairment of $51.9 million primarily related to the right-of-use assets. During fiscal 2019, we recorded impairment charges for four   retail locations, totaling $3.5   million. During fiscal 2018, we recorded impairment charges for ten retail locations, totaling $11.4 million. During our assessment of current and future performance, it was determined that these retail locations would not be able to generate sufficient cash flow over the expected remaining lease term to recover the remaining carrying value of the respective retail location assets. During fiscal 2020, we  evaluated the fair value of the Menus & Venues division as compared to the carrying value and determined that the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit is impaired in full, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $13.9 million.  Leases  On February 1, 2019, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) accounting standards update that amended the existing accounting standards for lease accounting. This update requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for both operating and finance leases. We adopted the new guidance using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the period of adoption. See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of the adoption.  We have operating leases for stores, distribution and fulfillment centers, corporate offices and equipment. We sublease certain properties to third parties. We have elected not to record a lease liability and right-of-use asset for leases with original terms of 12 months or less. We have elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components as it pertains to real estate leases.  Store leases have remaining lease terms that range from less than one year up to 15 years, some of which contain options to extend the lease for one or two 5-year periods. Payments related to a renewal period are included in the lease liability and right-of-use asset only when we are reasonably certain that we will exercise the option to renew the lease for an extended period of time. Certain leases may contain variable lease payments such as rent based on a percentage of net sales. Variable lease payments may be subject to a breakpoint threshold of fixed rent. Variable lease payments, other than those that depend on an index or a rate, are not included in the measurement of the lease liability. The lease liability is calculated at the present value of certain future payments, discounted using our incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate of interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a fully collateralized basis over a similar term. Significant judgment is used in determining the incremental borrowing rate related to estimates for credit rating, credit spread and the impact of collateral. We developed incremental borrowing rates at a lease portfolio level. The right-of-use asset is initially equal to the value of the lease liability less any amounts received from the landlord as incentives or tenant improvement allowances.  Accounting for Income Taxes  As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all material available   23      positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Net deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019 totaled $51.1   million and $52.9 million, respectively, representing 1. 5 % and  2.4%  of total assets, respectively.  To the extent we believe that recovery of a deferred tax asset is at risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we record additional income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Valuation allowances were $13.5   million as of January 31, 2020 and $3.9 million as of January 31, 2019. Valuation allowances are based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in certain foreign and state jurisdictions. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in “Income tax expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate.  We record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.  Our tax liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ, and we may be exposed to income tax expenses or benefits that could be material.  We consider certain earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future United States cash generation will be sufficient to meet future United States cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiaries’ earnings. Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the United States.  The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB No. 118”), which allowed registrants to record provisional estimates for the Tax Act during a measurement period not to exceed one year from its enactment date, December 22, 2017. While management has completed its analysis within the applicable measurement period, pursuant to SAB No. 118, we are accounting for the income tax impacts of the provisions of U.S. tax reform based on the interpretation of existing statutory law, including guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS. During the second half of fiscal 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS issued certain proposed regulations addressing new provisions such as Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax, Foreign Tax Credit and the Anti-hybrid Regulations. The Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.  See Note 10, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of provisional amounts recorded related to the Tax Act in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.  Accounting for Contingencies  From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We are required to record a reserve for estimated losses when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting for contingencies arising from contractual disputes or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our reserves for loss contingencies could fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds our reserve could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known. We believe that our reserves adequately reflect the anticipated final outcome of any matter currently pending against us and the ultimate settlement of such matters will not materially affect our financial position or results of operations.  Share-Based Compensation  Accounting for share-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all share-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period.  24      A  Black-Scholes model  was used  to determine the fair value of our stock options  granted in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019 .  A Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine the fair value of our stock options granted in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018.  A different model was used to value fiscal 20 20  and 20 19  grants due to changes in grant provisions .  Both  model s  use assumptions including the risk-free rate of interest, expected volatility of our stock price and expected life of the awards.  The fair value of the performance-based awards granted during fiscal 2020 equaled the stock price on the date of the grant.  A Monte Carlo simulation  was  used to determine the fair value of performance-based awards  granted during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 .  A different methodology was used to value fiscal 2020 grants due to the removal of  certain  conditions in the grant provisions.   We review our assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third-party valuation advisors in order to determine the fair value of share-based compensation awards at the date of grant. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these share-based payment awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.  Additionally, we make certain estimates about the number of awards that will become vested under performance-based incentive plans. We record expense for performance-based awards based on our current expectations of the probable number of awards that will ultimately vest. The estimation of awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised and could be materially different from share-based compensation expense recorded in prior periods.  Beginning in fiscal 2018, we elected to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than estimate the expected forfeitures.  Results of Operations  As a Percentage of Net Sales  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows:                 Fiscal Year Ended  January 31,                 2020           2019           2018         Net sales           100.0   %           100.0   %           100.0   %     Cost of sales (excluding store impairment)           68.5               65.8               67.2         Store impairment (1)           0.4               0.1               0.3         Gross profit           31.1               34.1               32.5         Selling, general and administrative expenses           25.0               24.4               25.3         Goodwill impairment (2)           0.3               —               —         Income from operations           5.8               9.7               7.2         Interest income           0.3               0.2               0.1         Other income           —               —               —         Other expenses           (0.1   )           (0.1   )           (0.1   )     Income before income taxes           6.0               9.8               7.2         Income tax expense (3)           1.8               2.3               4.2         Net income           4.2   %           7.5   %           3.0   %     Period over Period Change:                                                     Net sales           0.8   %           9.3   %           2.0   %     Gross profit           -7.9   %           14.6   %           -5.6   %     Income from operations           -39.2   %           46.7   %           -23.2   %     Net income           -43.6   %           175.3   %           -50.4   %           (1)   During fiscal 2020, we recorded store impairment charges for eight retail locations, totaling $14.6 million. During fiscal 2019, we recorded store impairment charges for four retail locations, totaling $3.5 million. During fiscal 2018, we recorded store impairment charges for ten retail locations, totaling $11.4 million.      (2)   During fiscal 2020, we recorded a charge of $13.9 million related to goodwill impairment of the Menus & Venues division.       (3)   During fiscal 2018, we recorded an additional $64.7 million in income tax expense related to a one-time charge on foreign earnings and profits and statutory rate changes on deferred taxes in relation to the Tax Act. During fiscal 2019, we recorded an additional $1.2 million in income tax expense to adjust our initial provisional estimates for the Tax Act in our provision for income taxes.     Fiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019  Net sales in fiscal 2020 increased by 0.8% to $3.98 billion, from $3.95 billion in fiscal 2019. The $33.2   million increase was attributable to a $44.8   million, or 1.2%,   increase in Retail segment net sales and $8.0 million in Subscription segment net sales, partially   25      offset by a $19.6   million, or 5.7%, decrease in Wholesale segment net sales. Retail segment net sales for fiscal 2020 accounted for 91.6% of total net sales compared to 91.2% of total net sales during fiscal 2019.  The growth in our Retail segment net sales during fiscal 2020 was due to an increase of $41.5   million, or 1.2%, in Retail segment comparable net sales, which includes our digital channel, and an increase of $3.3   million in non-comparable net sales, including new store and franchise net sales partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Retail segment comparable net sales increased 6.6%   at Free People and 2.2%   at the Anthropologie Group and decreased by 1.4%   at Urban Outfitters. Retail segment comparable net sales increased in North America but declined in Europe. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by continued growth in the digital channel, partially offset by negative comparable store net sales. The digital channel net sales increase was driven by increases in sessions and conversion rate, while average order value and units per transaction decreased. Negative comparable store net sales resulted from a decrease in average unit selling price and transactions, partially offset by an increase in units per transaction. Store traffic for fiscal 2020 decreased. The increase in net sales attributable to non-comparable sales was primarily due to the net impact of opening 44   new stores and restaurants and closing 23   stores and restaurants since the prior comparable period and an increase in franchise net sales due to the opening of two franchisee-owned stores during fiscal 2020 and the impact of full year operations of franchisee-owned stores opened during fiscal 2019, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation.  The decrease in Wholesale segment net sales during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, was due to a decrease of 7.7% for the Free People brand, primarily resulting from lower sales to North American department stores. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $3.8 million in Urban Outfitters BDG sales and $2.6 million in Anthropologie Home sales. The Urban Outfitters wholesale division was launched in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.  Gross profit percentage in fiscal 2020 decreased to 31.1% of net sales, from 34.1% of net sales in fiscal 2019. Gross profit decreased to $1.24 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $1.35 billion in fiscal 2019. The decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily driven by higher Retail segment markdowns and deleverage in delivery and logistics expenses. The higher Retail segment markdowns were largely driven by underperforming product at the Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie brands. The deleverage in delivery and logistics expenses was primarily due to the increase in penetration of the digital channel. Additionally, store impairment charges were $14.6 million in fiscal 2020 related to eight retail locations and $3.5 million in fiscal 2019 related to four retail locations.  Total inventory at January 31, 2020 increased by $39.0 million, or 10.5%,   to $409.5   million from $370.5 million at January 31, 2019. Comparable Retail segment inventory was flat at cost. The total inventory increase was primarily related to an increase in Wholesale segment inventory.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $28.6 million, or 3.0%,   to $994.0   million, in fiscal 2020, from $965.4 million in fiscal 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in fiscal 2020 to 25.0%   of net sales, compared to 24.4% of net sales for fiscal 2019. The dollar growth and deleverage in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by increased marketing expenses supporting our digital sales growth and new business initiatives.  During fiscal 2020, we recorded a charge of approximately $13.9 million related to goodwill impairment of the Menus & Venues division.  Income from operations decreased to 5.8%   of net sales, or $231.9   million, for fiscal 2020 compared to 9.7%, or $381.3 million, for fiscal 2019.  Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 29.9%   of income before income taxes compared to 22.7% of income before income taxes in fiscal 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the ratio of foreign taxable profits to global taxable profits and an increase in valuation allowances attributable to net losses of certain foreign operations. See Note 10, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate.     Fiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018  Net sales in fiscal 2019 increased by 9.3% to $3.95 billion, from $3.62 billion in fiscal 2018. The $334.6   million increase was attributable to a $304.5   million, or 9.2%,   increase in Retail segment net sales and a $30.1   million, or 9.5%, increase in Wholesale segment net sales. Retail segment net sales for fiscal 2019 accounted for 91.2% of total net sales compared to 91.3% of total net sales during fiscal 2018.  The growth in our Retail segment net sales during fiscal 2019 was due to an increase of $256.1   million, or 8.2%, in Retail segment comparable net sales, which includes our digital channel, and an increase of $48.4   million in non-comparable net sales, including new store and franchise net sales. Retail segment comparable net sales increased 11.4%   at Free People, 8.0%   at Urban Outfitters and 7.5%   at the Anthropologie Group. Retail segment comparable net sales increased in both North America and Europe. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by continued growth in the digital channel and positive comparable store net sales. The digital channel net sales increase was driven by increases in average order value, sessions and conversion rate, while units per transaction was flat. Positive comparable store net sales resulted from an increase in average unit selling price, partially offset by decreases in   26      transactions ,  units per transaction  and   s tore traffic .  The  increase in net sales attributable to non-comparable sales was  primarily due to the net impact of opening  36   new stores and restaurants and closing  22   stores and restaurants since the prior comparable period .  The increase in Wholesale segment net sales during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, was due to an increase of 6.8% for the Free People brand, primarily resulting from an increase in domestic sales to department stores, specialty stores and digital businesses due to growth in several categories, including women’s apparel, intimates and FP Movement activewear. The segment increase was also due to the launch of the Anthropologie home goods wholesale business in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and the launch of the Urban Outfitters BDG apparel collection wholesale business in fiscal 2019.  Gross profit percentage in fiscal 2019 increased to 34.1% of net sales, from 32.5% of net sales in fiscal 2018. Gross profit increased to $1.35 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $1.18 billion in fiscal 2018. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily driven by lower markdowns at all three brands, leverage in store occupancy cost due to increases in Retail segment comparable net sales and a lower level of impairment costs.  Total inventory at January 31, 2019 increased by $19.1 million, or 5.4%,   to $370.5   million from $351.4 million at January 31, 2018. Comparable Retail segment inventory increased 2.7% at cost.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $49.8 million, or 5.4%,   to $965.4   million, in fiscal 2019, from $915.6 million in fiscal 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased in fiscal 2019 to 24.4%   of net sales, compared to 25.3% of net sales for fiscal 2018. The dollar growth in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased direct selling and marketing expenses to support and drive the increase in Retail segment net sales and higher bonus and share-based compensation expense. The leverage for the year ended January 31, 2019 was primarily driven by the net sales growth and further benefited from continued savings associated with the fiscal 2018 store reorganization project and the nonrecurring store reorganization expenses incurred in fiscal 2018.  Income from operations increased to 9.7%   of net sales, or $381.3   million, for fiscal 2019 compared to 7.2%, or $259.9 million, for fiscal 2018.  Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 22.7%   of income before income taxes compared to 58.6% of income before income taxes in fiscal 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a one-time expense related to the Tax Act in fiscal 2018 of $64.7 million, which was nonrecurring, and the decrease in federal corporate income tax rate enacted as part of the Tax Act. See Note 10, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $530.4 million as of January 31, 2020, as compared to $694.8 million as of January 31, 2019 and $506.0 million as of January 31, 2018. During fiscal 2020, we generated $273.9 million in cash from operations, invested $217.4 million in property and equipment and repurchased $217.4 million in common shares under our share repurchase programs. Our working capital was $414.6 million at January 31, 2020 compared to $816.1 million at January 31, 2019 and $618.5 million at January 31, 2018. Working capital as of January 31, 2020 was negatively impacted by $221.6 million for the current portion of operating lease liabilities due to the February 1, 2019 adoption of an accounting standards update that amended the accounting standards for lease accounting (see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion). Working capital was also negatively impacted by the use of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities used to repurchase our common shares and fund our capital projects.  During the last three years, we have satisfied our cash requirements primarily through our cash flow from operating activities. Our primary uses of cash have been to repurchase our common shares, open new stores, purchase inventory, fund store operations and expand our home offices and fulfillment centers.  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 decreased by $172.7 million to $273.9 million from $446.6 million in fiscal 2019. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 increased by $143.5 million from $303.1 million in fiscal 2018. For all periods, our major source of cash from operations was merchandise sales and our primary outflow of cash for operations was for the payment of operational costs. The decrease in cash flows from operations in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower net income.  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2020 decreased by $58.4   million to $186.1   million from $244.5   million in fiscal 2019. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2019 increased by $123.1 million from $121.4 million in fiscal 2018. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 and 2019 primarily related to purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment, partially offset by the sales and maturities of marketable securities. Cash paid for property and equipment for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was   27      $ 217 . 4  million,  $ 114.9  million and $ 83.8  million, respectively , which  was primarily  used  to  construct new fulfillment and distribution centers  in fiscal 2020 and  expand our store base  in fiscal 2019 and 2018 .  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2020 increased by $104.0   million to $222.0   million from $118.0 million in fiscal 2019. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2019 decreased by $41.2 million from $159.2 million in fiscal 2018. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was primarily related to $217.4 million, $121.4 million and $157.0 million, respectively, of repurchases of our common shares under our share repurchase programs.  Credit Facilities  On June 29, 2018, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”) that amended our asset-based revolving credit facility with certain lenders, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as joint lead arrangers and co-book managers.  The Amended Credit Agreement extended the maturity date of the senior secured revolving credit facility to June 2023 (the “Amended Credit Facility”). The Amended Credit Facility provides for loans and letters of credit up to $350.0 million, subject to a borrowing base that is comprised of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory. The Amended Credit Facility includes a swing-line sub-facility, a multicurrency sub-facility and the option to expand the facility by up to $150.0 million. The funds available under the Amended Credit Facility may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.  The Amended Credit Facility provides for interest on borrowings, at our option, at either (i) adjusted LIBOR, CDOR or EURIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.125% to 1.375%, or (ii) an adjusted ABR plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.125% to 0.375%, each such applicable margin depending on the level of availability under the Amended Credit Facility. Currently, there has not been a replacement reference rate identified for LIBOR in the Amended Credit Facility. Depending on the type of borrowing, interest on the Amended Credit Agreement is payable monthly, quarterly or at the end of the interest period. A commitment fee of 0.20% is payable quarterly on the unused portion of the Amended Credit Facility.  All obligations under the Amended Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries. The obligations under the Amended Credit Facility are secured by a first-priority security interest in inventory, accounts receivable and certain other assets of the Company and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries. The obligations of URBN Canada Retail, Inc. are secured by a first-priority security interest in its inventory, accounts receivable and certain other assets. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, negative and affirmative covenants and provisions relating to events of default.  As of January 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all terms of the Amended Credit Agreement and there were no borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility. Outstanding stand-by letters of credit, which reduce the funds available under the Amended Credit Facility, were $14.1 million at January 31, 2020.  Additionally, we have borrowing agreements with two separate financial institutions under which we may borrow an aggregate of $130.0 million for the purposes of trade letter of credit issuances. The availability of any future borrowings under the trade letter of credit facilities is subject to acceptance by the respective financial institutions. As of January 31, 2020, we had $62.2 million in outstanding trade letters of credit, and $67.8 million available for future trade letters of credit under these facilities.  On March 16, 2020, we borrowed $220.0 million under the Amended Credit Facility in order to preserve financial flexibility and maintain liquidity and flexibility in response to the COVID-19 outbreak that caused public health officials to recommend precautions that would mitigate the spread of the virus, including warning against congregating in heavily populated areas such as malls and shopping centers, and led to the temporary closure of all of our stores globally. We intend to use the proceeds in the future for working capital, capital expenditure, general corporate or other purposes. We expect to remain in compliance with all terms, including financial covenants, of the Amended Credit Agreement.  Outlook  The outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow both in the United States and globally, and related government and private sector responsive actions have and will continue to adversely affect our business operations. It is impossible to predict the effect and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as the situation is rapidly evolving.  The spread of COVID-19 has caused public health officials to recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including warning against congregating in heavily populated areas, such as malls and shopping centers. On March 14, 2020, we announced that we temporarily closed all stores globally and have since extended the temporary closures until further notice. There is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of these store closures and other business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the U.S. and global economy, consumer willingness to visit malls and shopping centers, and employee willingness to staff our stores once they re-open. While our distribution and fulfillment centers currently remain open, there is risk that any of these facilities: 1) may become less productive or encounter disruptions due to employees at the facilities becoming infected with the virus or employees choosing to not work at the facilities; and/or 2) are no longer allowed to operate based on directives from public health officials or government authorities. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly   28      uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information  that   may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact.  I n our offices globally, we have asked our corporate employees whose jobs allow them to work remotely to do so for the foreseeable future. Such precautionary measures could create operational challenges as we adjust to a remote workforce, which could adversely impact our business.   Additionally, to the extent COVID-19 adversely impacts the operations of our Wholesale segment customers, it could negatively impact our sales and collection of accounts receivables from such customers.   On March 31, 2020, we announced we are furloughing a substantial   number of store, wholesale and home office employees for 60 days beginning April 1, 2020. We also announced taking many additional measures to protect our financial position and increase financial flexibility.  Capital and Operating Expenditures  During fiscal 2021, we plan to construct a new omni-channel fulfillment center, open approximately 38   new Company-owned retail locations, expand or relocate certain existing retail locations, invest in new products, markets and brands (including the continued investment in the apparel subscription rental service Nuuly), purchase inventory for our operating segments at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales, upgrade our systems, improve and expand our digital capabilities and invest in omni-channel marketing. We believe that our new brand initiatives, new store openings, merchandise expansion programs, international growth opportunities and our marketing, social media, website and mobile initiatives are significant contributors to our Retail segment sales. During fiscal 2021, we plan to continue our investment in these initiatives for all brands. We anticipate our capital expenditures during fiscal 2021 to be approximately $140 million, a significant portion of which will be to support a new omni-channel fulfillment center in Europe. All fiscal 2021 capital expenditures are expected to be financed by cash flow from operating activities and borrowings. We believe that our new store investments have the potential to generate positive cash flow within a year. We may also enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of our brand offerings, including additional franchise and joint venture agreements. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, availability under our current credit facilities and future cash flows provided by operations will be sufficient to fund these initiatives.  Share Repurchases  See Note 12, “Shareholders’ Equity,” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for certain financial information regarding the Company’s share repurchases.  Contractual Obligations  The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 31, 2020:                                 Payments Due by Period (in thousands)         Description       Total  Obligations           Less Than  One  Year           One to  Three  Years           Three to  Five  Years           More Than  Five  Years         Operating leases (1)       $   1,843,018           $   311,034           $   525,311           $   388,244           $   618,429         Purchase commitments (2)           543,703               533,675               9,353               540               135         Tax payable (3)           29,852               2,843               5,686               12,438               8,885         Construction contracts (4)           52,493               42,382               10,111               —               —         Total contractual obligations       $   2,469,066           $   889,934           $   550,461           $   401,222           $   627,449               (1)   Includes store operating leases, which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts shown above only reflect our future minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are 43 locations where a percentage of sales are paid, in lieu of a fixed minimum rent, that are not reflected in the above table. Total rent expense related to these 43 locations was approximately $4,157 for fiscal 2020. It is common for the lease agreements for our European locations to allow for the landlord to adjust the minimum rental due to the current market rates multiple times during the lease term. The table above includes our current contractual payments for these locations. Amounts noted above include commitments of approximately $52,219 related to seven executed but not yet commenced store leases as of January 31, 2020.      (2)   Includes merchandise commitments, which are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until the merchandise shipping date, as well as commitments for products and services, including information technology contracts used in the normal course of business.      ( 3 )   Represents one-time transition tax payable related to cash taxes payable in future years as a result of the Tax Act. For further information, refer to Note 10, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Excluded from the above table are tax contingencies of $23,825   because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled. As a result, the $23,825 liability was classified as a non-current liability in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2020.      ( 4 )   Includes construction and distribution equipment contracts that are fully satisfied upon the completion of construction or installation, which is primarily within 12 months. Construction and distribution equipment contracts include $50,203 related to the omni-channel fulfillment center in Peterborough, England.  29      Commercial Commitments  The following table summarizes our commercial commitments as of January 31, 2020:                                 Amount of Commitment Per Period  (in thousands)         Description       Total  Amounts  Committed           Less  Than  One  Year           One  to  Three  Years           Three  to  Five  Years           More  Than  Five  Years         Trade letters of credit (1)       $   62,155           $   62,155           $   —           $   —           $   —         Stand-by letters of credit (2)           14,071               14,071               —               —               —         Total commercial commitments       $   76,226           $   76,226           $   —           $   —           $   —               (1)   Consists primarily of outstanding letter of credit commitments in connection with import inventory purchases.      (2)   Consists primarily of stand-by letters of credit for customs, construction and insurance.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of and for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2020, we were not party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.  Other Matters  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies —Recent Accounting Pronouncements ,” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements.  Seasonality and Quarterly Results  Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations in net sales and net income, with a more significant portion typically realized in the second half of each year predominantly due to the year-end holiday period. Historically, and consistent with the retail industry, the seasonality also impacts our working capital requirements, particularly with regard to inventory. The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of such net sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The unaudited financial information has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.                 Fiscal 2020 Quarter Ended (1)                 April 30,  2019           July 31,  2019           Oct. 31,  2019           Jan. 31,  2020                 (dollars in thousands, except per share data)         Net sales       $   864,413           $   962,329           $   987,469           $   1,169,578         Gross profit (2)           269,056               315,875               321,102               333,793         Net income (3)           32,585               60,320               55,652               19,539         Net income per common share—basic           0.31               0.61               0.57               0.20         Net income per common share—diluted           0.31               0.61               0.56               0.20         As a Percentage of Fiscal Year:                                                                     Net sales           22   %           24   %           25   %           29   %     Net income           19   %           36   %           33   %           12   %       30                  Fiscal 2019 Quarter Ended (1)                 April 30,  2018           July 31,  2018           Oct. 31,  2018           Jan. 31,  2019                 (dollars in thousands, except per share data)         Net sales       $   855,688           $   992,454           $   973,533           $   1,128,948         Gross profit (4)           280,660               355,844               337,698               372,510         Net income (5)           41,260               92,809               77,520               86,414         Net income per common share—basic           0.38               0.85               0.71               0.81         Net income per common share—diluted           0.38               0.84               0.70               0.80         As a Percentage of Fiscal Year:                                                                     Net sales           22   %           25   %           24   %           29   %     Net income           14   %           31   %           26   %           29   %           (1 )   The sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal per share amounts reported for year-to-date periods due to changes in the number of weighted-average shares outstanding and the effects of rounding for each period.

(3)   Included in net income for the quarter ended January 31, 2020 were $14,611 of impairment charges related to eight retail locations, a charge of $13,911 related to goodwill impairment of the Menus & Venues division, ($6,799) of the income tax impact of the impairment charges and $7,809 in income tax expense related to valuation allowances attributable to net losses of certain foreign operations.      ( 4 )   Included in gross profit for the quarter ended January 31, 2019 were $3,544 of impairment charges related to four retail locations.      ( 5 )   Included in net income for the quarter ended January 31, 2019 were $3,544 of impairment charges related to four retail locations, ($920) of the income tax impact of the impairment charges and an additional $1,197 in income tax expense to adjust the initial provisional estimates for the Tax Act in the provision for income taxes.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  We are exposed to the following types of market risks—fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services, the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar and changes in interest rates. Due to our inventory turnover rate and our historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in our cost of goods to our customers through pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. We purchase the majority of our merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a majority of the goods for our stores located in Canada and a portion of the goods for our stores located in Europe.  Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currencies is due to our financial statements being presented in U.S. dollars and our international subsidiaries transacting in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates in effect during or at the end of the reporting period may affect the value of the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. As we expand our international operations, the potential impact of currency fluctuations increases.  Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the Credit Facility. As of January 31, 2020 and 2019, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of cash on hand and in banks, money market accounts, municipal and pre-refunded municipal bonds rated “BBB” or better, corporate bonds rated “BBB” or better, certificates of deposit and mutual funds. Due to the short average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, we believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows, but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments.  We are exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates on outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility because these borrowings bear interest at variable rates. A 100 basis point change in our applicable interest rate would not have a material impact to interest expense for the year ended January 31, 2020.  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
