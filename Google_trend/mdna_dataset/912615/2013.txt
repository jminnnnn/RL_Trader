Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations    Overview    We operate two business segments: a leading lifestyle specialty Retail segment and a Wholesale apparel segment. Our Retail segment consists of our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Free People, Terrain andBHLDN brands, whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through retail stores, websites, mobile applications, catalogs and customer contact centers. Our Wholesale apparel segment consists of the Free People wholesale division that,primarily, designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel.    Our comparable Retail segment netsales data is equal to the sum of our comparable store plus comparable direct-to-consumer channels. A store is considered to be comparable if it has been open at least one full fiscal year, unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within thatyear or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year. A direct-to-consumer channel is considered to be comparable if it has been operational for at least one full fiscal year. There is no overlap between comparable store netsales and comparable direct-to-consumer net sales. Sales from stores and direct-to-consumer channels that do not fall within the definition of comparable store or channel are considered to be non-comparable. The effects of foreign currencytranslation are also considered non-comparable.    Although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer trafficor customer conversion rates in our stores, we believe that, based only on our observations, changes in transaction volume in our stores, as discussed in our results of operations, may correlate to changes in customer traffic. We are able to monitorcustomer visits, average order value and conversion rate on our websites. We believe that changes in any of these metrics may be caused by a response to our brands fashion offerings, our marketing campaigns, circulation of our catalogs and anoverall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base.    Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references inthis discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2013 ended on January 31, 2013.    Our omni-channel strategy allows customers to experience our brands, rather than a channel within the brand, by providing a seamless approach to the customer shopping experience. We try to deliver thebest customer experience possible through an integration of all available shopping channels including stores, websites and catalogs (online and through mobile devices). Store sales are primarily fulfilled from that stores inventory, but mayalso be shipped from any of our fulfillment centers or from a different store location if an item is out-of-stock at the original store. Direct-to-consumer orders are primarily shipped to our customers through our fulfillment centers but may also beshipped from any store or a combination of fulfillment center and store depending on the availability of a particular item. These capabilities allow us to better serve customers and helps us to fill orders that otherwise may have been cancelled dueto out-of-stock positions.    Retail Store    As of January 31, 2013, we operated 215 Urban Outfitters stores of which 167 were located in the United States, 13 were located in Canada and 35 were located in Europe. During fiscal 2013, we      24     opened 18 new Urban Outfitters stores, of which 10 were located in the United States, three were located in Canada and five were located in Europe. Urban Outfitters targets young adults aged 18to 28 through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. Urban Outfitters product offering includes womens and mens fashion apparel, footwear and accessories, as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts.We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Urban Outfitters North American and European store sales accounted for approximately 29.8% and 6.6% of consolidated net sales,respectively, for fiscal 2013.    As of January 31, 2013, we operated 180 Anthropologie stores, of which 169 were locatedin the United States, eight were located in Canada and three were located in Europe. During fiscal 2013, we opened 14 new Anthropologie stores, of which 11 were located in the United States and three were located in Canada. During fiscal 2013, weclosed two Anthropologie stores. Anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged 28 to 45. Anthropologies product assortment includes womens casual apparel and accessories, shoes, home furnishings and adiverse array of gifts and decorative items. We plan to open additional stores over the next several years, some of which may be outside the United States. Anthropologies North American and European store sales accounted for approximately29.7% and 0.8% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2013.    As of January 31, 2013, we operated 77 FreePeople stores, of which 75 were located in the United States and two were located in Canada. During fiscal 2013 we opened 15 new Free People stores, of which 13 were located in the United States and two were located in Canada. Free People primarilyoffers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged 25 to 30. Free People provides a unique merchandise mix of casual womens apparel, intimates, shoes, accessories and gifts. We plan to open additional storesover the next several years some of which may be outside the United States. Free Peoples store sales accounted for approximately 3.3% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2013.   As of January 31, 2013, we operated two Terrain garden centers, one of which opened during fiscal 2013. Terrain is designed toappeal to women and men interested in a creative, sophisticated outdoor living and gardening experience. Terrain creates a compelling shopping environment through its large and freestanding sites, inspired by the greenhouse. Merchandiseincludes lifestyle home and garden products combined with antiques, live plants, flowers, wellness products and accessories. Both Terrain locations offer a full-service restaurant and coffee bar. Terrain also offers a variety of landscape anddesign services. Terrain garden center sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2013.    As ofJanuary 31, 2013, we operated two BHLDN stores, one of which opened during fiscal 2013. BHLDN offers a curated collection of heirloom quality wedding gowns, bridesmaid frocks, party dresses, assorted jewelry, headpieces, footwear, lingerie anddecorations. BHLDN store sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2013.    For all brandscombined, we plan to open approximately 35-40 new stores during fiscal 2014, including 15 Urban Outfitters stores, 12 Anthropologie stores and 10 Free People stores.    Direct-to-Consumer    We operate a direct-to-consumer channel that generatessales by accepting orders directly through our websites, online and via mobile devices, and catalogs. Our direct-to-consumer channel offers       25     customers a globally accessible extension of each brands store experience. We also believe that our direct-to-consumer channel increases the reputation and recognition of our brands with ourtarget customers and offers the customers a globally accessible and differentiated shopping experience. Direct-to-consumer net sales as a percentage of consolidated net sales increased 3.3% to approximately 23.7% of consolidated net sales in fiscal2013, from 20.4% in fiscal 2012.    We believe that our web marketing, social media, merchandise expansion and website andmobile initiatives are a significant contributor to our direct-to-consumer sales growth. For fiscal 2014 we plan to continue to increase our investment in these initiatives for all of our brands.   During fiscal 2013 we circulated approximately 41.9 million catalogs across all brands. Our catalog circulation levels are driven byour evaluation of the response to each individual catalog and the impact that our investment in web marketing has on the direct-to-consumer channel. Based upon that evaluation, we adjust the frequency and circulation of our catalog portfolio asneeded. In addition, we evaluate the buying pattern of our direct-to-consumer customers to determine which customers respond to our catalog mailings. Accordingly, we plan to decrease our catalog circulation to approximately 30 million catalogsacross all brands in fiscal 2014.   Anthropologie.  Anthropologie operates a website in the United States and awebsite in Europe that capture the spirit of the brand by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in our stores. Anthropologie also offers a direct-to-consumer catalog in the United States and in Europe that markets selectmerchandise, most of which is also available in our Anthropologie stores.    Urban Outfitters.  Urban Outfittersoperates a website in the United States and three websites in Europe that capture the spirit of the brand by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in our stores. Urban Outfitters offers a direct-to-consumer catalog in theUnited States and in Europe offering select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Urban Outfitters stores.   Free People.  Free People operates two websites that offer our domestic and European consumers a similar yet broaderselection of merchandise as found in our stores, as well as all of the Free People wholesale offerings. Free People also offers a direct-to-consumer catalog offering select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Free People stores.   Terrain.  Terrain operates a website that offers our consumers a portion of the product assortment found at theTerrain garden centers.    BHLDN.  Since February 2011, BHLDN has operated a website that offers our consumers toall product offerings of the BHLDN brand.    Wholesale   The Free People wholesale division designs, develops and markets young womens contemporary casual apparel. During fiscal 2013, FreePeoples range of tops, bottoms, sweaters and dresses were sold worldwide through approximately 1,400 better department and specialty stores, including Macys, Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, Lord & Taylor and our own Free Peoplestores. Free People wholesale sales accounted for approximately 5.3% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2013.       26     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.These generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financialstatements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period.    Our senior management has reviewedthe critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe thatthe following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and cash flows and require managements most difficult, subjective and complexjudgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. We are notcurrently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates.    Revenue Recognition    Revenue is recognized at the point-of-sale for retailstore sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct-to-consumer sales, net of estimated customer returns. Revenue is recognized at the completion of a job or service for landscape sales. Revenue is presented on a netbasis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental or municipal authority. Payment for merchandise at our stores and through our direct-to-consumer channel is tendered by cash, check, credit card, debit card or gift card. Therefore, ourneed to collect outstanding accounts receivable for our Retail segment is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card transactions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our wholesale and landscapeservice accounts receivable, which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments. Deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upondelivery of the merchandise to the customer. These custom orders, typically for upholstered furniture, are not material. Deposits for landscape services are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon completion of service. Landscapeservices and related deposits are not material.    We account for a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the timethe gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer. A liability is established and remains on our books until the card is redeemed by the customer, at which time we record the redemption of the card formerchandise as a sale, or when we determine the likelihood of redemption is remote. We determine the probability of the gift cards being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns. Revenues attributable to gift card liabilitiesrelieved after the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and are not material. Our gift cards do not expire.    Sales Return Reserve    We record a reserve for estimated product returnswhere the sale has occurred during the period reported, but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported. The reserve for estimated       27     product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends. If the actual return rate or experience is materially higher than our estimate, sales returns would be adjusted in thefuture. As of January 31, 2013 and 2012, reserves for estimated sales returns totaled $14.4 million and $11.0 million, representing 3.3% and 2.6% of total liabilities, respectively.   Marketable Securities    All of our marketable securities as of January 31, 2013 and 2012, are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost. Interest on these securities,as well as the amortization of discounts and premiums, is included in interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are considered temporary and therefore are excluded from earnings and arereported as a component of other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity until realized. Other than temporary impairment losses related tocredit losses are considered to be realized losses. When available-for-sale securities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically identified and is used to determine the realized gain or loss. Securities classified as current assets havematurity dates of less than one year from the balance sheet date. Securities classified as non-current assets have maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. Available-for-sale securities such as auction rate securities thatfail at auction and do not liquidate in the normal course are classified as non-current assets.    Inventories   We value our inventories, which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale, at the lower of cost ormarket. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method and includes the cost of merchandise and import related costs, including freight, import taxes and agent commissions. A periodic review of inventory is performed in order to determine ifinventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market. Factors related to current inventories such as future expected consumer demand and fashion trends, current aging, current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts and classor type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value. Criteria that we utilize to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise, the historical rate at which merchandisehas sold below cost during the average selling cycle and the value and nature of merchandise currently priced below original cost. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values, if appropriate. Themajority of inventory at January 31, 2013 and 2012 consisted of finished goods. Unfinished goods and work-in-process were not material to the overall net inventory value. Net inventories as of January 31, 2013 and January 31, 2012totaled $282.4 million and $250.1 million, representing 15.7% and 16.9% of total assets, respectively. Any significant unanticipated changes in the risk factors noted within this report could have a significant impact on the value of ourinventories and our reported operating results.    Adjustments to provisions related to the net realizable value of ourinventories are primarily based on the market value of our annual physical inventories, cycle counts and recent historical trends. Our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis. We expectthe amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly, related inventories.       28     Long-Lived Assets   Our long-lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements, buildings and furniture and fixtures, and are included in theProperty and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report (Consolidated Balance Sheets). Store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight-linemethod over the lesser of the applicable store lease term, including lease renewals which are reasonably assured, or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. The typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years. Buildings arerecorded at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over 39 years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over their useful life, which is typically five years. Net property andequipment as of January 31, 2013 and January 31, 2012 totaled $733.4 million and $685.0 million, respectively, representing 40.8% and 46.2% of total assets, respectively.   In assessing potential impairment of these assets, we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows ona store-by-store basis. Newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results. Factors such as store type (e.g., mall versus free-standing), store location (e.g., urban area versus college campus or suburb), currentmarketplace awareness of our brands, local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results, which, in general, is assumed to be withinthree years from the date a store location has opened. If financial results are substantially different from our expectations, the carrying value of certain of our long-lived assets may become impaired. For fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, write-downs oflong-lived assets were not material.    We have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to ourlong-lived assets. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense asincurred. Major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement, whichever is less.   Accounting for Income Taxes    As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involvesestimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes, such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation ofinventories. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxableincome. Actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods. Net deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2013 and January 31, 2012 totaled $41.1 million and $63.9 million,respectively, representing 2.3% and 4.3% of total assets, respectively.    To the extent we believe that recovery of an asset isat risk, we establish valuation allowances. To the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period, we record additional income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Valuation allowances were $2.1million as of January 31, 2013 and $2.8 million as of January 31, 2012. Valuation allowances       29     are based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in certain foreign and state jurisdictions. In the future, if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficientfuture taxable income in these jurisdictions becomes apparent, we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. On a quarterly basis, managementevaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances, if appropriate.   Our tax liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment toestimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.   Accounting for Contingencies    From time to time, we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. We are required to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior toissuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting forcontingencies arising from contractual disputes or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies. As additional information becomes known, our accrual for a loss contingencycould fluctuate, thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period. Likewise, an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our financial statements could have amaterial adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known.    Share-BasedCompensation    Accounting for share-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all share-based awardsat fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures.    Weuse a Lattice Binomial pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights. This model uses assumptions including the risk free rate of interest, expected volatility of our stock price and expected life ofthe options. A Monte Carlo simulation, which utilizes similar assumptions, is used to determine the fair value of performance shares. We review our assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third-party valuation advisors in order todetermine the fair value of share-based compensation awards at the date of grant. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these share-based payment awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertaintiesand the application of judgment. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.    Additionally, wemake certain estimates about the number of awards which will be granted under performance based incentive plans. We record expense for performance based shares based on our current expectations of the probable number of shares that will ultimatelybe issued. The estimation of share-based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in theperiod estimates are revised and could be materially different from share-based compensation expense recorded in prior periods.       30     We are also required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate. We consider many factorswhen estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards and historical experience. We revise our forfeiture rates, when necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those originally estimated. As a result, if the actualforfeiture rate is different from the estimate at the completion of the vesting period, the share-based compensation expense may not be comparable to amounts recorded in prior periods.    Results of Operations    As a Percentage of Net Sales   The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement dataand the change in certain income statement data from period to period. This table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows:                              Fiscal Year Ended January 31,          2013        2012        2011        Net sales         100.0  %         100.0  %         100.0  %      Cost of sales         63.1            65.2            58.8                                                            Gross profit         36.9            34.8            41.2         Selling, general and administrative expenses         23.5            23.3            23.0                                                            Income from operations         13.4            11.5            18.2         Interest income         0.1            0.2            0.1         Other income                                             Other expenses         (0.1  )                                                                                   Income before income taxes         13.4            11.7            18.3         Income tax expense         4.9            4.2            6.3                                                            Net income         8.5  %         7.5  %         12.0  %                                                         Period over Period Change:                        Net sales         13.0  %         8.8  %         17.4  %      Gross profit         19.9  %         -8.1  %         19.1  %      Income from operations         31.5  %         -31.3  %         22.2  %      Net income         28.1  %         -32.1  %         24.1  %     Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012    Net sales in fiscal 2013 increased by 13.0% to $2.79 billion, from $2.47 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $321 million increase was attributable to a $305 million, or 13.1%, increase in Retailsegment net sales and a $16 million, or 11.8%, increase in our Wholesale segment net sales.    The growth in our Retail segmentnet sales during fiscal 2013 was driven by increases of $158 million in non-comparable and new store net sales and $158 million, or 31.4%, in total direct-to-consumer net sales. These increases were partially offset by an $11 million, or 0.6%,decrease in comparable store net sales. Our total company comparable Retail segment net sales increase of 6.9% was comprised of increases of 21.8%, 8.0% and 3.6% at Free People, Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie, respectively. The increase in netsales attributable to non-comparable and new stores       31     was primarily the result of opening 106 new stores in fiscal 2013 and 2012 that were not in operation for the full comparable periods. The comparable store net sales decrease for fiscal 2013 wasprimarily due to decreases in average units per transaction and average unit sales prices, partially offset by an increase in transactions. The direct-to-consumer net sales increase was driven by increased traffic to our web sites, which waspartially offset by a decline in average order value and conversion rate. Thus far during the first quarter of fiscal 2014, comparable Retail segment net sales are high single-digit positive.   The increase in our Wholesale segment net sales of $21 million, or 16.6%, was driven by an increase in transactions, which was partiallyoffset by a decline in average unit selling prices. The Free People wholesale net sales increase was partially offset by a $5 million decline in Leifsdottir net sales resulting from the discontinuation of wholesale distribution of the Leifsdottirbrand, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and was principally completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2012.    Gross profit rates in fiscal 2013 increased to 36.9% of net sales, or $1.03 billion, from 34.8% of net sales, or $861 million, in fiscal 2012. The increase in the rate was primarily due to a reduction inmerchandise markdowns. Total Company inventory increased 12.9% to $282 million from $250 million in the prior year. Comparable Retail segment inventory, which includes our comparable store and our comparable direct-to-consumer channels, grew5.7%, while comparable store inventories decreased 3.4%. The growth in total inventories is primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new and non-comparable stores and to support the significant growth in the direct-to-consumerchannel.    Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2013, increased to 23.5% ofnet sales versus 23.3% of net sales for fiscal 2012. This increase was primarily due to the deleveraging of direct store controllable expenses driven by the negative comparable store net sales. In fiscal 2013, selling, general andadministrative expenses increased by $81 million, or 14.1%, to $657 million, from $576 million in fiscal 2012. The dollar increase over the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non-comparable stores.   Income from operations increased to 13.4% of net sales, or $374 million, for fiscal 2013 compared to 11.5% of net sales, or $285 million,for fiscal 2012.    Our annual effective income tax rate for fiscal 2013 increased to 36.8% of income before income taxescompared to 35.9% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2012. The increase in the fiscal 2013 effective tax rate is partially due to certain nonrecurring state and foreign tax adjustments. See Note 8, Income Taxes, in the notes to ourconsolidated financial statements, for a reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate. We expect the tax rate for fiscal 2014 to be approximately 36.5%.   Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011    Net sales in fiscal 2012 increased by 8.8% to $2.47 billion, from $2.27 billion in the prior fiscal year. The $200 million increase was attributable to a $187 million, or 8.7% increase, in Retail segmentnet sales and a $13 million, or 10.6%, increase in our Wholesale segment net sales. The growth in our Retail segment net sales during fiscal 2012 was driven by increases of $175 million in non-comparable and new store net sales and $71 million, or16.4%, in direct-to-consumer net sales. A decrease of       32     $59 million, or 3.8%, in comparable store net sales was a partial offset. The net increase in comparable Retail segment net sales was comprised of increases of 17.0% and 1.4% at Free Peopleand Urban Outfitters, respectively and a decrease of 3.2% at Anthropologie. The increase in our Wholesale segment net sales was due to a $16 million, or a 14.7% increase, at Free People wholesale, partially offset by a $3 million decrease atLeifsdottir wholesale resulting from the discontinuation of wholesale distribution of the Leifsdottir brand, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and was principally completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2012.   The increase in net sales attributable to non-comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening 57 new stores in fiscal 2012and 46 new stores in fiscal 2011 that were considered non-comparable during fiscal 2012. Direct-to-consumer net sales in fiscal year 2012 increased over the prior year primarily due to increased traffic to our websites combined with an increase inaverage order value, which more than offset a decrease in conversion rate. Catalog circulation across all brands increased by 4.1 million, or 9.3%. Comparable store net sales decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in the average unitsales prices combined with a decrease in the number of transactions. The increase in Free People wholesale net sales was driven by increases in transactions and average unit sale prices.   Gross profit rates in fiscal 2012 decreased to 34.8% of net sales, or $861 million, from 41.2% of net sales, or $937 million, in fiscal2011. This decrease was principally due to increased merchandise markdowns to clear slow-moving inventory, primarily associated with womens apparel inventory at Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters, as well as deleveraging of store occupancyexpense as a result of negative comparable store net sales. Total Company inventory increased 8.9% to $250 million from $230 million in the prior year. Comparable Retail segment inventory, which includes our comparable store and our comparabledirect-to-consumer channels, grew 1.8%, while comparable store inventories decreased 2.5%. The increase in total Company inventory is primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new stores, our direct-to-consumer channel growth andthe launch of our BHLDN brand. The decrease in comparable store inventory was a partial offset.    Selling, general andadministrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2012, increased to 23.3% of net sales versus 23.0% of net sales for fiscal 2011. This increase was primarily due to higher marketing and related e-commerce investments as well asthe deleveraging of direct store controllable expenses driven by the negative comparable stores sales in fiscal 2012. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive based compensation versus the prior fiscal year as well as an equitycompensation expense reversal due to the departure of an executive officer. In fiscal 2012, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $54 million, or 10.2%, to $576 million, from $522 million in fiscal 2011. The dollarincrease versus the prior year is primarily related to the operating expenses of new and non-comparable stores.    Income fromoperations decreased to 11.5% of net sales, or $285 million, for fiscal 2012 compared to 18.2% of net sales, or $414 million, for fiscal 2011.    Our annual effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 increased to 35.9% of income before income taxes compared to 34.6% of income before income taxes for fiscal 2011. The fiscal 2011 effective tax ratewas favorably affected by a non-recurring federal rehabilitation credit relating to the expansion of our home office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. See Note 8, Income Taxes, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, for areconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate.       33     Liquidity and Capital Resources   Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $623 million as of January 31, 2013 as compared to $362 million as ofJanuary 31, 2012 and $809 million as of January 31, 2011. The $261 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal 2013 was primarily a result of $396 million from cash provided by operatingactivities, partially offset by $169 million cash paid for property and equipment.    Cash provided by operating activities forfiscal 2013, increased by $113 million to $396 million from $283 million in fiscal 2012. The increase primarily consists of higher net income net of depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items. Our working capital as of year-end for fiscalyears 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $622 million, $364 million and $593 million, respectively. Changes in working capital primarily relate to changes in the volume of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.   Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2013 was $334 million, consisting of $169 million used primarily for the construction ofnew stores and a fulfillment facility and $165 million in net purchases of marketable securities.    Cash provided by financingactivities during fiscal 2013 of $37 million was related to the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits on stock option exercises.    During the last three years, we have satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operating activities. Our primary uses of cash have been to repurchase our common shares, open new storesand purchase inventories. We have also continued to invest in our direct-to-consumer efforts, technology, fulfillment and distribution facilities, our home office and our international operations. Cash paid for property and equipment for fiscal2013, 2012 and 2011 were $169 million, $190 million, and $144 million, respectively, and were primarily used to expand and support our store base and distribution and fulfillment facilities.   During fiscal 2014, we plan to construct and open approximately 35-40 new stores, renovate certain existing stores, continue to expandour home offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, upgrade our systems, increase our investments in direct-to-consumer marketing and purchase inventory for our stores,    direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth. We plan to increase the level of capital expenditures during fiscal 2014 to approximately $210million. We believe that our new store, direct-to-consumer and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year. We believe the expansion of our home office and distribution facilities is necessary to adequatelysupport our growth. We may also enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of our brand offerings.    On February 28, 2006, a stock repurchase authorization by the Companys Board of Directors allowed the Company to repurchase up to 8 million common shares. On November 16, 2010 andAugust 25, 2011, two additional stock repurchase authorizations by the Companys Board of Directors allowed the Company to repurchase, in aggregate, 20 million additional common shares.   The Company repurchased all of the remaining outstanding shares available under the above authorizations during fiscal 2012. Duringfiscal 2012, we repurchased and retired 20.5 million common shares for approximately $538.3 million. During fiscal 2011 we repurchased and subsequently retired 6.3 million common shares for $201.0 million. We repurchased 1.2 millioncommon shares during fiscal year 2007.       34     In addition to shares repurchased under the stock repurchase program, during the fiscalyears ended January 31, 2012 and 2011, we settled and subsequently retired 0.3 million and 0.1 million common shares at a total cost of $7.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively, from employees to meet minimum statutory taxwithholding requirements.    On April 25, 2011, the Company amended its line of credit facility (the Line) withWells Fargo Bank, National Association. This amendment extended the term of the Line for three years, increased the accordion feature from $100 million to $175 million, reduced the interest rate margin for certain cash advances and modified certainfinancial covenants and terms. The Line has been subsequently amended from time to time to join certain subsidiaries as borrowers and guarantors, to revise certain financial covenants, and to use the accordion feature of the Line to increase thetotal available credit under the Line to $175 million. The Line contains a sub-limit for borrowings by the Companys European subsidiaries that are guaranteed by the Company. Cash advances bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% to 1.50% based on theCompanys achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios. The Line subjects the Company to various restrictive covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios such as adjusted debt. The covenants also include limitations on theCompanys capital expenditures and the payment of cash dividends. As of and during the year ended January 31, 2013, there were no borrowings under the Line and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Line. Outstanding letters ofcredit and stand-by letters of credit under the Line totaled approximately $58.3 million as of January 31, 2013. The available credit under the Line was $116.7 million as of January 31, 2013. We expect the Line to satisfy our credit needsthrough at least fiscal 2014.

The obligation amounts shown above only reflect ourfuture minimum lease payments as the direct operating costs fluctuate over the term of the lease. Additionally, there are 26 locations where a percentage of sales are paid in lieu of a fixed minimum rent that are not reflected in the above table.Total rent expense related to these 26 locations was approximately $4,091 for fiscal 2013. It is common for the lease agreements for our European locations to adjust the minimum rental due to the current market rate multiple times during the term.The table above includes our current contractual payments for these locations. Amounts noted above include commitments for 31 executed leases for stores not opened as of January 31, 2013.     (2)  Our merchandise commitments are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until the merchandise shipping date.     (3)  Includes construction contracts with contractors that are fully liquidated upon the completion of construction, which is typically within 12 months.      35       (4)  Tax contingencies include $1,249 that is classified as a current liability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2013. Taxcontingencies in the table above do not show an existing liability of $9,756 because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled. As a result, the $9,756 liability was classified as a non-currentliability in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2013.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    As of and for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2013, except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business, we were not party to any material off-balance sheetarrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.   Other Matters    Recently IssuedAccounting Pronouncements    See Note 2, Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes toour Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impacts on our results of operations, financialposition and cash flows.       36     Seasonality and Quarterly Results   Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations in net sales and operating income, with a more significant portiontypically realized from August 1 to December 31  ofeach year (the back-to-school and holiday periods). The following tables set forth our net sales, gross profit, net income and net income per common share (basic and diluted) for each quarter during the last two fiscal years and the amount of suchnet sales and net income, respectively, as a percentage of annual net sales and annual net income. The unaudited financial information has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interimfinancial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.                                 Fiscal 2013 Quarter Ended (1)          April 30, 2012        July 31, 2012        Oct. 31, 2012        Jan. 31, 2013          (dollars in thousands, except per share data)        Net sales      $  568,930         $  676,269         $  692,894         $  856,832         Gross profit         202,479            254,505            260,851            313,696         Net income         33,957            61,292            59,517            82,548         Net income per common sharebasic         0.24            0.42            0.41            0.57         Net income per common sharediluted         0.23            0.42            0.40            0.56               As a Percentage of Fiscal Year:                              Net sales         20  %         24  %         25  %         31  %      Net income         14  %         26  %         25  %         35  %                                   Fiscal 2012 Quarter Ended (1)          April 30, 2011        July 31, 2011        Oct. 31, 2011        Jan. 31, 2012          (dollars in thousands, except per share data)        Net sales      $  524,019         $  609,181         $  609,953         $  730,648         Gross profit         193,365            231,090            216,103            219,978         Net income         38,624            56,693            50,679            39,255         Net income per common sharebasic         0.24            0.36            0.34            0.27         Net income per common sharediluted         0.23            0.35            0.33            0.27               As a Percentage of Fiscal Year:                              Net sales         21  %         25  %         25  %         29  %      Net income         21  %         31  %         27  %         21  %          (1)  The sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal per share amounts reported for year-to-date periods. This is due to changes in the number of weighted averageshares outstanding and the effects of rounding for each period.    Item 7A. Quantitativeand Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    We are exposed to the following types of market risksfluctuations inthe purchase price of merchandise, as well as other goods and services; the value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; and changes in interest rates. Due to our inventory turnover rate and our historical ability to pass through theimpact of any generalized changes in our cost of goods to our customers through       37     pricing adjustments, commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material. We purchase substantially all of our merchandise in U.S. dollars, including a portion of the goods for ourstores located in Canada and Europe.    Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash,cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 31, 2013 and 2012, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts, corporate bonds rated A orbetter, municipal and pre-refunded municipal bonds rated A or better, auction rate securities (ARS) rated A or better, which bear interest at variable rates, treasury bills, certificates of deposit, federalgovernment agencies, and commercial paper. Due to the short average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, we believe a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Consolidated FinancialStatements. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable, a change in interest rates earned on the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest incomealong with cash flows, but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments.    Our ARS are investedin A or better rated issuances that represent interests in municipal obligations. Our ARS had a par value and fair value of $4.9 million and $4.3 million as of January 31, 2013 and $23.0 million and $20.2 million as ofJanuary 31, 2012, respectively. As of January 31, 2013, all of the ARS we held failed to liquidate at auction due to lack of market demand. Based on review of credit quality, collateralization, final stated maturity, estimates of theprobability of being called or becoming liquid prior to final maturity, redemptions of similar ARS, previous market activity for the same investment security, impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates and valuation models, we haverecorded $0.6 million of temporary impairment on our ARS as of January 31, 2013 and $2.8 million as of January 31, 2012. To date, we have collected all interest payable on outstanding ARS when due and expect to continue to do so in thefuture. We do not have the intent to sell the underlying securities prior to their recovery and we believe that it is not likely that we will be required to sell the underlying securities prior to their anticipated recovery of full amortized cost.As a result of the current illiquidity, we have classified all ARS as non-current assets under marketable securities. We continue to monitor the market for ARS and consider the impact, if any, on the fair value of our investments.   Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
