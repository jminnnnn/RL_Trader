ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS                 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified by reference to, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto in Item 8 of this report and Selected Financial Data included in Item 6 of this report. Certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute "forward- looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform of 1995. Refer to the "Cautionary Statement About Forward Looking Statements" preceding Item 1 of this report. Also, for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business and operations see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report.            We were founded in 1984 as a cleaner coal technology, energy production and environmental solutions company primarily focused on developing and marketing K-Fuel. Today, Evergreen Energy is comprised of two discrete business units within the clean energy technology sector, which utilize two proprietary and potentially transformative technologies: K-Fuel and the GreenCert suite of software and services. K-Fuel, our patented clean coal technology, significantly improves the performance of low-rank sub-bituminous and brown coals and lignite yielding higher efficiency by applying heat and pressure to low-rank coals to reduce moisture. The increase is variable depending on the type of coal we process. Our GreenCert software suite focuses on providing power generators with operational intelligence; analytics to identify fuel and operational efficiency; and address new regulatory pressures regarding environmental emissions. The K-Fuel and GreenCert technologies are both business and environmental solutions for energy production and generation industries and processes.             During 2010 and through February 2011, we have executed on a number of our strategic objectives. On February 1, 2011, we completed a private placement to sell 6.2 million shares of our common stock and 12.0 million warrants to purchase our common stock, resulting $14.6 million of net proceeds, after the offering expenses. Also, on February 1, 2011, we executed an agreement to settle a significant portion of our 2007 Notes and the associated litigation. See further discussion of both of these transactions in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" and "Note 16Subsequent Events" in Item 8 of this report. In addition, we executed on two other strategic positioning plans by completing the sale of Buckeye and signing a definitive agreement to sell our Fort Union assets. See further discussion in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" and "Note 15Discontinued Operations" in Item 8 of this report.            We believe these transactions have better positioned us to focus our resources on a newly defined set of objectives and further clarify our strategic positioning. To this end, we expect to evaluate several alternatives, including but not limited to: (i) the development of a K-Fuel demonstration plant; (ii) entry into joint ventures for the further development of K-Fuel; and (iii) assessment of the GreenCert business, including evaluation of its relationship to K-Fuel and potential sale or joint venture of this business. We have been evaluating the engagement of an investment banking firm to assist us in the assessment of the GreenCert business and possible alternatives related to that business. As stages of this process are completed, it may alter our ongoing business plan.            The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. We do not consolidate Evergreen-China Energy Technology Co., Ltd, our 30% owned company in China (Evergreen-China); but record the activity using the equity method of investment. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.             Our business lines include the Technology segment and the GreenCert segment. The Technology segment is comprised of all operations that use, apply, own or otherwise advance our proprietary, patented K-Fuel process, including our headquarters and related operations, and activities of Evergreen Energy Asia Pacific Corp. and KFx Technology, LLC, which holds the licenses to our technology.    39             Corporate costs within our Technology segment are allocated to our GreenCert segment, generally on a percentage based on the number of employees, total segment operating expenses, or segment operating expenses plus segment capital expenditures. The GreenCert segment represents the operations of our GreenCert software suite, which focuses on providing power generators with operational intelligence; analytics to identify fuel and operational efficiency; and address new regulatory pressures regarding environmental emissions. As a result of the sale of Buckeye and the signing of a definitive agreement for the sale of our Fort Union assets, the Mining and the Plant segments were reclassified to discontinued operations for our consolidated financial statements. We will continue to evaluate how we manage our business and, as necessary, adjust our segment reporting accordingly.       Significant Trends               For the last several years, our operations have been focused on developing our two technologies, K-Fuel and GreenCert, and the construction of the Fort Union plant. To date, we have not yet generated significant revenues from either of these technologies or from the plant. Historically, most of our expenses are related to general and administrative expenses and plant costs. With the addition of Buckeye, we generated revenue and incurred more substantial mining costs. As a result of the sale of Buckeye and our Fort Union assets, the results of operations for the mining segment and plant segment are shown as discontinued operations and prior year comparative information is also restated and reflected in discontinued operations. Further, we do not expect there to be any mining or plant revenues and limited mining expenses after the completion of these sales.     Revenue Trends             In the future we expect to generate revenue from the following sources:       revenues from production facilities including K-Fuel and K-Direct plants domestically and internationally;       licensing of our technology, including license fees for constructing a plant and royalty fees for operating a plant; and      revenues from licensing our GreenCert technology, if we continue to own it.      Expense Trends        General and Administrative Expenses               As we identify business development opportunities and generally expand our business, including hiring additional personnel and increasing certain outsourced professional services, we will incur additional expenses, the most significant of which are:       payroll and related burdens;       non-cash, share-based compensation;       sales and marketing costs primarily for the K-Fuel technology;       rent and utilities; and       professional support fees.             We anticipate that accounting for non-cash, share-based compensation will add approximately $3.0 million to $6.0 million per year in the foreseeable future to our expenses. In the event we should achieve certain stock price targets, we would significantly accelerate recognition of these costs. Costs such as payroll and related burdens, professional support fees and utilities are variable costs that    40             increase with size and adding locations. As we focus our efforts on the development of our K-Fuel process, we expect these costs to increase in future periods.       GreenCert               We will incur costs to develop and implement our GreenCert technology, principally including: payroll and related burdens, certain outsourced professional fees, licensing fees and support fees. As previously discussed, we are evaluating our strategic positioning related to the GreenCert business, which may result in changes to these expenses.       Future K-Fuel and K-Direct facilities               We anticipate entering into joint ventures to construct future K-Fuel facilities and possibly K-Direct facilities. If these facilities are constructed and begin continuous operation, additional operational expenses will be incurred through these joint ventures, the most significant being:       coal transportation costs;       raw material costs;       outsourced engineering and technical support;       plant maintenance costs;       plant personnel labor costs;       fluid processing costs;       by-product and water disposal costs; and       royalty costs, relating to fees we owe to parties who own certain rights that support our patents and proprietary technology, primarily the Koppelman venture.             See further discussion of the royalty owed to Koppelman Ventures in Note 3Restricted Cash and Other Assets in Item 8 of this report.     Results of Operations      Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009              Note that prior year amounts of corporate allocations were restated due to the discontinued operations treatment.       Revenue               Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $403,000 compared to $423,000 for the same period ended December 31, 2009.    41              General and Administrative               The following table summarizes our general and administrative costs for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.                                     Year Ended  December 31,              2010      2009              (in thousands)         Non-cash, share-based compensation     $  3,289     $  4,509         Employee-related costs        4,225        9,323         Professional fees        4,029        4,888         Office and travel costs        1,226        3,892         Insurance and other        2,289        2,471                                Total general and administrative     $  15,058     $  25,083                                         Non-cash, share-based employee compensation expenses were $3.3 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to our Technology segment and GreenCert segment. The decrease for the year ended 2010 was primarily due to reduced headcount and the related forfeiture of these grants. In addition, we granted fewer options and restricted shares when comparing 2010 to 2009. Furthermore, we recognized a one-time decrease in 2009 due to the retirement of a former officer and the impact of his retirement on his restricted stock grant. Since the restricted shares never vested and were forfeited upon retirement, the cumulative non-cash compensation expense recorded since 2005 was reversed. This reversal of non-cash compensation totaled $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was partially offset by a transition agreement we entered into with another former officer. Pursuant to that agreement, we accelerated his restricted stock grant and recorded $1.6 million and $3.3 million of non-cash compensation for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.            Employee-related costs primarily include salaries and wages, temporary employees, bonuses, benefits, employer payroll taxes and education and training. The following table summarizes our employee-related costs related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.                                     Year Ended  December 31,              2010      2009              (in thousands)         Technology     $  1,993     $  4,723         GreenCert        2,232        4,600                                Total Employee-related     $  4,225     $  9,323                                         Employee-related costs were $4.2 million and $9.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2010 in comparison to the same period in 2009 was primarily due to lower head count in both our Technology and GreenCert segments. In addition, we incurred $525,000 of accrued severance expense relating to two former executive officers in our Technology segment for the year ended December 31, 2009.    42                   Professional fees include legal, audit and accounting, public relations, governmental relations and similar costs. The following table summarizes our professional fees related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.                                     Year Ended  December 31,              2010      2009              (in thousands)         Technology     $  3,505     $  3,916         GreenCert        524        972                                Total Professional fees     $  4,029     $  4,888                                         Professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $4.0 million compared to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 was due to legal fees in 2009 related to certain financing transactions that were not consummated, fees related to marketing and international work in 2009 all related to our Technology segment, and filing patent applications in 2009 for our GreenCert technology. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in legal expenses which totaled $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010.            Office and travel costs include airfare, lodging, meals, office rent, marketing, office supplies, phone, publications, subscriptions and utilities. The following table summarizes our office and travel costs related to each of our segments for years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.                                     Year Ended  December 31,              2010      2009              (in thousands)         Technology     $  711     $  2,097         GreenCert        515        1,795                                Total Office and travel     $  1,226     $  3,892                                         The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily related to less international travel. Furthermore, during 2009, we incurred a non-recurring charge of $1.0 million due to consolidating our employees into a smaller section of our office space to enable us to potentially sublease the remaining office space at our corporate location. The amortization of this loss in 2010 reduced our office expense for the year ended December 31, 2010.             Insurance and other costs primarily include costs related to our property and commercial liability, other insurance and all costs that cannot be categorized elsewhere and include, among other costs, various business and franchise taxes, licensing fees, repair and maintenance, engineering and technical services and director expenses. The following table summarizes our insurance and other costs related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.                                     Year Ended  December 31,              2010      2009              (in thousands)         Technology     $  1,677     $  2,471         GreenCert        612                                        Total Insurance and other     $  2,289     $  2,471                                 43              Depreciation and Amortization               Depreciation and amortization are principally comprised of amortization related to our patents and depreciation on other fixed assets using the straight-line method. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $2.4 million during the same period ended 2009.       Research and Development               Research and development costs primarily represent the development of our GreenCert software energy module and increased due to the development of this module. Research and development costs were $888,000 and $49,000 for the years ended 2010 and 2009, respectively.       Asset Impairment Charges               Due to the uncertainties relating to certain cap and trade legislation proposals, we impaired capitalized costs related to our GreenCert agricultural software module by $3.7 million, of which $2.9 million was previously reflected as construction in progress and $735,000 in property plant and equipment in our consolidated balance sheets. However, we do not believe impairment is necessary with respect to the Energy module where we have concentrated most of our work since early 2010. GreenCert Energy is focused on business intelligence solutions for power plant operators and the EPA has issued new rule making orders to monitor stationary assets for their greenhouse gas emissions independent of legislative sentiment.       Other Income (expense)      Gain on debt-for-equity exchange transactions               During the year ended December 31, 2010, we entered into multiple individually negotiated agreements with certain existing 2007 noteholders to exchange $5.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2007 Notes, for an aggregate of 2.0 million shares of our common stock. We recorded a $2.9 million gain related to these exchanges for the year ended December 31, 2010.       Loss on extinguishment of debt               We recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of the 2009 notes primarily related to the acceleration of debt issuance costs, the acceleration of exit fees and the write-off of the derivatives associated with these notes. We allocated this loss on a percentage basis between continuing operations and discontinued operations.       Interest income               Interest income was $23,000 and $65,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.       Interest expense               Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $2.4 million compared to $4.2 million for the same period ended 2009. The interest expense relates to the 2007 Notes and 2009 Notes more fully described in Note 6Debt to the consolidated financial statements included Item 8 of this report. Pursuant to discontinued operations accounting guidance, interest expense related to our 2009 Notes is reflected in (loss) gain from discontinued mining operations for all periods presented. Debt issuance costs prior to the extinguishment of the 2009 Notes are reflected as interest expense in our continuing operations. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 is primarily related to the amortization of finance charges related to the 2009 Notes.    44        NAME="page_do78701_1_45">                                              Gain on fair value derivatives               We are required to evaluate the fair value of the embedded derivatives at the end of each reporting period. These fair value adjustments are non-cash items, and each quarter's estimations are impacted, in part, by our stock price. We recognized a $5.6 million gain on the fair value adjustments for our embedded derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a $2.0 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase from the year ended in 2010 compared to the year ended in 2009 was due to the new financings in 2010. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 7Temporary Capital and Stockholders Equity in Item 8 of this report.       Other income (expense)               During the year ended December 31, 2010, other income was $772,000 as compared to $417,000 for the same period ended 2009.      Discontinued Mining Operations             Discontinued Mining Operations is comprised of the following:                                     Year Ended  December 31,              2010      2009              (in thousands)         Mining revenue     $  12,619     $  50,248         Coal mining operating costs        (12,035  )     (43,458  )      General and administrative        (1,566  )     (3,993  )      Depreciation, depletion & amortization        (1,281  )     (7,518  )      Other loss        (2,578  )     (23,579  )                             Loss from discontinued mining operations     $  (4,841  )  $  (28,300  )                                      Amounts for the year ended December 31, 2010 represent Buckeye operations for the three months ended March 31, 2010 through the closing date of the sale which occurred on April 1, 2010. Further, other loss for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes impairment charges of $20.1 million related to certain assets in our mining operations.      Discontinued Plant Operations             Discontinued Plant Operations is comprised of the following:                                     Year Ended  December 31,              2010      2009              (in thousands)         Plant costs     $  (646  )  $  (1,554  )      General and administrative                (6  )      Depreciation, depletion & amortization                (26  )      Other income        755        412                                Income (loss) from discontinued plant operations     $  109     $  (1,174  )                              45              Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2009 and 2008        Revenue               Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $423,000 compared to $4,000 for the same period ended December 31, 2008.       General and Administrative               The following table summarizes our general and administrative costs for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.                                     Year Ended  December 31,              2009      2008              (in thousands)         Non-cash, share-based compensation     $  4,509     $  5,204         Employee-related costs        9,323        10,154         Professional fees        4,888        3,787         Office and travel costs        3,892        3,577         Insurance and other        2,471        4,808                                Total general and administrative     $  25,083     $  27,530                                         Non-cash, share-based compensation expenses were $4.5 million and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, most of which related to our Technology segment. The decrease for the year ended 2009 was primarily due to the reduction of our workforce and the related forfeiture of the grants. We also recognized a one-time decrease due to the retirement of a former officer and the impact of his retirement on his restricted stock grant. Since the restricted shares never vested and were forfeited upon retirement, the cumulative non-cash compensation expense recorded since 2005 was reversed. This reversal of non-cash compensation totaled $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decreases were partially offset by a transition agreement we entered into with another former officer. Pursuant to that agreement, we accelerated the restricted stock grant and recorded $3.3 million of non-cash compensation for the year ended December 31, 2009.            Employee-related costs primarily include salaries and wages, temporary employees, bonuses, benefits, employer payroll taxes and education and training. The following table summarizes our employee-related costs related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.                                     Year Ended  December 31,              2009      2008              (in thousands)         Technology     $  4,723     $  7,516         GreenCert        4,600        2,638                                Total Employee-related     $  9,323     $  10,154                                         The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2009 in comparison to the same period in 2008 was primarily due to our cost cutting measures which resulted in lower employee count in our Technology segment. This decrease was offset by the addition of personnel to our GreenCert segment and severance expense for two former executive officers in the amount of $525,000 in our Technology segment.    46                   Professional fees include legal, audit and accounting, public relations, governmental relations and similar costs. The following table summarizes our professional fees related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.                                     Year Ended  December 31,              2009      2008              (in thousands)         Technology     $  3,916     $  2,957         GreenCert        972        830                                Total Professional fees     $  4,888     $  3,787                                         The increase for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared the year ended 2008 was due to legal fees related to certain financing transactions that were not consummated, fees related to the marketing of Buckeye and international work, all related to our Technology segment, and filing patent applications for our GreenCert technology in our GreenCert segment.            Office and travel costs include airfare, lodging, meals, office rent, marketing, office supplies, phone, publications, subscriptions and utilities. The following table summarizes our office and travel costs related to each of our segments for years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.                                     Year Ended  December 31,              2009      2008              (in thousands)         Technology     $  2,097     $  2,696         GreenCert        1,795        881                                Total Office and travel     $  3,892     $  3,577                                         The increase in office and travel for the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily due to a non-recurring charge of $1.0 million due to consolidating our employees into a smaller section of our office space to enable us to potentially sublease the remaining office space at our corporate location. The majority of this non-recurring charge was allocated to our GreenCert segment based on the number of employees, total segment operating expenses or segment operating expenses plus segment capital expenditures.             Insurance and other costs primarily include costs related to our property and commercial liability, other insurance and all costs that cannot be categorized elsewhere and include, among other costs, various business and franchise taxes, licensing fees, repair and maintenance, engineering and technical services and director expenses. The following table summarizes our insurance and other costs related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.                                     Year Ended  December 31,              2009      2008              (in thousands)         Technology     $  2,471     $  3,987         GreenCert                821                                Total Insurance and other     $  2,471     $  4,808                                         Costs decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009 mainly due to the idling of our Ft. Union plant in 2008 and the resulting decrease in Engineering and Technical services expense in our Technology segment.    47        NAME="page_dq78701_1_48">                                              Depreciation and Amortization               Depreciation and amortization are principally comprised of amortization related to our patents and depreciation on other fixed assets using the straight-line method. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $1.9 million during the same period ended 2008.       Research and Development               Research and development costs include costs incurred to advance, test, or otherwise modify our proprietary K-Fuel technology or develop new technologies and primarily include costs incurred to operate and maintain our laboratory facilities and professional engineering fees related to off-site testing of our K-Fuel refined coal. Research and development costs were $49,000 and $79,000 for the years ended 2009 and 2008, respectively.       Asset Impairment Charges               Asset impairment charges were $413,000 and $18.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2009 relate to the impairment of our leasehold improvements of the vacated office space that we are attempting to sublease and is reflected in our Technology segment. Asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2008 relate to further impairment of our boiler island which was classified as assets held for sale. See Note2 Property Plant and Equipment in Item 8 of this report for further details.       Other Income (expense)      Interest income               Interest income was $65,000 and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was principally attributable to a lower cash balance in 2009.       Interest expense               Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was $4.2 million and $6.1 million, respectively. The interest expense relates to the 2007 Notes and 2009 Notes more fully described in Note 6Debt in Item 8 of this report.       Gain (loss) on fair value derivatives               We are required to evaluate the fair value of the embedded derivatives at the end of each reporting period. We recognized a $2.0 million gain on the fair value adjustments for our embedded derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2009. These fair value adjustments are non-cash items, and each quarter's estimations are impacted, in part, by our stock price. See Note 6Debt and Note 7Temporary Capital and Stockholders' Equity in Item 8 of this report.       Other income (expense)               During the year ended December 31, 2009, other income was $417,000 as compared to $342,000 of other expense for the same period ended 2008.    48            Discontinued Mining Operations              Discontinued Mining Operations is comprised of the following:                                     Year Ended  December 31,              2009      2008              (in thousands)         Mining revenue     $  50,248     $  58,434         Coal mining operating costs        (43,458  )     (47,799  )      General and administrative        (3,993  )     (4,033  )      Depreciation, depletion & amortization        (7,518  )     (7,024  )      Other (loss) income        (23,579  )     86                                Loss from discontinued mining operations     $  (28,300  )  $  (336  )                               Discontinued Plant Operations             Discontinued Plant Operations is comprised of the following:                                     Year Ended  December 31,              2009      2008              (in thousands)         Revenue     $       $  463         Plant costs        (1,554  )     (17,630  )      General and administrative        (6  )     (401  )      Depreciation, depletion & amortization        (26  )     (56  )      Other income        412        890                                Loss from discontinued plant operations     $  (1,174  )  $  (16,734  )                               Liquidity and Capital Resources Discussion             Overall, we have increased our cash used in operations by $7.7 million, when comparing the year ended December 31, 2010 to the same period in 2009. Our cash used in operating activities from continuing operations increased by $2.5 million when compared to the prior year period, primarily due to disbursements for accounts payable and other liabilities and was somewhat offset by reduced professional fees and other general and administrative costs. Our cash used in discontinued operating activities increased by $5.2 million when compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the acceleration of payments of Buckeye's liabilities as we exited our mining operations, including selling and exit costs and additional interest expense related to our 2009 Note restructuring. In addition, we have invested $1.4 million in capital expenditures, primarily related to development of GreenCert, during the year ended December 31, 2010.            We have reduced our cash flow used in operations by $23.4 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2009 to the same period in 2008. This reduction was due, in part to the decrease in cash used in operating activities from continuing operations of $14.4 million, primarily due to the reduction of our professional fees and other general and administrative costs. These cost reductions were offset by the expansion of our GreenCert operations, including the addition of personnel and other administrative costs associated with developing the business. Our discontinued operating activities generated cash rather than a net utilization of cash, resulting in an $9.0 million fluctuation, when compared to the prior year period, primarily due to revenues earned at Buckeye and suspending operations at our Fort Union plant. In addition, we have invested $3.8 million in capital expenditures,    49             primarily related to GreenCert and K-Fuel process development during the year ended December 31, 2009.            Actual 2009 and first quarter 2010 cash flows from Buckeye's operations were less than anticipated and combined with the on-going costs associated with corporate, K-Fuel and GreenCert operations, required us to raise additional capital in 2010 and again in February 2011. As a result, we completed three financing transactions: (i) on March 16, 2010, we entered into a securities purchase agreement, and received gross proceeds of approximately $9.3 million; (ii) on January 26, 2010, we consummated a registered direct public offering and raised gross proceeds of approximately $8.7 million; and (iii) on February 1, 2011, we completed a private placement to sell 6.2 million shares of our common stock and 12.0 million warrants to purchase our common stock, resulting $14.6 million of net proceeds, after the offering expenses. See Note7Temporary Capital and Stockholders' Equity in Item 8 of this report for further description of these financings.            As previously mentioned, we executed on two of our strategic positioning plans by completing the sale of Buckeye and signing a definitive agreement to sell our Fort Union assets. We believe these sales have allowed us to focus our resources on core business activities, primarily our K-Fuel process. On March 12, 2010, we signed a definitive agreement with Rosebud Mining Company for the sale of Buckeye, for $27.9 million, in addition to the release of $5.0 million of cash reclamation bonds. Further, $2.8 million of the purchase price was deposited into escrow for a period of twelve months to cover amounts payable to Rosebud pursuant to the indemnification provision of the sales agreement. The sale closed on April 1, 2010. We received $25.1 million from the sale of Buckeye, of which $19.2 million was used to retire our 2009 Notes principal balance, accrued interest and exit fees. The remaining proceeds were used to fund related transaction expenses estimated at $2.5 million and for general working capital purposes. In addition, we received $5.0 million of additional cash from the release of our reclamation bonds through December 31, 2010.            On August 20, 2010, we executed the second of our strategic positioning plans by signing a definitive agreement to sell our Fort Union assets. We entered into a definitive agreement with Synthetic Fuels LLC, or its nominee, for the sale of the assets of our subsidiary Landrica Development Company, including the Fort Union plant and associated property located near Gillette, Wyoming. The sale will provide approximately $7.1 million of available cash to us, comprised of: (i) cash payments of $2.0 million, of which $500,000 will be paid at closing, an additional $500,000 on the first anniversary of closing and $1.0 million on the second anniversary of closing; and (ii) the payment for the transfer of all of the reclamation bonds pertaining to the sold property, currently totaling $5.2 million, pursuant to a secured one year note. Synthetic Fuels LLC is required to assume these environmental liabilities at the closing and the cash collateral or an equivalent amount will be released to us by the one year anniversary of the closing. The sale is anticipated to close during the first quarter 2011 and is subject to customary closing conditions. Proceeds of the sale will be used for general working capital purposes.            As previously described, on February 1, 2011, we executed a Settlement Agreement that provides for, assuming the final settlement date is reached and the settlement is completed, the settlement of an aggregate of $17.3 million of the 2007 Notes and the issuance of a new note for $1.6 million due on the one year anniversary of the final settlement date, that bears interest at 7% and is convertible into shares of our common stock at the market value of the shares on the date the exchange. This agreement also calls for the dismissal of the litigation that is now pending between us, Buckeye, the Settling 2007 Noteholders, and the 2009 Noteholders. Further, on February 14, 2011, we entered into an agreement to exchange $1.4 million of face value of 2007 Notes for 237,500 shares of our common stock. After this exchange and assuming that we close on the Settlement Agreement, there will remain $2.8 million of 2007 Notes outstanding. Further, this will decrease interest incurred from $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to an estimated $340,000 on an annualized basis.    50                   We have a history of losses, deficits and negative operating cash flows and may continue to incur losses in the future. Any of continued market disruptions associated with the economic downturn, lower demand for our technology or products, increased incidence of customers' inability to pay their accounts, or insolvency of our customers, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, and financial condition. We continue to evaluate our cash position and cash utilization and may make additional adjustments to capital or certain operating expenditures.            As stated above, we continue to require additional capital to fund the development of our K-Fuel process and our GreenCert technology and expect to investigate sources of additional capital. Further, as opportunities arise to accelerate the expansion of our K-Fuel technology or our anticipated operating cash outflows are greater than expected, we may need to obtain further funding. We believe we have the ability to raise additional capital from time to time as needed principally through: (i) equity offerings; (ii) debt or debt offerings; and (iii) partnering with third parties. While we believe we will obtain additional capital through one or more of the alternatives described, we can provide no assurance that any of the alternatives will be available or be on acceptable terms.     Payment Obligations             The following table summarizes our future commitments as of December 31, 2010:                                                    Payments due by period              2011      2012      2013      2014      2015      Thereafter      Total              (in thousands)         Operating leases     $  663     $  652     $  641     $  657     $  673     $  1,028     $  4,314         Consulting and service commitments        500        500        10,500        500        500        500        13,000         Long-term debt        1,724        23,279                                        25,003                                                              Total commitments     $  2,887     $  24,431     $  11,141     $  1,157     $  1,173     $  1,528     $  42,317                                                                       This table does not include accounts payable, accrued liabilities, or asset retirement obligations, which are reported in our December 31, 2010 consolidated balance sheet. We generally have not included any obligation in which either party has the right to terminate except as discussed below. Additionally, we have not included K-Fuel royalty payments, as we cannot presently determine when such payments will be made as such payments are based upon our receipt of cash for licensing and royalties.             We are obligated under non-cancelable operating leases with initial terms exceeding one year relating to office space. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $1.0 million, $1.2 million, and $1.1 million, respectively.            Consulting and service commitments include an exclusive patent sub-license agreement with the developer of a proprietary technology for the measurement of carbon emissions. The agreement provides us with an exclusive worldwide sub-license to a technology to standardize the measurement of carbon emissions in energy and agricultural related activities. The agreement was amended and restated to expand the energy and agricultural activities to all applications of the technology and eliminates other operating requirements. In order to maintain this licensing arrangement, we are required to make minimum annual royalty payments of $500,000 to the developer of the proprietary technology, with each payment extending the arrangement for one year if the parties are in material compliance with the contract. Additionally, consulting and service commitments includes our amended and restated umbrella agreement with Bechtel. Through this new program management agreement, we committed to provide Bechtel with $1 billion in construction contracts through 2014. Failure to meet this commitment by 2013 could cost us up to the $10 million in termination fees, which is included in the above table.    51                   Long-term debt includes our principal amount due 2012 and the 8% interest payments. See Note 10Commitments and Contingencies and Litigations for further details related to the contingent settlement and retirement of a portion of these notes.            While our former investment banking firm may claim that we owe them up to $1.0 million related to the sale of Buckeye, we do not believe that this fee is payable due to the lack of the counterparties meeting certain performance and contractual criteria. If a claim is made for this contingent payment, we intend to vigorously dispute this claim. This potential obligation is not included in the table above.     Historical View        Cash Used in Operating Activities of continuing operations               Cash used in operating activities of continuing operations were $15.7 million, $13.2 million, and $27.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of the cash used in operating activities of continuing operations relates to cash utilized in our on-going operations, as adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The most significant adjustments to net loss to arrive at cash used in operating activities are as follows:       Share-based compensation expense to employees and others was $3.6 million, $5.3 million and $6.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.       Depreciation and amortization expense was $1.7 million, $2.4 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.       During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred impairment charges related to the GreenCert agriculture module of $3.7 million. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred $18.6 million of asset impairment charges, principally related to boilers.      During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we adjusted the fair value of various embedded derivatives and incurred non-cash (losses) and gains of $(5.6) million, $(2.0) million and $934,000 respectively.       During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we completed several debt-for-equity exchanges resulting in gains of $2.9 million, $167,000 and $6.1 million.       Debt issue cost amortization was $2.4 million, $2.6 million and $777,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.       During the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred a non-recurring charge of $1.0 million from our attempt to sublease unused office space.       Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities of continuing operations               Cash provided by (used in) investing activities of continuing operations were $3.7 million, $(1.3) million, and $28.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of the sources and uses of cash relate to the following:       We spent $1.4 million, $3.8 million and $11.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, on construction in progress with our GreenCert development, future plant design and other construction in progress.       During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received $5.1 million from the release of restricted cash related to reclamation bonds.       During the year ended December 31, 2009, we liquidated our auction rate marketable securities and received $2.0 million in proceeds.    52              During the year ended December 31, 2008, we purchased $5.0 million of marketable securities and received $27.5 million in proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities.       In 2007, we were required to restrict cash and marketable securities to serve as collateral of $24.7 million, related to our 2007 Notes and to collateralize other contractual obligations and our asset retirement obligations.      We received $17.2 million of restricted cash net, primarily relating to our debt for equity exchange transaction related to the 2007 Notes for the year ended December 31, 2008.       Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities of continuing operations               Cash (used in) provided by financing activities of continuing operations were $(6.9) million, $17.1 million, and $(3.7) million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of the sources and uses of cash relate to the following:       We repaid the 2009 Notes totaling $17.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010.      During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we received proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, net of closing costs, of $8.7 million and $6.5 million, respectively.       During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we paid dividends on convertible preferred stock of $4.3 million and $2.0 million.       We received proceeds from the sale of common stock of $8.0 million, net of closing costs, for the year ended December 31, 2010.       We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2009 Notes totaling $15.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2009.     Cash (Used in) Provided by Discontinued Operations               Cash (used in) provided by operating activities of discontinued mining and plant operations was $(4.9) million, $248,000 and $(8.7) million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The net increase in operating cash used from the year ended in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to payment of interest on the 2009 Notes, the sale of certain Buckeye and Evergreen assets on April 1, 2010, and related selling and exit costs. After April 1, 2010, Buckeye operations ceased.             Cash provided by (used in) investing activities of discontinued mining and plant operations was $24.7 million, $(8.4) million, and $(7.6) million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase from the year ended in 2009 compared to the year ended in 2010 is related to the cash received from the sale of certain of Buckeye and Evergreen assets.    53        NAME="page_ds78701_1_54">                                               Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates             We have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our current and future business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies see the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These policies and estimates are considered "critical" because they either had a material impact or they have the potential to have a material impact on our financial statements, and because they require significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. The preparation of our financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect both the results of operations as well as the carrying values of our assets and liabilities. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base estimates on historical experience and/or on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the near term. Set forth below is a summary of our most critical accounting policies. These policies are focused on our continuing operations.             Revenue Recognition.     We expect to derive GreenCert and K-Fuel revenue from licensing arrangements that include licenses, technical support, and professional services.            For each arrangement, we recognize revenue when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists (e.g., a signed contract); (ii) delivery of the product has occurred and there are no remaining obligations or substantive customer acceptance provisions and all obligations are satisfied; (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection of the fee is reasonably assured. Any up-front fees received are deferred and recognized over the provision of specific deliverables as defined in the agreements. As our history related to customer relationships is limited, we may be required to change the estimated period over which we recognize our revenue as more information becomes available. Arrangements that include multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine whether the elements are separable based on objective evidence. If the elements are deemed separable, total consideration is allocated to each element and the revenue associated with each element is recognized as earned. If the elements are not deemed separable, total consideration is deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual period or the expected customer relationship period. We believe that the accounting estimates related to customer relationship periods and to the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable are "critical accounting estimates" because: (i) they require management to make assumptions about how long we will retain customers, for which we have limited history; (ii) the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable can be subjective; and (iii) the impact of changes in actual retention periods versus these estimates on the revenue amounts reported in our consolidated statements of operations could be material.             Accounts and Notes Receivable and Allowances.     Receivables are recorded at their estimated net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the past-due status of receivables and assessments of risk regarding collectability. If the financial condition of the customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.             Capitalization of Costs.     We capitalize all purchases of machinery, equipment, software, engineering costs and similar expenditures, where the useful life of the asset is greater than one year or the expenditures extend the useful life of an existing asset. All costs that are directly related to, or allocable to, developing a K-Fuel plant site are capitalized and separately identified as belonging to that site. Judgment is exercised in determining: (i) if costs extend the life of an asset; (ii) if costs increase    54             production volumes; and (iii) the feasibility of extracting coal. If these judgments are incorrect, we may capitalize more costs than we otherwise should.             Valuation of Long-Lived Assets.     The valuation of our long-lived and intangible assets, including the remaining assets at our Fort Union plant, and patents, have significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We must assess the realizable value of these assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of these assets, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. We must make assumptions regarding the useful lives of these assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.             Accounting for stock grants, options and warrants.     We issue stock grants, options and warrants to employees, board of directors and consultants in connection with our various business activities. In accounting for these awards we are required to make estimates of the fair value of the related instruments, the periods benefited and forfeiture rates. These estimates may affect such financial statement categories as stockholders' equity and general and administrative expense. If these estimates are incorrect, we may be required to incur additional expense in the future.             Accounting for derivative financial instruments.     Derivatives may be embedded in financial instruments (the "host instrument"). Embedded derivatives are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not clearly and closely related to those of the host instrument. The terms of the embedded derivative are similar to those of a stand-alone derivative and the combined contract is not held for trading or designated at fair value. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value and any subsequent changes are recognized in the statement of operations. We are required to make estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, estimating the future market price of our common stock and probability of a change in control. If these assumptions and estimates are incorrect, we may be required to incur additional expense in the future.             Accounting for Acquisitions.     The acquisition of businesses is an element of our strategy. We are required to record the net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect our financial statements. For example, the value and estimated life of assets may affect the amount of future period depletion and depreciation expense for the assets as well as possible impairment charges that may be incurred.             Marketable Securities.     As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, our balance sheet reflects $0 and $1.8 million of marketable securities, which are auction rate securities, respectively. These auction rate securities consisted of student-loan backed securities. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we reduced the carrying amount of our student loan-backed auction rate security by $200,000, which is reflected in general and administrative expense. In February 2009, we entered a reverse repurchase transaction for $1.8 million of our auction rate security which had a $2.0 million par value. In March 2009, we liquidated the auction rate security at $2.0 million, resulting in a gain of $200,000, which has been recorded in Other Income for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Currently, we have no significant foreign operations. We hold no equity market securities, which are subject to equity market risk relative to our own equity securities.
