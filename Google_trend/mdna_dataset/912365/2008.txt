ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS                  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified by reference to, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto in Item 8 of this report and Selected Financial Data included in Item 6 of this report. On March 19, 2008, we identified an error related to the classification of certain investments, principally auction rate securities, which were incorrectly classified as cash and cash equivalents rather than marketable securities. The following management's discussion and analysis gives affect to the restatement discussed in Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform of 1995. Refer to the "Cautionary Statement About Forward Looking Statements" preceding Item 1 of this report. Also, for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business and operations see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report.            We were founded in 1984 as a clean coal company focused on developing our K-Fuel process. Our goal is to leverage a vertically integrated, coal-based platform to deliver clean, efficient and affordable energy. We intend to meet the specific needs of public utility, industrial and international market customers by providing economical solutions to environmental emission standards compared to other emission standard alternatives. Our proprietary K-Fuel process uses heat and pressure to physically and chemically transform high moisture, low-Btu coals, such as sub-bituminous coal and lignite, into a more energy efficient, lower-emission fuel.             We, along with, our engineering consultants, Bechtel Power Corporation, have completed the modifications and improvements of the design and efficiency of the equipment used in the K-Fuel process. Bechtel and Evergreen's operations team at Fort Union completed successful testing of new operational systems that will support construction of future K-Fuel or K-Direct facilities, including a enhanced standard processing tower design. This work signals that we and Bechtel have resolved the most substantive technical challenges to scaling and commercializing our production process. In February 2007, we expanded our contractual relationship with Bechtel to assist with future designs of additional K-Fuel facilities we may build or license, including any K-Fuel plants located at coal-fired power generating plants, which we refer to as K-Direct plants. On September 19, 2007, we amended and restated our umbrella agreement with Bechtel Power Corporation. Through this new program management agreement, we committed to provide Bechtel with $1 billion in construction contracts through 2013. This restated agreement increases the scope of engineering, procurement and construction services which may be performed by Bechtel. We intend to use Bechtel's services to oversee both technical development and implementation of all new facilities and existing plants, including both K-Fuel and K-Direct plants.            The Fort Union plant which was our first plant to implement the current K-Fuel process, has accomplished virtually all of the goals and objectives we set forth for this site. Most notably, as a result of operations at the Fort Union plant, we have:       proven that the K-Fuel process works by increasing Btus and reducing mercury, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide emissions;  successfully completed the redesign and testing of new operational systems;  upgraded sufficient amounts of low-rank coal for utility and industrial customers who completed a number of test burns of K-Fuel refined coal with favorable results;  tested and improved product handling processes and requirements and improved transportation issues.    31                      For the reasons discussed below, we have chosen to suspend operations at our Fort Union plant and mine site. This will enable us to focus on future K-Fuel or K-Direct plants by redirecting constrained resources, both capital and human, to focus on the commercialization of our process. Bechtel has completed the enhanced standard processing tower design based upon the results of testing completed by us at the Fort Union plant. Additionally, suspending production at this site will further enable us to reduce our cash utilization. If the need arises, we are positioned to resume operations at the Fort Union plant to demonstrate the technology or to provide K-Fuel product for test burns at utilities or other industrial sites. We are also evaluating redeploying some of the equipment to a future K-Fuel facility site. We recorded an asset impairment charge of $109.5 million related to the Fort Union plant and mine site as of December 31, 2007.            The condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries, including the nine months ended December 31, 2006 for Buckeye Industrial Mining Co. (acquisition date of April 3, 2006). We consolidate all of our majority-owned subsidiaries and reflect as minority interest the portion of these entities that we do not own and reflected in other long-term liabilities. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.            During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, we re-evaluated our segments and have expanded our segment presentation to four segments to better reflect how our results of operations are now evaluated and allocations of capital resources are determined. The Plant segment primarily represents revenue and costs related to our Fort Union plant and our mine site in Gillette, Wyoming. The Mining segment primarily represents our mining operations at our Buckeye location and includes certain marketing personnel, the ash disposal facility and the blending facility. The C-lock segment reflects the operations related to our worldwide sub-license of a technology to standardize the measurement of carbon emissions in energy and agricultural related activities. The Technology segment is comprised of all other operations that use, apply, own or otherwise advance our proprietary, patented K-Fuel process, including our headquarters and related operations, activities of Evergreen Energy Asia Pacific and KFx Technology, LLC, which holds the licenses to our technology. Our operations are principally conducted in the United States. We will continue to evaluate how we manage our business and, as necessary, adjust our segment reporting accordingly.     Significant Trends             For the last several years, our operations have been focused on developing our technology and the construction of the Fort Union plant. As a result, we have limited revenues from K-Fuel refined coal and, historically most of our costs are related to general and administrative expenses. With the addition of Buckeye, we have begun to generate revenue and incurred more substantial mining costs. In the future, we plan to build, own and operate K-Fuel and K-Direct refineries domestically and internationally, both wholly owned and through joint ventures. Through C-Lock Technology we plan to generate revenues from our first-of- its-kind web-based system along with our patent-pending technology that accurately measures greenhouse gases and certifies these environmental improvements as carbon credits. As our operations expand, we expect our revenue and cost structure will also increase. The following discussion and analysis is focused on the events and trends that we believe have or will in the future have the most significant impact on our business.    Revenue Trends             In the future we expect to generate revenue from the following sources:       coal sales from our Buckeye operations;  revenues from production facilities including K-Fuel and K-Direct plants domestically and internationally;    32              revenues from the measurement of carbon credits using our web-based patent-pending technology;  licensing of our technology, including license fees for constructing a plant and royalty fees for operating a plant; and             We have granted certain rights and limited licenses for the use of certain K-Fuel technology, which may limit our revenue from production of K-Fuel refined coal to the extent that the rights are exercised. See Note 5 and 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.    Expense Trends        Fort Union               We have chosen to suspend operations at our Fort Union plant and mine site. This will enable us to focus on future K-Fuel or K-Direct plants by redirecting constrained resources, both capital and human, to focus on the commercialization of our process. Bechtel has completed the enhanced standard processing tower design based upon the results of testing completed by us at the Fort Union plant. Additionally, suspending production at this site will further enable us to reduce our cash expenditures. If the need arises, we are positioned to resume operations at Fort Union plant to demonstrate the technology or to provide K-Fuel product for test burns at utilities or other industrial sites. We are also evaluating redeploying some of the equipment to a future K-Fuel facility site. We will incur costs including labor, consulting and other costs to safely suspend operations at the plant.       Future K-Fuel and K-Direct facilities               As we build future K-Fuel and K-Direct facilities and these facilities begin continuous operation, we will incur additional operational expenses, the most significant being:       coal transportation costs;  raw material costs;  outsourced engineering and technical support;  plant maintenance costs;  plant personnel labor costs;  fluid processing costs;  by-product and water disposal costs; and  royalty costs, relating to fees we owe to parties who own certain rights that support our patents and proprietary technology, primarily the Koppelman estate.             See further discussion of the royalty owed to the estate of Edward Koppelman in Note 6Deferred Royalty Costs in Item 8 of this report.       Coal mining operating expenses               With the acquisition of Buckeye we have incurred mine operating expenses including all costs associated with the mining of saleable coal and costs relating to our coal ash disposal facility. As the price of coal increases, we anticipate increasing our production at both our surface mines and underground mines. We expect that the revenue generated from increased production will exceed the incremental mining costs.    33            General and administrative expenses               As we identify business development opportunities, build new plants, and generally expand our business including hiring additional personnel at our corporate, future plants and C-Lock locations and outsourced professional services, we will incur additional expenses, the most significant of which are:       payroll and related burdens;  non-cash, share-based compensation;  business development costs for potential future K-Fuel and K-Direct plants;  rent and utilities; and  professional support fees.             We anticipate that accounting for non-cash, share-based compensation will add approximately $6.0 million to $9.0 million per year in the foreseeable future to our expenses. In the event we should achieve certain performance goals, we would significantly accelerate recognition of these costs. Costs such as payroll and related burdens, professional support fees and utilities are variable costs that increase with size and adding locations. As we build new plants and expand our vertical integration strategy, we expect these costs to increase in future periods.    Results Of Operations     Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006        Revenue               Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $48.7 million compared to $36.7 million for the same period ended December 31, 2006. The increase in revenue primarily relates to our April 2006 acquisition of Buckeye. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we owned Buckeye for only nine months. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we owned Buckeye for the entire twelve-month period.            Revenues in our Mining segment for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $47.3 million and $35.9 million for the same period ended December 31, 2006 respectively, as follows:       Coal revenue includes mined raw and prepared coal sales within our Buckeye operations. Buckeye coal sales, including transportation costs charged to customers, for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $39.4 million or $54.13 sales realization per ton sold and $30.4 million or $56.32 sales realization per ton sold for the period ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in the sales realization per ton sold for the year ended December 31, 2007 was due to a mix of types of coals sold during 2007 and downward pressure on coal pricing, particularly during the first quarter of 2007 due depressed international coal prices. During periods of depressed coal pricing, we strategically adjust the mix of coal we produce to focus less on our premium coals. As prices have improved in 2008, we began increasing production of our premium coals and anticipate that our sales realization per ton will increase in 2008, as compared to 2007.  Brokered coal sales net include the revenues reduced by costs associated with the purchase of coal from other coal producers, which we ship directly to customers. We recognized $514,000 of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $695,000 of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. We enter into brokered coals sales as opportunities arise or as needed to meet certain customers requests, and as a result, revenues in this area fluctuate.  Ash disposal revenues primarily include revenues generated from the disposal of coal combustion bi-products at our ash pit in Ohio. Ash disposal revenues were $7.4 million and $4.7 million for years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.    34                      K-Fuel refined coal revenue is comprised of sales of our K-Fuel product to third parties. Blended K-Fuel refined coal revenue represents the proportionate revenue related to K-Fuel that has been blended with other raw or prepared coal from our Buckeye operations and sold to third parties. The remaining revenue related to the raw or prepared coal is reflected in Mining revenues. K-Fuel refined coal and blended K-Fuel refined coal sales were $1.1 million and $420,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively and are included in our Plant segment. K-Fuel refined coal sales were less than expected primarily due to less production at our Fort Union plant for both periods.       Coal Mining Operating Expenses               Our coal mining operating expenses include all costs associated with the mining of saleable coal and costs relating to our coal ash disposal facility at Buckeye, which principally comprises our Mining segment.       Coal mining operating expenses               Coal mining operating expenses include employee-related costs, outside contracted mining costs for our underground mines, internal and external coal transportation costs, blasting, drilling, heavy equipment costs, purchased coal and other mining-related costs. Coal mining operating expenses were $38.3 million and $28.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase can be attributed to the acquisition of Buckeye in April 2006, resulting in recording nine months of Buckeye's operation for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to recording twelve months of Buckeye's operations for the year ended December 31, 2007.       Ash disposal               Ash disposal expenses include employee-related costs, consulting costs, costs of repairs and maintaining culverts and drainage ponds, transportation, and heavy equipment costs and other costs associated with the ash disposal facility. Ash disposal expenses were $4.8 million and $3.4 million for the periods ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.       General and Administrative               The following table summarizes our general and administrative costs for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.             Year Ended December 31,          2007     2006          (in thousands)      Employee non-cash, share-based compensation     $  19,015     $  9,803    Employee-related costs        11,721        8,045    Non-cash, Arch warrants                1,692    Professional fees        4,152        4,113    Office and travel costs        3,498        2,555    Insurance and other        4,645        2,634                    Total general and administrative     $  43,031     $  28,842                            Employee non-cash, share-based compensation expenses were $19.0 million and $9.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, substantially all of which related to our Technology segment. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period ended in 2006 was primarily due to a one-time $9.8 million charge as a result of the termination of one of our executive officers and the acceleration of his restricted stock grant pursuant to his employment    35            agreement and a one-time $661,000 charge related to the departure of another executive officer and the acceleration of vesting of his restricted stock grant.            During 2005, we entered into two agreements with Arch Coal, Inc. which allowed us to evaluate the potential of constructing and operating a plant at their Coal Creek mine site and required us to issue warrants. In 2006, we extended these agreements to allow additional time for the evaluation of the project. In connection with the extension, the expiration date of the warrants was also extended and, pursuant to SFAS 123R, we were required to recognize an additional $1.7 million of non-cash expense for the year ended December 31, 2006. Based on discussions with Arch Coal, it was mutually agreed not to further extend these agreements. The first agreement expired on September 30, 2006 and the warrant agreement expired on October 31, 2006. As market conditions and other circumstances change we may enter into new agreements with Arch Coal.            Employee-related costs primarily include salaries and wages, temporary employees, bonuses, benefits, employer payroll taxes and education and training. The following table summarizes our employee-related costs related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.             Year Ended December 31,          2007     2006          (in thousands)      Technology     $  4,617     $  4,459    Plant        3,975        2,113    Mining        2,593        1,473    C-Lock        536                            Total Employee-related     $  11,721     $  8,045                            The increases for the year ended December 31, 2007 in comparison to the comparable period in 2006 were primarily due to a company-wide increase in health insurance costs and adding personnel, including plant and engineering personnel. In addition, through the acquisition of Buckeye, we incurred twelve months of expense in 2007 compared to nine months of expense in 2006. The small increase in the technology segment and the substantial increase in the plant segment were due to more corporate resources being used at our Fort Union plant during 2007 and the associated allocation of those expenses.            Professional fees include legal, audit and accounting, public relations, governmental relations and similar costs. The following table summarizes our professional fees related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.             Year Ended December 31,          2007     2006          (in thousands)      Technology     $  2,929     $  3,469    Plant        478        433    Mining        335        211    C-Lock        410                            Total Professional fees     $  4,152     $  4,113                   36                  Office and travel costs include airfare, lodging, meals, office rent, marketing, office supplies, phone, publications, subscriptions and utilities. The following table summarizes our office and travel costs related to each of our segments for years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.             Year Ended December 31,          2007     2006          (in thousands)      Technology     $  2,061     $  1,767    Plant        867        583    Mining        234        205    C-Lock        336                            Total Office and travel     $  3,498     $  2,555                            The anticipation of hiring additional employees at our corporate office led to our office expansion and relocation in May 2007, and the related increases in rent, utilities and relocation costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period ended 2006. Our travel for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased due an increase in the number of trips to our Fort Union plant as well as increased business development efforts. In addition, during the same period we incurred non-recurring charges relating to a loss on the sub-lease of our former corporate office space and moving costs.            Insurance and other costs primarily include costs related to our property and commercial liability, other insurance and all costs that cannot be categorized elsewhere and include, among other costs, various business and franchise taxes, licensing fees, repair and maintenance, engineering and technical services and director expenses. The following table summarizes our insurance and other costs related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.             Year Ended December 31,          2007     2006          (in thousands)      Technology     $  2,776     $  2,052    Plant        511        74    Mining        765        508    C-Lock        593                            Total Insurance and other     $  4,645     $  2,634                            The increase for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period ended 2006 can be attributed to the following:       A licensing fee paid to the owner of the proprietary technology for the measurement of carbon emissions related to the formation of our subsidiary, C-Lock Technology, Inc, which is reflected in the C-Lock segment;  Increase in insurance due to the acquisition of Buckeye, which is reflected in the Mining segment;  Increase in business development costs associated with the identification of key public utility leads, which are candidates for our process, and development of those leads, which is reflected in the Technology segment; and  Overall increase in property and commercial liability premiums for our Fort Union plant, which is reflected in the Plant segment.    37              Plant start-up costs               Plant start-up costs include purchased raw materials, coal transportation, outsourced engineering and technical support, fluid processing, by-products and water disposal, and employee-related costs, which are reflected in our Plant segment. Plant start-up costs remain higher than anticipated due to general start-up issues with this first-of-a-kind plant and technical and operation improvements being implemented. Plant start-up costs were $34.7 million and $26.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During the majority of the year ended December 31, 2006, we were in the construction and commissioning phases and most of the costs incurred during these phases were capitalized. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we were in the start-up phase and a higher percentage of costs associated with the operations of our Fort Union plant were expensed as incurred. In addition, non-capitalized costs increased as a result of engineering and technical work performed to improve and reconfigure our Fort Union plant.       Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization               Depreciation, depletion and amortization are comprised of (1) depreciation on our Fort Union plant using the units-of-production method, based on actual tons processed and depreciation on other fixed assets using the straight-line method; (2) depletion, based on actual tons mined at our mine sites in Ohio and Wyoming; and (3) amortization related to our patents. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses were $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $5.5 million during the same period ended 2006. The increases are primarily attributable to the acquisition of Buckeye and the related depreciation and depletion on our mine sites and property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2007.       Research and Development               Research and development costs include costs incurred to advance, test, or otherwise modify our proprietary technology or develop new technologies and primarily include costs incurred to operate and maintain our laboratory facilities and professional engineering fees related to off-site testing of our K-Fuel refined coal. Research and development costs were $876,000 and $1.4 million for the years ended 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease is primarily a result of our Fort Union plant entering the start-up phase of operation, which resulted in costs that were previously classified as research and development now being classified as plant start-up costs.       Cost of License and Consulting Revenue               Cost of license and consulting revenue includes costs to transfer our technology related to licensing and royalty agreements, including amortization of deferred royalty costs, salaries and wages of certain personnel and professional fees. Cost of licensing and consulting revenue was $77,000 and $134,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decreases in these costs were in direct correlation to the revenue recognized on the licensing agreement we entered into in 2004.       Asset Impairment Charges and Bad Debt               Asset impairment and bad debt charges were $122.7 million and $335,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2007 are as follows:       We suspended operations at our Fort Union plant and mine site to allow us focus on future K-Fuel or K-Direct plants by redirecting constrained resources, both capital and human, to focus on the commercialization of our process. We incurred impairment charges in our plant segment totalling $109.5 million.    38              Pursuant to the guidance of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", or SFAS 144, we are required to evaluate the fair value of our boiler, which is classified as held for sale. As result, of this fair value calculation we impaired the carrying value of our boiler by $7.8 million in our technology segment;  We impaired $3.6 million of capitalized costs related to projects that we abandoned and/or replaced with more cost effective projects in our plant segment; and  we impaired capital costs of 2.1 million related to a previously announced future potential project with a major utility because it was determined not to be economically feasible in our technology segment.        Other Income Expense      Interest income               Interest income was $4.3 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2007 is attributed to interest earned on our cash balance, which was significantly lower compared to the same period in 2006.       Interest expense               Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 was $3.4 million and $6,000, respectively. The interest expense relates to our long-term debt due 2012, which we completed in July 2007. We pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 8.00% per annum, due on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on February 1, 2008. For additional information, see Note 9Long-term Debt included in Item 8 of this report.       Other income (expense)               During the year ended December 31, 2007, other expense was $1.3 million as compared to $1.1 million of other income for the same period ended 2006. Pursuant to FAS 133, we estimated the fair value of the embedded derivatives as of July 30, 2007 when the notes were issued, and record those values as either assets or liabilities. In addition, we are required to evaluate the fair value of the embedded derivatives at the end of each subsequent reporting period. We recognized a decrease in the fair value of the derivatives of $1.7 million. This fair value adjustment is a non-cash item and each quarter's estimation exercise is impacted, in part, by our stock price. For additional information, see Note 9Long-term Debt included in Item 8 of this report.            On November 26, 2003, we completed an equity exchange transaction with Rio Tinto Energy America Services Company ("RTEA"), formerly Kennecott Energy Company. As a part of the exchange transaction, an intercompany working capital loan from Evergreen Energy to Pegasus Technologies Inc. with an outstanding balance of $9.4 million was exchanged for a contingent earn-out agreement of up to $9.4 million in the aggregate, plus accrued interest (prime rate plus 500 basis points), payable out of a portion of future cash flows generated by Pegasus. Due to the contingent nature of this potential stream of future cash flows, we did not recognize an asset or any associated income at the time of the exchange transaction. On May 16, 2006, RTEA entered into a transaction involving its investment in Pegasus. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement entered into between us and RTEA dated November 7, 2003, which triggered the earn-out provision, we received a payment of $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 from Pegasus as a payment in full satisfaction of the $9.4 million contingent obligation. This transaction had no effect on our note receivable from Pegasus with an outstanding balance of $87,000, net of an allowance of $1.2 million, which is included in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We have been and expect to continue to, receive payments on this note.    39        NAME="page_do13301_1_40">                 Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005        Revenue               Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $36.7 million compared to $984,000 for the same period ended December 31, 2005. The increase in revenue for the period ended December 31, 2006 is substantially related to our April 2006 acquisition of Buckeye. Our Mining segment accounted for $35.8 million in revenue for the period ended December 31, 2006.            We recognized revenue of $768,000 from the $7.5 million up-front licensing fee received in December 2004 from Cook Inlet Coal LLC in our Technology segment for the year ended December 31, 2005. To date we have completed all of our contractual deliverables for the licensing fee and are waiting for Cook Inlet Coal to provide specific site information before the next phase of revenue recognition can commence.       Coal Mining Operating Expenses               Our coal mining operating expenses include all costs associated with the mining of saleable coal and costs relating to our coal ash disposal facility at Buckeye, which principally comprises our Mining segment. Coal mining operating expenses were $32.3 million and $0 for the periods ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in coal mining operating expenses for the period ended December 31, 2006 is related to our April 2006 acquisition of Buckeye.       General and Administrative               The following table summarizes our general and administrative costs for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.             Year Ended December 31,          2006     2005          (in thousands)      Employee non-cash, share-based compensation     $  9,803     $  2,239    Employee-related costs        8,045        6,318    Non-cash, Arch warrants        1,692        5,803    Professional fees        4,113        3,418    Office and travel costs        2,555        1,445    Insurance and other        2,634        1,365                    Total general and administrative     $  28,842     $  20,588                            Employee non-cash, share-based compensation expenses were $9.8 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, substantially all of which related to our Technology segment. The increase in non-cash, share-based compensation was in direct correlation with the adoption of SFAS 123(R) as of January 1, 2006. See Note 11Stock Options, Stock Grants and Employee Benefit Plans for further discussion in Item 8 of this report. Non-cash, share based compensation in 2006 primarily related to restricted stock and option grants to our executive officers.             During 2005, we entered into two agreements with Arch Coal, Inc. which allowed us to evaluate the potential of constructing and operating a plant at their Coal Creek mine site and required us to issue warrants. In 2005, we incurred $5.8 million of non-cash expense related to the issuance of these warrants to Arch Coal, Inc. In 2006, we extended these agreements to allow additional time for the evaluation of the project. In connection with the extension, the expiration date of the warrants was also extended and, pursuant to SFAS 123R, we were required to recognize an additional $1.7 million of non-cash expense for the year ended December 31, 2006. Based on discussions with Arch Coal, it was    40           mutually agreed not to further extend these agreements. The first agreement expired on September 30, 2006 and the warrant agreement expired on October 31, 2006.            The following table summarizes our employee-related costs related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.             Year Ended December 31,          2006     2005          (in thousands)      Technology     $  4,459     $  5,716    Plant        2,113        602    Mining        1,473            C-Lock                                    Total Employee-related     $  8,045     $  6,318                            Employee-related costs were $7.6 million and $6.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increases for the year ended December 31, 2006 were primarily related to an increase in the number of employees, which increased salaries and related burdens. During 2006, we added personnel in many areas, including engineering and business development. In addition, the number of employees increased as a result of the Buckeye acquisition.             The following table summarizes our professional fees related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.             Year Ended December 31,          2006     2005          (in thousands)      Technology     $  3,469     $  3,098    Plant        433        320    Mining        211            C-Lock                                    Total Professional fees     $  4,113     $  3,418                            The increases can be attributed to a general overall increase in legal and accounting fees when compared to the same period ended 2005.            The following table summarizes our office and travel costs related to each of our segments for years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.             Year Ended December 31,          2006     2005          (in thousands)      Technology     $  1,767     $  1,011    Plant        583        434    Mining        205            C-Lock                                    Total Office and travel     $  2,555     $  1,445                            The majority of the increase is attributed to our increase in the number of employees at our corporate office and as a result of our acquisition of Buckeye. In addition, we increased our travel    41           related to our expanded business development efforts, including travel to our Ohio subsidiary and travel to identify potential sites for future plants. We also saw an increase in travel to our Fort Union plant site by non-plant related employees and management in 2006, as the plant entered the startup phase.             The following table summarizes our insurance and other costs related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.             Year Ended December 31,          2006     2005          (in thousands)      Technology     $  2,052     $  1,029    Plant        74        336    Mining        508            C-Lock                                    Total Insurance and other     $  2,634     $  1,365                            The increase can be attributed primarily to an overall increase in property and commercial liability premiums for our corporate and our Buckeye operations.       Plant start-up costs               Plant start-up costs were $26.3 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Plant start-up costs were higher than anticipated due to general start up issues with this first-of-a-kind plant and the acceleration of initial production runs. The commissioning of the facility at this accelerated pace resulted in a number of plant operating inefficiencies. We incurred higher feed stock costs as we chose to purchase coal from a nearby mine and incurred trucking costs for the transportation of that purchased coal. Outsourced engineering and employee-related costs were incurred to assist with the acceleration of the initial production. The water handling system was limited in its ability to process water from the production process. Disposal of this excess water required utilizing third parties to transport water to approved disposal sites. This resulted in higher water disposal costs.       Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization               Depreciation, depletion and amortization are comprised of depreciation on our Fort Union plant using the units-of-production method, based on actual tons processed and depreciation on other fixed assets using the straight-line method, depletion, based on actual tons mined at our mine sites in Ohio and Wyoming, and amortization related to our patents. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses were $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $773,000 during the same period ended 2005. The increases are primarily attributable to the acquisition of Buckeye in the second quarter of 2006.       Research and Development               Research and development costs were $1.4 million and $1.6 million for the years ended 2006 and 2005, respectively.       Cost of License and Consulting Revenue               Cost of licensing and consulting revenue was $134,000 and $401,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decreases in these costs were in direct correlation to the revenue recognized in 2005 on the licensing agreement we entered into in 2004.    42            Asset Impairment Charges and bad debt               Asset impairment and bad debt charges were $335,000 and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2006, we wrote off $295,000 of certain site specific costs, which we were evaluating for a future K-Fuel facility.            Through a series of transactions, Pegasus became indebted to us for $2.7 million. We have rights to collect payments under this note from Pegasus and to demand payment upon certain events of default. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we determined that Pegasus might not have sufficient contracts to continue to meet this obligation. Therefore, we have recorded an allowance for bad debt for the note receivable of $1.3 million. Despite this allowance, we retain all of our rights to collect payments under this note from Pegasus and to demand payment upon certain events of default.       Interest Income               Interest income was $5.6 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase is attributed to interest earned on our cash balance, which was significantly higher compared to the same period in 2005, primarily as a result of our public stock offering in February of 2006.       Other income, net               Other income was $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.            In 2003, we completed an equity exchange transaction pursuant to which we transferred our interest in Pegasus Technologies, Inc. for full ownership of K-Fuel LLC, now part of a wholly owned subsidiary named KFx Technology, LLC. As a part of this exchange transaction, we exchanged an intercompany working capital loan with Pegasus with an outstanding balance of $9.4 million for a contingent earn-out agreement of up to $9.4 million in the aggregate, plus accrued interest (prime rate plus 500 basis points), payable out of a portion of future cash flows generated by Pegasus. Due to the contingent nature of this potential stream of future cash flows, we did not recognize an asset or any associated income at the time of the exchange transaction. As a result of a transfer of ownership interests, the earn-out provisions were triggered and we received a payment of $1.1 million from Pegasus as a payment in full satisfaction of the $9.4 million obligation.    2008 Liquidity and Capital Resources Discussion             Our cash will primarily be used to fund corporate operations and for capital expenditures for future K-Fuel and/or K-Direct facilities and corporate purposes. Our capital expenditures for 2008 are expected to be less than $10 million which includes Buckeye mining and development costs, and costs associated with K-Fuel and K-Direct facilities. We expect that our capital expenditures budget for 2008 may increase as we proceed with the potential construction of future K-Fuel plants and obtain additional funding for these projects. In July 2007, the fabricator of the boiler island completed certain fabrication and engineering work which provided an appropriate point to temporarily suspend construction. We have classified this boiler as held for sale in the amount of $18.6 million. We agreed with the fabricator to suspend further construction on the boiler. Effective January 31, 2008, we and the fabricator of the boiler island agreed to terminate the contract and as a result, all future financial obligations were also terminated. We have been in discussions with several potential buyers for the sale of this boiler and anticipate the consummation of this sale in the future.            We believe because of the decision to suspend operations and construction at our Fort Union plant and mine sites, along with the anticipated cash flows from our Buckeye operations, that our current cash level is sufficient to support our corporate operations, including starting preliminary site investigation, design, permitting and similar long-lead-time activities related to K-Fuel plants and/or    43           K-Direct plants located at coal-fired power generating and industrial facilities for at least the next twelve months. However, as we identify strategic opportunities to accelerate projects of large-scale commercial K-Fuel facilities and/or K-Direct facilities, or other agreements such as joint ventures, we will need to obtain additional funding. We plan to seek additional capital from time to time as needed principally through: (1) equity offerings or the exercise of outstanding options and warrants; (2) debt offerings; and (3) partnering with third parties in the construction and operation for some of our large-scale commercial plants through the formation of joint ventures. While we believe we will obtain additional capital through one or more of the alternatives described, we can provide no assurance that any of the alternatives will be available to us or be on terms acceptable to us.            On July 30, 2007, we completed the sale of $95.0 million of long-term debt due 2012 that was resold in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes are senior, secured obligations guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiary, Evergreen Operations, LLC, and its subsidiaries, and secured by a first-priority security interest in (1) all of our equity interests in Evergreen Operations, LLC, (2) an escrow account established in connection with the offering, and (3) our and each of our subsidiaries' bank, investment, brokerage or similar accounts holding cash and cash equivalents, subject to certain exceptions. We will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 8.00% per annum, due on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on February 1, 2008. The notes mature on August 1, 2012. We incurred costs of $6.0 million in connection with the sale of the notes. Pursuant to the offering, we deposited $18.0 million of the net proceeds in the escrow account referred to above. We plan on using the remaining proceeds for Buckeye capital expenditures, for general corporate purposes and future construction of K-Fuel or K-Direct facilities.             If (1) the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in any 30 consecutive trading day period is at least the conversion price, or the reduced interest rate threshold, and (2) if the shelf registration statement covering resales of the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes is effective and available for use for at least 30 days following the reduced interest rate threshold, unless registration is no longer required, then the initial interest rate will be permanently decreased to 5.00%. In addition, if (1) the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in any 30 consecutive trading day period is at least 130% of the then applicable conversion price, or the collateral release threshold, and (2) if the shelf registration statement covering resales of the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes is effective and available for use for at least 30 days following the collateral release threshold, unless registration is no longer required, then the security will be released, including the $18.0 million held in escrow, and the notes will become automatically subordinated. At such time as the security is released, we may redeem the notes at a redemption price payable in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest and an additional "coupon make-whole payment." The "coupon make-whole" amount per $1,000 principal amount of notes will be equal to the present value of all remaining scheduled payments of interest on each note to be redeemed through the maturity date. On October 29, 2007, we and the subsidiary guarantors filed a post-effective amendment and prospectus supplement to our shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the resale of the notes, guarantees and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes. The registration statement, post-effective amendment and prospectus supplement were automatically effective upon filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.            In February 2006, we sold approximately 8.1 million shares of common stock at a price to the public of $18.75 per share pursuant to a follow-on common stock offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $144.6 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We used part of the proceeds from this offering to fund the acquisition of Buckeye and the construction of our Fort Union plant. We plan on using the remaining funds for new K-Fuel and K-Direct facility construction costs and general corporate purposes.    44          Payment Obligations             The following table summarizes our future commitments as of December 31, 2007:             Payments due by period          2008     2009     2010     2011     2012     Thereafter     Total          (in thousands)      Operating leases     $  1,731     $  1,748     $  1,444     $  1,186     $  1,175     $  28,185     $  35,469    Capital lease and other obligations        111                                                111    Consulting and service commitments        776        500        500        500        500        10,000        12,776    Long-term debt        7,600        7,600        7,600        7,600        102,606                133,006                                        Total commitments     $  10,218     $  9,848     $  9,544     $  9,286     $  104,281     $  38,185     $  181,362                                                This table does not include accounts payable, accrued expenses, or asset retirement obligations, which are reported in our December 31, 2007 Consolidated Balance Sheet. We generally have not included any obligation in which either party has the right to terminate except as discussed below. Additionally, we have not included royalty payments, as we cannot presently determine when such payments will be made as such payments are based upon our receipt of cash for licensing and royalties.            We are obligated under non-cancelable operating leases with initial terms exceeding one year relating to office space. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $784,000, $415,000 and $242,000, respectively. Additionally, included in operating leases is the rent obligation associated with our former headquarters totaling $942,000 a portion of which we have sub-leased but are not released from the obligation. Furthermore, included in operating leases is a dock lease on the Ohio River, which we have the right to cancel upon six months written notice. If this lease were cancelled as of December 31, 2007, we would be obligated to pay $250,000 rather than the entire obligation of $24.5 million reflected in the above table.            Consulting and service commitments include an exclusive patent sub-license agreement with the developer of a proprietary technology for the measurement of carbon emissions. The agreement provides us with an exclusive worldwide sub-license to a technology to standardize the measurement of carbon emissions in energy and agricultural related activities. The agreement was amended and restated to expand the energy and agricultural activities to all applications of the technology and to eliminate other operating requirements. In order to maintain this licensing arrangement, we are required to make minimum annual royalty payments of $500,000 to the developer of the proprietary technology, with each payment extending the arrangement for one year if the parties are in material compliance with the contract. Additionally, consulting and service commitments includes our amended and restated our umbrella agreement with Bechtel. Through this new program management agreement, we committed to provide Bechtel with $1 billion in construction contracts through 2013. Failure to meet this commitment by 2014 could cost us up to the $10 million in termination fees, which is included in the above table.            Long-term debt includes our principal amount due 2012 and the 8% interest payments.    Historical View        Cash Used in Operating Activities               Cash used in operating activities was $51.6 million, $30.4 million and $12.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The majority of the cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 relates to cash utilized in our on-going operations, as adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The most significant adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2007 was a $122.7 million impairment charges. Other significant adjustments to net loss to arrive at cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were: non-cash compensation expense of $19.6 million and $11.5 million    45          in 2007 and 2006, respectively and depreciation, depletion and amortization of $8.4 million and $5.5 million, respectively, primarily from the acquisition of Buckeye. The most significant adjustments to net loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 were non-cash expense related to the issuance of warrants and options to employees, directors and consultants of $11.0 million and a $1.3 million non-cash charge to establish an allowance for a note receivable.       Cash Used in Investing Activities               Cash used in investing activities was $50.2 million and $110.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of the uses of cash relate to the following:       We paid $36.9 million to consummate the Buckeye acquisition in 2006.  We purchased $74.6 million and $113.3 million of marketable securities and received $101.7 million and $85.6 million in proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  We spent $49.4 million and $41.5 million primarily on our Fort Union plant and future plant sites for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  We had capital expenditures related to other purchases of property and equipment of $4.1 million and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and $1.0 million for purchases of mineral rights and mine development for the year ended December 31, 2006.  In 2007, we were required to restrict cash and marketable securities to serve as collateral of $24.7 million, related to our $95 million long-term debt due 2012 and to collateralize other contractual obligations and our asset retirement obligations.             Cash used in investing activities was $73.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The majority of the uses of cash related to the following;       We spent $47.1 million on our Fort Union plant.  We purchased $54.7 million of marketable securities and received $30.8 million in proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities.  We had capital expenditures related to other purchases of property and equipment of $851,000.  We were required to restrict $1.8 million of cash and marketable securities to collateralize other contractual obligations and our asset retirement obligation.      Cash Provided by Financing Activities               Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $96.1 million compared to $169.1 million for the same period ended 2006. The majority of the cash provided and used by financing activities relate to the following:       We received $95.0 million from the issuance of long-term debt and paid $5.8 million in debt issuance costs during the year ended December 31, 2007.  We received $144.6 million of cash from our public offering in February 2006.  We received $4.9 million and $24.6 million in proceeds from the exercises of stock options and warrants during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively             Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $11.5 million. We received cash related to the exercise of options and warrants of $11.7 million.    46        NAME="page_dq13301_1_47">                   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates             We have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our current and future business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies, see the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These policies and estimates are considered "critical" because they either had a material impact or they have the potential to have a material impact on our financial statements, and because they require significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. The preparation of our financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect both the results of operations as well as the carrying values of our assets and liabilities. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base estimates on historical experience and/or on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the near term. Set forth below is a summary of our most critical accounting policies.            Revenue recognition.     We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, generally when an agreement has been signed, all significant obligations have been satisfied, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Any up-front fees received are deferred and recognized over the provision of specific deliverables as defined in the agreements. As our history related to customer relationships is limited, we may be required to change the estimated period over which we recognize our revenue as more information becomes available. Arrangements that include multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine whether the elements are separable based on objective evidence. If the elements are deemed separable, total consideration is allocated to each element and the revenue associated with each element is recognized as earned. If the elements are not deemed separable, total consideration is deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual period or the expected customer relationship period. We believe that the accounting estimates related to customer relationship periods and to the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable are "critical accounting estimates" because: (1) they require management to make assumptions about how long we will retain customers, for which we have limited history; (2) the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable can be subjective; and (3) the impact of changes in actual retention periods versus these estimates on the revenue amounts reported in our consolidated statements of operations could be material.            Accounts and notes receivable and allowances.     Receivables are recorded at their estimated net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the past-due status of receivables and assessments of risk regarding collectability. If the financial condition of the customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.             Capitalization of Costs.     Generally, we expense plant start-up costs as incurred that do not extend the life of the plant or increase production volumes. In addition, we expense mine exploration costs as incurred. Once it has been determined that it is economically feasible to extract coal, we begin to capitalize these costs as premining costs. We have identified the commencement of permitting as the point to begin capitalizing premining costs. Judgment is exercised in determining (i) if costs extend the life of the plant; (ii) if costs increase plant production volumes; and (iii) the feasibility of extracting coal. If these judgments are incorrect, we may capitalize more costs than we otherwise should.            Mineral rights and mine development.     A significant portion of our coal reserves are controlled through leasing arrangements. Costs to obtain coal lands and leased mineral rights, including    47           capitalized premining costs, are capitalized and depleted to operations using the units-of-production method based on tons produced utilizing only proven and recoverable reserves in the depletion base and are assumed to have no residual value. Premining costs include drilling, permitting, county and state filing fees and the initial overburden removal. We used assumptions such as selling price of coal, costs to mine and a discount rate to value our mines at Buckeye. If the assumptions used to value the proven and recoverable reserves change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.            Useful lives of our long-lived assets.     Selecting the useful lives of long-lived assets to be depreciated, depleted or amortized requires a significant amount of judgment. We placed our Fort Union plant into service in the third quarter of 2006. As this is the first-of-its-kind plant, assumptions were made in order to estimate the total expected production for the life of the plant. These assumptions were primarily based upon research and inquiry of our engineers.            Valuation of long-lived assets.     The valuation of our long-lived and intangible assets, including our Fort Union plant, mineral rights and patents, have significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We must assess the realizable value of these assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of these assets, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. The estimates and assumptions related to our Fort Union plant are particularly difficult to determine as it is a first-of-its-kind facility. In addition, we must make assumptions regarding the useful lives of these assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.            Asset retirement obligations.     We are required to record the fair value of legally required removal costs and retirement obligations as a liability and we also recorded an offsetting asset. Initially, our asset retirement obligations were recorded at their fair value using an expected cash flow approach, in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflected the range of possible outcomes and a credit-adjusted risk-free rate were applied. The liability is then accreted over time by applying the interest method of allocation. In determining the initial liability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. In addition, the rate of accretion is based upon our best estimate of the rate at which cost to complete the reclamation will increase. If these estimates and their related assumptions are incorrect or change in the future, we may be required to increase our obligation.            Accounting for stock grants, options and warrants.     We issue stock grants, options and warrants to employees, board of directors and consultants in connection with our various business activities. In accounting for these awards we are required to make estimates of the fair value of the related instruments, the periods benefited and forfeiture rates. These estimates may affect such financial statement categories as stockholders' equity and general and administrative expense. If these estimates are incorrect, we may be required to incur additional expense in the future.            Accounting for derivative financial instruments.     Derivatives may be embedded in financial instruments (the "host instrument"). Embedded derivatives are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not clearly and closely related to those of the host instrument, the terms of the embedded derivative are similar to those of a stand-alone derivative and the combined contract is not held for trading or designated at fair value. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value and any subsequent changes are recognized in the statement of operations. We are required to make estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, estimating the future market price of our common stock and probability of a change in control. If these assumptions and estimates are incorrect, we may be required to incur additional expense in the future. If our expected volatility of our common stock decreased by 10%, the impact would have been an increase in other    48           expenses of $420,000. If our expected volatility of our common stock increased by 10%, the impact would have been an increase in other income of $330,000.             Accounting for acquisitions.     The acquisition of businesses is an important element of our strategy. We are required to record the net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect our financial statements. For example, the value and estimated life of assets may affect the amount of future period depletion and depreciation expense for the assets as well as possible impairment charges that may be incurred.             Marketable securities     We classify our marketable securities as available for sale. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had available-for-sale investments in auction rate securities ("ARS") with a carrying value of $29.5 million and $41.8 million as of December 31, 2006. The types of ARS investments that we own are backed by student loans, the majority of which are guaranteed under the Federal Family Education Loan Program ("FFELP"), and all had credit ratings of AAA or Aaa when purchased. The interest rates on these ARS are reset every 7 to 35 days by an auction process.            Historically, these types of ARS investments have been highly liquid. As a result of the recent liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets, in February and March 2008, auctions for a certain ARS investment held by us failed. The recent uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us and other investors from liquidating the holdings of auction rate securities in recent auctions for these securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders.            The carrying value of our investments in ARS as of December 31, 2007 represents our best estimate of the fair value of these investments based on currently available information. The estimated fair value calculated at December 31, 2007 was determined to be the carrying value as of December 31, 2007. The estimation process included consideration of such factors as issuer and insurer credit rating, comparable market data, if available, credit enhancement structures, projected yields, discount rates and terminal periods. Due to the uncertainty in the credit markets, it is reasonably possible the fair value of these investments may change in the near term. If the credit markets recover and successful auctions resume, we may be able to recover an amount greater than the carrying value of the ARS as of December 31, 2007, which would result in a gain. However, if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may be required to adjust the carrying value of its investment in ARS through impairment charges.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements             On July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109," ("FIN 48") which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This Interpretation requires that we recognize, in our consolidated financial statements, the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The provisions of FIN 48 were effective as of January 1, 2007. We have evaluated our tax positions and determined that the adoption of this pronouncement did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.            In September 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, or SAB No. 108, "Financial Statement Misstatements." SAB No. 108 expresses the SEC staff's view regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements. The Interpretations in SAB No. 108 was issued to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential under current practice for the build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet. SAB No. 108 is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal    49           year ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results our operations.             In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement". This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the Financial Accounting Standards Board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurements. However, for some entities, the application of this statement will change current practice. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are in the process of evaluating the impacts, if any, of adopting this pronouncement.            In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, as part of an effort to conform to international accounting standards, issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections," which was effective for us beginning on January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 154 requires that all voluntary changes in accounting principles be retrospectively applied to prior financial statements as if that principle had always been used, unless it is impracticable to do so. When it is impracticable to calculate the effects on all prior periods, SFAS No. 154 requires that the new principle be applied to the earliest period practicable. Since adoption, SFAS No. 154 has not had a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.    ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK             In addition to risks inherent in operations, we are exposed to the following market risks in our business:            Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to commodity price risk. We expect to consume 1.7 million to 1.9 million gallons of fuel per year. On a per gallon basis, based on this usage, a change in fuel prices of one cent per gallon would result in an increase in our operating costs of approximately $17,000 per year. Alternatively, a one dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs by approximately $680,000.            Ignoring embedded derivatives, we own (or hold) no derivative instruments or floating rate debt and do not expect to derive a material amount of our revenues from such interest bearing securities. Currently, we have no significant foreign operations. We were required to establish an irrevocable standby letter of credit in Euros, which will be adjusted to account for the change in foreign currency rates. As these adjustments are made we will either increase or decrease our restricted cash balance. At this time we are still evaluating our exposure to these foreign currency rate adjustments. However, to the extent that we establish significant foreign operations in the future, we may attempt to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates contractually and through the use of hedging activities and other means considered appropriate. We hold no equity market securities, which are subject to equity market risk relative to our own equity securities.            ITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
