OVERVIEW    Through the acquisition of 60% of Pegasus in early 1998, KFx significantly broadened its technology solutions, by adding NeuSIGHT(R), Pegasus' neural network based combustion optimization software, to K-Fuel Technology, its patented clean coal technology.  This step was taken in order to better meet the evolving needs of the electric power industry that are being stimulated by domestic industry deregulation and increasingly stringent air quality standards worldwide. In August 1999, KFx increased its ownership of Pegasus to 75% and during 2000, KFx sold 4% of its interest in Pegasus to Kennecott Energy for $1,000,000,  KFx converted $3.6 million of debt Pegasus owed to it into convertible preferred stock and Kennecott Energy invested $2,000,000 into Pegasus in the form of convertible preferred stock.  During 2001, KFx closed transactions with various parties pursuant to which KFx sold all of its Pegasus Preferred Stock, representing an approximate 16.0% as converted interest in Pegasus, for $2,722,330.  KFx is obligated to repurchase this Preferred Stock, or any other security issued with respect to this Preferred Stock, for $3,847,562 at various dates during 2002, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a change in control. Also during 2002, KFx received 919,416 shares of Pegasus Common Stock in exchange for the guarantee of Pegasus' obligations relating to the Pavilion acquisition and warrants issued in conjunction with the Cinergy advance to Pegasus.    As a result of the additional investments of Kennecott Energy in Pegasus Preferred Stock and the grant of Pegasus Common Stock to KFx subsequent to December 31, 2001, the ownership of Pegasus at April                                        35   12, 2002 is approximately as follows: KFx--52%, Pegasus founders--14%, Kennecott Energy--18%, Evergreen Resources, Inc.--9% and other private investors--7%.    Pegasus operations in 2001 were significantly hampered by ambiguities in the power generation industry as to the manner of achieving compliance with certain aspects of the CAA, due to legal challenges brought against certain EPA initiatives directed at the reduction of NO\\x\\ emissions as well as a patent infringement suit brought by Pavilion in the third quarter of 2000, which was ultimately settled in July 2001 with the Pegasus acquisition of the Pavilion Power Optimization Division and the addition of the Pavilion software products to the Pegasus suite of product offerings.  See also Part I--Item 3--Legal Proceedings.    During 2000 and early 2001, various court actions affirmed most of the EPA's NO\\x\\ initiatives as well as EPA's authority to promulgate these and similar air quality regulations (which authority had been legally challenged). Accordingly, the power generation industry is resuming efforts to determine the manner in which it will comply with the EPA NO\\x\\ initiatives.    In 2001, Cinergy Corp. awarded Pegasus a contract to install its NeuSIGHT software at 24 of its coal-fired boiler units.  Per the terms of the contract, these installations must be completed by May 2004.  This contract represents the first system-wide contract for a neural network optimization product awarded in the utility industry.  Management believes that this contract demonstrates Pegasus is a leader in boiler optimization because Cinergy selected the Pegasus technology after a careful analysis of optimization technologies available in the market.  Pegasus believes that this contract will be important in persuading other utilities to adopt Pegasus' software products for their boiler units.    During 2001, Pegasus added the Pavilion technology software to its suite of product offerings and initiated VAR agreements or exclusive licensing arrangements in China, Poland and South Africa with experienced local partners with strong domestic ties to electric utilities in their respective countries. Despite the difficulties imposed by the legal challenges to the EPA's NO\\x\\ initiatives and the Pavilion lawsuit, Pegasus achieved improved revenue growth from 2000 to 2001 of 58% compared to a 23% increase in revenues from 1999 to 2000.    Progress to commercialize K-Fuel Technology continued during 2001 with the announcement of the successful demonstration of an improved coal upgrading process resulting from the joint efforts of KFx and Kennecott Energy, through the K-Fuel, LLC joint venture. This 16-month project, performed by Kennecott Energy's affiliate, Rio Tinto Technical Services, evaluated historical information, issues impacting the operations of the existing Gillette commercial K-Fuel facility, off-the-shelf equipment, and methods to achieve continuous operations to improve the economics of the production process. The principal differences from the K-Fuel Series C process previously used are continuous operations, lower temperatures, and the absence of superheat from the system. The resulting product, which in the tests was produced from PRB coals, is low in SO\\2\\, NO\\x\\, mercury and chlorine, similar to K-Fuel.    Even with the positive items noted above, along with the increased number of contracts entered into by Pegasus, the Company continued to experience operating and net losses and continues to have a negative equity balance. The Company will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of indebtedness and to fund working capital requirements and capital expenditures. The Company will be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements. The Company currently does not have any commitments with respect to any funding and cannot be assured that such additional funding will be available at all or on terms satisfactory to us. A lack of adequate financing may adversely affect our ability to make necessary payments on our indebtedness, respond to changing business and economic conditions and competitive pressures, absorb continued negative operating results or fund capital expenditures or increased working capital requirements. The Company intends to seek further capital through various means which may include the sale of a portion of its interest in Pegasus, additional sales of debt or equity securities, a business combination, or other means and to further reduce expenditures as necessary. Should the Company not be successful in achieving additional financing, it is possible that the Company may not be able to continue as a going concern.                                        36     On May 9, 2000, the Company closed a series of agreements with various parties intended to initiate the redevelopment of the KFP Facility. Among other things, as a result of these agreements (a) a subsidiary of Black Hills Corporation (BKH) purchased the KFP Facility and received 2 million shares of KFx common stock previously held by TCK in exchange for the assumption of the reclamation liability associated with the KFP Facility, (b) KFx granted BKH a warrant to purchase 1.3 million shares of KFx common stock at $3.65 per share, subject to certain adjustments, (c) KFx relinquished its 5% interest in KFP to TCK and provided certain releases to TCK in exchange for approximately $1.5 million, (d) TCK sold the remaining 2.25 million common shares of KFx it owned to private investors and canceled the warrants it held to purchase a control position in KFx's common stock.  KFx currently has no investment in the plant and has no obligation to assist in the restart of this facility.    During 2001 and before, management of the Company has been evaluating various alternatives to raise capital and improve its balance sheet.   The Pavilion Lawsuit filed in the third quarter of 2000, precluded many of the options that had been considered, some of which were in the process of being implemented at the time the Pavilion Lawsuit was filed.  With the 2001 settlement of the Pavilion Lawsuit, and subsequent acquisition of the Pavilion Power Optimization Division, the Company immediately resumed its efforts to raise needed capital for Pegasus and KFx.  During 2001, the Company issued 1 million shares of common stock at $3.65 per share in a private placement, resulting in net proceeds of $3.5 million.  In March 2002, the Company issued 2 million shares of common stock at $2.50 per share in a private placement, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $4.85 million.  The Company is continuing its efforts to raise needed capital for Pegasus and KFx.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES    We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 14 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, beginning on page F-8.  .  Revenue recognition. Our revenue recognition policy is significant because    our revenue is a key component of our results of operations. In addition, our    revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses, such as    license fees and commissions. We follow very specific and detailed guidelines    in measuring revenue; however, certain judgments affect the application of    our revenue policy such as estimating the percentage-of-completion on fixed    price contracts. Revenue results are difficult to predict, and any shortfall    in revenue, delay in recognizing revenue or project overruns could cause our    operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could    result in future operating losses. A detailed description of our revenue    recognition policy is included in the Notes to the Financial Statements.  .  Accounting Estimates. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and    results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have    been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in    the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements    requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts    of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of    contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our    estimates, including those related to project completion, prepaid assets, bad    debts, warranty obligations, fair value of equity instruments, stock    appreciation rights, classification of assets and liabilities, contingencies    and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various    other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,    the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying    values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other    sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from    these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  .  Acquisition Accounting. The acquisition of the Power Optimization Division of    Pavilion Technologies, Inc. has been accounted for under the purchase method    of accounting for business combinations. Under the purchase method of    accounting, the cost, including transaction costs, of approximately $7.5    million was allocated to the underlying net assets of the Division acquired,    based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase    price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired was recorded    as goodwill.       The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected    useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can    significantly impact net income. For example, different classes of assets    will have useful lives that differ-the useful life of a customer contact list    may not be the same as the useful life of maintenance contracts acquired.    Consequently, to the extent a longer-lived asset is assigned greater value    under the purchase method than a shorter-lived asset, there may be less    amortization recorded in a given period.       Determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is    judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and    assumptions. As provided by the accounting rules, we will use the one-year    period following the consummation of the acquisition to finalize estimates of    the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. One of the areas that    requires more judgment in determining fair values and useful lives is    intangible assets. To assist in this process, we obtained appraisals from an    independent valuation firm for certain intangible assets. While there were a    number of different methods used in estimating the value of the intangibles    acquired, there were two approaches used: replacement cost and income    approaches. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent    in the two approaches include: projected future cash flows (including    timing); discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows;    and perpetual growth rate. Most of the above assumptions were made based on    available historical information.       The value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, is exposed to    future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or    experience significant negative industry or economic trends or if future    performance is below historical trends. The Company periodically reviews    intangible assets and goodwill for impairment using the guidance of    applicable accounting literature.       In the first six months of 2002, we will adopt new rules for measuring the    impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets. The estimates and    assumptions described above, as well as the determination as to how goodwill    will be allocated to our operating segments, will impact the amount of    impairment to be recognized upon adoption of the new accounting standard. We    anticipate that these impairment tests will not have a material impact on our    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.                                        37   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Year Ended December 31, 2001 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2000    The consolidating operating loss in 2001 of $9,620,186, which includes $4,172,650 of non-cash charges, was $621,781, or 6.9%, greater than the 2000 operating loss.  Pegasus' portion of the operating loss in 2001 was $3,489,709, which was an improvement of $641,585, or 15.5%, compared to the corresponding $4,131,294 operating loss in 2000.  The improvement in the Pegasus operating loss was due mainly to a significant increase in customer orders and efficiencies gained in installations during 2001.  The gross margin for Pegasus' installations increased to 34% from 6% in the prior year.  The combined K-Fuel segment and corporate cost portion of the operating loss for 2001 was $6,130,477 compared to $4,867,111, an increase of $1,263,366, or 26.0%.  The increased loss can be attributed to the increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses of $1,860,129, or 83.3%, from the prior year.  The increase is primarily due to increased professional fees for legal and consulting services, relating to various financing arrangements that took place during 2001, in addition to $762,144 relating to the final payment for our Chairman's note to the State of Wyoming in return for a 12% royalty interest held by the state.    Consolidated operating revenues increased $878,287, or 41.3%, from 2000 to 2001.  Pegasus' revenues for 2001 are $3,003,057, an increase of $1,108,063, or 58.4% due to increased executed orders during 2001 mainly from the Cinergy Fleetwide Agreement along with recognition of the revenue from the installation completed in Poland and the Gateway license fee.  The increase in consolidated revenues was offset by the decline in K-Fuel contract revenues in 2001 because there were no contract projects during 2001.  The K-Fuel contract revenues are derived from contracts negotiated with a third party who funds individual research projects.  Each contract with this third party is negotiated separately as research projects arise.  These contracts occur intermittently and there may not be a new project each year.  The absence of such a contract in 2001 resulted in a decrease of $229,776 compared to 2000.    Consolidated operating costs and expenses in 2001 exceeded 2000 by $1,500,068, or 13.5%.  Pegasus' operating costs for 2001 are $6,492,766, an increase of $466,478, or 7.7% compared to 2000.  The increase can be attributed to a) an increase in amortization expense of $198,110 mainly due to the amortization of intangibles purchased from Pavilion, b) an increase in research and development costs of $40,176, and c) an increase in headcount primarily to support the increase in contracts entered into during 2001.  At December 31, 2001, Pegasus had 32 full time employees compared to 23 full time employees at December 31, 2000.  The increases in costs were offset by a reduction in professional fees primarily due to the reduction in legal fees incurred during the Pavilion lawsuit and the realization of reduced sales and marketing expenses due to headcount reductions in those areas in 2000.  The operating costs for the K-Fuel segment and corporate cost portion for 2001 are $6,130,477, an increase of $1,033,590, or 20.3%, compared to 2000.  The increase is primarily due to the increase in professional fees for legal and consulting services, relating to various financing arrangements that took place during 2001, in addition to $762,144 relating to the final payment for our Chairman's note to the State of Wyoming.  These increases were offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of $265,984 primarily due to the full amortization of most Series "A" and "B" patents by the end of 2000 and the decrease of $560,555 in the costs at the K-Fuel demonstration plant due to the suspension of certain contract activities during 2001.    Non-operating items added $5,556,890 to the Company's net loss in 2001, an increase of $2,265,123, or 68,8%, compared to $3,291,767 in 2000.  The increase is primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $2,822,061, or 106.3%, offset by a reduction in the impairment loss recognized in 2000 of $629,000. Interest expense increased due mainly to the accretion for the maturity premium of $1,063,520 relating to the Company's convertible debentures and the sales of Pegasus preferred stock and the amortization of the debt discount of $2,998,352 relating to the Cinergy convertible debt, the Company's convertible debentures and the Evergreen Resources, Inc. preferred stock transaction.    As a result of the above factors, the consolidated net loss of $15,177,076 ($.58 per share) for 2001 was $2,886,904 ($.09 per share), or 23.5%, greater than the net loss in 2000.  Included in the year to date net                                        38   losses were non-cash charges approximating $8,391,179 and $5,814,864, respectively. Non-cash charges for the current year included depreciation and amortization, accretion of maturity premium, amortization of debt discount and the cost of common stock and warrants issued for services. Non-cash charges for the prior year included depreciation and amortization, impairment losses, accretion of maturity premium, amortization of debt discount and the cost of common stock and warrants issued for services.    The Company has not recorded a deferred tax benefit from KFx's and Pegasus' net operating loss carryforwards, which approximate $49,439,000 and $8,198,000, respectively, at December 31, 2001, since, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company's deferred tax assets will not be realized. Certain limitations apply to the annual amount of net operating losses that can be used to offset taxable income, after certain ownership changes, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 382").  Although management does not believe Section 382 places significant limitations on the use of the Company's net operating loss carryforwards presently, transactions that may be consummated in order to obtain needed financing may result in ownership changes that are large enough to trigger the Section 382 limitations. In the event the Company achieves profitable operations and taxable income, any significant Section 382 limitation would have the effect of increasing the Company's income tax liability and reducing available cash resources.  Year Ended December 31, 2000 vs. Year Ended December 31, 1999    The consolidated operating loss in 2000 of $8,998,405, which includes $3,575,622 of non-cash charges, was $1,521,363, or 20%, greater than the 1999 operating loss due primarily to (a) a K-Fuel license fee in 1999 that contributed $750,000 to operating income, with no similar fee in 2000, (b) a non-cash charge approximating $464,000 at the K-Fuel segment due to the write- down of certain idle equipment (c) an increase approximating $865,000 in operating losses at Pegasus offset by (d) reduced KFx corporate and other costs and losses approximating $505,000.    Consolidated operating revenues decreased approximately $726,000, or 25% from 1999 to 2000 due primarily to (a) the $1 million K-Fuel license fee from Kennecott Energy in 1999 only, offset by (b) an increase in Pegasus revenues approximating $358,000, or 23%.    Consolidated operating costs and expenses in 2000 exceeded the 1999 level by approximately $795,000, or 8%.  Pegasus operating cost increases of approximately $1,223,000 (25%) and the K-Fuel idle equipment write-down of $464,0000 were offset by the absence of K-Fuel royalty expense in 2000, that was $250,000 in 1999, a reduction in other operating costs of the K-Fuel demonstration plant and laboratory approximating $121,000, or 37%, due to reduced contract revenue and related activity level  and  cost reductions at the KFx corporate level approximating $505,000 (16%), resulting from staff reductions and various other costs reduction measures.    Pegasus cost increases from 1999 to 2000 included (a) an increase in cost of sales of $594,000 (50%) resulting from the 23% increase in sales as well as increased costs associated with ensuring the completion of certain installations to the satisfaction of customers, (b) a $279,000 (83%) increase in research and development as a result of more focus on product improvement and new product development resulting in part from Kennecott Energy's investments in Pegasus, and (c) a $129,000 (21%) increase in depreciation and amortization largely due to $115,000 (22%) of additional goodwill amortization stemming from an addition to goodwill in late 1999.  Marketing, general and administrative costs for Pegasus increased by approximately $221,000 (8%) from 1999 to 2000, largely due to certain internal costs associated with the Pavilion Lawsuit that are not subject to indemnification.    Declines in KFx corporate and other costs included (a) $457,000 (17%) in reduced marketing, general and administrative expenses, resulting from reducing staff and executive office space and related expenses, and (b) $48,000 (9%) in reduced depreciation and amortization of debt issue costs resulting from the conversion of $1.9 million of Debentures during 2000.    Partially offsetting the variances from 1999 to 2000 in the Company's operating loss, the Company experienced a $1,962,000 net decrease in net non- operating expense items from 1999 to 2000. This decrease was primarily due to the net result of (a) a $4,000,000 impairment loss in 1999 related to the                                        39   Company's investment in KFP compared to a $629,000 impairment loss in 2000 related to the Company's investment in Charco Redondo, (b) the recognition, beginning in 2000 of, the accretion of the maturity premium on the Company's Debentures, which totaled $1,362,000, and is included in interest expense, (c) a decline in interest and other income approximating $359,000, due largely to a $223,000 forgiveness of an outstanding payable during 1999, as well as a $116,000 decline in interest income due to lower cash balances, (d) a $134,000 (10%) increase in interest expense associated with increased borrowings and (e) the absence in 2000 of $452,000 of equity losses associated with the Company's investment in  KFP.    The factors discussed above combined to produce a 2000 net loss of $12,290,172, which is approximately 3% below the $12,730,427 net loss for 1999. On a basic and diluted net loss per share basis, the $.49 loss for 2000 is approximately 6% lower than the $.53 loss for 1999 due to the smaller 2000 net loss as well as 3% increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding from 1999 to 2000.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    During 2001, the Company used approximately $6,738,000 of cash for its operating activities, which included (a) approximately $2,458,000 used to support and accelerate the growth of Pegasus' business, (b) $1,430,000 used for interest payments ($396,000 by Pegasus and $1,034,000 by KFX), and (c) approximately $2,850,000 used for KFx corporate and other activities.    The principal sources of cash during 2001 were:    .  the issuance of 1 million shares of KFx common stock at a price of $3.65      per share and a warrant, expiring three years after the date of issue,      exercisable for 500,000 shares of KFx common stock, at a price of $3.65 per      share, subject to certain adjustments, to an institutional investor,      resulting in net proceeds, after financing costs, to the Company of $3.5      million;    .  an advance of $3.5 million from Cinergy to Pegasus against the existing      contract between Pegasus and Cinergy, which bears interest at 7% per annum,      payable monthly, and subject to the following terms:       (a)  Cinergy may elect to apply future Pegasus invoices against the advance           or may choose to convert the balance of the advance into KFx common           stock, at a price of $3.65 per share, or Pegasus common stock, at a           price of $2.10 per share, subject to certain adjustments;       (b)  the note is putable by Cinergy upon:             .  a change in control of KFx or Pegasus;             .  the sale of substantially all of Pegasus' or KFx's assets;             .  the completion of third party financing for Pegasus of $12.5               million or for Pegasus and KFx combined of $30 million; or             .  termination for cause as set forth in the original contract; and       (c)  Cinergy received a warrant, expiring three years after the date of           issue, exercisable for 200,000 shares of KFx common stock, at $3.65           per share, subject to certain adjustments;    .  Proceeds of $2,722,330 from the sale of Pegasus preferred stock held by the      Company, which the Company is required to repurchase during 2002, subject      to certain provisions that could accelerate or defer the required      repurchase date; see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements;    .  the issuance of $1,000,000 of Pegasus preferred stock to Kennecott Energy;      and    .  a $300,000 short-term loan to Pegasus from a director of the Company, which      bears interest at the prime rate plus 2%.                                        40     Cash raised during 2001 was used for funding of current operations, repayment of portions of notes payable and installment payments totaling approximately $2.5 million for the acquisition of the Pavilion Power Optimization Segment.    During 2000, the Company used approximately $5,151,000 of cash for its operating activities, which included approximately (a) $2,360,000 used to support and accelerate the growth of Pegasus' business, (b) $1,181,000 used for KFx interest payments, and (c) $1,610,000 used for KFx corporate and other activities.  The principal sources of cash during 2000 were (a) $3,000,000 from Kennecott Energy associated with its investment in Pegasus beginning in March (of which $1,000,000 was paid to KFx and $2,000,000 was invested in Pegasus), (b) the $1,527,000 recovery of the Company's investment in KFP and (c) $850,000 in net short term borrowings from KFx directors (of which $250,000 was borrowed by KFx and $600,000 was borrowed by Pegasus).  In addition to cash used for operating activities the Company also used $532,000 of cash in total as follows: (a) K-Fuel patent applications ($295,000), (b) repayment of notes related to the 1998 acquisition of Pegasus ($171,000) and (c) purchases of property and equipment ($66,000).    Pursuant to an Asset Purchase and License Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") between Pavilion, Pegasus Technologies, Inc. ("Pegasus"), a subsidiary of KFx Inc. ("KFx"), and KFx, dated July 31, 2001, certain assets and liabilities relating to the Power Optimization Division were acquired by Pegasus.  These purchased assets and acquired liabilities were primarily accounts receivable, unbilled revenue, deposits, customer list, exclusive rights to license Pavilion's software, other intangibles and deferred revenue. Pavilion has retained certain liabilities of the Power Optimization Division, including but not limited to Pavilion indemnifying Pegasus regarding the intellectual property of Pavilion's software being licensed.  The Purchase Agreement provided for a base price of $9,500,000 in cash, payable to Pavilion in installments through July 31, 2003, which is adjusted for the net of assets and liabilities assumed. Additionally, Pegasus shall pay Pavilion royalties of up to $5,500,000 between August 1, 2001 and October 31, 2005, based on Pavilion and Pegasus software licenses sold by Pegasus.  Through December 31, 2001, Pegasus made payments to Pavilion totaling $2,447,740.  KFx guarantees the duties and obligations of Pegasus under the Purchase Agreement (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements).  In March 2002, the Purchase Agreement was amended to reduce total remaining purchase price payments to $4,500,000, less transaction costs, with the entire payment due by March 28, 2002.  Amounts due were classified as short- term debt at December 31, 2001 and the Company made a payment of $4,350,000 to satisfy the terms of the amended Purchase Agreement.  The payment was financed by a $5,000,000 sale of KFx common stock (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements).    During 2001, the Company engaged Jefferies & Co., Inc., an investment banking firm, to assist in all aspects of strategic and financial planning.  This step was taken as a part of the Company's ongoing efforts to restructure its balance sheet in an optimal manner for the benefit of its shareholders and in view of the rapidly growing energy market opportunities. The Company had begun a similar effort initially focused on Pegasus in mid 2000, but the Pavilion Lawsuit, which was filed in the third quarter of 2000, limited many of the options that were under consideration at that time.    The Company has contacted and has been contacted by several large suppliers to the power generation industry about the potential of making an investment in Pegasus. In addition, the Company is considering the potential for debt and/or equity offerings by the Company and/or Pegasus and has had related discussions with investment banking firms. At this stage, discussions with all of these parties are preliminary, but the Company intends to continue such discussions and negotiate definitive agreements if acceptable terms can be reached.    The Company is continuing to work toward its goal of licensing a large commercial K-Fuel plant.  Upon granting a license to construct a commercial scale K-Fuel production facility, KFx expects to generate significant K-Fuel license fees and net cash flows.  Through December 31, 2001, there were no commitments to build a K-Fuel plant.  It is estimated that construction of a K- Fuel production facility will take approximately nine months, thus no royalty payment would begin until at least nine months after a license agreement is signed.                                        41     From time to time, directors of the Company have provided to the Company short term unsecured financing and the Company expects that such financing, on at least a short-term basis, will continue to be available if needed.  Such short term financing will not, however, cover the cash needs of the Company on an ongoing basis.    The Company will seek to meet its cash requirements over the next fiscal year with respect to day-to-day operations and debt service requirements through (a) cash on hand, which as of April 12, 2002 approximated $934,000; (b) an additional discretionary investment by Kennecott of $500,000 during the year; (c) potential additional investments in Pegasus and/or KFx from interested participants in the power generation industry; (d) potential debt and/or equity offerings of the Company; (e) potential fees from licensing new K-Fuel facilities; (f) potential partners in connection with opportunities to expand the Company's product and service offerings to the power industry; and (g) unsecured short term borrowings for the Company and/or Pegasus from one or more of its directors and/or other parties.  Efforts by the Company to raise additional funding may be hampered by the put option and additional financing restrictions as a result of the financing transactions that occurred subsequent to year-end (see below).    On March 28, 2002, the Company issued 2 million shares of KFx common stock at a price of $2.50 per share and warrants to purchase 2.25 million shares of KFx common stock, which resulted in cash proceeds to the Company of $5 million.  The warrants have an exercise price of $2.75 per share, and are subject to adjustment through March 27, 2003, in the event that the Company issues options, warrants or common stock at a price of less than $2.75. The common stock issued is subject to redemption pursuant to a put option, in whole or in part, at the option of the investors.   The put option is exercisable upon the earlier of July 31, 2002 or upon the redemption or conversion of all of the Convertible Debentures.  At the time the investors notify KFx of their intent to exercise the put option, KFx must repurchase the common stock at a price of $2.50 per share plus accrued interest ("Redemption Value") within 100 days of notification.  Interest for purposes of redemption accrues at the rate of 9% per annum, beginning upon the original issuance date and ceases on the date in which the common stock is repurchased.  If two-thirds or more of the investors exercise their put option and KFx is unable to secure the necessary funding to satisfy these exercised put options, KFx must transfer its entire interest in Pegasus to the investors.  The put option expires on December 23, 2002.  Until the put option expires, the Company is precluded from issuing, selling, transferring or pledging any of its interest in Pegasus and Pegasus is precluded from transferring any rights with respect to its equity and assets without approval of at least two-thirds of the investors.    As part of the agreement, KFx also has a right to call the common stock at a 25% premium of the Redemption Value.  The call option is exercisable upon the investors' refusal to purchase the lesser of $5 million in equity instruments or the entire offering in the event the Company secures a qualifying equity offering.    In addition, the investors have the right to select two persons to serve on the board of directors of KFx and, upon election to the board, KFx has agreed to appoint these two persons to serve on the board's executive committee.  This agreement will remain in force until the investors hold less than 400,000 shares of KFx's common stock.  In accordance with the terms of the investment agreement, approximately $4.4 million of the proceeds were required to be applied against the outstanding amount on the Pavilion Power Optimization Division acquisition obligation.    At the option of the investors, anytime prior to June 30, 2002, on the same terms as noted above the investors have the right to purchase up to an additional $5 million of common stock and receive an equivalent amount of warrants on a pro rata basis.    As part of the agreement the Company is required to register the shares issued, including the potential shares of common stock underlying the warrants, in a qualifying registration statement.  In the event such shares are not registered by April 30, 2002, the Company shall issue additional warrants to purchase shares of common stock based upon the passage of time that the shares remain unregistered.    Depending on the outcome of various uncertainties, including those discussed herein, the Company may be required to seek additional debt and/or equity financing for general operating purposes and/or to meet                                        42   debt service requirements. The timing of collection of accounts receivable and payment of accounts payable could significantly alter the Company's need for at least temporary financing. Should the Company be required to seek any additional debt and/or equity financing, its ability to do so will be affected by the terms of the Debentures, which contain a number of restrictions including (a) limitations on the Company's ability to incur secured and unsecured debt, (b) limitations on the Company's ability to sell assets or enter into merger agreements, and (c) provisions that would reduce the Debenture conversion price from $2.50 per share if the Company sells KFx common stock at a price below $2.50 per share. In addition, included in the agreements among KFx and the other shareholders of Pegasus are provisions governing the terms of investments from any new investors in Pegasus, limiting the borrowings of Pegasus, limiting the payment of dividends by Pegasus, and precluding the Company from issuing, selling, transferring or pledging any of its interest in Pegasus and precluding Pegasus from transferring any rights with respect to its equity and assets without approval of at least two-thirds of the investors (see also Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements).    There are no assurances that any of these potential funding sources will materialize, the Company currently does not have the means to satisfy certain indebtedness, including, but not limited to the Debentures due July 2002 (see Note 11), and the Company does not currently have any commitments with respect to any such funding sources. If the overall outcome of the various uncertainties affecting the Company is not favorable, the Company may be forced to seek debt and/or equity financing on terms and conditions that may be unfavorable to the Company, if available at all. If the Company requires additional financing and cannot obtain it when needed, the Company may default on payments when due. Should the Company not be successful in achieving one or more of the financing alternatives discussed above, the Company may not be able to continue as a going concern.    Below is the detail of our obligations and the maturity of those obligations:                                                                          Payments Due by Period                                                    ----------------------------------------------------------                                                                         Less than          1-3         4 - 5                                                          Total           1 year           years        years                                                    ----------------------------------------------------------          Long-Term Debt (1)                                      $ 8,880,329      $ 5,250,329    $3,630,000 Operating Leases, net of sublease receivable            $   744,000      $   289,000    $  445,000    $10,000 Royalty Payment to Pavilion (2)                         $ 9,000,000 Pegasus Preferred Stock Repurchase Obligations (3)      $ 3,847,562      $ 3,847,562 Convertible debentures, including interest and  premium                                                $ 8,625,000      $ 8,625,000 Redeemable common stock                                 $   424,350      $   424,350   (1)  Includes $2,957,005 of debt payable to Cinergy that becomes putable back to      Pegasus upon (i) a change in control of KFx or Pegasus, (ii) the sale of      substantially all of Pegasus' or KFx's assets, (iii) the completion of      third party financing for Pegasus of $12.5 million or for Pegasus and KFx      combined of $30 million, or (iv) termination for cause as set forth in the      original contract. (2)  Amount represents royalties payable to Pavilion based on the sales of      software licenses by Pegasus. Note the payments have no term of expiration. (3)  The date of repurchase will be accelerated upon occurrence of certain      events, such as a change in control. As of April 12, 2002, preferred stock      with a total redemption value of approximately $2,865,000 is past due. The      Company is currently in the process of renegotiating the repurchase dates      for these shares of preferred stock; however, in the event that the Company      is unable to repay the redemption value for cash, the instruments are      convertible into KFx common stock.                                        43   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("FAS 141").  FAS 141 requires that all purchase business combinations must be accounted for using the purchase method.  Under this method, the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the individual tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.  If the purchase price exceeds the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed the excess is recognized as goodwill. Acquired intangible assets that do not meet certain criteria for recognition apart from goodwill are included in the amount initially recognized as goodwill. After initial recognition, goodwill and intangible assets acquired in the business combination must be accounted for under FAS 142.  FAS 141 is effective for the Company for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, including the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Pavilion (see Note 12).    In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("FAS 142").  FAS 142 requires that after a company allocates the purchase price in accordance with FAS 141, the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and goodwill must be assigned to one or more reporting units based on certain criteria outlined in FAS 142.  In addition, goodwill will no longer be amortized.  FAS 142 is effective for the Company for any goodwill acquired in a business combination entered into after June 30, 2001, including the acquisition of certain assets of Pavilion, (see Note 12).  The remaining provisions of the Statement are effective beginning in the first six months of 2002.    SFAS 142 requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two- step process. The first step is to identify a potential impairment and, in transition, this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year. However, a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete the first step. The Company expects to complete that first step of the goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of 2002. The second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss (measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption), if any, and must be completed by the end of the Company's fiscal year. Intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment using a one-step process, which compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset as of the beginning of the fiscal year, and pursuant to the requirements of SFAS 142 will be completed during the first six months of 2002. Any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first six months of 2002. The Company anticipates that these impairment tests will not have a material impact upon the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.    On October 3, 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Accounting Standards No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("FAS 144"). FAS 144 supercedes FAS 121 "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of."  FAS 144 applies                                        44   to all long-lived assets (including discontinued operations) and consequently amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Division of a Business" ("APB 30"). FAS 144 develops one accounting model for long-lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale. FAS 144 requires that long-lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell. Additionally, FAS 144 expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that (1) can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and (2) will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction. FAS 144 is effective for the Company's financial statements issued in fiscal 2003. The Company has not yet determined the impact of FAS 144 on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    The Company is not currently subject to a significant level of direct market risk related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices or equity prices. The Company has no derivative instruments and only $450,000 of floating rate debt and does not expect to derive a material amount of its revenues from interest bearing securities. Currently the Company has no foreign operations. To the extent that the Company establishes significant foreign operations in the future, it will attempt to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates contractually and through the use of hedging activities and other means considered appropriate. The Company is indirectly exposed to fluctuations in fuel commodity prices. To the extent that fuel prices rise, there may be a tendency for greater demand for certain of the Company's products and services, since K-Fuel and Pegasus' combustion optimization products have been shown to result in lower usage of coal and coal beneficiated fuel products when used to generate electric power. The Company's fuel-related products provide various environmental benefits that management believes significantly mitigate the fuel commodity risk associated with the Company's business. The Company holds no equity market securities, but does face equity market risk relative to its own equity securities.   ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA
