ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       This 10-K filing contains, in addition to historical information, forward- looking statements that include risks and uncertainties.  The Company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.  Factors that might cause such a difference include those discussed below, as well as general economic and business conditions, regulatory changes, competition, the acceptance of new product offerings and other factors discussed elsewhere in this 10-K.  The Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.  OVERVIEW       Excluding the joint venture fee of $1 million in 1996, to date the Company has not generated any other material revenues from the licensing of the K-Fuel Technology to third party licensees or the direct manufacturing of K-Fuel. All revenues other than the joint venture fee in 1996 have been derived from ancillary sources not directly related to the Company's efforts to commercialize the K-Fuel Technology. Net losses before extraordinary items and income taxes were approximately $5.1 million, $5.6 million, and $8.8 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The KFP Facility is the only commercial-scale K-Fuel production facility constructed to date. Until the Company successfully negotiates additional third-party licensing and royalty agreements, independently constructs and operates additional commercial-scale K-Fuel production facilities, or successfully enters into other lines of environmental and/or energy technology businesses, net operating losses will continue. The royalties and profit interests to be derived from the Company's 5 percent ownership interest in the KFP Facility will not be sufficient to meet all of the operating and debt service needs of the Company based on current and future anticipated operating plans and budgets. Until such time as the Company has in place sufficient additional commercial-scale K-Fuel production facilities (either owned independently or through joint venture entities similar to the KFP Facility) or has successfully entered into other lines of environmental and/or energy technology businesses to generate positive cash flow from operations, the Company will be dependent on additional debt and/or equity financing. The Company has recently made investments in environmental and energy technologies not directly related to the K-Fuel Technology that may provide a more rapid economic return than the K-Fuel Technology (see "ITEM 1 - BUSINESS Certain Recent Developments"). There are no assurances that any of these investments will produce an acceptable economic return, if at all.       Additionally, any equity participation that the Company negotiates for future commercial-scale K-Fuel production facilities prior to January 2000 (or later, depending on whether TCK exercises Warrant "A") will have to be financed by sources other than the Stock Purchase Agreement with TCK.   See "ITEM 1 - BUSINESS - Strategic Relationships - Thermo Ecotek Corporation."       The Company expects that most or all of its financing needs in 1998 with respect to day-to-day operations and debt service requirements will be satisfied by the proceeds of the Debenture Offering.  See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Year Ended December 31, 1997 vs. Year Ended December 31, 1996       The Company had a net loss of approximately $5,095,000 in 1997 compared to a net loss of approximately $5,629,000 in 1996. The decrease of approximately $534,000 is attributable to a decrease in revenue of approximately $32,000 in 1997 as compared to 1996, and a decrease in expenses of approximately $566,000 in 1997 as compared to 1996.       Revenues decreased slightly from 1996 to 1997 due to several factors: 1) a one-time joint venture fee of $1,000,000 received in 1996 which was not repeated in 1997; 2) an increase in contract revenues of $489,000 from the increased level of technical subcontract work the Company performed for KFP, and 3)                                          16   an increase in interest and other income of $479,000 as a result of overall higher cash balances resulting from the Debenture Offering, and certain payable write-offs. The Company will perform additional technical subcontract work for KFP through the second quarter of 1998, although the dollar amount of such work in not currently determinable. The decrease in technical subcontract work performed for K-Fuel LLC in 1997 was expected given the planned schedule and timing of the K-Fuel LLC Initial Work Plan.       Expenses decreased by approximately $566,000 in 1997 as compared to 1996. The components of the overall decrease in expenses are summarized as follows (all figures are approximate):      Decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses....................   $ 569,000 Write-down of mine property and reclamation costs                          Incurred in 1996...........................................................     701,000 Increase in depreciation and amortization expense.............................    (108,000) Increase in research and development / laboratory operating expenses..........     (52,000) Increase in equity loss of unconsolidated affiliates..........................    (182,000) Increase in interest expense..................................................    (362,000)                                                                                  ---------       Net decrease in expenses................................................   $ 566,000                                                                                  =========        Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $569,000 in 1997 compared to 1996 primarily as a result of (1) personnel reductions in 1997 which decreased salaries and wages by approximately $220,000; (2) an overall decrease in professional fees in 1997 by approximately $487,000; and (3) reduction of travel expenses in 1997 by approximately $100,000. These decreases were partially offset by an overall increase in other general and administrative expenses in 1997 of approximately $238,000.       The decrease in salaries and wages in 1997 is attributable to the Company implementing a personnel reduction program in which the total number of employees of the Company was reduced from 17 in 1996 to 12 in 1997 (reduction of 3 executive positions and 2 administrative positions). Professional fees decreased in 1997 primarily due to $340,000 of legal expenses related to the K- Fuel, LLC joint venture agreement incurred in 1996. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to (1) a one-time charge of $163,000 to write-off previously capitalized project development expenses associated with the previously planned KFP II Project; (2) approximately $100,000 of internal costs associated with the Debenture Offering and permitting costs related to the Company's coal mining property adjacent to the KFP Facility; offset by a one- time payment of a $50,000 listing fee with the American Stock Exchange incurred only in 1996.       The mine property and reclamation costs write-down of $701,000 relating to the Company's coal mine located near Gillette, Wyoming was a one-time expense incurred only in 1996. No additional material write-downs are expected in 1998. In addition, the Company does not expect to incur any additional material reclamation costs in 1998.       The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 1997 is primarily attributable to the Company's re-evaluation of the depreciable useful lives of certain demonstration plant and laboratory equipment located in Gillette, Wyoming (approximately $216,000), the amortization of Debenture Offering costs beginning in August 1997 (approximately $205,000), offset by the amortization of a consulting contract in 1996 of approximately $281,000.       The increase in research and development and laboratory expenses is attributable to increased efforts associated with overall project developments activities, with particular emphasis on the activated carbon program, the proposed projects in Indonesia and Turkey, and the start-up of the KFP Facility. The Company will continue to perform such services for these projects in 1998, although the amount and scope of such work is not currently determinable.       The increase in equity loss of unconsolidated affiliates relates to losses the Company recognized for its 51 percent share of the marketing, general and administrative expenses of K-Fuel LLC for a full year                                          17   in 1997 versus a partial year in 1996. The Company will continue marketing efforts through K-Fuel LLC, and as the KFP Facility becomes fully operational, these expenses are expected to increase in 1998.       The increase in interest expense is attributable to the Debenture Offering completed in July 1997 which has resulted in monthly interest of $85,000 beginning in August 1997.  The Company incurred $425,000 of interest expense related to this debt in 1997.  This was partially offset by overall lower levels of other debt in 1997.  Year Ended December 31, 1996 vs. Year Ended December 31, 1995       The Company had a net loss before income tax benefits and extraordinary item of approximately $5,629,000 in 1996 as compared to a loss of approximately $8,796,000 in 1995. The decrease of approximately $3,167,000 is attributable to an increase in revenue of approximately $1,388,000 in 1996 as compared to 1995, and a decrease in expenses of approximately $1,779,000 in 1996 as compared to 1995. In 1996, the Company had no debt extinguishment gains and related income tax benefits, as compared to such gains in 1995 totaling approximately $2,567,000. Including such gains in 1995, overall net loss decreased from approximately $6,229,000 in 1995 to approximately $5,629,000 in 1996.       Revenues increased in 1996 because of the one-time joint venture fee of $1,000,000, as well as approximately $360,000 in technical subcontract work the Company performed for K-Fuel LLC beginning in mid-1996. As the K-Fuel LLC joint venture commenced in 1996, there were no comparable figures in 1995.       Expenses decreased by approximately $1,779,000 in 1996 as compared to 1995. The components of the overall decrease in expenses are summarized as follows (all figures are approximate):      Decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses...............      $  899,000 One-time litigation charge and performance fee in 1995...................       1,760,000 Decrease in interest expense.............................................         493,000 Increase in depreciation and amortization expense........................        (204,000) Increase in equity loss of unconsolidated affiliates.....................         (86,000) Increase in research & development / laboratory operating expenses ....          (382,000) Write-down of mine property and reclamation costs                               incurred in 1996....................................................        (701,000)                                                                                ----------           Net decrease in expenses.......................................      $1,779,000                                                                                ==========        Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $899,000 in 1996 as compared to 1995 primarily as a result of (1) an overall decrease in professional services fees in 1996 of approximately $859,000 and (2) a decrease in board of director compensation expense in 1996 of approximately $178,000.  This decrease was partially offset by an overall increase in payroll and general administrative expenses in 1996 totaling approximately $138,000.       The decrease in professional services fees in 1996 is generally attributable to certain stock-based compensation agreements incurred only in 1995 relating to certain marketing and public relations activities.  However, legal fees increased by approximately $177,000 in 1996 to a total of approximately $693,000, of which approximately $340,000 was specifically attributable to the K-Fuel LLC joint venture agreement in 1996 and for which no further significant legal expense is expected in 1997.  The decrease in board of director compensation in 1996 is attributable to a change of compensation policy beginning in 1996. The increase in payroll and general and administrative expenses in 1996 is attributable to the hiring of two executive employees in 1996 and the Company doubling its Denver, Colorado headquarters office space in the fourth quarter 1995.       The litigation settlement ($800,000) and success fees relating to the closing of the KFP Project ($960,000) were one-time expenses incurred in 1995 only.                                         18        The decrease in interest expense in 1996 is attributable to the significant decrease in outstanding debt in 1996 as compared to 1995. Total debt outstanding has decreased to $1,225,000 at December 31, 1996 from approximately $1,614,000 at December 31, 1995, and from approximately $4,835,000 at December 31, 1994.       The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 1996 is attributable to the full year of amortization of the Series "C" patents acquired in the third quarter of 1995 and the depreciation of certain property and equipment additions in 1996 at the Company's demonstration and laboratory facility.       The increase in equity loss of unconsolidated affiliates is due to the first year in which the Company recognized losses for its 51 percent share of the marketing, general and administrative expenses of K-Fuel LLC.       The increase in research and development and laboratory operating expenses in 1996 is attributable to the K-Fuel LLC technical subcontract services performed in 1996 only.       The write-down of mine property and reclamation costs incurred in 1996 are attributable to the Company's mining property near Gillette, Wyoming. This property was acquired by the Company in 1995 and was related to its participation in the KFP Project. The Company had intended to sell this property. However, in 1996 the Company determined that it would not sell the property but would retain it to hold the mining property as a reserve coal supply for the KFP Project to protect against any raw coal feedstock disruptions. Also in 1996, the Company reassessed the value of this asset and wrote-down the value of the property to its current estimated value. Additionally, the Company increased its reclamation reserve related to the property by approximately $134,000 in 1996 because of more accurate reclamation studies performed in 1996 and certain regulatory changes enacted by the State of Wyoming.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Working capital increased from a deficit of approximately $167,000 at December 31, 1996 to a surplus of approximately $12,565,000 at December 31, 1997. The increase is primarily attributable to $2.5 million in proceeds from the sale of Common Stock to TCK in January 1997 and approximately $15.1 million in net proceeds from the Debenture Offering.       The Company expects no additional stock purchases by TCK in 1998 or 1999. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the next possible investment by TCK is not until a period of time beginning in January 2000 and expiring in July 2001. There are no assurances that TCK will make any investments in the Company at that time. Additionally, the Stock Purchase Agreement prohibits the Company from issuing shares of Common Stock to other investors unless at least 90 percent of the proceeds from such stock issuances are used to invest in K-Fuel production facilities. Furthermore, in the event of any stock issuances by the Company, TCK's Warrant "A" may be subject to certain adjustments that increase the number of shares available to TCK under Warrant "A." See "ITEM 1 -  BUSINESS - Strategic Relationships - Thermo Ecotek Corporation."       The Company may be required to seek additional debt and / or equity financing as early as the second or third quarter of 1999 for general operating purposes or for capital investments. Factors that may reduce or eliminate the need for additional financing in 1999 are as follows: (1) license fees from proposed K-Fuel projects in Indonesia and Turkey; (2) cash flow distributions from the Company's 60 percent ownership of Pegasus; (3) cash flow distributions from Charco; and (4) a sale of all or a portion of the Company's 5 percent ownership interest in KFP.       The Company expects no material net operating revenues from its ownership interest in KFP in the foreseeable future. Additionally, the Company's net production royalties (after fulfilling related royalty obligations) once the KFP Facility reaches full production is projected to be less than $200,000 per year. The Section 29 tax credit available for the KFP production of K-Fuel at full capacity could result in an opportunity to sell the Company's interest to TCK or other third parties; the Company intends to try to retain its production royalty following any such sale. The value, amount or possibility of any such sale                                        19   will not be determinable until KFP reaches its full productive capacity, currently expected to be in the third or fourth quarter of 1998.       Should the Company be required to seek any additional debt or equity financing, the ability of the Company to do so may be affected by an existing agreement with TCK and by the terms of the Indenture.  With respect to TCK, the Company must obtain TCK's consent to sell any Common Stock or to incur any indebtedness other than indebtedness that is secured only by the assets of a particular project and is non-recourse to the Company and its subsidiaries. With respect to the Indenture, the Company may only incur unsecured indebtedness of up to $8.0 million (of which approximately $1.4 million was outstanding as of March 24, 1998) and indebtedness secured only by the assets of a particular project and is non-recourse to the Company and its subsidiaries.       There are no assurances that any of these potential funding sources will materialize, and the Company does not currently have any commitments with respect to any such funding sources. If such events do not materialize, the Company may be forced to seek debt and / or equity financing on terms and conditions that may not be favorable to the Company, if available at all.  YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE       Like many other companies, the Company is aware of the problems associated with "The Year 2000 Issue." This issue centers on certain computer systems being unable to recognize the year 2000 as a valid date or may interpret a date in the format of "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000. This system issue creates risk for the Company from unforeseen problems in its own computer systems and from third parties with which the Company deals. Such failures of the Company and/or third parties' computer systems could potentially have a material impact on the Company's ability to conduct its business. Based on interviews with and publications from those vendors supplying the Company's current business information systems, management believes those systems to be date compliant such that they will not pose a significant risk to the Company's future business operations. Future version upgrades to these systems and/or new acquisitions will be subjected to Year 2000 date compliance as selection, acceptance, and installation criteria.       During 1998, the Company will assess any impact the Year 2000 issue may have on other systems that support the Company's operation. These can include, but are not limited to, supplier systems, shipper systems, environmental control systems, manufacturing equipment, building security systems, etc. The Company will evaluate appropriate courses of corrective action if any are needed outside of routine maintenance or currently planned projects.       The Company has made an initial assessment of the Year 2000 issue and related potential effects on the Company's operations, and has determined that it will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.
