ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       This 10-K filing contains, in addition to historical information, forward- looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that include risks and uncertainties.  The Company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. The forward looking statements contained in this filing include, among others, statements regarding the Company's goals for 1999; availability of potential funding sources; expected future operating results and financial condition; the expected impact of and changes in environmental regulations; effects of deregulation of the electric power generation industry; expected effects of a new marketing approach adopted by NPS and Pegasus; expected benefits to customers of the NeuSIGHT product and the K-Fuel Technology; timing of filling of sales commitments; effects of the Company's competition; expected applications of K-Fuel Technology; impact on the Company of future possible costs at the KFP Facility; results of test burns of K-Fuel; expected results of further test burns of K-Fuel; expected timing of  future K-Fuel shipments; outcome of discussions with KECC regarding the Kennecott Agreement; proposed projects in Poland, Turkey and Indonesia; anticipated markets for the Company's products and services; and potential expansions of product and service offerings. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include, but are not limited to, adverse market and various other conditions that could inhibit the Company's ability to obtain financing; competition and technological developments by competitors; lack of market interest in the Company's existing and any new products and services; changes in environmental, electric utility and other governmental regulations; availability of Section 29 tax credits; actions of the Company's strategic partners; breadth or degree of protection available to the Company's intellectual property; availability of key management and skilled personnel; unanticipated problems that arise from research and development activities; cost overruns, delays and damage that may occur in developing, permitting, financing and constructing K-Fuel production facilities; and domestic and international economic and political conditions.  The Company does not undertake to update, revise or correct any of the forward-looking statements.  OVERVIEW       Stimulated by the acquisition of Pegasus Technologies Limited (Pegasus) in early 1998, and the formation of Net Power Solutions (NPS) in mid-1998, KFx significantly broadened its technology solutions in order to meet the evolving needs of the electric power industry as triggered by the deregulation of the domestic power industry and the ever more stringent air quality standards.  In combination, Pegasus and NPS generated $1.3 million in revenues over the nine months from the date of the Pegasus acquisition, a 65% increase from the revenues posted by Pegasus during 1997.  With the foundation of NPS's recently installed professional, seasoned software marketing team and Pegasus' NeuSIGHT, the leading combustion optimization software product, management has set a 1999 goal of growing its software related revenues by a factor of 2-4 times the level of 1998.  Our ability to achieve this goal will become clearer during the course of the year as new marketing plans for NPS/Pegasus are fully implemented and become effective.  Key to the new marketing strategy is more effectively communicating the full potential benefits of NeuSIGHT to the marketplace and receiving value commensurate with the benefits delivered to our electric utility clients.  An additional factor supporting this goal is a recently completed alliance with Science Applications International Corporation ("SAIC"), that we anticipate will result in the development of a strong installation partner to help accelerate NPS's ability to install NeuSIGHT and, in conjunction with other factors, also facilitate an acceleration of revenue recognition for the license fee element of this revenue stream.       Progress on commercializing K-Fuel continued during 1998, with a successful first commercial burn of a unit train load of product (approximately 12,000 tons) at a generating station in southern Indiana in February 1999.  After the completion of additional commercial burns with this customer, management expects to further clarify the significant benefits available from K-Fuel.  Various solutions to certain waste handling system bottlenecks at the KFx Fuel Partners production facility (KFP Facility), operated by our 95% partner Thermo Ecotek Corporation (TCK), that have significantly limited production volume at the facility, are being evaluated.  In addition, certain                                          18   fine-tuning of the K-Fuel production process is being considered to increase product size and minimize the level of dust associated with the product.       During 1998, management actively sought and analyzed several opportunities to invest in existing and new activated carbon operations that could have generated synergies with the operations of KFP.  After evaluation of the potential risks and rewards, however, in management's opinion, none of the opportunities presented a prudent investment for KFx at this time.       In view of: a) the magnitude of the opportunity presented by the market potential for NPS/Pegasus' products and services, b) the progress made demonstrating in a commercial setting the benefits and potential of K-Fuel and c) other opportunities that management believes will be available as the power industry evolves under deregulation but with continued emphasis on addressing environmental concerns, management is focused on i) growing NPS/Pegasus quickly into a positive contributor to the Company's earnings and operating cash flows, ii) continuing its efforts to fully commercialize the licensing potential of K- Fuel and iii) evaluating opportunities to invest with partners, as has been our past general practice, in new ventures designed to meet the expanding product and service needs of the evolving power industry.       The Company's principal goals for 1999 are to:   .  Increase revenues from NPS/Pegasus, as outlined above. With this operation in    a building mode, it is likely, however, to experience negative operating cash    flows for at least the first half of 1999.  .  Pursue acquisition opportunities synergistic to NeuSIGHT and K-Fuel.  .  Evaluate opportunities, in conjunction with partners, to expand the Company's    product and service offerings to meet the evolving needs of the power    industry as it is transformed by the combination of deregulation and    continuing pressure to meet more stringent air quality standards.  .  Improve operations and increase production, through TKC, at the KFP facility,    and execute at least one license agreement. Such license agreement may be    largely dependent on obtaining an extension of the Section 29 tax credit in    1999.  .  Facilitate outside financing for further development at Charco Redondo.       As a company still in the process of developing its business, the nature of the opportunities KFx is pursuing and their status make it rather difficult to predict financial results with meaningful accuracy and also leads to difficulties in achieving positive and stable financial results in the short term.  These issues are exacerbated by the volatile nature of the stock market. The delays in the development of K-Fuel, coupled with the weakness in the stock market for non-internet small cap companies, have negatively affected KFx's stock price. Nevertheless, the continued progress of K-Fuel, coupled with the potential to grow NPS/Pegasus, reaffirm management's confidence in the opportunity to create long-term value for KFx shareholders.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 VS. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997       The consolidated operating loss in 1998 of $6,419,000 exceeded the 1997 consolidated operating loss by $1,488,000, principally attributable to the combined operating loss of NPS and Pegasus that approximated $1.6 million. Despite its operating loss, NPS/Pegasus posted a gross margin of $573,000, or 43%, on revenues of $1,328,000. The operating loss in NPS/Pegasus was incurred in connection with building a marketing and sales function to grow the future revenue, earnings and operating cash flow streams of this element of KFx. The 1998 consolidated operating loss includes $2,996,000 of non-cash expenses.       Revenues for 1998 of $2,221,000 were $1,136,000 higher than for 1997 primarily due to $1,328,000 in revenues from the software licenses and services generated by NPS and Pegasus. The decline in contract revenues stemmed from a reduction in work performed for K-Fuel LLC.       Consolidated costs and expenses include $755,000 of costs associated with software licenses and services revenues of NPS/Pegasus.  Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased by $1,352,000 in 1998 over                                          19   1997 primarily due to $1,589,000 of such costs associated with NPS/Pegasus, partially offset by reductions in various other costs. Research and development costs decreased by $168,000 from 1997 to 1998 due to a lower level of K-Fuel related research and development activities as the KFP Facility commenced operations April 1, 1998, offset by $138,000 in research and development expenses in NPS/Pegasus associated with planning and developing NeuSIGHT improvements and new products related to combustion optimization. Costs associated with operating the K-Fuel demonstration plant and laboratory declined in 1998 by $71,000 due to some curtailment in activities as the KFP facility commenced operations. Depreciation and amortization for 1998 increased over the 1997 level by $741,000 primarily due to $369,000 of goodwill amortization associated with the acquisition of Pegasus, and a $287,000 increase in amortization of deferred costs associated with the issuance of convertible debentures in August 1997.       In 1998 the Company sold a mineral property with a book value of $466,000 to KFP in exchange for KFP's assumption of a related $1,166,000 reclamation obligation, and recorded a gain of $701,000. In 1996 a $701,000 provision was recorded to write this property down to its estimated recoverable value and to recognize the estimated reclamation obligation, based on information available and management's judgment at that time. Interest and other income for 1998 of $668,000 is only slightly higher than the 1997 level of $650,000. Interest expense for 1998 of $1,160,000 exceeded the 1997 level by $613,000 due to the $17 million convertible debenture issuance in August 1997. The $573,000 in equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates consists primarily of the Company's 5% share ($410,000) of KFP losses. No such losses were incurred in 1997 since KFP did not commence operations until April 1998. In addition, this category includes $163,000 in losses associated with the Company's 51% interest in K- Fuel, LLC.       The Company does not record a deferred tax benefit from its net operating loss carryforwards, which approximate $28 million at December 31, 1998, because there is no assurance that the Company will be able to realize such benefit as an offset to future income taxes payable.  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 VS. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996       The Company had a net loss of approximately $5,095,000 in 1997 compared to a net loss of approximately $5,629,000 in 1996. The decrease of approximately $534,000 is attributable to a decrease in revenue of approximately $32,000 in 1997 as compared to 1996, and a decrease in expenses of approximately $566,000 in 1997 as compared to 1996.       Revenues decreased slightly from 1996 to 1997 due to several factors: 1) a one-time joint venture fee of $1,000,000 received in 1996 which was not repeated in 1997; 2) an increase in contract revenues of $489,000 from the increased level of technical subcontract work the Company performed for KFP, and 3) an increase in interest and other income of $479,000 as a result of overall higher cash balances resulting from the Debenture Offering, and certain payable write- offs.. The decrease in technical subcontract work performed for K-Fuel LLC in 1997 was expected given the planned schedule and timing of the K-Fuel LLC Initial Work Plan.       Expenses decreased by approximately $566,000 in 1997 as compared to 1996. The components of the overall decrease in expenses are summarized as follows (all figures are approximate):      Decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses...............    $ 569,000 Write-down of mine property and reclamation costs incurred in 1996.......      701,000 Increase in depreciation and amortization expense........................     (108,000) Increase in research and development / laboratory operating expenses.....      (52,000) Increase in equity loss of unconsolidated affiliates.....................     (182,000) Increase in interest expense.............................................     (362,000)                                                                              ---------    Net decrease in expenses..............................................    $ 566,000                                                                              =========        Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $569,000 in 1997 compared to 1996 primarily as a result of  (1) personnel reductions in 1997 which decreased salaries and wages by approximately $220,000; (2) an overall decrease in professional fees in 1997 by approximately $487,000; and (3) reduction of                                          20   travel expenses in 1997 by approximately $100,000. These decreases were partially offset by an overall increase in other general and administrative expenses in 1997 of approximately $238,000.       The decrease in salaries and wages in 1997 is attributable to the Company implementing a personnel reduction program in which the total number of employees of the Company was reduced from 17 in 1996 to 12 in 1997 (reduction of 3 executive positions and 2 administrative positions). Professional fees decreased in 1997 primarily due to $340,000 of legal expenses related to the K- Fuel, LLC joint venture agreement incurred in 1996. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to (1) a one-time charge of $163,000 to write-off previously capitalized project development expenses associated with the previously planned KFP II Project; (2) approximately $100,000 of internal costs associated with a debt offering and permitting costs related to the Company's coal mining property adjacent to the KFP Facility; offset by a one- time payment of a $50,000 listing fee with the American Stock Exchange incurred only in 1996.       The mine property and reclamation costs write-down of $701,000 relating to the Company's coal mine located near Gillette, Wyoming was a one-time expense incurred only in 1996. This property was sold in 1998.       The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 1997 is primarily attributable to the Company's re-evaluation of the depreciable useful lives of certain demonstration plant and laboratory equipment located in Gillette, Wyoming (approximately $216,000), the amortization of Debenture Offering costs beginning in August 1997 (approximately $205,000), offset by the amortization of a consulting contract in 1996 of approximately $281,000.       The increase in research and development and laboratory expenses is attributable to increased efforts associated with overall project developments activities, with particular emphasis on the activated carbon program, the proposed projects in Indonesia and Turkey, and the start-up of the KFP Facility.       The increase in equity loss of unconsolidated affiliates relates to losses the Company recognized for its 51 percent share of the marketing, general and administrative expenses of K-Fuel LLC for a full year in 1997 versus a partial year in 1996.       The increase in interest expense is attributable to the Debenture offering completed in July 1997 which has resulted in monthly interest of $85,000 beginning in August 1997.  The Company incurred $425,000 of interest expense related to this debt in 1997.  This was partially offset by overall lower levels of other debt in 1997.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       The Company's primary financial goal for 1998 was to improve operating cash flow to produce a break-even level in the fourth quarter of the year, which was largely dependent on the outcome of negotiations with one of our partners in the development of K-Fuel. Unexpected delays in these negotiations have occurred which prevented achievement of this goal.  Nevertheless, management is optimistic that negotiations will be concluded in the second quarter and will result in a significant payment to KFx.  During 1998 $4.6 million in net cash was used in operating activities to continue the commercialization of K-Fuel and build the marketing and sales function of NPS/Pegasus.  Of this amount approximately $1.4 million was associated with working capital needs, including a $950,000 increase in receivables from Pegasus clients, which were fully collected subsequent to year-end.  Investing activities in 1998 required $3.8 million in cash, including $1.6 million required for the acquisition of Pegasus, $583,000 related to K-Fuel activities and $629,000 related to Charco Redondo, LLC.  There were no significant financing activities in 1998.       The Company expects most or all of its cash requirements in 1999 with respect to day-to-day operations and debt service requirements will be satisfied by a) cash on hand, which as of March 26, 1999 was approximately $4.1 million; b) certain revenues under technical subcontracts to be performed for KFP; c) certain contract revenues relating to a research and development program conducted by the Company; and d) revenues related to the operations of NPS/Pegasus (although material net operating cash flows related to NPS/Pegasus are not expected to materialize until late 1999 or later). In addition the Company believes there is potential for additional funding in 1999 from: (i) the potential payment referred to in the preceding paragraph; (ii) fees from licensing new K-Fuel                                          21   facilities; and (iii) funding from potential partners in connection with opportunities to expand the Company's product and service offerings to the power industry.       Depending on the outcome of various uncertainties, including those discussed herein, the Company may be required to seek additional debt and/or equity financing in mid-2000 for general operating purposes. If acquisitions or significant capital investments are made in this time period, the need to seek additional debt and/or equity financing may be accelerated. In addition, the timing of collection of NPS/Pegasus accounts receivable and other working capital items could significantly alter the Company's needs for at least temporary financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will not need at least temporary financing during 1999 and that, if financing is required in 1999, that it will be available when needed and on satisfactory terms, if at all.       The Company does not expect material net operating revenues or net operating cash flows from its ownership interest in KFP in the foreseeable future. The Company's net production royalty (after fulfilling related royalty obligations) once the KFP Facility reaches full production is projected to be less than $200,000 per year. The potential for Section 29 tax credit for the KFP production of K-Fuel represents additional potential value but since the Company has a net operating loss carryforward, it is most likely that a structured transaction would be required to generate any significant value from the potential Section 29 tax credit. With the KFP Facility now in production and therefore generating Section 29 tax credits, management is exploring potential Section 29 structured transactions but the value, amount or likelihood of any such transaction is not clearly determinable at this time.       The Company expects no additional stock purchases by TCK in 1999.  Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the next possible investment by TCK is not until a period of time beginning in January 2000 and expiring in July 2001.  There are no assurances that TCK will make any investments in the Company at that time.  Additionally, the Stock Purchase Agreement prohibits the Company from issuing shares of Common Stock to other investors unless at least 90 percent of the proceeds from such stock issuances are used to invest in K-Fuel production facilities.  Furthermore, in the event of any stock issuances by the Company, TCK's Warrant "A" may be subject to certain adjustments that increase the number of shares available to TCK under Warrant "A."  See "ITEM 1 - BUSINESS - - Strategic Relationships - Thermo Ecotek Corporation and KFX Fuel Partners."       Should the Company be required to seek any additional debt or equity financing, the ability of the Company to do so will be affected by an existing agreement with TCK and by the terms of the Convertible Debentures.  With respect to TCK, the Company must obtain TCK's consent to sell any Common Stock or to incur any indebtedness other than indebtedness that is secured only by the assets of a particular project and is non-recourse to the Company and its subsidiaries.  With respect to the Convertible Debentures, the Company may only incur unsecured indebtedness of up to $8.0 million (of which not in excess of approximately $.7 million was outstanding as of March 26, 1999) and indebtedness that is secured only by the assets of a particular project and is non-recourse to the Company and its subsidiaries.       There are no assurances that any of these potential funding sources will materialize, and the Company does not currently have any commitments with respect to any such funding sources. If the overall outcome of the various uncertainties affecting the Company is not favorable, the Company may be forced to seek debt and/or equity financing on terms and conditions that may be unfavorable to the Company, if available at all. If the Company requires additional financing and cannot obtain it when needed, it may default on payments when due.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS       The Company has determined that the adoption of recently issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 132, "Employer's Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," and SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" will not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or footnote disclosures.  YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE       Like many other companies, the Company is aware of the problems associated with the "Year 2000 issue."  This issue centers on certain computer systems being unable to recognize the year 2000 as a valid date or possibly interpreting a date in the format of "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000.  This system issue creates risk                                          22   for the Company from unforeseen problems in its own computer systems and from third parties with which the Company conducts business. Such failures of the Company's and third parties' computer systems could potentially have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.       The Company is currently engaged in a process to evaluate the potential impacts of the Year 2000 issue and implement remedial actions.  In 1998, the Company engaged a third party consultant to complete an analysis of its information technology ("IT") and non-IT systems, such as office and other hardware containing embedded technology, in its executive offices.  The Company completed remediation steps recommended as a result of this analysis at a nominal cost.  Future upgrades to these systems and/or new acquisitions are subjected to a similar analysis with the assistance of the third party consultant. The Company substantially completed similar analyses at the offices of Pegasus during 1998.  Based on the results of these analyses, management believes that the IT and non-IT systems of its executive offices and the offices of Net Power Solutions and Pegasus are Year 2000 compliant and does not believe that there is a significant risk to the Company's future business operations.       In addition, during 1998, the Company substantially completed an assessment of the impact that the Year 2000 issue may have on other systems that support the Company's operations, including but not limited to, supplier systems, shipper systems, systems of suppliers of banking and other financial services, environmental control systems and building security systems.  This analysis was largely based on interviews, certifications and other correspondence.  At this time, the Company cannot determine the effects, if any, that any non-compliant systems of such third parties may have on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations, and there can be no assurance that such effects, if any, would not be material.  Nevertheless, based on the analyses performed to date, management does not expect these third party systems to present a significant Year 2000 risk to the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.       During 1999, the Company engaged a third party consultant to perform an analysis of its non-IT systems at its laboratory facility near Gillette Wyoming. This location does not have any IT systems.  Once this analysis is complete the Company plans to implement any recommended remedial actions, which based on the analysis performed to date, are expected to be at a nominal cost and are expected to be completed during the second quarter of 1999.       The Company has also been advised that KFP has undertaken appropriate Year 2000 analyses with respect to its IT and non-IT systems, including its manufacturing equipment.  These analyses are not yet complete, but the Company has been advised that KFP will implement any necessary remedial actions, which based on the analysis performed to date, are estimated to be at a nominal cost. Such analyses and any remedial actions are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 1999.       With respect to Year 2000 issue compliance of Pegasus' NeuSIGHT and related software products, Pegasus personnel have performed extensive analysis, with the assistance of third party consultants, and believe that such products are Year 2000 compliant.  The remediation costs relative to these products was nominal.       To date, the costs incurred by the Company with respect to the Year 2000 issue have not been material.  The Company cannot estimate future costs until the analyses referred to in the preceding paragraphs are completed.  The Company expects, however, but can provide no assurances, that the future costs will not be material.       The Company does not expect the impact of the Year 2000 issue will be material in the systems assessed or being assessed.  The Company plans, however, to continue to monitor this issue with respect to the various computer systems that it relies on, directly and indirectly, and will take additional steps as it considers prudent to minimize the potential adverse impact of this issue, including performing additional analysis and related remediation, as may appear necessary.  In addition, if the Company determines that it will not be able to achieve Year 2000 compliance in a function that is critical to the future of the Company, it will immediately develop contingency plans and will attempt to quantify any impacts of any failure to timely correct non Year 2000 compliant computer systems.  There can be no assurance that the Company will discover all Year 2000 issues in the course of its assessment or be able to implement timely and cost effective remedial actions for the Year 2000 issues that it does discover, such that the Year 2000 issue will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.                                         23   ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       The Company is not currently subject to a significant level of direct market risk related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices or equity prices.  The Company has no derivative instruments or any floating rate debt and does not expect to derive a material amount of its revenues from interest bearing securities.  Currently the Company has no significant foreign operations.  To the extent that the Company establishes significant foreign operations in the future, it will attempt to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates contractually and through the use of hedging activities and other means considered appropriate.  The Company is indirectly exposed to fluctuations in fuel commodity prices.  To the extent that fuel prices rise, there may be a tendency for greater demand for certain of the Company's products and services, since K-Fuel and NeuSIGHT have been shown to result in lower usage of coal and coal beneficiated fuel products when used to generate electric power.  The Company's fuel-related products provide various environmental benefits that management believes significantly mitigate the fuel commodity risk associated with the Company's business. The Company holds no equity market securities, but does face equity market risk relative to its own equity securities.  This risk is most likely to be manifested by influencing the Company's ability to raise debt or equity financing, if needed.  ITEM 8.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA
