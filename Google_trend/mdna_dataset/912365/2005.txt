ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS                   The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with, and arequalified by reference to, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto in Item 8 of this report and Selected Financial Data included in Item 6 of this report.  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform tocurrent year presentation.  Certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform of 1995.  Refer to the “Cautions About Forward LookingStatements” preceding Item 1 of this report.  Also, for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business and operations see “Risk Factors” in Item 1 of this report.   Overview                   KFx is a “clean coal” technology company with a patented process and technology, which we refer to as K-Fuel technology,that uses heat and pressure to physically and chemically transform coal with a lower heat value, as measured by British Thermal Units (or Btus) into coal with a higher heat value, while at the same time removing significant amounts of certain impurities. Throughout the Western United States there are significant coal resources with heat values less than 9,000 Btus.  Such heat values are considered low grade and serve as feedstocks for our process.  Many coal-fired, EGUs, which comprise our primary market,burn coal that is 11,000 Btus or greater.  Our technology adds value for coal producers and the electric power generation industry by significantly improving the quality of lower-grade coal and facilitating its compliance with certain air emissionstandards.  We believe the current pricing of coal in the U.S. and the declining availability of cleaner, higher-Btu coal to comply with environmental regulation, referred to as compliance coal, has created a near-term and long-term opportunity for K-Fuel. Furthermore, certain federal tax credits were enacted by federal legislation passed in 2004 to encourage the development of cleaner fuel sources including refined coal.  Based upon testing we have performed to date, we believe that K-Fuel meets the tax creditrequirements of a refined coal and we believe our future plants that produce K-Fuel will be eligible for the credit if they are operational by January 1, 2009.  Such credits add to the economic feasibility of processing and selling K-Fuel.                   We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1988.  Our financial statements include all of our wholly ownedsubsidiaries, including Landrica, which was acquired in May 2004 and is more fully discussed in Item 1 – Business – Landrica Development Company.  During 2003, as a part of an exchange transaction with Kennecott, we transferred our ownership ofPegasus to Kennecott for the remaining interest in KFL that we did not own.  As a result of this exchange, we have accounted for Pegasus as a discontinued operation and have accordingly removed its effects from our results of continuing operations for 2003 and2002.  KFL is now a wholly owned subsidiary.                    Currently, we operate our business in one segment.  This segment primarily contains:                       •         the construction of our 750,000-ton plant;                       •         our corporate operations; and                       •         our research and development activities.                       The majority of the assets associated with this segment are those related to the construction costs and equipment of the 750,000-tonplant and cash, our patents and the demonstration facility.  We currently manage our business in one segment as our operations are focused on developing the technology and the commercial viability of our product.  Therefore, our results of operations areevaluated and allocations of capital resources are based upon the operations of one segment.  In the future, we plan to develop and operate K-Fuel production plants both domestically and internationally, both wholly owned and through joint ventures, as well asto license the K-Fuel technology to additional third parties.  As our operations expand, we expect to increase the number of segments under which we manage our business to reflect the increasing complexity of our operations.   Significant Trends                   The following discussion and analysis is focused on the events and trends that we believe have the most significant impact on ourbusiness.  One of the significant developments in the potential value of K-Fuel has been the increase in the price differential between naturally occurring higher Btu compliance coal and Western coal, as more fully described in Item 1 – Business –Market for K-Fuel of this report.  This higher-grade coal, in part, establishes the value of K-Fuel, subject to the relative costs of transporting these fuels to market.  This price differential is a key indicator for the value of K-Fuel along with thevalue of reduced air emissions (e.g., NOx, SO 2 , and mercury reductions) provided by our process when burned.  The value of these emission reductions can vary depending on a coalburning plant’s permits, local regulations, the availability of trading allowances for these pollutants, as well as the capital and operating costs to install pollution control equipment to reduce the emissions.  These are key indicators that managementfollows closely to assess the value of the K-Fuel process.   Page 23                     Currently our operations are focused on developing our technology and the commercial viability of our product.  As a result, wehave limited revenues and most of our costs are related to general and administrative expenses.  In the future, we plan to own and operate K-Fuel production facilities both domestically and internationally, both wholly owned and through joint ventures, as wellas to license the K-Fuel technology to third parties.  As our operations expand, we expect our revenue and cost structure will also expand.   Revenue Trends                   In the future we expect to generate revenue from the following sources:                       •         Sales of K-Fuel from our wholly owned plants;                       •         Licensing of our technology.  We have sold and anticipate selling more non-exclusive licenses to other parties to construct and operate facilities in geographic areas we are not currently evaluating.  The license feeis generally considered to have two to three components depending upon the contract specifics: (i) a fee to review the overall technical specifications of the process; (ii) a fee payable at the time design or permitting of a facility commences; and (iii) a feepayable when the facility is substantially complete;                       •         Royalties related to licensing, which are based upon production from the plant and tax credits generated, if any, by the plant;                       •         Equipment sales, as sales of the required Sasol-Lurgi equipment in the U.S. are limited to us and we anticipate earning revenue from the resale of Sasol-Lurgi equipment to parties that have licensed our technology;                       •         Consulting services we expect to provide parties who license our technology and assistance with the transfer of knowledge; and                       •         Operations related to joint ventures.                      We believe that we will maximize our earnings by constructing and operating our own plants in the U.S. and licensing our productinternationally.  Over the near term, we expect the majority of the revenue we recognize will be related to licensing agreements and joint venture agreements.  We anticipate entering into licensing agreements, whereby we earn both license fees and royaltyrevenue, in geographic areas we are currently not evaluating.  We anticipate being required to defer any up-front payments received from licensing agreements and amortizing such payments based upon the terms and conditions of the licensing agreement.  As weestimate it will take at least three years for design, permitting and construction of larger plants, we do not anticipate recognizing revenue related to royalties in the near future.  We also anticipate entering into joint venture agreements as a mechanism tofund the construction of some of our future plants.  We would earn licensing fees and royalties from such joint ventures.  The recognition of licensing fees related to joint ventures would be subject to the same accounting treatment and similar timing asour licensing agreements.  We anticipate entering into licensing agreements and joint venture agreements until such time as we are sufficiently capitalized and can construct our own wholly owned plants.  We cannot provide an estimate as to when we would besufficiently capitalized such that we would be solely focused on the construction and operation of wholly owned plants.                   We have granted certain rights and limited licenses for the use of certain K-Fuel technology.  The following is a summary of thesignificant parties and the rights:                       •         Pursuant to the exchange transaction with Kennecott, they received indefinite licenses for up to three plants, with certain limitations on the location of the plants, each plant having a maximum annual capacity of threemillion tons.  Kennecott is obligated to pay certain royalty and license fees for these three plants, if constructed.                       •         Certain investors, including a number of funds and accounts managed by Westcliff Capital Management LLC of which one of our directors, Richard Spencer, is the manager, obtained certain licensing rights when they entered intofive separate transactions to purchase our common stock and warrants during the period March 28, 2002 through August 21, 2002.  The investors  have the right under certain conditions to develop or participate in the greater of K-Fuel commercial projectswith an annual output capacity of 50 million tons per year or six commercial projects.  The rights granted to the investors also gave them the exclusive right to develop commercial projects in India for an indefinite period of time as long as certain conditionsare met.  The investors are obligated to pay certain royalty and license fees for these plants, if constructed.       Page 24     Expense Trends                   As we begin to operate our wholly owned and joint venture plants, we expect that our cost structure will change.  Currently, themajority of our costs are related to general and administrative efforts.  As the plants begin operations, we will incur additional expenses, the most significant of which are:                       •         Feedstocks;                       •         Payroll;                       •         Utilities; and                       •         Royalty costs, relating to fees we owe to parties who own certain rights that support our patents and proprietary technology.                      Costs such as feedstocks, payroll and utilities are variable costs that increase with the size and the location of the plant and theyear in which they are incurred.  As a result, we cannot currently estimate what these costs will be until such time as a plant becomes operational.                   We owe royalty payments to three parties related to certain rights that support our patents and our proprietary technology.  Thefollowing is a summary of the parties and the rights.                       •         The Estate of Edward Koppelman is entitled to 25% of worldwide licensing and royalty revenues up to a maximum of $75.2 million.  The royalties due the Koppelman estate may be subordinated until a 15% rate of return isachieved on the initial plant constructed.  Through December 31, 2004, we have incurred costs totaling $2.2 million, including $1.9 million paid in February 2005, pursuant to the $75.2 million cap reducing the amount remaining under the cap to $73 million. The $1.9 million paid in February 2005 related to the Cook Inlet Coal licensing agreement described in Item 1 – Business – Other Development Activities in this report.  See further discussion of this royalty below.    The following details activity related to the  remaining Koppelman royalty and licenses cap (dollars in thousands):          Koppelman royalty and licensing cap     $    75,222      Fees paid in prior years     (275)      Fee accrued in 2004, paid in 2005     (1,875)              Remaining balance under cap    $    73,072                                                                                                                                             •         Fort Union Ltd. is entitled to 20% of North American royalty revenue until the earlier of cumulative royalties paid of $1.5 million or September 15, 2015.  Through December 31, 2004, we have not yet paid anything to FortUnion Ltd.                       •         Ohio Valley Electric is entitled to 0.5% of royalty revenue generated using an older version of our K-Fuel technology.  While we believe that Ohio Valley Electric is not entitled to any royalty revenue generated basedupon the current version of our technology, we can provide no assurance that they will not pursue options to compel us to pay them a royalty based upon the new technology.  There is no expiration date or cap associated with this royalty.  Through December31, 2004, we have not yet paid anything to Ohio Valley Electric.                      In 1996, we entered into a royalty amendment agreement with Mr. Edward Koppelman, the inventor of K-Fuel, that reduced the cap by$500,000 to $75.2 million and set the royalty percentage at 25% of our worldwide licensing and royalty revenue, as defined in the agreement.  In addition, Mr. Koppelman provided us an indemnification against potential claims made by certain parties if welicensed the technology.  We paid Mr. Koppelman a total of $500,000 pursuant to the agreement as a prepayment.  The $500,000 has no specified expiration date and recognition is solely dependent upon the issuance of licenses; and as a result, has beenreflected in deferred royalty costs in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As we entered into a third party licensing agreement in December 2004, we will amortize this payment as license revenue generated from the Cook Inlet Coal agreement is recognized.  Seefurther discussion below in Results of Operations regarding revenue recognition for and other aspects of the agreement.                    Mr. Theodore Venners, our Chairman and CEO, is entitled to 50% of net royalties to be paid to the Koppelman estate.  In December2004, Mr. Venners entered into a waiver agreement with us under which he agreed to assign his right to payments that may become due to him from the estate in connection with a license arrangement with Cook Inlet Coal, in December 2004.  Pursuant to the waiver,Mr. Venners is obligated to remit any proceeds he may receive related to the Cook Inlet Coal license   Page 25     agreement to us.  As we do not have the right to offset the amount owed to the estate against the amount we expect to receive from the estate, we have accrued the entire amount due to the Koppelman estate in AccruedLiabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  In addition, we have recorded a receivable in Related Party Receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets representing the amount due back from the Koppelman estate.  In February 2005, we paid the entire $1.9million amount due to the estate and the estate remitted Mr. Venners’ portion directly back to us.  Mr. Venners continues to negotiate a reduction, representing his portion, in the overall amounts due to the Koppelman estate or payment of his portionthrough the issuance of our common stock or other securities.  It is unclear if future negotiations will be successful in reducing our overall obligation to the estate or if the use of securities will act as a suitable currency for payment.    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS                   The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

American JobsCreation Act Tax Credits.  See Note 17 - Related Party for transactions for further discussion of these consulting fees in Item 8 of this report.  In 2003, we recognized expense related to the issuance of warrants to a consultant and legal fees.  Werecognized $1.3 million of expense related to issuances of warrants to a consultant for services during 2003, based on the fair value of the warrants that vested during the year.  In addition, we incurred $1.1 million in legal fees primarily related to thederivative lawsuit, which was settled in January 2004.                    Employee-related costs primarily include salaries and wages, bonuses, benefits, employer payroll taxes and education andtraining.  Employee-related costs increased $555,000, or 33%, in 2004 and decreased $350,000 in 2003, or 17%.  Bonuses increased 50% in 2004 due to the increase in the number of employees and overall increase in amount paid.  We increased our number ofemployees by seven employees between December 31, 2003 and 2004.  We almost doubled the number of employees between December 31, 2003 and 2002.  The rise in personnel increased our employee-related costs in all periods.  In 2002, we incurred a one-timecharge of $1.6 million related to the conversion of stock appreciation rights to stock options issued to certain employees.                   Office expense includes rent, office supplies, phone and utilities and publications and subscriptions.  Office expense increased$21,000, or 5%, in 2004 and  $92,000, or 29%, in 2003.  The increase in both years is due to increases in all aspects of office expense due to the expansion of our business and the increase in the number of employees.                   Insurance primarily includes costs related to our commercial and liability insurance and our directors and officers insurance. Insurance increased $69,000, or 27%, in 2004 and 68,000, or 37% in 2003.  Our insurance costs increase as our business expands.  In addition, our commercial and liability insurance increased in 2004 due to our acquisition of Landrica and the start ofconstruction of our plant.  See further discussion of our acquisition of Landrica in Item 1 – Business and Note 3 - Acquisitions in Item 8 of this report.                   Travel and entertainment costs are primarily comprised of airfare, lodging and meals.  Our travel and entertainment costsdecreased $185,000, or 40%, in 2004 and increased $230,000, or 100%, in 2003.  The increase in 2003 was due to increased travel to improve our K-Fuel product .  A large portion of the travel in 2003 was international as we designed theimprovement to our process by using the Sasol-Lurgi equipment.  As we have completed this investigation, established the commercial feasibility and begun construction on our plant, our travel has decreased.  In addition, some travel incurred in 2004 wascapitalized to our 750,000-ton plant as it was directly related to this plant.   Page 27                     Other general and administrative is comprised of expenses that cannot be categorized elsewhere and include, among other costs, variousbusiness and franchise taxes, repair and maintenance and board of director fees and expenses.  Other costs increased $254,000 and $8,000 in 2004 and 2003, respectively.  In November 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors voted to extendthe exercise period for vested options after the resignation of a director.  As a result of this extension we recorded $136,000 of non-cash expense.  Further, we experienced increases related to a rise in our business and franchise taxes due to the growthin our total assets and potential shares of common stock outstanding, assuming conversion of warrants, stock options and preferred stock.  In addition, we have experienced an increase in our board of director fees and expenses due to more meetings being held in2004 than in prior years.   Research and Development                   The following table summarizes our research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Depreciation and Amortization                   Depreciation and amortization is comprised of depreciation on our property and equipment and amortization related to our patents. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $45,000, or 12%, and $100,000, or 36%, in 2004 and 2003 respectively.  Depreciation increased by $156,000 in 2004 due to depreciation expense related to new assets placed into service during 2004, Landrica assetsincluded in our 2004 financial statements and a full year’s depreciation on assets placed into service in 2003.  Amortization decreased by $111,000 due to certain of our older patents becoming fully amortized and write-off of certain foreign patents. Depreciation expense increased by $26,000 in 2003 due to assets placed into service during 2003 and 2002.  Amortization increased by $74,000 due to additions to our patents that became eligible for amortization in 2003.   Asset Impairment Charges                   Impairments in 2004 of $1.3 million primarily related to certain site-specific and plant size-specific costs incurred associated withevaluating three other locations for our 750,000-ton plant, including the Black Thunder, Coal Creek and Buckskin sites.  We chose the Fort Union site for our 750,000-ton plant, which resulted in impairments for previously capitalized costs at the othersites.  Impairments during 2003 totaled $107,000, relating primarily to scrap metal previously   Page 28     believed to be salable, which was deemed to have no expected future cash value as of December 31, 2003.  During the year ended December 31, 2004, we subsequently sold the scrap metal for a gain of $31,000, which isincluded in other income (expense) described below.   Other Income Expense                   The following table summarizes our total other income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, 2002.        Year Ended December 31      Increase/(Decrease)                  2004      2003      2002      2004 vs.  2003      2003 vs.  2002                            (Dollars in thousands)        Other income (expense), net    $    235                $    12                $    (7,803    )           $    223            $    7,815        Interest income (expense)     571       (530    )      (4,096      )      1,101       3,566        Equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates     —       (209    )      (1    )      209       (208    )                                                         Total other income (expenses)    $    806      $    (727    )     $    (11,900    )     $    1,533      $    11,173                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Other income (expense), net increased by $223,000 in 2004 due to proceeds related to the settlement of the derivative lawsuit asdiscussed above and scrap metal, which was previously impaired, being sold at a gain.  Other income (expense), net increased $7.8 million in 2003 primarily due to expenses recorded in 2002 as follows:   (i) $2.8 million due to the recognition of thewarrant penalty incurred as part of our private equity investments; (ii) $10.6 million due to the recognition of expense relating to the grant of the warrants pursuant to the July 19, 2002 and August 21, 2002 private equity transactions, partially offset by (iii)$4.2 million in other income resulting from the revaluation of warrants at June 30, 2002 and again at August 30, 2002.                    Interest income (expense), net increased $1.1 million in 2004 due to a decline in interest expense of $748,000 due to the repayment ofdebt in 2003 and an increase in interest earned of $352,000 due to overall higher cash balances due to private placements of common stock during 2004.  The decline in interest expense, net of $3.6 million in 2003 is due to the repayment of outstanding debenturesin 2003.                   Equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates in 2003 was comprised of our share of KFL’s loss.  As we now consolidate KFL,there is no such loss in 2004.   Net Gain (Loss) on Discontinued Operations                   The net gain (loss) on discontinued operations is comprised of two pieces in 2003.  There was a gain on the disposal ofdiscontinued operations of $3.4 million and a loss on discontinued operations of $1.4 million.  We recognized a gain on the disposal of Pegasus of $3.4 million, net of transaction costs of approximately $428,000.  The loss on discontinued operations was$1.4 million for 2003 and $5.1 million for 2002, a decline of $3.7 million, or 72%.  The decline primarily related to significant decreases in: (i) general and administrative expenses of approximately $1.3 million; (ii) depreciation and amortization ofapproximately $440,000; and (iii) other one-time expenses incurred in 2002 of approximately $1.5 million which were not incurred in 2003.   Deemed Dividend Attributable to a Warrant Holder                   During 2002, we recognized a one-time, non-cash charge of $399,000  to recognize expense relating to the reduction of theexercise price and extension of the term of an outstanding warrant.   Accretion of Redeemable Common Stock                   During 2002, we recognized a one-time, non-cash charge of $16.1 million to accrete redeemable common stock, pursuant to certain putoptions (later terminated), to their redemption value.   Deferred Tax Benefit                   We have not recorded a deferred tax benefit from net operating loss carryforwards, which approximate $72 million at December 31, 2004since based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, management has determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets may not be realized.  The primary evidence is our history of net   Page 29     operating losses.  As we begin to earn revenue during 2005, we will continue to evaluate our valuation allowance and at such time as there is sufficient evidence that we will utilize at least some portion of our deferredtax assets, we will reverse a related portion of our valuation allowance.                    Certain limitations apply to the annual amount of net operating losses that can be used to offset taxable income, after certainownership changes, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“Section 382”).  Pursuant to Section 382, as a result of the change in control in 2003, we believe our annual limitation on the use of our NOLs is $11.3 million. Transactions that may be consummated in order to obtain additional financing may result in ownership changes that are large enough to trigger larger Section 382 limitations.  In the event we achieve profitable operations and taxable income, any significantSection 382 limitation would have the effect of increasing our income tax liability and reducing available cash resources.   Liquidity and Capital Resources                   Our operations have required and will continue to require investment for research and development of our K-Fuel product, constructionof our 750,000-ton plant near Gillette, Wyoming and construction of other large-scale commercial plants.  We expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next several years as we complete the construction of our 750,000-ton plant and undertakethe design, construction and operation of other large-scale commercial plants.  Further, we do not expect to derive a significant amount of cash from operations until at least some plants are fully operational.   Historically, we have satisfied our cashrequirements primarily through the sale of equity securities.                    At December 31, 2004, our working capital, the amount by which our current assets exceed our current liabilities, was approximately$73.6 million compared to $21.2 million at December 31, 2003 an increase of $52.4 million.  The increase in working capital of $52.4 million is primarily attributable to the $47.4 million (net of transaction costs) received from the issuance of stock during 2004and $22.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants.  Offsetting these sources of cash was $14.4 million spent on our 750,000-ton plant and certain site investigation costs written-off in 2004.  We anticipate spending anadditional $32 million related to such plant in 2005, which represents substantially all of our capital expenditures.                    We believe our current cash level is sufficient to support our operations for the next year, complete our 750,000-ton plant, and startpreliminary site investigation, permitting and similar long-lead-time activities related to other large-scale commercial plants.  During 2005, we anticipate adding personnel and other costs related to the expansion of our operations resulting in an estimatedincrease in cash expenditures of approximately $11 million or more.  We believe we will need to obtain additional funding in order to begin constructing other large-scale commercial plants.   We plan to seek additional capital from time to time asneeded through:  (1) proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants; (2) potential debt and/or equity offerings; (3) partnering with third parties in the construction and operation for some of our large-scale commercial plants through theformation of joint ventures, and (4) fees from additional licensing of our K-Fuel technology.  While we believe we will obtain additional capital through one or more of the alternatives described, we can provide no assurance that any of the alternatives will beavailable to us or be on terms acceptable to us.  See further discussion of anticipated sources of revenue above in “Revenue Trends.”    Payment obligations.                   The following table summarizes our future commitments, excluding repayments of debt, as of December 31, 2004:        Payments due by period           (Dollars in thousands)           2005     2006     2007     2008     2009     Thereafter     Total                             Operating leases    $    174     $    131     $    69     $    12     $    —     $    —     $    386      Vehicle loan     10        10      10      10      3      —      43      Demand note payable     170      —      —      —      —      —      170      Purchase commitment obligations:                             750,00-ton plant     3,469      —      —      —      —      —      3,469         Other contractual commitments     584      365      180      105      —      —      1,234                                  Total commitments    $    4,407     $    506     $    259     $    127     $    3     $    —      $    5,302                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Page 30                     This table does not include accounts payable or accrued expenses, which are reported in our December 31, 2004 Consolidated BalanceSheets.  We also have not included the interest related to the $170,000 demand note payable.  We have included our non-cancelable purchase orders in the 750,000-ton plant commitments.                   We have excluded payments to be made to the Koppleman estate, as we cannot presently determine when such payments will be made as suchpayments are based upon our receipt of cash for licensing and royalties.  See further discussion of our obligation to pay royalties to the Koppelman estate above in “Expense Trends.”                   We are obligated under non-cancelable operating leases with initial terms exceeding one year relating to office space and certainequipment and vehicle leases.  Purchase commitments related to our 750,000-ton plant relate to outstanding, non-cancelable purchase orders, primarily for the fabrication of the process modules.  Our other contractual commitments includes agreements withconsultants to advise us on proposed legislation and regulations and advocate our interests before the U.S. Congress and regulatory agencies that extend four of the currently active consulting agreements for periods of 12 to 43 months at an aggregate cost of $1.1million.   Historical View                   While our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Operations were presented with specific line items for discontinued operationsour Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows presentation did not change considerably from prior periods.  However, the following discussion primarily focuses on cash provided by or used in our continuing operations.   Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities                   Cash provided by operating activities was $494,000 in 2004.   We used cash in our operations of  $6.9 million and $4.0million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.  We had cash provided by operating activities in 2004, primarily due to a cash receipt of $7.5 million related to the license agreement we entered into in December 2004.  We received the up-front cash payment but arerequired to defer and amortize the underlying revenue in our financial statements.  See further discussion of the license agreement in Item 1 – Business – Other Development Activities.  Other fluctuations in our cash used in operations relate toour acquisition of Landrica.  As a part of our acquisition of Landrica, we were required to establish a restricted cash account to fund our asset retirement obligation.  See further discussion of our acquisition of Landrica see Item 1 – Business– Landrica Development Company.                   There was an increase of $2.9 million in cash used in operations during 2003 compared to 2002, despite experiencing a much smaller netloss of $8.3 million compared to $23.5 million in 2002.  The primary reason for this disparity was the non-cash charges, gain on disposal and significant changes in our working capital during 2002 and 2003.  During 2003 we disposed of our Pegasus operationsand recognized a gain of $3.4 million, net of transaction costs.  Additionally, we recognized an increase of $1.1 million in common stock and warrants issued for services to $2.4 million in 2003.  An increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $2.0million, an improvement in cash from operating activities, was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, unbilled revenue and deferred job costs of $1.4 million which had a net effect of an increase of $544,000 in our net cash position.   Cash Used in Investing Activities                   We used cash in investing activities of $14.7 million, $6.9 million and $5.5 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  The$8.1 million increase from 2003 to 2004 was due to an increase in spending related to the construction of our 750,000-ton plant and certain site related costs written-off in 2004.  In 2004, we spent $14.4 million and in 2003 we spent 6.3 million.  We alsoexperienced certain cash receipts and uses in both 2003 and 2004, which virtually offset each other related to the exchange agreement with Kennecott and our acquisition of Landrica.  In 2003, we received $162,000 related to our acquisition of KFL and offsettingthis receipt, we paid certain obligations totaling $362,000 resulting in a net usage of $200,000 related to the exchange agreement.  In 2004, we expended $523,000 related to our acquisition of Landrica and received cash payments related to our note receivablefrom Pegasus or $334,000, resulting in a $187,000 net cash usage related to the exchange agreement and Landrica.  See further discussion of the exchange agreement with Kennecott in Item 1 – Business – Discontinued Operations and for furtherdiscussion of our acquisition of Landrica see Item 1 – Business – Landrica Development Company.                   Cash used in investing activities increased by $1.4 million in 2003, compared to 2002.  This increase was primarily the result of$6.3 million spent on our 750,000-ton plant in 2003 compared to $5.2 million spent on business acquisitions during 2002.  The cash spent on the acquired business in 2002 related to the acquisition of a segment of Pavilion Technologies, Inc. by our discontinuedPegasus operations.   Page 31     Cash Provided by Financing Activities                   We received cash from financing activities of $69.9 million, $34.4 million and $12.2 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002,respectively.  The majority of the $35.6 million increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2004 was due to an increase of $29.1 million increase in the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants from private placements.  Inaddition, there was an increase in the net amount of proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants of $8.1 million.  These increases where partially offset by proceeds from borrowings of discontinued operations of $2.3 million in 2003.  Additionally atthe request of the holder of the $170,000 unsecured promissory note, included in our current portion of long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet, payments including interest during 2004 and 2003 were deferred and the note became payable on demand as ofDecember 31, 2004.  We intend to pay off the entire unsecured promissory note including interest in early 2005.                   Cash provided by financing activities increased to $34.4 million in 2003 from $12.2 million in 2002.  The increase of $22.1million was primarily due to net proceeds of $18.3 million received from the issuance of common stock in two private placements in March 2003 and $14.5 million from the exercise of options and warrants into common stock during 2003.  In 2002, we raisedapproximately $19.6 million from the issuance of common stock and warrants; however, we made significant repayments on convertible debentures, purchased preferred stock and made payments on borrowings in the amounts of $3.4 million, $3.8 million and $1.0 million,respectively.  These payments significantly absorbed the amount of cash provided from financing activities in 2002.                   During the second quarter of 2004, we sold 245,400 shares of common stock to Arch Coal, Inc. for proceeds of approximately $2 millionand incurred $5,000 in placement costs.  On November 24, 2004, we issued and sold 4,000,000 shares of our common stock at $12.00 per share in a private placement to a limited number of accredited investors.  The gross proceeds received from the financingwere $48.0 million.  We paid a placement fee equal to 5% of the gross proceeds, incurred an additional $241,000 in placement costs.  As a result, we recorded an increase to our Additional Paid in Capital of $45.4 million in our December 31, 2004Consolidated Balance Sheet.                    In two transactions in March 2003, we issued a total of 7.7 million shares of KFx common stock at a price of $2.50 per share andwarrants to purchase 1.5 million shares of KFx common stock, which resulted in cash proceeds to us of $19.4 million.  The warrants have an exercise price of $2.75 per share, are subject to adjustment and are exercisable over a five-year period.  Thewarrants were recorded at their estimated fair value of $2.4 million.  The estimated fair value of all of the warrants was determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model using an expected life of 5 years a dividend yield of zero, expected volatility of73% and 72% and a risk free interest rate of 2.6% and 3.1% related to 6.0 million shares and 1.7 million shares, respectively.  Through the effective date of the registration statement of May 5, 2003, $2.8 million of additional expense was recognized for theincrease in fair value of the warrants.  This amount was recorded as additional paid in capital at the effective date of registration.                   During the period from March 28, 2002 through August 21, 2002, we entered into five separate transactions with certain investorswhereby we issued 6.8 million shares at $2.50 per share and warrants for 14.4 million shares of our common stock.  Cash to us from these transactions was $16.9 million.  The warrants have an exercise price of $2.75 and expire in March through August2010.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates                   We have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our current and future business operations and the understanding ofour results of operations.  For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies, see the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.  These policies and estimates are considered“critical” because they either had a material impact or they have the potential to have a material impact on our financial statements, and because they require significant judgments, assumptions or estimates.  The preparation of our financialstatements in this annual report on Form 10-K requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect both the results of operations as well as the carrying values of our assets and liabilities.  Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult andsubjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.  We base estimates on historical experience and/or on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the resultsof which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under differentassumptions or conditions, making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the near term.  Set forth below is a summary of our most critical accounting policies.   Page 32     Policies and Estimates Impacting our Current and Future Operations                   Revenue recognition accounts receivable and allowances.    We recognize revenue from K-Fuellicenses and royalties when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, generally when an agreement has been signed, all significant obligations have been satisfied, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.  Any up-front feesreceived related to licenses granted are deferred and recognized over the provision of specific deliverables as defined in the agreement.  As our history related to customer relationships is limited, we may be required to change the estimated period over whichwe amortize our revenue as more information becomes available.  Arrangements that include multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine whether the elements are separable based on objective evidence.  If the elements are deemed separable, totalconsideration is allocated to each element and the revenue associated with each element is recognized as earned.  If the elements are not deemed separable, total consideration is deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual period or theexpected customer relationship period.  We believe that the accounting estimates related to customer relationship periods and to the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable are “critical accounting estimates” because: (1) theyrequire management to make assumptions about how long we will retain customers, for which we have limited history; (2) the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable can be subjective; and (3) the impact of changes in actual retention periodsversus these estimates on the revenue amounts reported in our consolidated statements of operations could be material.                   Plant under construction and property and equipment.   Our policy regarding accounting for ourplant under construction and for potential future plants is significant because of the significant capital expenditures we expect to incur and certain judgments are required.  All costs that are directly related to the engineering, design, purchase, orfabrication of plant equipment, which are expected to be used in a commercial plant project, are capitalized.   Employee-related costs directly related to construction are also capitalized during the construction phase.   Any costthat is not directly related to specific equipment or development of a specific site is expensed.  All costs that are directly related and/or allocable to developing a specific plant site for a commercial plant project are capitalized and separately identifiedas belonging to that site.                   Useful lives of our long-lived assets.     Selecting the useful lives of long-lived assets to bedepreciated or amortized requires a significant amount of judgment.  As construction of our 750,000-ton plant and other anticipated future plants are completed and they are placed into service, we expect our depreciation to increase significantly.  Asignificant portion of the costs to design and construct our plants relate to technology that has never been used for this application.  As a result, there is no history on which to base the economic life of the equipment and we will be required to make a numberof assumptions and estimates in determining the life.                   Valuation of long-lived assets.   The valuation of our long-lived and intangible assets,including patents, is significant related to our results of operations and financial condition.  We must assess the realizable value of these assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not berecoverable.  In assessing the recoverability of these assets, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets.  In addition, we must make assumptions regarding the usefullives of these assets.  If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.                   Asset retirement obligations.     We are required to record the fair value of legally requiredremoval costs and retirement obligations as a liability with an equivalent amount added to the asset cost and depreciated over an appropriate period.  Our reclamation liability was recorded at its fair value as determined by the DEQ, on the date of acquisitionof Landrica and an equivalent amount was added to the asset cost.  Since we have elected to rely on the DEQ assessment of reclamation cost, no accretion to the liability has been recognized through December 31,2004.  Instead, adjustments to the liabilitywill be made if, and when, the DEQ changes its assessment.  The asset is amortized over the useful life of the underlying assets.  We will begin to accrete the DEQ reclamation liability in 2005.                    Collections on note receivable.   Collections on the Pegasus note receivable is significantbecause there are a number of judgments that must be made regarding (1) our evaluation of the financial condition of Pegasus; (2) expected timing of payments from Pegasus; and (3) the determination of a reserve to reduce the receivable to its anticipated collectibleamount, if needed.  Pegasus continues to make its scheduled monthly interest payments, however, their financial condition is deteriorating.  We regularly evaluate the collectibility of this receivable.  In the event sufficient evidence develops thatindicates that Pegasus will not be able to meet some or all of its obligation, we will reserve for the appropriate amount of the receivable.  The portion of the note allocated to current portion represents our best estimate of the amount we anticipate collectingin the next year.                    Consolidation.       We are subject to Financial Accounting StandardsBoard, or FASB, Interpretation No. 46 “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” or FIN 46.  FIN 46 contains rules regarding the consolidation of certain entities based upon criteria delineated in the interpretation.  The decision toconsolidate pursuant to the criteria in FIN 46 requires significant judgments, estimates and assumptions related to future results of operations and cash flows, financing and   Page 33     capitalization and probability assignments related to potential outcomes.  Depending upon the structure, financing and capitalization, and other criteria of a joint venture, such joint venture may be required to beconsolidated in our financial statements; even if we do not own a majority of the equity of the entity.  As a result, if we enter into joint venture agreements, we may be required to consolidate some of the entities and not consolidate others even though theoperations of the joint venture are substantially the same.    Policies and Estimates Impacting our Past Operations                   Our policy regarding accounting for discontinued operations is significant because of the restated financial statements resulting fromthe disposal of the Pegasus operations.  For purposes of discontinued operations presentation in these Consolidated Financial Statements we have separately identified the assets and liabilities of the Pegasus operations.  Pegasus was previously reported andaccounted for as an operating segment.  The assets and liabilities of this former operating segment have been separately classified as “Assets held for sale” and “Liabilities associated with discontinued operations” on the ConsolidatedBalance Sheet as of December 31, 2002.  The loss from operating Pegasus has been aggregated for reporting purposes into a single line on the Consolidated Statements of Operations called “Loss from discontinued operations” for each of the three yearsended December 31, 2003.  We have made the determination to account for the disposal of these operations as discontinued in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” because (a) it has beendetermined that the operations and cash flows of Pegasus were eliminated from our on-going operations in November 2003 and (b) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of Pegasus after the disposal transaction.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements                   In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, or SFAS,No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment,” or SFAS 123R.  SFAS 123R requires that compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instrumentsissued.  We will be required to apply SFAS 123R as of the interim reporting period beginning July 1, 2005.  SFAS 123R covers a wide range of share-based compensation arrangements including share options, restricted share plans, performance-basedawards, share appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans.  We are still evaluating the impacts of adopting SFAS 123R upon our financial position and results of operations.  Based upon preliminary evaluations, we anticipate that adoption willresult in significant non-cash expense due to the number of stock options outstanding.  However, we have not determined which method of recognition allowed under SFAS 123R we will apply.                   In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets, or SFAS 153, which is effective for periodsstarting July 1, 2005.  Under SFAS 153, we will measure assets exchanged at fair value, as long as the transaction has commercial substance and the fair value of the assets exchanged is determinable within reasonable limits.  A non-monetary exchangehas commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange.  The adoption of SFAS No. 153 is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position or results ofoperations.   ITEM 7A.      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK                   We are not currently subject to a significant level of direct market risk related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,commodity prices or equity prices.  We own (or hold) no derivative instruments or floating rate debt and do not expect to derive a material amount of our revenues from interest bearing securities.  Currently, we have no foreign operations.  To theextent that we establish significant foreign operations in the future, we will attempt to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates contractually and through the use of hedging activities and other means considered appropriate.  We areindirectly exposed to fluctuations in fuel commodity prices.  To the extent that competitive fuel prices rise or fall, there may be greater or lesser demand for our K-Fuel production services.  However, K-Fuel provides various environmental benefits thatmanagement believes could significantly mitigate the fuel commodity risk associated with our business.  KFx holds no equity market securities, but is subject to equity market risk relative to its own equity securities.
