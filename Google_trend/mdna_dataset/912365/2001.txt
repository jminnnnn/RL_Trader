OVERVIEW      Through the acquisition of 60% of Pegasus in early 1998, KFx significantly broadened its technology solutions, by adding NeuSIGHT(TM), Pegasus' neural network based combustion optimization software, to K-Fuel Technology, its patented clean coal technology. This step was taken in order to better meet the evolving needs of the electric power industry that are being stimulated by domestic industry deregulation and increasingly stsingent air quality standards worldwide. In August 1999, KFx increased its ownership of Pegasus to 75% and during 2000, KFx sold 4% of its interest in Pegasus to Kennecott Energy for $1 million, KFx converted $3.6 million of debt Pegasus owed to it into convertible preferred stock and Kennecott Energy invested $2,000,000 into Pegasus in the form of convertible preferred stock.      As a result of the additional investments by Kennecott Energy in Pegasus Preferred Stock through April 13, 2001 and KFx's sale of a portion of its Pegasus Preferred Stock through April 13, 2001 to Evergreen and other private investors, the ownership of Pegasus at April 13, 2001 is approximately as follows: KFx--57.9%, Pegasus founders--16.0%, Kennecott Energy--14.9%, Evergreen Resources, Inc.--8.8% and other private investors--2.4%.      Pegasus operations in 2000 were significantly hampered by confusion in the power generation industry as to the manner of achieving compliance with certain aspects of the CAA, due to legal challenges brought against certain EPA initiatives directed at the reduction of NOX emissions as well as a patent infringement suit brought by Pavilion in the third quarter of 2000.       During 2000 and early 2001, various court actions affirmed most of the EPA's NOX initiatives as well as EPA's authority to promulgate these and similar air quality regulations (which authority had been legally challenged). Accordingly, the power generation industry is resuming efforts to determine the manner in which it will comply with the EPA NOX initiatives.       On April 11, 2001, Pegasus and Pavilion agreed to dismiss the Pavilion Lawsuit and the Pegasus Answer, without prejudice, in order to explore possible business combinations, cooperative relationships and other alternatives. To the extent that these efforts are not successful, Pegasus, in coordination with its licensor, intends to vigorously defend against the Pavilion Lawsuit and to aggressively pursue the Pegasus Answer and Pegasus Counterclaims. See also Part I--Item 3--Legal Proceedings.       In 2000, Pegasus hired a new CEO, Gary Nicholson, with a uniquely suited background in power generation information technology, control systems and systems integration, coal mining and a strong base of management and marketing skills. During 2000, under his leadership, Pegasus' achievements included the completion of several outstanding installation projects with improved customer satisfaction, the introduction of another improvement to NeuSIGHT to further streamline installation efforts, the receipt of an order for the installation of NeuSIGHT in China and the initiation of an exclusive licensing arrangement for China with an experienced local partner with strong US ties. Despite the difficulties imposed by the legal challenges to the EPA's NOX initiatives and the Pavilion lawsuit, Pegasus achieved improved revenue growth from 1999 to 2000 of 23% compared to a 16% increase in revenues from 1998 to 1999.      In early 2000, after completion of an analysis of issues impacting the growth and success of Pegasus, the Company decided to move the Denver, Colorado headquarters activities of Pegasus, which included marketing and sales administration, general accounting and financial reporting, to the Pegasus Cleveland, Ohio area offices which include its operations and research and development activities. This move was substantially completed during the second quarter of 2000, and has provided more effective management and coordination of and communication among Pegasus' various activities.      Progress to commercialize K-Fuel Technology continued during 2000, culminating with the announcement in early 2001 of the successful demonstration of an improved coal upgrading process resulting from the joint efforts of KFx and Kennecott Energy, through the K-Fuel, LLC joint venture. This 16-month project, performed by Kennecott Energy's affiliate, Rio Tinto Technical Services, evaluated historical information, issues impacting the operations of the existing Gillette commercial K-Fuel facility, off-the-shelf equipment, and methods to achieve continuous operations to improve the economics of the production process. The principal differences from the K-Fuel Series C process previously used are continuous operations, lower temperatures, and the absence of superheat from the system.      The resulting product, which in the tests was produced from PRB coals, is low in SO2, NOX, mercury and chlorine, similar to K-Fuel. The analysis also indicated that an improved process can possibly be designed to produce the new fuel within potentially attractive economic constraints and that tie K-Fuel production process proposed as a result of the project should be more reliable than the current Gillette commercial plant and have lower capital and operating costs than any previous design.      The heating value of the new fuel as tested is approximately 11,200 to 11,600 Btu's per pound. Upon combustion, the new fuel produces approximately 20% lower NOX emissions and lower mercury emissions, as compared to the PRB feedstock coal (already the lowest mercury content coal naturally available), and SO2 emissions well below the 1.0 lb per million Btu limit contained in Phase II of the CAA.      In addition, K-Fuel LLC believes that there may be considerable advantages to blending the new product and raw PRB coal. The dust and self-heating behaviors of a blend of the new product and raw PRB coal appear to be similar to raw PRB coal, without the need for oil or other treatment. The blend retains proportional NOX, SO2 and mercury reduction benefits. Accordingly, a commercial plant for the new product may be leveraged to provide considerably higher volumes of blended product for the market place.      On May 9, 2000, the Company closed a series of agreements with various pasties intended to initiate the redevelopment of the KFP Facility. Among other things, as a result of these agreements (a) a subsidiary of Black Hills Corporation (BKH) purchased the KFP Facility and received 2 million shares of KFx common stock previously held by TCK in exchange for the assumption of the reclamation liability associated with the KFP Facility, (b) KFx granted BKH a warrant to purchase 1.3 million shares of KFx common stock at $3.65 per share, subject to certain adjustments, (c) KFx relinquished its 5% interest in KFP to TCK and provided certain releases to TCK in exchange for approximately $1.5 million, (d) TCK sold the remaining 2.25 million common shares of KFx it owned to private investors and canceled the warrants it held to purchase a control position in KFx's common stock. KFx and BKH are proceeding to finalize plans and secure the necessary capital to rectify certain design flaws in the balance-of-plant systems in order to restart the KFP Facility and produce K-Fuel. The cost to implement these plans is currently estimated at $2 million to $4 million.      During 2000 and before, management of the Company has been evaluating various alternatives to raise capital and improve its balance sheet. The Pavilion Lawsuit filed in the third quarter of 2000, precluded many of the opuions that had been considered, some of which were in the process of being implemented at the time the Pavilion Lawsuit was filed. With the April 11, 2001 settlement of the Pavilion Lawsuit, the Company immediately resumed its efforts to raise needed capital for Pegasus and KFx and is considering various alternative relationships with Pavilion.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  Pegasus Software License and Services Revenue      The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition." The Company derives revenues from license fees, for the Company's NeuSIGHT software, and services, including installation, implementation, maintenance and training, under the terms of both fixed-price and time-and-materials contracts. Revenues are not recognized until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, either by way of a signed contract or signed purchase order.      Where services are essential to the functionality of the delivered software, the license fee and services revenue is generally recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, as prescribed by SOP 81-1 "Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts". The percentage of completion for each contract is determined based on the ratio of direct labor hours incurred to total estimated direct labor hours required to complete the contract. The Company may periodically encounter changes in costs, estimated costs and other factors that may lead to a change in the original estimated profitability of a fixed-price contract. In such circumstances, adjustments to cost and profitability estimates are made in the periods in which the underlying factors requiring such revisions become known. If such revisions indicate a loss on a contract, the entire loss is recorded at such time. Amounts billed in advance of services being performed are recorded as deferred revenue. Unbilled work-in-progress represents revenue earned but not yet billable under the terms of fixed price contracts and all such amounts are expected to be billed in accordance with performance milestones specified in the contract with the client and collected within twelve months. Deferred job costs represent up-front hardware costs incurred that will be amortized to expense over the term of related revenue recognition.      Services revenue provided under fixed-price contracts is generally recognized using the percentage completion method of accounting described above. Revenue from other services provided pursuant to time-and-materials contracts is recognized as the services are performed. Annual maintenance revenue is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the service period, which is generally twelve months.   K-Fuel Revenue      The Company recognizes revenue from K-Fuel licenses, when an agreement has been signed, all significant obligations have been satisfied, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Fees fsom contract services are recognized as the services are performed.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Year Ended December 31, 2000 vs. Year Ended December 31, 1999      The consolidated operating loss in 2000 of $8,998,405, which includes $3,575,622 of non-cash charges, was $1,521,363, or 20%, greater than the 1999 operating loss due primarily to (a) a K-Fuel license fee in 1999 that cootributed $750,000 to operating income, with no similar fee in 2000, (b) a non-cash charge approximating $464,000 at the K-Fuel segment due to the write-down of certain idle equipment (c) an increase approximating $865,000 in operating losses at Pegasus offset by (d) reduced KFx corporate and other costs and losses approximating $505,000.      Consolidated operating revenues decreased approximately $726,000, or 25% from 1999 to 2000 due primarily to (a) the $1 million K-Fuel license fee from Kennecott Energy in 1999 only, offset by (b) an increase in Pegasus revenues approximating $358,000, or 23%.      Consolidated operating costs and expenses in 2000 exceeded the 1999 level by approximately $795,000, or 8%. Pegasus operating costs increases of approximately $1,223,000 (25%) and the K-Fuel idle equipment write-down of $464,0000 were offset by the absence of K-Fuel royalty expense in 2000, that was $250,000 in 1999, a reduction in other operating costs of the K-Fuel demonstration plant and laboratory approximating $121,000, or 37%, due to reduced contract revenue and related activity level and cost reductions at the KFx corporate level approximating $505,000 (16%), resulting from staff reductions and various other costs reduction measures.      Pegasus cost increases from 1999 to 2000 included (a) an increase in cost of sales of $594,000 (50%) resulting from the 23% increase in sales as well as increased costs associated with ensuring the completion of certain installations to the satisfaction of customers, (b) a $279,000 (83%) increase in research and development as a result of more focus on product improvement and new product development resulting in part from Kennecott Energy's investments in Pegasus, and (c) a $129,000 (21%) increase in depreciation and amortization largely due to $115,000 (22%) of additional goodwill amortization stemming from an addition to goodwill in late 1999. Marketing, general and administrative costs for Pegasus increased by approximately $221,000 (8%) from 1999 to 2000, largely due to certain internal costs associated with the Pavilion Lawsuit that are not subject to indemnification.      Declines in KFx corporate and other costs included (a) $457,000 (17%) in reduced marketing, general and administrative expenses, resulting from reducing staff and executive office space and related expenses, and (b) $48,000 (9%) in reduced depreciation and amortization of debt issue costs resulting from the conversion of $1.9 million of Debentures during 2000.      Partially offsetting the variances from 1999 to 2000 in the Company's operating loss, the Company experienced a $1,962,000 net decrease in net non-operating expense items from 1999 to 2000. This decrease was primarily due to the net result of (a) a $4,000,000 impairment loss in 1999 related to the Company's investment in KFP compared to a $629,000 impairment loss in 2000 related to the Company's investment in Charco Redondo, (b) the recognition, beginning in 2000 of, the accretion of the maturity premium on the Company's Debentures, which totaled $1,362,000, and is included in interest expense, (c) a decline in interest and other income approximating $359,000, due largely to a $223,000 nonrecurring non cash income item in 1999, as well as a $116,000 decline in interest income due to lower cash balances, (d) a $134,000 (10%) increase in interest expense associated with increased borrowings and (e) the absence in 2000 of $452,000 of equity losses associated with the Company's investment in KFP.      The factors discussed above combined to produce a 2000 net loss of $12,290,172, which is approximately 3% below the $12,730,427 net loss for 1999. On a basic and diluted net loss per share basis, the $.49 loss for 2000 is approximately 6% lower than the $.53 loss for 1999 due to the smaller 2000 net loss as well as 3% increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding from 1999 to 2000.      The Company has not recorded a deferred tax benefit from KFx's and Pegasus' net operating loss carryforwards, which approximate $42,873,000 aod $4,151,000, respectively, at December 31, 2000, since, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company's deferred tax assets will not be realized. Certain limitations apply to the annual amount of net operating losses that can be used to offset taxable income, after certain ownership changes, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 382"). Although management does not believe Section 382 places significant limitations on the use of the Company's net operating loss carryforwards presently, transactions that may be consummated in order to obtain needed financing may result in ownership changes that are large enough to trigger the Section 382 limitations. In the event the Company achieves profitable operations and taxable income, any significant Section 382 limitation would have the effect of increasing the Company's income tax liability and reducing available cash resources.   Year Ended December 31, 1999 vs. Year Ended December 31, 1998      The consolidated operating loss in 1999 of $7,477,000, which includes $2,765,000 of non-cash charges, was $1,058,000, or 16% greater than the 1998 operating loss due primarily to an increase approximating $2,033,000 in operating losses at Pegasus partially offset by reduced operating losses for K-Fuel approximating $619,000 and a reduction in KFx corporate and other costs approximating $356,000.      Consolidated operating revenues increased approximately $630,000, or 28% from 1998 to 1999 due primarily to the $1 million K-Fuel license fee from Kennecott Energy. In addition, Pegasus revenues increased approximately $208,000, or 16%, but K-Fuel contract revenue declined approximately $578,000, or 65%. This decrease was primarily due to a $351,000 decline in contract revenues associated with services provided by the K-Fuel demonstration plant and laboratory to the KFP Facility, stemming from TCK's suspension of operations at the KFP Facility in June 1999. In addition, there was a $227,000 decline in revenues from a K-Fuel research and development contract with a third party, related to the K-Fuel demonstration plant and laboratory, due to certain administrative changes at the third party research and development contracting agency.      Consolidated operating costs and expenses in 1999 exceeded the 1998 level by approximately $1,688,000, or 20%, principally due to increased costs at Pegasus approximating $2,241,000, partially offset by comparative declines in K-Fuel costs of $197,000 and in KFx and other costs of $356,000.      Pegasus costs increased from 1998 to 1999, in part, because 1998 included three fewer months of Pegasus activity. Pegasus cost increases included (a) $426,000 (56%) in increased cost of sales associated with increased revenue, (b) $1,445,000 (118%) increased marketing, general and administrative costs resulting largely from efforts begun in late 1998 to develop a professional marketing and sales organization, (c) $197,000 (143%) in research and development costs associated with activities to develop enhancements to NeuSIGHT and new products and (d) $173,000 (39%) in depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased goodwill amortization.      Declines in K-Fuel costs include $474,000 (53%) in reduced K-Fuel demonstration plant and laboratory expense associated with the decline in related revenue discussed above partially offset by a $250,000 royalty expense associated with the K-Fuel license fee from Kennecott Energy. Declines in KFx corporate and other costs included (a) $224,000 (8%) in reeuced marketing, general and administrative expenses and (b) $132,000 (20%) in reduced depreciation and amortization as certain assets became fully depreciated during 1999.      In addition to the Company's operating loss, the Company experienced a $4,889,000 net increase in net non-operating expense items from 1998 to 1999. This increase was primarily due to (a) the recognition in 1998 of a $701,000 gain on sale of mine, (b) a decline in interest and other income approximating $320,000, due largely to a decline in the average balance of cash investments, partially offset by (c) a $175,000 reduction in KFx's share of losses at K-Fuel, LLC, due to lower R&D expenses, and (d) a $4,000,000 impairment of the Company's investment in KFP.      The factors discussed above combined to produce a net loss of $12,730,427 for 1999, which is $5,946,610 in excess of the 1998 net loss. On a basic and diluted per share basis, the 1999 loss was $.53 compared to $.28 in 1998.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      During 2000, the Company used approximately $5,151,000 of cash for its operating activities, which included (a) approximately $2,360,000 used to support and accelerate the growth of Pegasus' business, (b) $1,181,000 used for interest payments, (c) approximately $1,610,000 used for KFx corporate and other activities. The principal sources of cash during 2000 were (a) $3,000,000 from Kennecott Energy associated with its investment in Pegasus beginning in March (of which $1,000,000 was paid to KFx and $2,000,000 was invested in Pegasus), (b) the $1,527,000 recovery of the Company's investment in KFP and (c) $850,000 in net short term borrowings from KFx directors (of which $250,000 was borrowed by KFx and $600,000 was borrowed by Pegasus). In addition to cash used for operating activities the Company also used $532,000 of cash in total as follows: (a) K-Fuel patent applications ($295,000), (b) repayment of notes related to the 1998 acquisition of Pegasus ($171,000) and (c) purchases of property and equipment ($66,000).      During 1999, the Company used approximately $3,458,000 of cash for its operating activities, which included (a) approximately $1,952,000 used to support and accelerate the growth of Pegasus' business, (b) $1,148,000 used for interest payments, and (c) approximately $1,854,000 used for KFx corporate and other activities. Offsetting these uses of cash was approximately $1,496,000 of cash provided from the continued development of the K-Fuel business, principally the June 1999 agreement with Kennecott Energy which produced net operating cash flow of $1,750,000.      During 2000 and before, management of the Company has been evaluating various alternatives to raise capital and improve its balance sheet. The Pavilion Lawsuit filed in the third quarter of 2000, precluded many of the options that had been considered, some of which were in the process of being implemented at the time the Pavilion Lawsuit was filed. With the April 11, 2001 settlement of the Pavilion Lawsuit, the Company immediately resumed its efforts to raise needed capital for Pegasus and KFx and is considering various alternative relationships with Pavilion as discussed below.      During 2001, through April 13, the Company raised $1,900,000 in cash from certain transactions resulting in the sale of a portion (equivalent to an 11.2% as converted interest in Pegasus) of its preferred stock investment in Pegasus. KFx is obligated to repurchase this preferred stock for $2,533,333 within one year of the date it was sold, or earlier in certain circumstances.      At December 31, 2000, principal and interest under a promissory note to the State of Wyoming ("Wyoming") in the amount of $475,000 was due as follows: (a) February 1, 2001--$5,000 and (b) March 1, 2001--$470,000. The payment due March 1, 2001 was not paid. The Company initiated discussions with Wyoming in late February 2001 and on March 12, 2001 consummated an extension to July 1, 2001 in exchange for (a) a principal payment approximating $150,400 made on March 9, 2001, (b) a delinquent payment fee approximating $47,200 made on March 9, 2001, (c) an interest payment approximating $2,400 made on March 9, 2000, (d) the assignment to Wyoming of the net sales proceeds of the balance of the Company's preferred stock investment in Pegasus (with a face value approximating $1 million, representing an interest in Pegasus approximating 4.4% and (e) a collateral interest in certain K-Fuel related equipment that is not currently in use.      Circumstances substantially identical to those in the preceding paragraph arose relative to promissory notes due Wyoming by KFx's Chairman and one of his affiliates. The Company agreed in 1994 to indemnify its Chairman and his affiliate for any payments made under such note, upon his demand, since their obligation stemmed from their personal guarantee of certain obligations of the Company that were renegotiated in 1994. During 2000, the Company made related principal and interest payments on behalf of its Chairman totaling $82,150. In addition, similar payments totaling $12,210 were made through April 12, 2001. The Company's Chairman and his affiliate have agreed to waive their indemnification rights for future payments under certain circumstances. Wyoming issued a notice of default relative to this note on March 2, 2001, triggering a 10-day cure period. On March 12, 2001, Wyoming agreed to forebear from collection activities under this note until July 1, 2001.      The Company will seek to meet its cash requirements over the balance of 2001 with respect to day-to-day operations and debt service requirements through (a) cash on hand, which as of April 13, 2001 approximated $306,000; (b) the net sales proceeds of the balance of the Company's preferred stock inwestment in Pegasus that has been assigned to Wyoming; (c) approximately $500,000 of Kennecott Energy's discretionary investments in Pegasus pursuant to provisions of the agreements executed in March 2000; (d) potential investments in Pegasus from interested participants in the power generation industry; (e) potential debt and/or equity offerings of the Company; (f) potential fees from licensing new K-Fuel facilities; (g) potential partners in connection with opportunities to expand the Company's product and service offerings to the power industry; (g) potential contract revenues relating to the K-Fuel demonstration plant and laboratory; and (h) unsecured borrowings from one or more of its directors.      The Company has contacted and has been contacted by several large suppliers to the power generation industry about the potential of making an investment in Pegasus. In addition, the Company is considering the potential for debt and/or equity offerings by the Company and/or Pegasus and has had related discussions with investment banking firms. At this stage, discussions with all of these parties are preliminary, but the Company intends to continue such discussions and negotiate definitive agreements if acceptable terms can be reached.      The Company is continuing to work toward its goal of licensing a large commercial K-Fuel plant to Kennecott Energy.      The Company has had discussions with various parties about potential transactions to add product and/or service offerings relevant to the power generation industry. Such discussions have included consideration of acquisitions and related transactions to raise equity capital for the Company and/or Pegasus. Although currently there are no active discussions, the Company will continue to evaluate the merits of pursuing such a strategy, in view of the Company's evolving financial condition. In adeition, from time to time, directors of the Company have provided to the Company short term unsecured financing and the Company expects that such financing, on at least a short-term basis, will continue to be available if needed.      Depending on the outcome of various uncertainties, including those discussed herein, the Company may be required to seek additional debt and/or equity financing for general operating purposes and/or to meet debt service requirements. The timing of collection of accounts receivable and payment of accounts payable could significantly alter the Company's need for at least temporary financing. Should the Company be required to seek any additional debt and/or equity financing, its ability to do so will be affected by the terms of the Debentures, which contain a number of restrictions including (a) limitations on the Company's ability to incur secured and unsecured debt, (b) limitations on the Company's ability to sell assets or enter into merger agreements, and (c) provisions that would reduce the Debenture conversion price from $3.65 per share, if the Company sells KFx Common Stock is sold at a price below $3.65 per share.      There are no assurances that any of these potential funding sources will materialize, and the Company does not currently have any commitments with respect to any such funding sources. If the overall outcome of the various uncertainties affecting the Company is not favorable, the Company may be forced to seek debt and/or equity financing on terms and conditions that may be unfavorable to the Company, if available at all. If the Company requires additional financing and cannot obtain it when needed, the Company may default on payments when due. Should the Company not be successful in achieving one or more of the financing alternatives discussed above, it is possible that the Company may not be able to continue as a going concern.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS      In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," (the "Bulletin"), which addresses revenue recognition issues. The implementation of the Bulletin was delayed until the fourth quarter of 2000 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1999. The application of the Bulletin was retroactive to January 1, 2000. The impact of the Bulletin on the Company's consolidated financial statements was not material.      In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires, among other things, that all desivative instruments be recognized at fair value as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that changes in fair value generally be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Because the Company does not hold any derivative financial instruments and has not engaged in hedging activities, the Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 133 to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS 133 in the first quarter of 2001.   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK      The Company is not currently subject to a significant level of direct market risk related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices or equity prices. The Company has no derivative instruments and only $850,000 of floating rate debt and does not expect to derive a material amount of its revenues from interest bearing securities. Currently the Company has no significant foreign operations. To the extent that the Company establishes significant foreign operations in the future, it will attempt to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates contractually and through the use of hedging activities and other means considered appropriate. The Company is indirectly exposed to fluctuations in fuel commodity prices. To the extent that fuel prices rise, there may be a tendency for greater demand for certain of the Company's products and services, since K-Fuel and NeuSIGHT have been shown to result in lower usage of coal and coal beneficiated fuel products when used to generate electric power. The Company's fuel-related products provide various environmental benefits that management believes significantly mitigate the fuel commodity risk associated with the Company's business. The Company holds no equity market securities, but does face equity market risk relative to its own equity securities.   ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA
