ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS                 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified by reference to, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto in Item 8 of this report and Selected Financial Data included in Item 6 of this report. Certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform of 1995. Refer to the "Cautionary Statement About Forward Looking Statements" preceding Item 1 of this report. Also, for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business and operations see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report.       Overview               We were founded in 1984, as a cleaner coal technology, energy production and environmental solutions company focused on developing our proprietary technologies. Our goal now is to leverage an integrated technology strategy, including a coal-based technology platform and proven production process to deliver a cleaner, more efficient and affordable solid fuel available to meet the growing energy demands of industrial and utility customers while addressing important environmental concerns. In addition, we are leveraging a science-based carbon information management software solution built on a platform of IBM products and solutions to measure greenhouse gases and certify carbon emission reduction credits.            In November 2008, we requested Houlihan Lokey, an international investment bank, to provide independent advice to our management and board of directors as we continue to explore the strategic positioning of the company. We expect to consider and evaluate several alternatives during the engagement, including, but not limited to, the potential sale or joint venture of our Buckeye subsidiary.            In March 2008, we suspended operations at our Fort Union plant in order to redirect constrained resources, both capital and human, to focus on the commercialization of this process in future K-Fuel plants. Suspending production at Fort Union enabled us to reduce our cash expenditures. The significant resources invested in the Fort Union plant served three important purposes:       First, as an engineering and process improvement platform, the Fort Union plant allowed Evergreen and Bechtel engineers and scientists to dramatically improve the performance of the K-Fuel process.       Second, Fort Union served as an important coal testing facility that allowed Evergreen to build a test results database from more than 100 coal types drawn from across the globe.       Third, Fort Union served as an important business development tool and production platform for thousands of tons of K-Fuel used for marketing and test burn purposes.             To date, we have idled the Fort Union boiler, processing towers and other equipment at the site and are safeguarding the assets and maintaining the plant in a non-operational mode. While we would be able to resume operations at the Fort Union plant to demonstrate the technology or to provide K-Fuel refined coal for test burns at utilities or other industrial sites, we would be required to return equipment to operational status, which could take several months. As time passes and the plant remains idled, the time and costs to convert it to an operational status will increase. We continue to evaluate redeploying some of the equipment to a future K-Fuel facility site.             The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries, including the nine months ended December 31, 2006 for Buckeye Industrial Mining Co. (acquisition date of April 3, 2006). We consolidate all of our majority-owned subsidiaries and reflect as minority interest the portion of these entities that we do not own and recorded in other long-term liabilities. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.    40                   Our segments include the C-Lock segment, Plant segment, Mining segment and Technology segment. The Mining segment primarily represents our mining operations of our subsidiary, Buckeye Industrial Mining Co., and includes certain marketing personnel, the ash disposal facility and the preparation and blending facility. The C-lock segment reflects activities related to the measurement of green house gases and certification of environmental improvements as carbon credits. The Plant segment primarily represents revenue and costs related to our Fort Union plant in Gillette, Wyoming, at which we suspended operations in March 2008. The Technology segment is comprised of all other operations that use, apply, own or otherwise advance our proprietary, patented K-Fuel process, including our headquarters and related operations, activities of Evergreen Energy Asia Pacific and KFx Technology, LLC, which holds the licenses to our technology. Corporate costs within our Technology segment are allocated to our other segments, generally on a percentage based on the number of employees, total segment operating expenses, or segment operating expenses plus segment capital expenditures.       Significant Trends               For the last several years, our operations have been focused on developing our technology and the construction of the Fort Union plant. As a result, we have limited revenues from K-Fuel refined coal and, historically most of our costs are related to general and administrative expenses. With the addition of Buckeye, we have begun to generate revenue and incur more substantial mining costs. In the future, we plan to build, own and operate K-Fuel and K-Direct refineries domestically and internationally, both wholly owned and through joint ventures. Through C-Lock Technology we plan to generate future revenues from the measurement of greenhouse gases and certification of environmental improvements as carbon credits. The following discussion and analysis is focused on the events and trends that we believe have or will in the future have the most significant impact on our business.      Revenue Trends             In the future we expect to generate revenue from the following sources:       coal sales from our Buckeye operations;       revenues from the measurement of carbon credits using our web-based patented technology;      revenues from production facilities including K-Fuel and K-Direct plants domestically and internationally; and       licensing of our technology, including license fees for constructing a plant and royalty fees for operating a plant.             We have granted certain rights and limited licenses for the use of certain K-Fuel technology, which may limit our revenue from production of K-Fuel refined coal to the extent that the rights are exercised. See Item 8 Note5 Other Assets and Note13 Commitments and Contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.     Expense Trends        Coal mining operating expenses               With the acquisition of Buckeye, we have incurred mine operating expenses including all costs associated with the mining of saleable coal and costs relating to our coal ash disposal facility. As capital is available, we anticipate increasing our production at our mines. We expect that the revenue generated from increased production will exceed the incremental mining costs.       Fort Union               In March 2008, we suspended operations at our Fort Union plant in order to redirect constrained resources, both capital and human, to focus on the commercialization of this process in future K-Fuel    41           plants. Suspending production at Fort Union enabled us to reduce our cash expenditures. Overall, while we anticipate costs to decline in 2009, we will continue to incur various costs related to maintaining the site in a non-operational mode.       Future K-Fuel and K-Direct facilities               As we build future K-Fuel and K-Direct facilities and these facilities begin continuous operation, we will incur additional operational expenses, the most significant being:       coal transportation costs;       raw material costs;       outsourced engineering and technical support;       plant maintenance costs;       plant personnel labor costs;       fluid processing costs;       by-product and water disposal costs; and       royalty costs, relating to fees we owe to parties who own certain rights that support our patents and proprietary technology, primarily the Koppelman estate.             See further discussion of the royalty owed to the estate of Edward Koppelman in Note 5Other Assets in Item 8 of this report.       General and administrative expenses               As we identify business development opportunities, build new plants, and generally expand our business including hiring additional personnel at our corporate offices, future plants and C-Lock locations and increasing outsourced professional services, we will incur additional expenses, the most significant of which are:       payroll and related burdens;       non-cash, share-based compensation;       business development costs for potential future K-Fuel and K-Direct plants;      rent and utilities; and       professional support fees.             We anticipate that accounting for non-cash, share-based compensation will add approximately $6.0 million to $9.0 million per year in the foreseeable future to our expenses. In the event we should achieve certain performance goals, we would significantly accelerate recognition of these costs. Costs such as payroll and related burdens, professional support fees and utilities are variable costs that increase with size and adding locations. As we build new plants and expand our vertical integration strategy, we expect these costs to increase in future periods.     Results of Operations      Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007        Revenue               Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $58.9 million compared to $48.7 million for the same period ended December 31, 2007.    42                    Revenues in our Mining segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $58.4 million and $47.4 million for the same period ended December 31, 2007 respectively, as follows:       Coal revenue includes mined raw and prepared coal sales within our Buckeye operations. Buckeye coal sales, including transportation costs charged to customers, were $50.7 million and $39.4 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Coal sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were 727,197 tons at $69.72 sales realization per ton sold compared to 728,059 tons at $54.12 sales realization per tons sold for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the sales realization per ton sold for the year ended December 31, 2008 was due to higher coal prices when compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Our production tons for the year ended December 31, 2008, were less than anticipated due to power outages and other weather issues related to Hurricane Ike. In addition, we experienced unexpected adverse roof conditions resulting from clay vein slip areas in a section of one of our underground mining veins. We have resolved the roof conditions by using longer bolts in each of the main entries, more bolts and narrowing the belt entry. We were also required to obtain the Mine Safety and Health Administrations approval of the revised roof control and ventilation plans, which took longer than anticipated. We believe that all issues are resolved and Buckeye is now producing at expected levels. We anticipate coal prices to remain consistent with the 2008 prices in 2009.       Brokered coal sales, net include the revenues reduced by costs associated with the purchase of coal from other coal producers, which we ship directly to customers. We recognized $437,000 of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $514,000 of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007. We enter into brokered coal sales as opportunities arise or as needed to meet certain customers requests, and as a result, revenues in this area fluctuate.      Ash disposal revenues primarily include revenues generated from the disposal of coal combustion bi-products at our ash pit in Ohio. Ash disposal revenues were $7.3 million and $7.4 million for years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.             K-Fuel refined coal revenue is comprised of sales of our K-Fuel product to third parties. Blended K-Fuel refined coal revenue represents the proportionate revenue related to K-Fuel that has been blended with other raw or prepared coal from our Buckeye operations and sold to third parties. The remaining revenue related to the raw or prepared coal is reflected in Mining revenues. K-Fuel refined coal and blended K-Fuel refined coal sales were $463,000 and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively and are included in our Plant segment.       Coal Mining Operating Expenses               Our coal mining operating expenses include all costs associated with the mining of saleable coal and costs relating to our coal ash disposal facility at Buckeye, which principally comprises our Mining segment.       Coal mining operating expenses               Coal mining operating expenses include employee-related costs, outside contracted mining costs for our underground mines, internal and external coal transportation costs, blasting, drilling, heavy equipment costs, purchased coal and other mining-related costs. Coal mining operating expenses were $42.4 million and $38.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in cost per ton in comparing the year ended December 31, 2008 to 2007 is primarily due to the increased price of fuel used to mine and transport coal.       Ash disposal               Ash disposal expenses include employee-related costs, consulting costs, costs of repairs and maintaining culverts and drainage ponds, transportation, and heavy equipment costs and other costs    43            associated with the ash disposal facility. Ash disposal expenses were $5.4 million and $4.8 million for the periods ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.       General and Administrative               Corporate costs within our Technology segment are allocated to our other segments, generally on a percentage based on the number of employees, total segment operating expenses or segment operating expenses plus segment capital expenditures. As a result of idling our Fort Union plant, these allocated costs have significantly decreased in our Plant segment and increased in other segments most notable in our Technology segment, for the year ended 2008 when compared to 2007.            The following table summarizes our general and administrative costs for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.                         Year Ended  December 31,              2008      2007              (in thousands)         Employee non-cash, share-based compensation        5,956     $  19,015         Employee-related costs        12,559        11,721         Professional fees        3,908        4,152         Office and travel costs        3,830        3,498         Insurance and other        5,712        4,645                                Total general and administrative     $  31,965     $  43,031                                      Employee non-cash, share-based compensation expenses were $6.0 million and $19.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, substantially all of which related to our Technology segment. The decrease related to the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007, was due to the terminations of two former executive officers and one-time charges of $10.5 million related to the accelerated vesting of a portion of their restricted stock grants.            Employee-related costs primarily include salaries and wages, temporary employees, bonuses, benefits, employer payroll taxes and education and training. The following table summarizes our employee-related costs related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.                         Year Ended  December 31,              2008      2007              (in thousands)         Technology        5,585     $  4,617         Plant        1,834        3,975         Mining        2,502        2,593         C-Lock        2,638        536                                Total Employee-related     $  12,559     $  11,721                                      Employee-related costs were $13.0 million and $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increases for the year ended December 31, 2008 in comparison to the same period in 2007, were primarily due to adding personnel to our C-Lock segment, as well as adding engineering and other personnel in our Technology segment, recruiting fees, an overall increase in health insurance costs and changes in the allocation of corporate costs to various segments.    44                   Professional fees include legal, audit and accounting, public relations, governmental relations and similar costs. The following table summarizes our professional fees related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.                         Year Ended  December 31,              2008      2007              (in thousands)         Technology        2,340     $  2,929         Plant        363        478         Mining        375        335         C-Lock        830        410                                Total Professional fees     $  3,908     $  4,152                                      The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007, was due to less outsourced engineering work as a result of increasing our corporate engineering staff in our Technology segment. Offsetting these savings were increased professional fees in our C-Lock segment associated with patent-related costs.            Office and travel costs include airfare, lodging, meals, office rent, marketing, office supplies, phone, publications, subscriptions and utilities. The following table summarizes our office and travel costs related to each of our segments for years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.                         Year Ended  December 31,              2008      2007              (in thousands)         Technology     $  2,255     $  2,061         Plant        449        867         Mining        245        234         C-Lock        881        336                                Total Office and travel     $  3,830     $  3,498                                      The increases in office and travel costs for the year ended December 31, 2008, were primarily for international and domestic travel related to our business development efforts in both our Technology and C-Lock segments.            Insurance and other costs primarily include costs related to our property and commercial liability, other insurance and all costs that cannot be categorized elsewhere and include, among other costs, various business and franchise taxes, licensing fees, repair and maintenance, engineering and technical services and director expenses. The following table summarizes our insurance and other costs related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.                         Year Ended  December 31,              2008      2007              (in thousands)         Technology     $  3,740     $  2,776         Plant        409        511         Mining        742        765         C-Lock        821        593                                Total Insurance and other     $  5,712     $  4,645                             45              Plant costs               Subsequent to the idling of the Fort Union plant, costs primarily consist of salaries and wages, security and repair and maintenance. Previously, plant costs included purchased raw materials, coal transportation, outsourced engineering and technical support, fluid processing, by-products and water disposal, and employee-related costs, which are reflected in our Plant segment. Plant costs decreased during the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to the idling of our Fort Union plant in late March 2008. Overall, while we anticipate costs to decline in 2009, we will continue to incur various costs related to maintaining the site in a non-operating mode.       Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization               Depreciation, depletion and amortization are principally comprised of (1) depletion, based on actual tons mined at our mine sites in Ohio; (2) amortization related to our patents; and (3) depreciation on other fixed assets using the straight-line method. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses were $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $8.4 million during the same period ended 2007.       Research and Development               Research and development costs include costs incurred to advance, test, or otherwise modify our proprietary technology or develop new technologies and primarily include costs incurred to operate and maintain our laboratory facilities and professional engineering fees related to off-site testing of our K-Fuel refined coal. Research and development costs were $79,000 and $876,000 for the years ended 2008 and 2007, respectively. As a result of cost cutting measures, we decreased the number of employees and the corresponding salary and wages in our lab at our Gillette site.       Asset Impairment Charges               Asset impairment charges were $18.6 million and $122.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2008, relate to further impairment of our boiler island which was classified as assets held for sale. See Note6 Assets Held for Sale in Item 8 of this report for further details. Impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2007 are as follows:       we suspended operations at our Fort Union plant to allow us to focus on future K-Fuel or K-Direct plants by redirecting constrained resources, both capital and human, to focus on the commercialization of our process. We incurred impairment charges in our Plant segment totaling $109.5 million.       pursuant to the guidance of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", or SFAS 144, we are required to evaluate the fair value of our boiler, which is classified as held for sale. As result, of this fair value calculation we impaired the carrying value of our boiler by $7.8 million in our Technology segment;       we impaired $3.6 million of capitalized costs related to projects that we abandoned and/or replaced with more cost effective projects in our Plant segment; and       we impaired capital costs of $2.1 million related to a previously announced future potential project with a major utility because it was determined not to be economically feasible in our Technology segment.    46                  Other Income Expense      Interest income               Interest income was $1.3 million and $4.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was principally attributable to a lower cash balance as well as reduced interest rates during 2008.       Interest expense               Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 was $6.1 million and $3.4 million, respectively. Interest expense relates to the $95.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8.00% convertible secured notes due 2012, which we completed in July 2007. The increase in interest expense is in direct relation to the time and amount of the notes outstanding in 2008 compared to 2007. We anticipate interest expense to significantly decrease in future periods due to the conversion of 71% of these outstanding convertible secured notes.       Gain on debt for equity exchange transactions               During the year ended December 31, 2008, we entered into multiple individually negotiated agreements with certain existing noteholders to exchange $67.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 8.00% convertible secured notes due 2012, for an aggregate of 48.6 million shares of our common stock. We recognized a $6.1 million gain, which was reduced by transaction costs, non-cash reversal of debt issue costs and non-cash adjustment related to the embedded derivatives.       Other income (expense)               During the year ended December 31, 2008, other expense was $300,000 as compared to $1.4 million of other expense for the same period ended 2007. Pursuant to FAS 133, we estimated the fair value of the embedded derivatives as of July 30, 2007, when the notes were issued, and recorded those values as either assets or liabilities. In addition, we are required to evaluate the fair value of the embedded derivatives at the end of each subsequent reporting period. We recognized a decrease in the fair value of the derivatives of $934,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008. This fair value adjustment is a non-cash item and each quarter's estimation exercise is impacted, in part, by our stock price. For additional information, see Note 9Debt included in Item 8 of this report. In addition we recognized a $744,000 gain for insurance reimbursements for cost incurred to repair certain equipment at our Fort Union plant for the year ended December 31, 2008.     Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006        Revenue               Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $48.7 million compared to $36.7 million for the same period ended December 31, 2006. The increase in revenue primarily relates to our April 2006 acquisition of Buckeye. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we owned Buckeye for only nine months. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we owned Buckeye for the entire twelve-month period.            Revenues in our Mining segment for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $47.4 million and $35.9 million for the same period ended December 31, 2006 respectively, as follows:       Buckeye coal sales, including transportation costs charged to customers, for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $39.4 million or 728,059 tons at $54.12 sales realization per ton sold and $30.4 million or 539,773 tons at $56.32 sales realization per ton sold for the period ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in the sales realization per ton sold for the year ended December 31, 2007 was due to a mix of types of coals sold during 2007 and downward pressure on coal pricing, particularly during the first quarter of 2007 resulting from depressed    47              international coal prices. During periods of depressed coal pricing, we strategically adjust the mix of coal we produce to focus less on our premium coals. As prices had improved in 2008, we increased production of our premium coals and our sales realization per ton increased in 2008, as compared to 2007.        We recognized $514,000 of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $695,000 of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. We enter into brokered coal sales as opportunities arise or as needed to meet certain customers requests, and as a result, revenues in this area fluctuate.      Ash disposal revenues were $7.4 million and $4.7 million for years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.             K-Fuel refined coal and blended K-Fuel refined coal sales were $1.1 million and $420,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively and are included in our Plant segment. K-Fuel refined coal sales were less than expected primarily due to less production at our Fort Union plant for both periods.       Coal Mining Operating Expenses      Coal mining operating expenses               Coal mining operating expenses were $38.3 million and $28.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase can be attributed to the acquisition of Buckeye in April 2006, resulting in recording nine months of Buckeye's operation for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to recording twelve months of Buckeye's operations for the year ended December 31, 2007.       Ash disposal               Ash disposal expenses were $4.8 million and $3.4 million for the periods ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.       General and Administrative               The following table summarizes our general and administrative costs for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.                         Year Ended  December 31,              2007      2006              (in thousands)         Employee non-cash, share-based compensation     $  19,015     $  9,803         Employee-related costs        11,721        8,045         Non-cash, Arch warrants                1,692         Professional fees        4,152        4,113         Office and travel costs        3,498        2,555         Insurance and other        4,645        2,634                                Total general and administrative     $  43,031     $  28,842                                      Employee non-cash, share-based compensation expenses were $19.0 million and $9.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, substantially all of which related to our Technology segment. The increase related to the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006, was due to the terminations of two former executive officers and one-time charges of $10.5 million related to the accelerated vesting of a portion of their restricted stock grants.    48                   The following table summarizes our employee-related costs related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.                         Year Ended  December 31,              2007      2006              (in thousands)         Technology     $  4,617     $  4,459         Plant        3,975        2,113         Mining        2,593        1,473         C-Lock        536                                        Total Employee-related     $  11,721     $  8,045                                      The increases for the year ended December 31, 2007 in comparison to the comparable period in 2006 were primarily due to a company-wide increase in health insurance costs and adding personnel, including plant and engineering personnel. In addition, through the acquisition of Buckeye, we incurred twelve months of expense in 2007 compared to nine months of expense in 2006. The small increase in the technology segment and the substantial increase in the plant segment were due to more corporate resources being used at our Fort Union plant during 2007 and the associated allocation of those expenses.            The following table summarizes our professional fees related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.                         Year Ended  December 31,              2007      2006              (in thousands)         Technology     $  2,929     $  3,469         Plant        478        433         Mining        335        211         C-Lock        410                                        Total Professional fees     $  4,152     $  4,113                                      The following table summarizes our office and travel costs related to each of our segments for years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.                         Year Ended  December 31,              2007      2006              (in thousands)         Technology     $  2,061     $  1,767         Plant        867        583         Mining        234        205         C-Lock        336                                        Total Office and travel     $  3,498     $  2,555                                      The anticipation of hiring additional employees at our corporate office led to our office expansion and relocation in May 2007, and the related increases in rent, utilities and relocation costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period ended 2006. Our travel for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased due to an increase in the number of trips to our Fort Union plant as well as increased business development efforts. In addition, during the same period we incurred    49             non-recurring charges relating to a loss on the sub-lease of our former corporate office space and moving costs.            The following table summarizes our insurance and other costs related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.                         Year Ended  December 31,              2007      2006              (in thousands)         Technology     $  2,776     $  2,052         Plant        511        74         Mining        765        508         C-Lock        593                                        Total Insurance and other     $  4,645     $  2,634                                      The increase for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period ended 2006 can be attributed to the following:       A licensing fee paid to the owner of the proprietary technology for the measurement of carbon emissions related to the formation of our subsidiary, C-Lock Technology, Inc, which is reflected in the C-Lock segment;       Increase in insurance due to the acquisition of Buckeye, which is reflected in the Mining segment;      Increase in business development costs associated with the identification of key public utility leads, which are candidates for our process, and development of those leads, which is reflected in the Technology segment; and       Overall increase in property and commercial liability premiums for our Fort Union plant, which is reflected in the Plant segment.       Plant costs               Plant costs were higher than anticipated due to general start-up issues with this first-of-a-kind plant and technical and operation improvements being implemented. Plant costs were $34.7 million and $26.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During the majority of the year ended December 31, 2006, we were in the construction and commissioning phases and most of the costs incurred during these phases were capitalized. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we were in the start-up phase and a higher percentage of costs associated with the operations of our Fort Union plant were expensed as incurred. In addition, non-capitalized costs increased as a result of engineering and technical work performed to improve and reconfigure our Fort Union plant.       Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization               Depreciation, depletion and amortization are comprised of (1) depreciation on our Fort Union plant using the units-of-production method, based on actual tons processed and depreciation on other fixed assets using the straight-line method; (2) depletion, based on actual tons mined at our mine sites in Ohio; and (3) amortization related to our patents. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses were $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $5.5 million during the same period ended 2006. The increases are primarily attributable to the acquisition of Buckeye and the related depreciation and depletion on our mine sites and property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2007.    50              Research and Development               Research and development costs were $876,000 and $1.4 million for the years ended 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease is primarily a result of our Fort Union plant entering the start-up phase of operation, which resulted in costs that were previously classified as research and development now being classified as plant costs.       Asset Impairment Charges               Asset impairment charges were $122.7 million for December 31, 2007 and were previously described. Asset impairment charges were $335,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006.       Other Income Expense      Interest income               Interest income was $4.3 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2007 is attributed to interest earned on our cash balance, which was significantly lower compared to the same period in 2006.       Interest expense               Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 was $3.4 million and $6,000, respectively. The interest expense relates to our long-term debt due 2012, which we completed in July 2007. We pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 8.00% per annum, due on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on February 1, 2008. For additional information, see Note 9Debt included in Item 8 of this report.       Other income (expense)               During the year ended December 31, 2007, other expense was $1.4 million as compared to $1.1 million of other income for the same period ended 2006. We recognized a decrease in the fair value of the derivatives of $1.7 million. This fair value adjustment is a non-cash item and each quarter's estimation exercise is impacted, in part, by our stock price. For additional information, see Note 9Debt included in Item 8 of this report.             On November 26, 2003, we completed an equity exchange transaction with Rio Tinto Energy America Services Company ("RTEA"), formerly Kennecott Energy Company. As a part of the exchange transaction, an intercompany working capital loan from Evergreen Energy to Pegasus Technologies Inc. with an outstanding balance of $9.4 million was exchanged for a contingent earn-out agreement of up to $9.4 million in the aggregate, plus accrued interest (prime rate plus 500 basis points), payable out of a portion of future cash flows generated by Pegasus. Due to the contingent nature of this potential stream of future cash flows, we did not recognize an asset or any associated income at the time of the exchange transaction. On May 16, 2006, RTEA entered into a transaction involving its investment in Pegasus. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement entered into between us and RTEA dated November 7, 2003, which triggered the earn-out provision, we received a payment of $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 from Pegasus as a payment in full satisfaction of the $9.4 million contingent obligation. This transaction had no effect on our note receivable from Pegasus.     2009 Liquidity and Capital Resources Discussion             During 2008, we have reduced our cash flow used in operations by $15.3 million, when compared to 2007. We accomplished these savings principally by suspending operations at our Fort Union plant, reducing professional fees and other general and administrative costs. These cost reductions were offset by the expansion of our C-Lock operations, including the addition of personnel and other administrative costs associated with developing a business. In addition, we have invested $16.8 million in capital expenditures, primarily related to Buckeye, C-Lock's software development and completion of    51             the K-Fuel enhanced tower design and other K-Fuel process development. The capital expenditures related to Buckeye were related to capitalizable maintenance and acquisition of certain equipment, which has positioned it to expand its production in 2009 and thereafter.             As previously mentioned, we are evaluating several strategic alternatives including, but not limited to, the potential sale or joint venture of Buckeye. If this evaluation indicates that sale or joint venture of Buckeye is not appropriate at this time, we will retain and continue to operate it. Alternatively, sale or joint venture of Buckeye could provide Evergreen with immediate access to significant capital that could be reinvested in the growth of our C-Lock and K-Fuel energy technologies. In order to ensure that we had sufficient operating capital, we entered into the financing arrangement described below to provide financial flexibility as we complete this evaluation.            On March 20, 2009, we executed a senior secured convertible note agreement which provides for the issuance of $15 million in aggregate principal amount of 10% Senior Secured Promissory Notes (the "Notes") in three $5 million tranches. The first $5 million tranche was funded on March 20, 2009. The second $5 million tranche, which must be drawn, will be funded upon our request no later than April 3, 2009 and upon satisfaction that all conditions precedent to closing have been met. The third tranche is available to be drawn at any time prior to the maturity of the Notes upon our request and upon satisfaction that all conditions precedent to closing have been met. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 10% per annum beginning on the funding date of each tranche through December 20, 2009, and all interest is required to be prepaid at the time the Note is issued and is non-refundable. The Notes are secured by all of Buckeye's assets and Evergreen Operation LLC's equity interest in Buckeye. The Notes will mature at the earlier of December 20, 2009 or the sale of Buckeye and may be prepaid in whole or in part. Upon repayment, we will pay the face amount of the Notes outstanding at the rate of: 105% if repaid by June 20, 2009; 110% if repaid after June 20, 2009 but before September 20, 2009 and 115% thereafter. The holder of the Notes may, at its option and at any time prior to the maturity date, convert such Notes, in whole or in part, into our common stock at a conversion price of $3.65 per share. In addition to other covenants, the note purchase agreement places limits on the ability of Buckeye to incur additional indebtedness or incur other liens upon its property. Please see a detailed description of the Notes in Item 9BOther Information or Note 9Debt in Item 8 of this report.            In July 2007, we completed a convertible debt offering that provided us with approximately $72 million, net of amounts held in escrow and offering costs. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we entered into multiple individually negotiated agreements with certain existing noteholders to exchange $67.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 8.00% convertible secured notes due 2012, for an aggregate of 48.6 million shares of our common stock. We issued all the shares by December 2008 except for 9.3 million, which represents $12.5 million of principal value of the notes. During the first quarter of 2009, we closed additional portions of this remaining transaction and issued an aggregate of 4.0 million shares, representing $5.4 million of principal value of notes. We anticipate the remaining conversion to take place in 2009. These exchange transactions will dramatically reduce the interest we owe related to these notes in 2009. Further, we received the requisite consents to amend the indenture and, in compliance with the terms and provisions of the indenture, we, each of the guarantors and the trustee, executed a supplemental indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture"). See further discussion in Note 9- Debt in Item 8 of this report.            We believe because of the actions described above, along with the anticipated cash flows from our Buckeye operations, the proceeds of the senior secured convertible note agreement described above and the ability to adjust capital and certain operational spending, our current cash level is sufficient to support our corporate and other operations for the foreseeable future. However, if Buckeye experiences unexpected declines in production for any reason, including but not limited to, heavy rains or flooding, slow-downs or suspension of operations for geologic or any other unanticipated reason, it could adversely impact our cash flow from operations. Further, continued market disruptions associated    52             with the global credit crisis could cause broader economic downturns, which may lead to lower demand for our technology or products, increased incidence of customers' inability to pay their accounts, or insolvency of our customers, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, and financial condition. We continue to evaluate our cash position and cash utilization and may make additional adjustments to capital or certain operating expenditures.             As we complete our strategic evaluation and identify alternatives, or as opportunities arise to construct K-Fuel facilities, further expand Buckeye's production volumes, accelerate our C-Lock operations, or our anticipated operating cash flows are less than expected, due to among other things, lower than anticipated production at Buckeye or a protracted global credit crisis, we may need to obtain additional funding. We plan to seek additional capital from time to time as needed principally through: (1) equity offerings; (2) debt or debt offerings; (3) partnering with third parties in the construction and operation for some of our large-scale commercial plants through the formation of joint ventures; and (4) sales or potential joint venture of certain assets. While we believe we will obtain additional capital through one or more of the alternatives described, we can provide no assurance that any of the alternatives will be available to us or be on terms acceptable to us.     Payment Obligations             The following table summarizes our future commitments as of December 31, 2008:                                        Payments due by period              2009      2010      2011      2012      2013      Thereafter      Total              (in thousands)         Operating leases     $  2,042     $  1,829     $  1,240     $  1,229     $  1,169     $  22,938     $  30,447         Purchasing commitments        3,498                                                3,498         Consulting and service commitments        500        500        500        500        500        10,000        12,500         Long-term debt        2,230        2,230        2,230        28,990                        35,680                                                              Total commitments     $  8,270     $  4,559     $  3,970     $  30,719     $  1,669     $  32,938     $  82,125                                                                    This table does not include accounts payable, accrued liabilities, or asset retirement obligations, which are reported in our December 31, 2008 Consolidated Balance Sheet. We generally have not included any obligation in which either party has the right to terminate except as discussed below. Additionally, we have not included royalty payments, as we cannot presently determine when such payments will be made as such payments are based upon our receipt of cash for licensing and royalties.            We are obligated under non-cancelable operating leases with initial terms exceeding one year relating to office space. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $1.1 million, $784,000, and $415,000, respectively. Additionally, included in operating leases is the rent obligation associated with our former headquarters totaling $577,000, which we have sub-leased but are not released from the obligation. Furthermore, included in operating leases is a 47-year port dock lease on the Ohio River, which we have the right to cancel upon six months written notice. If this lease were cancelled as of December 31, 2008, we would be obligated to pay $250,000 rather than the entire obligation of $23.5 million.            Purchase commitments include the purchase of underground mining equipment.            Consulting and service commitments include an exclusive patent sub-license agreement with the developer of a proprietary technology for the measurement of carbon emissions. The agreement provides us with an exclusive worldwide sub-license to a technology to standardize the measurement of carbon emissions in energy and agricultural related activities. The agreement was amended and restated to expand the energy and agricultural activities to all applications of the technology and eliminates other operating requirements. In order to maintain this licensing arrangement, we are required to make minimum annual royalty payments of $500,000 to the developer of the proprietary technology, with    53              each payment extending the arrangement for one year if the parties are in material compliance with the contract. Additionally, consulting and service commitments includes our amended and restated our umbrella agreement with Bechtel. Through this new program management agreement, we committed to provide Bechtel with $1 billion in construction contracts through 2013. Failure to meet this commitment by 2014 could cost us up to the $10 million in termination fees, which is included in the above table.            Long-term debt includes our principal amount due 2012 and the 8% interest payments. Long-term debt does not include the principal and interest payments for $12.5 million of notes, in which the agreement to convert has been signed as of December 31, 2008, but the exchange for 9.3 million of shares for the $12.5 million par value has not been closed. During the first quarter of 2009, we closed additional portions of this remaining transaction and issued an aggregate of 4.0 million shares, representing $5.4 million of principal value of notes. We anticipate the remaining conversion to take place in 2009.      Historical View        Cash Used in Operating Activities               Cash used in operating activities was $36.3 million, $51.6 million, and $30.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of the cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 relates to cash utilized in our on-going operations, as adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The most significant adjustments to net loss to arrive at cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 was a $18.6 million asset impairment, non-cash, share-based compensation expenses of $6.3 million, depreciation, depletion and amortization of $9.0 million and gain on debt for equity exchange transactions of $6.1 million.            The majority of the cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 relates to cash utilized in our on-going operations, as adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The most significant adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2007 was a $122.7 million impairment charge. Other significant adjustments to net loss to arrive at cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were: non-cash compensation expense of $19.6 million and $11.5 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively and depreciation, depletion and amortization of $8.4 million and $5.5 million, respectively, primarily from the acquisition of Buckeye.       Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities               Cash provided by investing activities was $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The majority of the uses of cash relate to the following:       We spent $16.8 million on our capital equipment, future plant design and construction in progress for the year ended December 31, 2008.       We purchased $5.0 million of marketable securities for the year ended December 31, 2008. We received proceeds from maturities of $27.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2008.       We received $15.0 million of restricted cash, net, primarily relating to our debt for equity exchange transaction for the year ended December 31, 2008.             Cash used in investing activities was $50.2 million and $110.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of the uses of cash relate to the following:       We paid $36.9 million to consummate the Buckeye acquisition in 2006.    54            NAME="page_dm75401_1_55">                                                 We purchased $74.6 million and $113.3 million of marketable securities and received $101.7 million and $85.6 million in proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.       We spent $49.4 million and $41.5 million primarily on our Fort Union plant and future plant sites for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.       We had capital expenditures related to other purchases of property and equipment of $4.1 million and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and $1.0 million for purchases of mineral rights and mine development for the year ended December 31, 2006.       In 2007, we were required to restrict cash and marketable securities to serve as collateral of $24.7 million, related to our $95 million long-term debt due 2012 and to collateralize other contractual obligations and our asset retirement obligations.       Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities               Cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2008 was $3.7 million, which relates to payments made related to the debt for equity exchange transactions. The principal differences for the year ended December 31, 2007 were due to $95.0 million of proceeds from issuance of convertible debt, offset by $5.8 million of debt issuance cost, $4.9 million from the exercise of options and warrants and $3.7 million of proceeds from minority interest investment in Evergreen Asia.            Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $96.1 million compared to $169.1 million for the same period ended 2006. The majority of the cash provided and used by financing activities relate to the following:       We received $95.0 million from the issuance of long-term debt and paid $5.8 million in debt issuance costs during the year ended December 31, 2007.       We received $144.6 million of cash from our public offering in February 2006.       We received $4.9 million and $24.6 million in proceeds from the exercises of stock options and warrants during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively      Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates             We have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our current and future business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies, see the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These policies and estimates are considered "critical" because they either had a material impact or they have the potential to have a material impact on our financial statements, and because they require significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. The preparation of our financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect both the results of operations as well as the carrying values of our assets and liabilities. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base estimates on historical experience and/or on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the near term. Set forth below is a summary of our most critical accounting policies.    55                   Revenue recognition.     We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, generally when an agreement has been signed, all significant obligations have been satisfied, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Any up-front fees received are deferred and recognized over the provision of specific deliverables as defined in the agreements. As our history related to non-coal sale customer relationships is limited, we may be required to change the estimated period over which we recognize our revenue as more information becomes available. Arrangements that include multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine whether the elements are separable based on objective evidence. If the elements are deemed separable, total consideration is allocated to each element and the revenue associated with each element is recognized as earned. If the elements are not deemed separable, total consideration is deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual period or the expected customer relationship period. We believe that the accounting estimates related to customer relationship periods and to the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable are "critical accounting estimates" because: (1) they require management to make assumptions about how long we will retain customers, for which we have limited history; (2) the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable can be subjective; and (3) the impact of changes in actual retention periods versus these estimates on the revenue amounts reported in our consolidated statements of operations could be material.             Accounts and notes receivable and allowances.     Receivables are recorded at their estimated net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the past-due status of receivables and assessments of risk regarding collectability. If the financial condition of the customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.             Capitalization of Costs.     We expense mine exploration costs as incurred. Once it has been determined that it is economically feasible to extract coal, we begin to capitalize these costs as premining costs. We have identified the commencement of permitting as the point to begin capitalizing premining costs. We also capitalize all purchases of machinery, equipment, software, engineering costs and similar expenditures, where the useful life of the asset is greater than one year or the expenditures extends the useful life of an existing asset. All costs that are directly related to, or allocable to, developing a K-Fuel plant site are capitalized and separately identified as belonging to that site. Judgment is exercised in determining (i) if costs extend the life of an asset; (ii) if costs increase production volumes; and (iii) the feasibility of extracting coal. If these judgments are incorrect, we may capitalize more costs than we otherwise should.            Mineral rights and mine development.     A significant portion of our coal reserves are controlled through leasing arrangements. Costs to obtain coal lands and leased mineral rights, including capitalized premining costs, are capitalized and depleted to operations using the units-of-production method based on tons produced utilizing only proven and probable reserves in the depletion base and are assumed to have no residual value. Premining costs include drilling, permitting, county and state filing fees and the initial overburden removal. We used assumptions such as selling price of coal, costs to mine and a discount rate to value our mines at Buckeye. If the assumptions used to value the proven and probable reserves change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.             Valuation of long-lived assets.     The valuation of our long-lived and intangible assets, including the remaining assets at our Fort Union plant, mineral rights, and patents, have significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We must assess the realizable value of these assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of these assets, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. We    56             must make assumptions regarding the useful lives of these assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.            Asset retirement obligations.     We are required to record the fair value of legally required removal costs and retirement obligations as a liability and we also recorded an offsetting asset. Initially, our asset retirement obligations were recorded at their fair value using an expected cash flow approach, in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflected the range of possible outcomes and a credit-adjusted risk-free rate were applied. The liability is then accreted over time by applying the interest method of allocation. In determining the initial liability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. In addition, the rate of accretion is based upon our best estimate of the rate at which cost to complete the reclamation will increase. If these estimates and their related assumptions are incorrect or change in the future, we may be required to increase our obligation.             Accounting for stock grants, options and warrants.     We issue stock grants, options and warrants to employees, board of directors and consultants in connection with our various business activities. In accounting for these awards we are required to make estimates of the fair value of the related instruments, the periods benefited and forfeiture rates. These estimates may affect such financial statement categories as stockholders' equity and general and administrative expense. If these estimates are incorrect, we may be required to incur additional expense in the future.            Accounting for derivative financial instruments.     Derivatives may be embedded in financial instruments (the "host instrument"). Embedded derivatives are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not clearly and closely related to those of the host instrument, the terms of the embedded derivative are similar to those of a stand-alone derivative and the combined contract is not held for trading or designated at fair value. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value and any subsequent changes are recognized in the statement of operations. We are required to make estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, estimating the future market price of our common stock and probability of a change in control. If these assumptions and estimates are incorrect, we may be required to incur additional expense in the future. If our expected volatility of our common stock decreased by 20%, the impact would have been an increase in other expenses of $15,000. If our expected volatility of our common stock increased by 20%, the impact would have been an increase in other income of $17,000.             Accounting for acquisitions.     The acquisition of businesses is an element of our strategy. We are required to record the net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect our financial statements. For example, the value and estimated life of assets may affect the amount of future period depletion and depreciation expense for the assets as well as possible impairment charges that may be incurred.             Marketable securities.     We classify our marketable securities as available for sale. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had available-for-sale investments in auction rate securities with a carrying value of $1.8 million and $29.5 million, respectively. The types of Auction Rate Securities investments that we own are backed by student loans and all had credit ratings of AAA or Aaa when purchased. The interest rates on these Auction Rate Securities are reset every 7 to 35 days by an auction process.            As a result of the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets, in February and March 2008, auctions for a certain ARS investment held by us failed. The recent uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us and other investors from liquidating the holdings of auction rate securities in recent auctions for these securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders.    57                   During the quarter ended March 31, 2008 we liquidated, at par, $22.5 million in student loan-  backed auction rate securities. As of December 31, 2008, our consolidated balance sheet reflects $1.8 million of such securities in other long-term assets. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we reduced the carrying amount of our student loan-backed auction rate security by an other than temporary impairment of $200,000. Our estimate of the fair value of such securities is based upon consideration of various factors including the overall credit market, the issuer and guarantor credit ratings, credit enhancement structures, projected yields, discount rates and terminal periods. If the issuer and guarantor are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may be required to adjust the carrying value of our investment in auction rate securities further. On February 17, 2009, we entered a Reverse Repurchase Transaction for our $1.8 million auction rate security, with our banking institution. Through the reverse repurchase transaction, we are able to borrow up 90% of the par value of the auction rate security with interest rate comparable to the interest earned on the auction rate security.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements             In November 2008, the FASB ratified EITF No. 08-8, "Accounting for an Instrument (or an Embedded Feature) with a Settlement Amount That Is Based on the Stock of an Entity's Consolidated Subsidiary," (EITF 08-8). EITF 08-8 clarifies whether a financial instrument for which the payoff to the counterparty is based, in whole or in part, on the stock of an entity's consolidated subsidiary is indexed to the reporting entity's own stock and therefore should not be precluded from qualifying for the first part of the scope exception in paragraph 11 (a) of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" or from being within the scope of EITF No. 00-19, "Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and, Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock." EITF 08-8 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on our financial statements.            In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-3,  Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active . FSP No. FAS 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 as it relates to the valuation of financial assets in a market that is not active for those financial assets. This FSP is effective immediately and includes those periods for which financial statements have not been issued. The adoption FAS 157-3 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.            In June 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on Issue 08-4, "Transition Guidance for Conforming Changes to Issue No. 98-5" (Issue 08-4). Because of Issue 00-27, "Application of Issue No. 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments," and SFAS 150,  Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity  , conforming changes were made to Issue 98-5, "Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios." Issue 08-4 provides transition guidance for those conforming changes and is effective for financial statements issued after January 1, 2009. The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.             In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, " The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles"  ("SFAS No. 162"). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. SFAS No. 162 becomes effective 60 days following the Securities Exchange Commission's approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, "The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles." We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 162 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.    58                   In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Standard Position (FSP) APB 14-1,  Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) . This FSP requires issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion to account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. Issuers will need to determine the carrying value of just the liability portion of the debt by measuring the fair value of a similar liability (including any embedded features other than the conversion option) that does not have an associated equity component. The excess of the initial proceeds received from the debt issuance and the fair value of the liability component should be recorded as a debt discount with the offset recorded to equity. The discount will be amortized to interest expense using the interest method over the life of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component. Transaction costs incurred with third parties shall be allocated between the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs, respectively, with the debt issuance costs amortized to interest expense. This FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is not permitted. This statement will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this pronouncement.            In March 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161 "Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" ("SFAS 161") which enhances the disclosure requirements about derivatives and hedging activities. SFAS 161 requires additional narrative disclosure about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how they are accounted for under FASB Statement No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"), and what impact they have on financial position, results of operations and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after November 15, 2008. Although the adoption of SFAS 161 did not materially impact our financial statements we are now required to provide additional disclosures as part of our financial statements.            In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141 (revised 2007),    Business Combinations , (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, including goodwill, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The Statement also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The impact of adopting SFAS 141R will be dependent on the future business combinations that we may pursue after its effective date.            In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160 "Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of ARB No. 51" ("SFAS 160"), which requires ownership interests in subsidiaries held by others to be clearly identified, labeled and presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity but separate from the parent company's equity. SFAS 160 also affects the accounting requirements when the parent company either purchases a higher ownership interest or deconsolidates the equity investment. SFAS No. 160 applies prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this Statement is initially applied, January 1, 2009 for entities that have a calendar year end, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements. The presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. An entity may not apply it before that date. We currently have a non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial    59             statements and do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material impact on our financial statements.            On February 15, 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," which gives companies the option to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value (i.e., the fair value option), on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards. The election to use the fair value option is available when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment. Subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We elected not to adopt the fair value option and as a result it did not have an impact on our financial statements.            In September 2006, the FASB issued statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. We have adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 as of January 1, 2008, for financial instruments. Although the adoption of SFAS 157 did not materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow, we are now required to provide additional disclosures as part of our financial statements.

We expect to consume 1.9 million to 2.1 million gallons of fuel per year. On a per gallon basis, based on this usage, a change in fuel prices of one cent per gallon would result in an increase in our operating costs of approximately $19,000 per year. Alternatively, a one dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs by approximately $45,000.             Ignoring embedded derivatives, we own (or hold) no derivative instruments or floating rate debt and do not expect to derive a material amount of our revenues from such interest bearing securities. Currently, we have no significant foreign operations. We hold no equity market securities, which are subject to equity market risk relative to our own equity securities.
