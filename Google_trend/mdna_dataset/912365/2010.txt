ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS                  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified by reference to, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto in Item 8 of this report and Selected Financial Data included in Item 6 of this report. Certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform of 1995. Refer to the "Cautionary Statement About Forward Looking Statements" preceding Item 1 of this report. Also, for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business and operations see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report.            We were founded in 1984 as a cleaner coal technology, energy production and environmental solutions company focused on developing our proprietary technologies. In the last two years, we have sharpened our focus as a carbon technology company. We have developed two proprietary, patented, and potentially transformative green technologies: the GreenCert suite of software and services and K-Fuel. Our GreenCert technology is a scientifically accurate and scalable environment intelligence solution that measures greenhouse gases (or GHG) and other environmental costs enabling customers to manage and report their environmental assets and liabilities. GreenCert, built on IBM's Service-Oriented Architecture (or SOA), is the environment intelligence solution that provides customers the end-to-end visibility and traceability necessary to measure their complete environmental footprint. K-Fuel, our clean coal technology significantly improves the performance of low-rank coals yielding higher efficiency and lower emissions.            We are continuing the development of our GreenCert suite of software and services. GreenCert is an accurate and scalable environmental intelligence solution that quantifies GHG emission avoidances and reductions and generates verifiable emissions offsets. GreenCert provides real-time, multiple method data analysis to increase accuracy and reduce uncertainty to quantify incremental improvements. GreenCert also enables enterprises to reduce overall costs via the identification of significant operational efficiencies, compliance and risk reduction and sustainability measures. We intend to sell GreenCert as an on-premise offering and as a hosted software as a service (SaaS) solution, both with annual licensing fees and renewal fees.            Over the past year, we have been evaluating several alternatives related to our strategic positioning, including the potential sale of Buckeye. As further described in Item 1Business, on March 12, 2010, we signed a definitive agreement with Rosebud Mining Company with respect to the sale of certain net assets of Buckeye for $27.9 million, in addition to the the release of $5.0 million of cash reclamation bonds. Further, $2.8 million of the purchase price will be deposited into escrow for a period of twelve months to cover amounts payable to Rosebud pursuant to the indemnification provision of the sales agreement. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and the completion of Rosebud's due diligence. The sale is expected to close in April 2010, but in any event no later than June 30, 2010. The proceeds from the sale of Buckeye will be used to retire the outstanding 2009 Notes including fees and accrued interest of $21.1 million, to fund related transaction expenses estimated at $2.5 million and for general working capital purposes. We recorded an impairment charge of $20.1 million to write down these assets to their fair market value.            With the sale of Buckeye we will be able to better focus our resources on core business activities, including the K-Fuel technology. We have terminated the contemplated spin-off of the K-Fuel technology as previously announced. Concurrently, Evergreen-China signed a letter of intent with a large Chinese integrated utility and chemical manufacturer to build a K-Fuel plant in Inner Mongolia to produce K-Fuel refined coal from low ranked lignite feedstock.            The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. We consolidate all of our majority-owned subsidiaries and reflect as    43             minority interest the portion of these entities that we do not own and recorded in other long-term liabilities. We do not consolidate our Chinese joint venture, Evergreen-China, but record the activity using the equity method of investment. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.            Our segments include the GreenCert segment, Plant segment, Mining segment and Technology segment. The GreenCert segment reflects activities related to the measurement of green house gases and certification of environmental improvements as carbon credits. The Plant segment primarily represents revenue and costs related to our Fort Union plant near Gillette, Wyoming, at which we suspended operations in March 2008. The Mining segment primarily represents our mining operations of our subsidiary, Buckeye, and includes certain marketing personnel, the ash disposal facility and the preparation and blending facility. The Technology segment is comprised of all other operations that use, apply, own or otherwise advance our proprietary patented K-Fuel process, including our headquarters and related operations, activities of Evergreen Energy Asia Pacific Corp. and KFx Technology, LLC, which holds the patents to our technology. Corporate costs within our Technology segment are allocated to our other segments, generally on a percentage based on the number of employees, total segment operating expenses, or segment operating expenses plus segment capital expenditures.       Significant Trends               For the last several years, our operations have been focused on developing our two technologies GreenCert and K-Fuel and the construction of the Fort Union plant. To date, we have not yet generated significant revenues from either of these technologies. Historically most of our costs are related to general and administrative expenses. With the addition of Buckeye, we have begun to generate revenue and incur more substantial mining costs. As previously discussed, we have entered into an agreement to sell certain of our mining segments assets and as a result, do not expect there to be any mining revenues and limited mining expenses after the completion of this sale. In the future, we plan to identify potential future strategic partners for GreenCert, in addition to IBM, EIM and Black and Veatch, to assist in the development, testing and roll-out of our products. Potential partners include companies offering services or products such as: energy engineering; consulting; power generation performance optimization; environmental consulting; and products relating to sensor systems and devices, data collection devices, or other products that support energy or power plant operations. Through our GreenCert software we plan to generate revenues through measurement of baseline emissions, assess and identify capital and operational improvements and site-specific, highly-customized solution that enables the quantification and monetization of the emissions reductions and efficiency improvements. We plan to license our K-Fuel technology, focusing on the Asia Pacific region of the world through Evergreen-China. The following discussion and analysis is focused on the events and trends that we believe have or will have in the future the most significant impact on our business.     Revenue Trends             In the future we expect to generate revenue from the following sources:       revenues from licensing our GreenCert technology;       revenues from renewal fees from our GreenCert technology;       revenues from the measurement of carbon credits using our GreenCert technology;       revenues from site specific efficiency improvements using our GreenCert technology;       revenues from pilot projects using our GreenCert technology;       revenues for supporting our GreenCert technology; and       coal sales from our Buckeye operations for the period during which we continue to own it;    44              revenues from K-Fuel licensing.      Expense Trends        GreenCert               As we develop and implement our GreenCert technology we will incur additional operational cost such as:       payroll and related burdens;       outsourced professional fees associated with the development of GreenCert software;       consulting costs for pilot deployment; and       professional fees related to the deployment of site-specific, highly-customized solution for the quantification and monetization of emissions.       General and Administrative Expenses               As we identify business development opportunities and generally expand our business, including hiring additional personnel at our corporate office, GreenCert locations and increasing outsourced professional services, we will incur additional expenses, the most significant of which are:       payroll and related burdens;       non-cash, share-based compensation;       sales and marketing costs for GreenCert technology;       rent and utilities; and       professional support fees.             We anticipate that accounting for non-cash, share-based compensation will add approximately $6.0 million to $10.0 million per year in the foreseeable future to our expenses. In the event we should achieve certain stock price targets, we would significantly accelerate recognition of these costs. Costs such as payroll and related burdens, professional support fees and utilities are variable costs that increase with size and adding locations. As we develop our GreenCert and K-Fuel technologies we expect these costs to increase in future periods.       Coal Mining OperatingEexpenses               We incur mine operating expenses including all costs associated with the mining of saleable coal and costs relating to our coal ash disposal facility as a result of Buckeye's operations. As previously discussed, we have entered into an agreement to sell certain mining segment assets and as a result, do not expect there to be any revenues and limited mining expenses after the completion of this sale.       Fort Union               In March 2008, we suspended operations at our Fort Union plant in order to redirect constrained resources, both capital and human, to focus on the commercialization of this process in future K-Fuel plants. Suspending production at Fort Union enabled us to reduce our cash expenditures. We will continue to incur various costs related to maintaining the site in a non-operational mode.    45            Results of Operations      Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2009 and 2008        Revenue               Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $50.7 million compared to $58.9 million for the same period ended December 31, 2008. With the sale of Buckeye, we anticipate our future mining revenues to decline.            Revenues in our Mining segment for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $50.2 million and $58.4 million for the same period ended December 31, 2008 respectively, as follows:       Coal revenue includes mined raw and prepared coal sales within our Buckeye operations. Buckeye coal sales, including transportation costs charged to customers, were $46.0 million and $50.7 million, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Coal sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 566,600 tons at $66.18 sales realization per ton sold net of transportation costs of $8.5 million compared to 727,200 tons at $58.03 sales realization per tons sold, net of transportation cost of $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our coal price per ton increased due to our increase in our pre-sold negotiated price per ton. However, revenues decreased due to the depressed economy and the unusually mild summer temperatures in the North East region of the United States, both of which have led to lower than previously forecasted coal prices and reduced coal consumption. However, sales realization for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased primarily due to higher coal prices realized during the first quarter of 2009 compared to the same period ended 2008.       Net brokered coal sales, include the revenues reduced by costs associated with the purchase of coal from other coal producers, which we ship directly to customers. We recognized $5,000 of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $437,000 of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008. We enter into brokered coal sales as opportunities arise or as needed to meet certain customers requests, and as a result, revenues in this area fluctuate.      Ash disposal revenues primarily include revenues generated from the disposal of coal combustion bi-products at our ash pit in Ohio. Ash disposal revenues were $4.2 million and $7.3 million for years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2009 was due to decreased disposal volume from one of our large customers.             K-Fuel refined coal revenue is comprised of sales of our K-Fuel product to third parties. Blended K-Fuel refined coal revenue represents the proportionate revenue related to K-Fuel that has been blended with other raw or prepared coal from our Buckeye operations and sold to third parties. The remaining revenue related to the raw or prepared coal is reflected in Mining revenues. K-Fuel refined coal and blended K-Fuel refined coal sales were $0 and $463,000 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively and are included in our Plant segment.       Coal Mining Operating Expenses               Our coal mining operating expenses include all costs associated with the mining of saleable coal and costs relating to our coal ash disposal facility at Buckeye, which principally comprises our Mining segment.       Coal mining operating expenses               Coal mining operating expenses include employee-related costs, outside contracted mining costs for our underground mines, internal and external coal transportation costs, blasting, drilling, heavy equipment costs, purchased coal and other mining-related costs. Coal mining operating expenses were    46           $40.0 million and $42.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Coal mining operating expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. However, costs per ton increased during this same period due to more than expected ash and rock content thus increasing transportation costs and preparation/separation costs.       Ash disposal               Ash disposal expenses include employee-related costs, consulting costs, costs of repairs and maintaining culverts and drainage ponds, transportation, and heavy equipment costs and other costs associated with the ash disposal facility. Ash disposal expenses were $3.5 million and $5.4 million for the periods ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2009 is in correlation with the decrease in revenue for the same period.       General and Administrative               Corporate costs within our Technology segment are allocated to our other segments, generally on a percentage based on the number of employees, total segment operating expenses or segment operating expenses plus segment capital expenditures. As a result of idling our Fort Union plant, these allocated costs have significantly decreased in our Plant segment and increased in other segments most notably in our Technology and GreenCert segments, for the year ended 2009 when compared to 2008.             The following table summarizes our general and administrative costs for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.                                     Year Ended December 31,              2009      2008              (in thousands)         Employee-related costs     $  11,303     $  12,559         Non-cash, share-based compensation        4,786        5,956         Professional fees        5,788        3,908         Office and travel costs        4,084        3,830         Insurance and other        3,121        5,712                                Total general and administrative     $  29,082     $  31,965                                         Non-cash, share-based compensation expenses were $4.8 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, most of which related to our Technology segment. The decrease for the year ended 2009 was primarily due to the reduction of our workforce and the related forfeiture of the grants. We also recognized a one-time decrease due to the retirement of a former officer and the impact of his retirement on his restricted stock grant. Since the restricted shares never vested and were forfeited upon retirement, the cumulative non-cash compensation expense recorded since 2005 was reversed. This reversal of non-cash compensation totaled $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decreases were partially offset by a transition agreement we entered into with another former officer. Pursuant to that agreement, we accelerated the restricted stock grant and recorded $3.3 million of non-cash compensation for the year ended December 31, 2009.            Employee-related costs primarily include salaries and wages, temporary employees, bonuses, benefits, employer payroll taxes and education and training. The following table summarizes our    47           employee-related costs related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.                                     Year Ended December 31,              2009      2008              (in thousands)         GreenCert     $  4,601     $  2,638         Technology        3,361        5,585         Mining        2,822        2,502         Plant        519        1,834                                Total Employee-related     $  11,303     $  12,559                                         The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2009 in comparison to the same period in 2008 was primarily due to our cost cutting measures which resulted in lower employee count in our Technology and Plant segments. This decrease was offset by the addition of personnel to our GreenCert segment and severance expense for two former executive officers in the amount of $525,000 in our Technology segment.             Professional fees include legal, audit and accounting, public relations, governmental relations and similar costs. The following table summarizes our professional fees related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.                                     Year Ended December 31,              2009      2008              (in thousands)         GreenCert     $  972     $  830         Technology        3,842        2,340         Mining        923        375         Plant        51        363                                Total Professional fees     $  5,788     $  3,908                                         The increase for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared the year ended 2008 was due to legal fees related to certain financing transactions that were not consummated, fees related to the marketing of Buckeye and international work, all related to our Technology segment, and filing patent applications for our GreenCert technology in our GreenCert segment.            Office and travel costs include airfare, lodging, meals, office rent, marketing, office supplies, phone, publications, subscriptions and utilities. The following table summarizes our office and travel costs related to each of our segments for years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.                                     Year Ended December 31,              2009      2008              (in thousands)         GreenCert     $  1,794     $  881         Technology        1,997        2,255         Mining        192        245         Plant        101        449                                Total Office and travel     $  4,084     $  3,830                                 48                     The increase in office and travel for the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily due to a non-recurring charge of $1.0 million due to consolidating our employees into a smaller section of our office space to enable us to potentially sublease the remaining office space at our corporate location. The majority of this non-recurring charge was allocated to our GreenCert segment based on the number of employees, total segment operating expenses or segment operating expenses plus segment capital expenditures.            Insurance and other costs primarily include costs related to our property and commercial liability, other insurance and all costs that cannot be categorized elsewhere and include, among other costs, various business and franchise taxes, licensing fees, repair and maintenance, engineering and technical services and director expenses. The following table summarizes our insurance and other costs related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.                                     Year Ended December 31,              2009      2008              (in thousands)         GreenCert     $       $  821         Technology        2,449        3,740         Mining        645        742         Plant        27        409                                Total Insurance and other     $  3,121     $  5,712                                         Costs decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009 mainly due to the idling of our Ft. Union plant in 2008 and the resulting decrease in Engineering and Technical services expense in our Technology segment.       Plant costs               Subsequent to the idling of the Fort Union plant, costs primarily consist of salaries and wages, security, utilities and repair and maintenance. Previously, plant costs included purchased raw materials, coal transportation, outsourced engineering and technical support, fluid processing, by-products and water disposal, and employee-related costs, which are reflected in our Plant segment. Plant costs decreased during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to the idling of our Fort Union plant in late March 2008. Overall, while we anticipate costs to somewhat decline in 2010, we will continue to incur various costs related to maintaining the site in a non-operating mode.       Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization               Depreciation, depletion and amortization are principally comprised of: (i) depletion, based on actual tons mined at our mine sites in Ohio; (ii) amortization related to our patents; and (iii) depreciation on other fixed assets using the straight-line method. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses were $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $9.0 million during the same period ended 2008.       Research and Development               Research and development costs include costs incurred to advance, test, or otherwise modify our proprietary K-Fuel technology or develop new technologies and primarily include costs incurred to operate and maintain our laboratory facilities and professional engineering fees related to off-site testing of our K-Fuel refined coal. Research and development costs were $49,000 and $79,000 for the years ended 2009 and 2008, respectively. As a result of cost cutting measures, we decreased the number of employees and the corresponding salary and wages at our lab at Fort Union.    49        NAME="page_ds48201_1_50">                                              Asset Impairment Charges               Asset impairment charges were $20.5 million and $18.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of the impairment charge in 2009 relates to the write-down of our Buckeye assets. Other asset impairment charges for year ended December 31, 2009 relate to the impairment of our leasehold improvements of the vacated office space that we are attempting to sublease and is reflected in our Technology segment. Asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2008 relate to further impairment of our boiler island which was classified as assets held for sale. See Note2 Property Plant and Equipment in Item 8 of this report for further details.       Other Income Expense      Interest income               Interest income was $65,000 and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was principally attributable to a lower cash balance in 2009.       Interest expense               Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was $7.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively. The interest expense relates to the 2007 Notes and 2009 Notes more fully described in Note 7Debt.       Other income (expense)               During the year ended December 31, 2009, other income was $2.8 million as compared to $300,000 of other expense for the same period ended 2008. The increase in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily relates to the fair value adjustments of our embedded derivatives in the amount of $2.1 million.       Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007       Revenue               Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $58.9 million compared to $48.7 million for the same period ended December 31, 2007.            Revenues in our Mining segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $58.4 million and $47.4 million for the same period ended December 31, 2007 respectively, as follows:       Buckeye coal sales, including transportation costs charged to customers, were $50.7 million and $39.4 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Coal sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were 727,197 tons at $69.72 sales realization per ton sold compared to 728,059 tons at $54.12 sales realization per tons sold for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the sales realization per ton sold for the year ended December 31, 2008 was due to higher coal prices when compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Our production tons for the year ended December 31, 2008, were less than anticipated due to power outages and other weather issues related to Hurricane Ike. In addition, we experienced unexpected adverse roof conditions resulting from clay vein slip areas in a section of one of our underground mining veins. We have resolved the roof conditions by using longer and more bolts in each of the main entries and narrowing the belt entry. We were also required to obtain the Mine Safety and Health Administrations approval of the revised roof control and ventilation plans, which took longer than anticipated.       We recognized $437,000 of brokered coal sales net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $514,000 of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007. We enter into    50              brokered coal sales as opportunities arise or as needed to meet certain customers requests, and as a result, revenues in this area fluctuate.        Ash disposal revenues were $7.3 million and $7.4 million for years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.             K-Fuel refined coal revenue is comprised of sales of our K-Fuel product to third parties. Blended K-Fuel refined coal revenue represents the proportionate revenue related to K-Fuel that has been blended with other raw or prepared coal from our Buckeye operations and sold to third parties. The remaining revenue related to the raw or prepared coal is reflected in Mining revenues. K-Fuel refined coal and blended K-Fuel refined coal sales were $463,000 and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively and are included in our Plant segment.       Coal Mining Operating Expenses       Coal mining operating expenses               Coal mining operating expenses were $42.4 million and $38.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in cost per ton in comparing the year ended December 31, 2008 to 2007 is primarily due to the increased price of fuel used to mine and transport coal.        Ash disposal               Ash disposal expenses were $5.4 million and $4.8 million for the periods ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.       General and Administrative               Corporate costs within our Technology segment are allocated to our other segments, generally on a percentage based on the number of employees, total segment operating expenses or segment operating expenses plus segment capital expenditures. As a result of idling our Fort Union plant, these allocated costs have significantly decreased in our Plant segment and increased in other segments most notable in our Technology segment, for the year ended 2008 when compared to 2007.            The following table summarizes our general and administrative costs for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.                                     Year Ended December 31,              2008      2007              (in thousands)         Employee-related costs     $  12,559     $  11,721         Employee non-cash, share-based compensation        5,956        19,015         Insurance and other        5,712        4,645         Professional fees        3,908        4,152         Office and travel costs        3,830        3,498                                Total general and administrative     $  31,965     $  43,031                                         Employee non-cash, share-based compensation expenses were $6.0 million and $19.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, substantially all of which related to our Technology segment. The decrease related to the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007 was due to the termination of two former executive officers and one-time charges of $10.5 million related to the accelerated vesting of a portion of their restricted stock grants.    51                    The following table summarizes our employee-related costs related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.                                     Year Ended December 31,              2008      2007              (in thousands)         GreenCert     $  2,638     $  536         Technology        5,585        4,617         Mining        2,502        2,593         Plant        1,834        3,975                                Total Employee-related     $  12,559     $  11,721                                         Employee-related costs were $12.6 million and $11.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increases for the year ended December 31, 2008 in comparison to the same period in 2007, were primarily due to adding personnel to our GreenCert segment, as well as adding engineering and other personnel in our Technology segment, recruiting fees, an overall increase in health insurance costs and changes in the allocation of corporate costs to various segments.             The following table summarizes our professional fees related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.                                     Year Ended December 31,              2008      2007              (in thousands)         GreenCert     $  830     $  410         Technology        2,340        2,929         Mining        375        335         Plant        363        478                                Total Professional fees     $  3,908     $  4,152                                         The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007, was due to less outsourced engineering work as a result of increasing our corporate engineering staff in our Technology segment. Offsetting these savings were increased professional fees in our GreenCert segment associated with patent-related costs.             The following table summarizes our office and travel costs related to each of our segments for years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.                                     Year Ended December 31,              2008      2007              (in thousands)         Technology     $  2,255     $  2,061         GreenCert        881        336         Plant        449        867         Mining        245        234                                Total Office and travel     $  3,830     $  3,498                                         The increases in office and travel costs for the year ended December 31, 2008, were primarily for international and domestic travel related to our business development efforts in both our Technology and GreenCert segments.    52                   The following table summarizes our insurance and other costs related to each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.                                     Year Ended December 31,              2008      2007              (in thousands)         GreenCert     $  821     $  593         Technology        3,740        2,776         Plant        409        511         Mining        742        765                                Total Insurance and other     $  5,712     $  4,645                                    Plant costs               Plant costs decreased during the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to the idling of our Fort Union plant in March 2008. Overall, while we anticipate costs to decline in 2009, we will continue to incur various costs related to maintaining the site in a non-operating mode.       Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization               Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses were $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $8.4 million during the same period ended 2007.       Research and Development               Research and development costs were $79,000 and $876,000 for the years ended 2008 and 2007, respectively. As a result of cost cutting measures, we decreased the number of employees and the corresponding salary and wages in our lab at our Fort Union facility.       Asset Impairment Charges               Asset impairment charges were $18.6 million and $122.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2008, relate to further impairment of our boiler island which was classified as assets held for sale. See Note2 Property Plant and Equipment in Item 8 of this report for further details. Impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2007 are as follows:       we suspended operations at our Fort Union plant to allow us to focus on future K-Fuel and K-Direct plants by redirecting constrained resources, both capital and human, to focus on the commercialization of our process. We incurred impairment charges in our Plant segment totaling $109.5 million;       we are required to evaluate the fair value of our boiler, which is classified as held for sale. As result, of this fair value calculation we impaired the carrying value of our boiler by $7.8 million in our Technology segment;       we impaired $3.6 million of capitalized costs related to projects that we abandoned and/or replaced with more cost effective projects in our Plant segment; and       we impaired capital costs of $2.1 million related to a previously announced future potential project with a major utility because it was determined not to be economically feasible in our Technology segment.    53               Other Income Expense      Interest income               Interest income was $1.3 million and $4.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was principally attributable to a lower cash balance as well as reduced interest rates during 2008.       Interest expense               Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 was $6.1 million and $3.4 million, respectively. Interest expense relates to the $95.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8.00% Convertible Secured Notes due 2012, which we completed in July 2007. The increase in interest expense is in direct relation to the time and amount of the 2007 Notes outstanding in 2008 compared to 2007.       Gain on debt for equity exchange transactions               During the year ended December 31, 2008, we entered into multiple individually negotiated agreements with certain existing noteholders to exchange $67.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 8.00% Convertible Secured Notes due 2012, for an aggregate of 48.6 million shares of our common stock. We recognized a $6.1 million gain, which was reduced by transaction costs, non-cash reversal of debt issue costs and non-cash adjustment related to the embedded derivatives.       Other income (expense)               During the year ended December 31, 2008, other expense was $300,000 as compared to $1.4 million of other expense for the same period ended 2007. We estimated the fair value of the embedded derivatives as of July 30, 2007, when the 2007 Notes were issued, and recorded those values as either assets or liabilities. In addition, we are required to evaluate the fair value of the embedded derivatives at the end of each subsequent reporting period. We recognized a decrease in the fair value of the derivatives of $934,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008. This fair value adjustment is a non-cash item and each quarter's estimation exercise is impacted, in part, by our stock price. For additional information, see Note 7Debt included in Item 8 of this report. In addition we recognized a $744,000 gain for insurance reimbursements for cost incurred to repair certain equipment at our Fort Union plant for the year ended December 31, 2008.      2010 Liquidity and Capital Resources Discussion             We have reduced our cash flow used in operations by $23.4 million when comparing the year ended December 31, 2009 to the same period in 2008. We accomplished these savings principally by suspending operations at our Fort Union plant, reducing corporate professional fees, and other general and administrative cost reductions. These cost reductions were offset by the expansion of our GreenCert operations, including the addition of personnel and other administrative costs associated with developing the business. In addition, we have invested $12.3 million in capital expenditures, primarily related to Buckeye, GreenCert's software development and K-Fuel process development during the year ended December 31, 2009.            Over the past year, we have been evaluating several alternatives related to our strategic positioning, including the potential sale of Buckeye. As previously discussed, on March 12, 2010, we signed a definitive agreement with Rosebud Mining Company with respect to the sale of Buckeye for $27.9 million, in addition to the release of $5.0 million of cash reclamation bonds. The sale is expected to close in April 2010, but in any event no later than June 30, 2010. The proceeds from the sale of Buckeye will be used to retire the outstanding 2009 Notes including fees and accrued interest of    54             $21.1 million, to fund related transaction expenses estimated at $2.5 million and for general working capital purposes.            Actual 2009 cash flows from Buckeye's operations have been less than previously anticipated due in part to the depressed economy and the unusually mild summer temperatures in the North East region of the United States, both of which have led to lower than previously forecasted coal prices and reduced coal consumption. Because of these lower than expected results, combined with the on-going costs associated with GreenCert, we were required to raise additional capital in October 2009, January 2010 and March 2010, as discussed in more detail below. However, we continue to require additional capital to fully fund the anticapted development of our GreenCert technology and expect to investigate sources of additional capital. Because of the immediate need for additional capital to fund operations and the costs to develop GreenCert, there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue to operate as a going concern for the foreseeable future.            On March 16, 2010, we and certain institutional investors entered into a securities purchase agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to sell an aggregate of 9,312.5 shares of our preferred stock and warrants to purchase 12,500,000 shares of our common stock to such investors for gross proceeds of approximately $9.3 million. Subject to certain ownership limitations, the warrants are immediately exercisable for a five year period after closing at an exercise price of $.31 per share. The exercise price of the warrants is subject to adjustment in the case of stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares and similar recapitalization transactions. Our net proceeds from the registered direct public offering excluding certain transaction costs and the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the warrants issued in the offering, were approximately $5.0 million.            On January 26, 2010, we completed a registered direct public offering and raised gross proceeds of approximately $8.7 million. The securities were offered pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was previously declared effective by the SEC on January 19, 2010. In total, we sold an aggregate of 29,236,664 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 14,618,331 shares of our common stock. The common stock and warrants were sold in units, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase 0.50 of a share of common stock. The purchase price per unit is $.30. Subject to certain ownership limitations, the warrants are exercisable commencing six months following the closing date of the offering and for a five year period thereafter at an exercise price of $0.3859. The exercise price of the warrants is subject to adjustment in the case of stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares and similar recapitalization transactions. The net proceeds to us from the registered direct public offering, after deducting placement agent fees and our estimated offering expenses, and excluding the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the warrants issued in the offering, were approximately $8.0 million.            On October 21, 2009 we entered into the sale of shares of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock ("Preferred Stock") pursuant to a private placement offering to institutional investors, representing gross proceeds to us of $7.0 million, with net proceeds of $5.0 million, prior to transactions costs. Evergreen plans to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.            In March 2009, we executed a Senior Secured Convertible Note Agreement which provides for the issuance of up to $15 million in aggregate principal amount of 10% Senior Secured Promissory Notes (the "2009 Notes") in three $5 million tranches. All three of these tranches were funded during 2009. On December 18, 2009, we executed a binding term sheet and then on January 12, 2009 we executed an agreement to extend the maturity of these 2009 Notes to the earlier of June 30, 2010 or the sale of Buckeye. See further discussion in Note 7Debt.            We have a history of losses, deficits and negative operating cash flows and may continue to incur losses in the future. As stated above, we have dramatically reduced our cash flow used in operations. Continued market disruptions associated with the economic downturn, may lead to lower demand for our technology or products, increased incidence of customers' inability to pay their accounts, or    55             insolvency of our customers, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, and financial condition. We continue to evaluate our cash position and cash utilization and may make additional adjustments to capital or certain operating expenditures.            As stated above, we continue to require additional capital to fully fund the development of our GreenCert technology and expect to investigate sources of additional capital. Further, as we complete our strategic positioning or as opportunities arise to accelerate the expansion of our GreenCert and K-Fuel technologies, or our anticipated operating cash flows are less than expected due to among other things, a protracted global economic downturn, we may need to obtain further funding. We believe we have the ability to raise additional capital from time to time as needed principally through: (i) equity offerings; (ii) debt or debt offerings; and (iii) partnering with third parties. While we believe we will obtain additional capital through one or more of the alternatives described, we can provide no assurance that any of the alternatives will be available or be on acceptable terms.      Payment Obligations             The following table summarizes our future commitments as of December 31, 2009:                                                    Payments due by period              2010      2011      2012      2013      2014      Thereafter      Total              (in thousands)         Operating leases     $  1,942     $  1,353     $  1,334     $  1,187     $  1,199     $  22,738     $  29,753         Short-term debt and purchase commitments        21,100                                                21,100         Consulting and service commitments        500        500        500        500        500        10,000        12,500         Long-term debt        2,190        2,190        28,470                                32,850                                                              Total commitments     $  25,732     $  4,043     $  30,304     $  1,687     $  1,699     $  32,738     $  96,203                                                                       This table does not include accounts payable, accrued liabilities, or asset retirement obligations, which are reported in our December 31, 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet. We generally have not included any obligation in which either party has the right to terminate except as discussed below. Additionally, we have not included K-Fuel royalty payments, as we cannot presently determine when such payments will be made as such payments are based upon our receipt of cash for licensing and royalties.             We are obligated under non-cancelable operating leases with initial terms exceeding one year relating to office space. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $1.2 million, $1.1 million, and $784,000, respectively. Additionally, included in operating leases is the rent obligation associated with our former headquarters totaling $105,000, which we have sub-leased but are not released from the obligation. Furthermore, included in operating leases is a 46-year port dock lease on the Ohio River, which we have the right to cancel upon six months written notice. If this lease were cancelled as of December 31, 2009, we would be obligated to pay $250,000 rather than the entire obligation of $23.0 million. This dock lease and the related obligation are included as assets to be sold pursuant to the anticipated sale of Buckeye.             Consulting and service commitments include an Exclusive Patent Sub-License Agreement with the developer of a proprietary technology for the measurement of carbon emissions. The agreement provides us with an exclusive worldwide sub-license to a technology to standardize the measurement of carbon emissions in energy and agricultural related activities. The Agreement was amended and restated to expand the energy and agricultural activities to all applications of the technology and eliminates other operating requirements. In order to maintain this licensing arrangement, we are required to make minimum annual royalty payments of $500,000 to the developer of the proprietary technology, with each payment extending the arrangement for one year if the parties are in material compliance with the contract. Additionally, consulting and service commitments includes our amended    56             and restated umbrella agreement with Bechtel. Through this new program management agreement we committed to provide Bechtel with $1 billion in construction contracts through 2013. Failure to meet this commitment by 2014 could cost us up to the $10 million in termination fees, which is included in the above table.            Long-term debt includes our principal amount due 2012 and the 8% interest payments.             Short-term debt includes our principal amount, exit fees and accrued interest due upon the earlier of the sale of Buckeye or June 30, 2010. Interest is accrued at 10% of the principal amount.            While our former investment banking firm may claim that we owe them up to $1.0 million upon the sale of Buckeye, and, while the previous potential buyer may claim that we owe them up to an additional $650,000 if we do not sell Buckeye to them, we do not believe that these fees are payable due to the lack of the counterparties meeting certain performance and contractual criteria in addition to certain verbal understandings reached related thereto. If claims are made for these contingent payments, we intend to vigorously dispute these claims. These potential obligations are not included in the table above.     Historical View        Cash Used in Operating Activities               Cash used in operating activities was $12.9 million, $36.3 million, and $51.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 relates to cash utilized in our on-going operations, as adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The most significant adjustments to net loss to arrive at cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 were an impairment charge of $20.1 million related to our Buckeye mining operations, non-cash, share-based compensation expenses of $5.3 million, debt issue cost amortization of $2.6 million, a non-recurring charge of $1.0 million from our attempt to sublease unused office space, and depreciation, depletion and amortization of $10.0 million.            The majority of the cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 relates to cash utilized in our on-going operations, as adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The most significant adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $18.6 million and $122.7 million impairment charges. Other significant adjustments to net loss to arrive at cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were: non-cash share-based compensation expense of $6.3 million and $19.6 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and depreciation, depletion and amortization of $9.0 million and $8.4 million, respectively, and gain on debt for equity exchange transactions of $6.1 million in 2008.       Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities               Cash used in investing activities was $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The majority of the sources and uses of cash relate to the following:       We spent $12.3 million on capital equipment primarily with our Buckeye operations, GreenCert development and future plant design.       We liquidated our auction rate marketable securities and received $2.0 million in proceeds.    57            NAME="page_du48201_1_58">                                                      Cash provided by investing activities was $20.6 million and cash used in investing activities was $50.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the sources and uses of cash relate to the following:       We spent $16.8 million on our capital equipment, future plant design and construction in progress for the year ended December 31, 2008. We spent $49.4 million primarily on our Fort Union plant and future plant sites for the year ended December 31, 2007. We had capital expenditures related to other purchases of property and equipment of $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.       We purchased $5.0 million and $74.6 million of marketable securities and received $27.5 million and $101.7 million in proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.       In 2007, we were required to restrict cash and marketable securities to serve as collateral of $24.7 million, related to our 2007 Notes and to collateralize other contractual obligations and our asset retirement obligations. We received $15.0 million of restricted cash net, primarily relating to our debt for equity exchange transaction related to the 2007 Notes for the year ended December 31, 2008.     Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities               Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2009 was $17.1 million compared to cash used in financing activities of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The difference for the year ended December 31, 2009 was principally due to $15.0 million of proceeds from our 2009 Notes, $6.5 million of proceeds, net of closing costs, from our issuance of convertible preferred stock and the payment of $2.0 million in dividends from the subsequent preferred stock conversion, and payments of debt issuance costs of $2.4 million.            Cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2008 relates to payments made related to the debt for equity exchange transactions. The principal differences for the year ended December 31, 2007 were due to $95.0 million of proceeds from issuance of convertible debt, offset by $5.8 million of debt issuance cost, $4.9 million from the exercise of options and warrants and $3.7 million of proceeds from minority interest investment in Evergreen-China.     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates             We have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our current and future business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies see the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These policies and estimates are considered "critical" because they either had a material impact or they have the potential to have a material impact on our financial statements, and because they require significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. The preparation of our financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect both the results of operations as well as the carrying values of our assets and liabilities. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base estimates on historical experience and/or on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the near term. Set forth below is a summary of our most critical accounting policies.    58                    Revenue Recognition.     We expect to derive GreenCert and K-Fuel revenue from licensing arrangements that include licenses, technical support, and professional services.            For each arrangement, we recognize revenue when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists (e.g., a signed contract); (ii) delivery of the product has occurred and there are no remaining obligations or substantive customer acceptance provisions and all obligations are satisfied; (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection of the fee is reasonably assured. Any up-front fees received are deferred and recognized over the provision of specific deliverables as defined in the agreements. As our history related to non-coal sale customer relationships is limited, we may be required to change the estimated period over which we recognize our revenue as more information becomes available. Arrangements that include multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine whether the elements are separable based on objective evidence. If the elements are deemed separable, total consideration is allocated to each element and the revenue associated with each element is recognized as earned. If the elements are not deemed separable, total consideration is deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual period or the expected customer relationship period. We believe that the accounting estimates related to customer relationship periods and to the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable are "critical accounting estimates" because: (i) they require management to make assumptions about how long we will retain customers, for which we have limited history; (ii) the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable can be subjective; and (iii) the impact of changes in actual retention periods versus these estimates on the revenue amounts reported in our consolidated statements of operations could be material.             Accounts and Notes Receivable and Allowances.     Receivables are recorded at their estimated net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the past-due status of receivables and assessments of risk regarding collectability. If the financial condition of the customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.             Capitalization of Costs.     We expense mine exploration costs as incurred. Once it has been determined that it is economically feasible to extract coal, we begin to capitalize these costs as premining costs. We have identified the commencement of permitting as the point to begin capitalizing premining costs. We also capitalize all purchases of machinery, equipment, software, engineering costs and similar expenditures, where the useful life of the asset is greater than one year or the expenditures extends the useful life of an existing asset. All costs that are directly related to, or allocable to, developing a K-Fuel plant site are capitalized and separately identified as belonging to that site. Judgment is exercised in determining: (i) if costs extend the life of an asset; (ii) if costs increase production volumes; and (iii) the feasibility of extracting coal. If these judgments are incorrect, we may capitalize more costs than we otherwise should.             Mineral Rights and Mine Development.     A significant portion of our coal reserves are controlled through leasing arrangements. Costs to obtain coal lands and leased mineral rights, including capitalized premining costs, are capitalized and depleted to operations using the units-of-production method based on tons produced utilizing only proven and probable reserves in the depletion base and are assumed to have no residual value. Premining costs include drilling, permitting, county and state filing fees and the initial overburden removal. We used assumptions such as selling price of coal, cost to mine and a discount rate to value our mines at Buckeye. If the assumptions used to value the proven and probable reserves change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.             Valuation of Long-Lived Assets.     The valuation of our long-lived and intangible assets, including the remaining assets at our Fort Union plant, mineral rights, and patents, have significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We must assess the realizable value of these assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may    59             not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of these assets, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. We must make assumptions regarding the useful lives of these assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.            Asset Retirement Obligations.     We are required to record the fair value of legally required removal costs and retirement obligations as a liability and we also recorded an offsetting asset. Initially, our asset retirement obligations were recorded at their fair value using an expected cash flow approach, in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflected the range of possible outcomes and a credit-adjusted risk-free rate were applied. The liability is then accreted over time by applying the interest method of allocation. In determining the initial liability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. In addition, the rate of accretion is based upon our best estimate of the rate at which cost to complete the reclamation will increase. If these estimates and their related assumptions are incorrect or change in the future, we may be required to increase our obligation.             Accounting for stock grants, options and warrants.     We issue stock grants, options and warrants to employees, board of directors and consultants in connection with our various business activities. In accounting for these awards we are required to make estimates of the fair value of the related instruments, the periods benefited and forfeiture rates. These estimates may affect such financial statement categories as stockholders' equity and general and administrative expense. If these estimates are incorrect, we may be required to incur additional expense in the future.            Accounting for derivative financial instruments.     Derivatives may be embedded in financial instruments (the "host instrument"). Embedded derivatives are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not clearly and closely related to those of the host instrument. The terms of the embedded derivative are similar to those of a stand-alone derivative and the combined contract is not held for trading or designated at fair value. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value and any subsequent changes are recognized in the statement of operations. We are required to make estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, estimating the future market price of our common stock and probability of a change in control. If these assumptions and estimates are incorrect, we may be required to incur additional expense in the future.             Accounting for Acquisitions.     The acquisition of businesses is an element of our strategy. We are required to record the net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect our financial statements. For example, the value and estimated life of assets may affect the amount of future period depletion and depreciation expense for the assets as well as possible impairment charges that may be incurred.             Marketable Securities.     As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, our balance sheet reflects $0 and $1.8 million of marketable securities, which are auction rate securities, respectively. These auction rate securities consisted of student-loan backed securities. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we reduced the carrying amount of our student loan-backed auction rate security by $200,000, which is reflected in general and administrative expense. In February 2009, we entered a reverse repurchase transaction for $1.8 million of our auction rate security which had a $2.0 million par value. In March 2009, we liquidated the auction rate security at $2.0 million, resulting in a gain of $200,000, which has been recorded in Other Income for the year ended December 31, 2009.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements             Refer to Note 1 Recent Accounting Pronouncements  of the accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.    60             NAME="du48201_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02669">         ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK                 In addition to risks inherent in operations, we are exposed to the following market risks in our business:             Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to commodity price risk. Through our Buckeye subsidiary, we generally consume 1.9 million to 2.1 million gallons of fuel per year. On a per gallon basis based on this usage, a change in fuel prices of one cent per gallon would result in an increase to our operating costs of approximately $19,000 per year. Alternatively, a one dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs by approximately $45,000.            Ignoring embedded derivatives, we own (or hold) no derivative instruments or floating rate debt and do not expect to derive a material amount of our revenues from such interest bearing securities. Currently, we have no significant foreign operations. We hold no equity market securities, which are subject to equity market risk relative to our own equity securities.
