The Company does not undertake to update, revise or correct any of the forward-looking statements.                                           35    39    OVERVIEW       Through the acquisition of 60% of Pegasus in early 1998, KFx significantly broadened its technology solutions, by adding NeuSIGHT, Pegasus' artificial intelligence based combustion optimization software, to K-Fuel Technology, its patented clean coal technology, in order to better meet the evolving needs of the electric power industry that are being stimulated by domestic industry deregulation and increasingly stringent air quality standards worldwide. In the fourth quarter of 1998 Pegasus began hiring a software marketing team. During August 1999, KFx increased its ownership of Pegasus to 75% and in early March 2000, KFx sold 4% of its interest in Pegasus to Kennecott Energy for $1 million, KFx converted $3.6 million of debt Pegasus owed it to preferred stock and Pegasus secured a $500,000 preferred stock investment in Pegasus from Kennecott Energy. At April 14, 2000, the ownership of Pegasus is approximately as follows: KFx--74%, Pegasus management--20% and Kennecott Energy--6%. It is expected that Kennecott Energy will make additional investments totaling $3.5 million for an additional 14% interest in Pegasus as certain product development and other milestones are met, through 2004 or earlier.       In connection with Kennecott Energy's Pegasus investment, Pegasus and Kennecott formed Net Power Solutions, an entity that is intended to offer total energy solutions to the electric utility industry on a worldwide basis. Net Power Solutions has the non-exclusive right to market the products of KFx, Pegasus, and Kennecott Energy in combination in order to optimize the available synergies and value added opportunities.           Although Pegasus generated 1999 revenues of $1.5 million, representing an increase over the 1998 level of approximately 16%, 1999 order and revenue growth was significantly hampered by two May 1999 federal appeals court decisions that effectively suspended two NOx reduction programs initiated by the EPA. The two programs affected were the 8-hour national ambient air quality standard for ozone ("8 Hour Ozone Standard"), of which NOx is a primary component, and a requirement for 22 eastern and midwestern states and the District of Columbia to submit implementation plans in the fall of 1999 to achieve a reduction in NOx emissions of approximately 85% beginning in 2003 ("SIP Call"). Although the ultimate governing requirements of the CAA continue to be in place, these court actions created confusion as to the manner of achieving compliance with the CAA. As a result of these developments, during the latter half of 1999, utilities tended to delay or abandon certain previously planned activities designed to achieve compliance with the relevant sections of the CAA, which activities the Company believes included purchase and installation of Pegasus products. On March 3, 2000 most of the EPA's initiative related to the SIP Call was affirmed by a federal appeals court action, which, although subject to appeal, is expected to accelerate demand for Pegasus products and services. At March 31, 2000, Pegasus' order backlog was $2,485,000, which is expected to be recognized as revenue during the next 12-18 months.           In early 2000, after completion of an analysis of issues impacting the growth and success of Pegasus, the Company decided to move the Denver, Colorado headquarters activities of Pegasus, which included marketing and sales administration, general accounting and financial reporting, to the Pegasus Cleveland, Ohio area offices, which include its operations and research                                             36    40   and development activities. Implementation of this decision is underway and is expected to be substantially completed during the second quarter of 2000. Benefits of this action are expected to include more effective management and coordination of and communication among Pegasus' various activities. These benefits are expected to translate into improvements in the growth and financial performance of Pegasus. Costs associated with this decision are expected to approximate $__________, and will be charged to expense when incurred.       Progress to commercialize K-Fuel Technology continued during 1999, with a successful first commercial burn of a unit train load of product (approximately 12,000 tons) at a generating station in southern Indiana in February 1999. In addition, K-Fuel, LLC, the joint venture established in 1996 between KFx and Kennecott Energy to commercialize K-Fuel Technology, advanced in June 1999 with (a) the formal completion of Kennecott's due diligence phase, (b) a $1 million K-Fuel license fee payment by Kennecott Energy to KFx, (c) an additional $1 million payment by Kennecott Energy to KFx that was required to be invested in K-Fuel, LLC to fund further development activities and (d) certain other provisions to facilitate the next phase of K-Fuel Technology's commercialization. The near term mission of K-Fuel, LLC is to pursue the development of a 3 million ton-per-year K-Fuel production facility that is economic in today's energy markets.       During June 1999, operations at the KFP Facility were suspended and the KFP Facility was put up for sale largely due to certain May 1999 strategic restructuring decisions at TCK and its parent company, Thermo Electron Corporation. Although the KFP Facility operated and produced commercially salable K-Fuel product in 1998 and 1999, TCK advised that optimal and sustained operations had been significantly hampered by certain design and construction deficiencies. KFP is involved in a dispute with the primary construction contractor regarding the withholding of $5.9 million in payments under the KFP Facility construction contract and has filed a counterclaim in excess of $29 million against the contractor for damages related to various claims of faulty construction.       On April 12, 2000 the Company executed agreements with various parties that initiate the redevelopment of the KFP Facility. Pursuant to the agreements, if all conditions to closing are met, (a) a subsidiary of Black Hills Corporation (BHK) will purchase the KFP Facility and receive 2 million shares of KFx common stock previously held by TCK in exchange for the assumption of the reclamation liability associated with the KFP Facility, (b) BHK will be given the right to one seat of KFx's board of directors and KFx will grant BHK a warrant to purchase 1.3 million shares of KFx common stock at $3.65 per share, subject to certain adjustments, (c) KFx will relinquish its 5% interest in KFP and provide certain releases in exchange for cash proceeds estimated at $1.5 million, will retain royalty right and certain real and personal property and has negotiated a revenue-based service fee, (d) TCK will sell the remaining 2.25 million common shares of KFx it owns to private investors and cancel the warrants it holds to purchase a control position in KFx's common stock. KFx and BHK are proceeding to finalize plans and secure the necessary capital to rectify certain design flaws in the balance-of-plant systems, including the addition of an incinerator to eliminate certain process waste streams, and to modify the plant to replace natural gas with waste coal as the facility's energy source. The cost to implement these plans is estimated at $10 million to $12 million. If efforts to finalize plant modification plans and secure related capital are not successful by August 2000, BHK has                                             37    41   the options to salvage the equipment and reclaim the site. The terms of the agreements provide for closing of these transactions not later than April 28, 2000. The carrying value of the Company's investment in KFP has been written down effective December 31, 1999 by $1.8 million, to the $1.5 million near term cash proceeds expected if these transactions close. In addition, the estimated $2.2 million value of the warrants expected to be issued to Black Hills has been charged to expense effective December 31, 1999.        As a company still in the process of developing its businesses, it is rather difficult to predict financial results with meaningful accuracy, which also leads to difficulties in achieving positive and stable financial results in the short term. Nevertheless, the continued progress of both Pegasus and the K-Fuel Technology, reaffirm management's confidence in the opportunity to create long-term value for KFx shareholders.                                           38    42    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Year Ended December 31, 1999 vs. Year Ended December 31, 1998           The consolidated operating loss in 1999 of $7,477,000, which includes $2,765,000 of non-cash charges, was $1,058,000, or 16% greater than the 1998 operating loss due primarily to an increase approximating $2,033,000 in operating losses at Pegasus partially offset by reduced operating losses for K-Fuel approximating $619,000 and a reduction in KFx corporate and other costs approximating $356,000.           Consolidated operating revenues increased approximately $630,000, or 28% from 1998 to 1999 due primarily to the $1 million K-Fuel license fee from Kennecott Energy. In addition, Pegasus revenues increased approximately $208,000, or 16%, but K-Fuel contract revenue declined approximately $578,000, or 65%. This decrease was primarily due to a $351,000 decline in contract revenues associated with services provided by the K-Fuel demonstration plant and laboratory to the KFP Facility, stemming from TCK's suspension of operations at the KFP Facility in June 1999. In addition, there was a $227,000 decline in revenues from a K-Fuel research and development contract with a third party, related to the K-Fuel demonstration plant and laboratory, due to certain administrative changes at the third party research and development contracting agency.           Consolidated operating costs and expenses in 1999 exceeded the 1998 level by approximately $1,688,000, or 20%, principally due to increased costs at Pegasus approximating $2,241,000, partially offset by comparative declines in K-Fuel costs of $197,000 and in KFx and other costs of $356,000.           Pegasus costs increased from 1998 to 1999, in part, because 1998 included three fewer months of Pegasus activity. Pegasus cost increases included (a) $426,000 (56%) in increased cost of sales associated with increased revenue, (b) $1,445,000 (118%) increased marketing, general and administrative costs resulting largely from efforts begun in late 1998 to develop a professional marketing and sales organization, (c) $197,000 (143%) in research and development costs associated with activities to develop enhancements to NeuSIGHT and new products and (d) $173,000 (39%) in depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased goodwill amortization           Declines in K-Fuel costs include $474,000 (53%) in reduced K-Fuel demonstration plant and laboratory expense associated with the decline in related revenue discussed above partially offset by a $250,000 royalty expense associated with the K-Fuel license fee from Kennecott Energy. Declines in KFx corporate and other costs included (a) $224,000 (8%) in reduced marketing, general and administrative expenses and (b) $132,000 (20%) in reduced depreciation and amortization.           The above factors produced a consolidated 1999 operating loss of $7,477,000. In addition, the Company experienced an $4,889,000 net increase in net non-operating expense items from 1998 to 1999. This increase was primarily due to (a) the recognition in 1998 of a $701,000                                           39    43  gain on sale of mine, (b) a decline in interest and other income approximating $320,000, due largely to a decline in the average balance of cash investments, partially offset by (c) a $175,000 reduction in KFx's share of losses at K-Fuel, LLC, due to lower R&D expenses, (d) a $4,000,000 impairment of investment in KFx Fuel Partners, L.P.       The Company does not record a deferred tax benefit from its net operating loss carryforwards, which approximate $36 million at December 31, 1999, because there is no assurance that the Company will be able to realize such benefit as an offset to future income taxes payable.                                           40    44    Year Ended December 31, 1998 vs. Year Ended December 31, 1997       The consolidated operating loss in 1998 of $6,419,000, which includes $3,003,000 of non-cash charges, exceeded the 1997 consolidated operating loss by $1,488,000, or 30%, primarily due to the operating loss of Pegasus that approximated $1,234,000.       Consolidated operating revenues for 1998 of $2,221,000 were $1,136,000, or 51%, higher than for 1997 primarily due to $1,328,000 in revenues from the software licenses and services generated by Pegasus. A decline approximating $192,000 in K-Fuel contract revenues stemmed from a reduction in work performed for K-Fuel, LLC.       Consolidated operating costs and expenses in 1998 exceeded the level of 1997 by approximately $2,624,000, or 44%, largely due to $2,563,000 in operating costs of Pegasus, which was acquired in late March 1998. Pegasus operating costs included $755,000 of costs associated with revenues, $1,225,000 in marketing, general and administrative costs, $138,000 of research and development activities, and $444,000 in depreciation and amortization. Costs associated with operating the K-Fuel demonstration plant and laboratory decreased in 1998 by $362,000 largely due to the reduction in work performed of K-Fuel, LLC as noted above. KFx corporate and other depreciation and amortization for 1998 increased over the 1997 level by $297,000 primarily due to a $287,000 increase in amortization of deferred costs associated with the issuance of convertible debentures in August 1997.       The above factors produced a consolidated 1998 operating loss of $6,419,000. In addition the Company experienced a $200,000 net increase in net non-operating income/expense items from 1997 to 1998. This increase was primarily due to (a) a $613,000 increase in interest expense associated with the July 1997 issuance of the 6% Convertible Debentures, (b) a $305,000 increase in equity in loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries stemming from the April 1998 commencement of operations at the KFP Facility, partially offset by (c) a $701,000 gain on sale of mine.                                           41    45 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           During 1999 the Company used approximately $3,458,000 of cash for its operating activities, which included (a) approximately $1,952,000 used to support and accelerate the growth of Pegasus' business, (b) $1,148,000 used for interest payments, (c) approximately $1,496,000 provided and (c) $1,854,000 used for KFx corporate and other activities. Offsetting these uses of cash, was approximately $1,496,000 of cash provided from the continued development of the K-Fuel business. The principal source of this cash was the agreement in June 1999 with Kennecott Energy which resulted in an addition to operating cash flow, net of related royalty expense payments, of $1,750,000. Of this amount, $1,000,000 was invested in the K-Fuel, LLC joint venture with Kennecott Energy, as required by the agreements with Kennecott Energy. Operating cash used in KFx corporate and other activities was used (a) to oversee the development of the Pegasus and K-Fuel businesses, (b) to pursue opportunities to expand the Company's product and service offerings, and (c) for general corporate activities. In addition to the $1,000,000 investment in K-Fuel, LLC, cash investing activities included approximately $207,000 related to maintenance and further development of the K-Fuel patent estate and approximately $111,000 for miscellaneous capital expenditures. Financing activities used approximately $219,000 of cash for scheduled debt payments, primarily related to the Pegasus acquisition.           During the first quarter of 2000, the Company closed a series of transactions resulting in (a) the sale to Kennecott Energy of 4% of the outstanding common stock of Pegasus held by KFx for $1,000,000, (b) the creation of a 6% cumulative convertible preferred class of Pegasus stock, in which Kennecott Energy invested $500,000, for an additional 2% of Pegasus, and (c) the development in conjunction with Kennecott Energy of a work plan for product development and other achievements that is expected to trigger up to $3.5 million in additional investments at the discretion of Kennecott Energy for up to an additional 14% interest in Pegasus by the end of 2004. Kennecott Energy has the right to sell the Pegasus common stock that it purchased for $1,000,000 back to KFx at any time until March 3, 2001 for the greater of its purchase price or fair market value. In addition, KFx converted approximately $3.6 million of secured debt owed by Pegasus to KFx into shares of the new Pegasus preferred stock, on the same terms as Kennecott Energy. Included in the agreements among KFx, Kennecott Energy and Pegasus are provisions governing the terms of investments from any new investors in Pegasus, limiting the borrowings of Pegasus, and limiting the payment of dividends by Pegasus. KFx is actively seeking additional strategic investors to further expand the capital base of Pegasus.           During the first quarter of 1999, the Company announced its desire to restructure its 6% Convertible Debentures (Debentures), which are convertible into KFx common stock at a conversion price of $3.65. As of April 13, 2000, Debentures with a face value of $1,650,000, have been converted into 452,049 shares of the Company's common stock at the contract conversion price of $3.65. The Company continuing to evaluate alternatives to strengthen its balance sheet including ways to induce conversion of all of substantially all of the Debentures.                                          42     46           The Company expects its cash requirements over the balance of 2000 with respect to day-to-day operations and debt service requirements to be satisfied by (a) cash on hand, which as of April 13, 2000 approximated $287,000; (b) expected cash proceeds approximating $1.5 million from the KFP Sale, (c) approximately $1.5 million of Kennecott Energy's discretionary investments in Pegasus in connection with the achievement of milestones under the work plan, pursuant to provisions of the agreements executed in March 2000; (d) potential investments in Pegasus from interested participants in the power generation industry; (e) potential debt and/or equity offerings of the Company; (f) potential fees from licensing new K-Fuel facilities; (g) potential partners in connection with opportunities to expand the Company's product and service offerings to the power industry; (g) certain contract revenues relating to the K-Fuel demonstration plant and laboratory; and (h) unsecured borrowings from one or more of its directors.           The Company has contacted and has been contacted by several large suppliers to the power generation industry about the potential of making an investment in Pegasus. In addition, the Company has contacted several prominent investment banking firms about the potential for debt and/or equity offerings of the Company and/or Pegasus. At this stage, discussions with all of these parties are preliminary, but the Company intends to continue such discussions and negotiate definitive agreements if acceptable terms can be reached. The Company and Kennecott Energy are continuing to work diligently on an optimal design for a 3 million ton-per-year K-Fuel plant and toward the objective of licensing such a plant within approximately the next 12 months. Such a license, if agreed to, would a generate gross initial license fee at the granting of the license approximating $3.5 million, or approximately $2.2 million in cash, net of related royalty obligations. The Company has had discussions with various parties about potential transactions to add product and/or service offerings relevant to the power generation industry. Such discussions have included consideration of acquisitions and related transactions to raise equity capital for the Company and/or Pegasus. Although there are no currently active discussions, the Company will continue to evaluate the merits of pursuing such a strategy, in view of the Company's evolving financial condition. In addition, from time to time, directors of the Company have provide to the Company short term unsecured financing and the Company expects that such financing, on at least a short term basis, will continue to be available if needed.           Depending on the outcome of various uncertainties, including those discussed herein, the Company may be required to seek additional debt and/or equity financing for general operating purposes and/or to meet debt service requirements. The timing of collection of accounts receivable and payment of accounts payable could significantly alter the Company's need for at least temporary financing. Should the Company be required to seek any additional debt and/or equity financing, its ability to do so will be affected by the terms of the Debentures, under which the Company may only incur unsecured indebtedness of up to $8.0 million (of which approximately $611,000 was outstanding as of April 14,, 2000) and indebtedness that is secured only by the assets of a particular project and is non-recourse to the Company and its subsidiaries. In addition, certain agreements with TCK contain restrictions on the Company's ability to sell its common stock and incur indebtedness. Such TCK restrictions will be cancelled if the KFP Sale closes, as expected on or before April 28, 2000.           There are no assurances that any of these potential funding sources will materialize, and the Company does not currently have any commitments with respect to any such funding sources. If the overall outcome of the various uncertainties affecting the Company is not favorable, the Company may be forced to seek debt and/or equity financing on terms and conditions that may be unfavorable to the Company, if available at all. If the Company requires additional financing and cannot obtain it when needed or if Kennecott Energy elects to sell the Pegasus common stock that it purchased from the Company back to the Company, the Company may default on payments when due.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS       In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133). SFAS 133 establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities. SFAS 133,                                           43    47  as amended, is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. To date the Company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments or hedging activities.       In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" (SAB 101). SAB 101 provides specific guidance, among other things, as to the recognition of revenue related to up-front non-refundable fees and services received in connection with a contractual arrangement. The Company has applied the provisions of SAB 101 for the year ended December 31, 1999 and its application did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.  YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE       Prior to December 31, 1999, the Company completed various analyses and remediation procedures, as it considered necessary and prudent, to identify and remediate potential Year 2000 issues that could create significant disruptions or other difficulties related to the Company's business. Such analyses and remediation procedures covered all internal systems of the Company and the Pegasus products and also included surveys and other procedures, as considered appropriate, related to the Company's suppliers and customers. These analyses and remediation procedures were completed at a nominal cost to the Company. To date the Company has not experienced any disruptions or other difficulties related to the Year 2000 issue. Based on the results of analyses and remediation procedures completed prior to December 31, 1999 and the absence of Year 2000 disruptions or other difficulties to date, management believes that its systems and products are substantially Year 2000 compliant and the systems of its suppliers and vendors are at least sufficiently Year 2000 compliant so as to avoid any significant disruptions or other difficulties to the Company's business.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       The Company is not currently subject to a significant level of direct market risk related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices or equity prices. The Company has no derivative instruments or any floating rate debt and does not expect to derive a material amount of its revenues from interest bearing securities. Currently the Company has no significant foreign operations. To the extent that the Company establishes significant foreign operations in the future, it will attempt to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates contractually and through the use of hedging activities and other means considered appropriate. The Company is indirectly exposed to fluctuations in fuel commodity prices. To the extent that fuel prices rise, there may be a tendency for greater demand for certain of the Company's products and services, since K-Fuel and NeuSIGHT have been shown to result in lower usage of coal and coal beneficiated fuel products when used to generate electric power. The Company's fuel-related products provide various environmental benefits that management believes significantly mitigate the fuel commodity risk associated with the Company's business. The Company holds no equity market securities, but does face equity market risk relative to its own                                           44    48  equity securities. This risk is most likely to be manifested by influencing the Company's ability to raise debt or equity financing, if needed.  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA
