ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS            This 10-K filing contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties.  The Company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward- looking statements.  Factors that might cause such a difference include those discussed below, as well as general economic and business conditions, regulatory changes, competition, the acceptance of new product offerings and other factors discussed elsewhere in this 10-K.  The Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.  OVERVIEW            Excluding the joint venture fee of $1 million in 1996, to date the Company has not generated any other material revenues from the licensing of the K-Fuel Technology to third party licensees or the direct manufacturing of K-Fuel product.  All revenues other than the joint venture fee in 1996 have been derived from ancillary sources not directly related to the Company's efforts to commercialize the K-Fuel Technology.  Net losses before extraordinary items and income taxes were approximately $6.1 million, $8.8 million and $5.6 million in 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively. The KFP Project is the only commercial- scale K-Fuel production facility constructed to date.  Until the Company successfully negotiates additional third-party licensing and royalty agreements and / or independently constructs and operates additional commercial-scale production facilities, net operating losses will continue.   The royalties and profit interests to be derived from the Company's 5 percent ownership interest in the KFP Project will not be sufficient to meet all of the operating and debt service needs of the Company based on current and future anticipated operating plans and budgets.  Until such time as the Company has in place sufficient additional commercial-scale production facilities (either owned independently or through joint venture entities similar to the KFP Project) to generate positive cash flow from operations, the Company will be dependent on additional debt and/or equity financing.  The Company expects that most or all of its financing needs in 1997 with respect to day-to-day operations and debt service requirements will be provided by the January 1997 equity funding provided by TCK, certain technical subcontract revenues from K-Fuel LLC, and the Company's interest in profits and production royalties from the KFP Project. Additionally, any equity participation that the Company negotiates for future commercial-scale production facilities prior to January 2000 (or later, depending on whether TCK exercises Warrant "A") will have to be financed by sources other than the Stock Purchase Agreement with TCK.   See "ITEM 1 - BUSINESS - Strategic Relationships - Thermo Ecotek Corporation."                                      -------------------------    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Year Ended December 31, 1996 vs. Year Ended December 31, 1995 - -------------------------------------------------------------            The Company had a net loss before income tax benefits and extraordinary item of approximately $5,629,000 in 1996 as compared to a loss of approximately $8,796,000 in 1995.  The decreased loss of approximately $3,167,000 is attributable to a revenue increase of approximately $1,388,000 in 1996 over 1995, and a decrease in expenses of approximately $1,779,000 in 1996 as compared to 1995.  In 1996, the Company had no debt extinguishment gains and related income tax benefits, as compared to such gains in 1995 totaling approximately $2,567,000.  Including such gains in 1995, overall net loss decreased from approximately $6,229,000 in 1995 to approximately $5,629,000 in 1996.            Revenues increased in 1996 because of the one-time joint venture fee of $1,000,000, as well as approximately $360,000 in technical subcontract work the Company performed for K-Fuel LLC beginning  in mid-1996.  As the K-Fuel LLC joint venture commenced in 1996, there were no comparable figures                                         14   in 1995. The Company does not expect to receive any further fees related to K- Fuel LLC until one or more Commercial Projects are constructed by K-Fuel LLC; see "ITEM 1- BUSINESS - Strategic Relationships - Kennecott Energy and Coal                                                   ------------------------- Company."  The Company will perform additional technical subcontract work for K- - -------                                                                         Fuel LLC in 1997, although the dollar amount of such work is not currently determinable.  All of K-Fuel LLC's research and development costs, including any technical subcontract work performed for K-Fuel LLC by the Company, are paid by KAFI.            Expenses decreased by approximately $1,779,000 in 1996 as compared to 1995. The components of the overall decrease (increase) in expenses in 1996 are summarized as follows (all figures are approximate):     Decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses ...........  $  813,000 One-time litigation charge and performance fee in 1995 ...............   1,760,000 Decrease in interest expense..........................................     493,000 Increase in depreciation and amortization expense.....................    (204,000) Increase in research & development / laboratory operating expenses ...    (382,000) Write-down of mine property and reclamation costs incurred in 1996....    (701,000)                                                                         ----------      Net decrease in expenses.......................................... $1,779,000                                                                         ==========             Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $813,000 in 1996 as compared to 1995 primarily as a result of (1) an overall decrease in professional services fees in 1996 of approximately $859,000 and (2) a decrease in board of director compensation expense in 1996 of approximately $178,000, partially offset by (3) the Company's 51 percent equity in the expenses of K-Fuel LLC (other than research and development and amortization expenses) in 1996 totaling approximately $87,000 and (4) an overall increase in payroll and general administrative expenses in 1996 totaling approximately $137,000.            The decrease in professional services fees in 1996 is generally attributable to certain stock-based compensation agreements incurred only in 1995 relating to certain marketing and public relations activities.  However, legal fees increased by approximately $177,000 in 1996 to a total of approximately $693,000, of which approximately $340,000 was specifically attributable to the K-Fuel LLC joint venture agreement in 1996 and for which no further significant legal expense is expected in 1997.  The decrease in board of director compensation in 1996 is attributable to a change of compensation policy beginning in 1996.   The Company's 51 percent equity in the marketing, general and administrative expenses of K-Fuel LLC will continue in 1997 but will increase over the 1996 amount because of the full year in 1997 as compared to the partial year in 1996.   The increase in payroll and general and administrative expenses in 1996 is attributable to the hiring of two executive employees in 1996 and the Company doubling its Denver, Colorado headquarters office space in the fourth quarter 1995.            The litigation settlement ($800,000) and success fees relating to the closing of the KFP Project ($960,000) were one-time expenses incurred in 1995 only.            The decrease in interest expense in 1996 is attributable to the significant decrease in outstanding debt in 1996 as compared to 1995.  Total debt outstanding has decreased to $1,225,000 at December 31, 1996 from approximately $1,614,000 at December 31, 1995, and from approximately $4,835,000 at December 31, 1994.            The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 1996 is attributable to the full year of amortization of the Series "C" patents acquired in the third quarter of 1995 and the depreciation of certain property and equipment additions in 1996 at the Company's demonstration and laboratory facility.                                        15             The increase in research and development and laboratory operating expenses in 1996 is attributable to the K-Fuel LLC technical subcontract services performed in 1996 only.  The Company will continue to perform such services for K-Fuel LLC in 1997, although the amount and scope of such work is not currently determinable.            The write-down of mine property and reclamation costs incurred in 1996 are attributable to the Company's mining property near Gillette, Wyoming.  This property was acquired by the Company in 1995 and was related to its participation in the KFP Project.  The Company had intended to sell this property. However, in 1996 the Company determined that it would not sell the property; rather it intends to hold the mining property as a reserve coal supply for the KFP Project to protect against any raw coal feedstock disruptions that might result from the current consolidation that is happening among coal producers in the Powder River Basin   Also in 1996, the Company reassessed the value of this asset and wrote-down the value of  the property to its current estimated value.  Additionally, the Company increased its reclamation reserve related to the property by approximately $134,000 in 1996 because of more accurate reclamation studies performed in 1996 and certain regulatory changes enacted by the State of Wyoming.  The Company does not expect to incur any significant cash reclamation costs related to the property in 1997.  Year Ended December 31, 1995 vs. Year Ended December 31, 1994 - -------------------------------------------------------------            The Company had a net loss before income tax benefits and extraordinary item of approximately $8,796,000 in 1995 as compared to a net loss of approximately $6,120,000 in 1994.  The increased loss of approximately $2,676,000 is primarily attributable to increased marketing, general and administrative expenses of approximately $734,000, performance fees of $960,000 specifically associated with the TCK Stock Purchase Agreement and KFP Project funding by TCK, and a litigation charge of $800,000.  The increased marketing, general and administrative expenses in 1995 were primarily comprised of an increase in legal and other professional fees of approximately $324,000 resulting from the TCK Stock Purchase Agreement and KFP Project construction start-up, approximately $238,000 in increased investor and public relations expenses, and other expense increases totaling approximately $172,000 primarily relating to additional employees hired in 1995.            Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by approximately $251,000 in 1995 because of a full year of amortization of a prepaid consulting agreement in 1995 as compared to a partial year in 1994, and the acquisition of the Series "C" patents in August 1995.            Research and development expenses  decreased by approximately $298,000 in 1995 because of specific activities and projects undertaken in 1994 only.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES            Working capital decreased from approximately $2,254,000 at December 31, 1995 to a working capital deficit of approximately $167,000 at December 31, 1996.  The decrease is primarily attributable to a December 1995 investment by TCK under the Stock Purchase Agreement for $3 million.  In January 1997, TCK invested another $2.5 million in the Company.  On a proforma basis, after including the January 1997 investment in the Company by TCK, proforma working capital at December 31, 1996 was approximately $2,333,000, comparable to the working capital at December 31, 1995.                                        16             The Company expects no additional stock purchases by TCK in 1997, 1998 or 1999.  Under the terms of the TCK Stock Purchase Agreement, the next possible investment by TCK is not until a period of time beginning in January 2000 and expiring in July 2001.  There are no assurances that TCK will make any investments in the Company at that time.  Additionally, the TCK Stock Purchase Agreement prohibits the Company from issuing additional shares of common stock to other investors unless at least 90 percent of the proceeds from such stock issuances are used to invest in K-Fuel production facilities.  Furthermore, in the event of any stock issuances by the Company, TCK's Warrant "A" may be subject to certain adjustments that increase the number of shares available to TCK under Warrant "A."  See "ITEM 1 - BUSINESS - Strategic Relationships -- Thermo Ecotek Corporation." - -------------------------              Because of the Company's current net operating loss carryforward position with respect to federal income taxes, the Section 29 credit the Company receives from its 5 percent ownership of KFP will likely not be utilized in the near term (i.e., next two to three years).  Accordingly, the Company is currently considering the sale of a portion of its ownership interest in KFP as a means to generate cash.  There are no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully complete such a sale transaction.            KFP is also currently considering the construction of a fifth processing vessel for the KFP Project, which would add production capacity of approximately 125,000 TPY.  The funding for this expansion, if commenced, would be funded 100 percent by TCK or other entities with which TCK and the Company are currently negotiating.  The Company may be entitled to certain license fees and an ownership percentage in the fifth processor expansion, the terms of which have not yet been finalized.  There are no assurances that such an expansion will be completed by KFP.            The Company is also working to commence construction of the KFP II Project. There are no assurances that the Company will obtain the necessary permits for the KFP II Project or that suitable financing terms will be negotiated with potential partners.  If the KFP II Project is not constructed, it is unlikely that any other U.S. K-Fuel production facilities will be constructed until K-Fuel LLC successfully develops an enhanced processing vessel design and completes the remaining objectives of the research and development program.  There are no assurances that such objectives of K-Fuel LLC will be achieved.            The Company's current cash balances, the expected revenues to be derived from the Company's research and development subcontract agreements with K-Fuel LLC, and the royalty income to be derived from the commencement of operations of KFP in 1997 are expected to fund the Company's operations and debt service requirements until the first quarter of 1998 based on current operating plans and budgets.  The Company does not expect to realize any significant net revenues from its 5 percent ownership interest in KFP during 1997.  The Company will need to realize additional operating funding sources and reduce certain operating expenses to sustain operations into 1998 and beyond.  Such potential sources of funding may include, but are not limited to (1) the proposed sale of all or a portion of the Company's 5 percent interest in KFP;  (2) certain development and license fees that may be derived from a potential 125,000 TPY expansion of the KFP Project; (3) license fees to be derived from the proposed construction of an Indonesia K-Fuel production facility in late 1997 or early 1998; and (4) certain development and license fees to be derived from the proposed commencement of construction of the 635,000 TPY KFP II Project.  There are no assurances that any of these potential funding sources will materialize, and the Company does not currently have any commitments with respect to any such funding sources.  If such events do not materialize, the Company may be forced to seek debt and / or equity financing on terms and conditions that may not be favorable to the Company, if available at all.  The Company does not currently have any commitments with respect to any debt or equity financing.                                         17             As discussed at "ITEM 1 - BUSINESS - Current Projects - KFX Fuel                                                                   -------- Partners," a fire at the KFP facility in December 1996 destroyed one of two oil - --------                                                                        heating systems for the KFP facility.  Until the fire damage is fully repaired and the KFP facility is operating at its full capacity, the Company may experience  difficulty in attracting other investors to the KFP II Project, the expansion of the KFP Project, or negotiating suitable terms with investors with respect to the sale of all or a portion of the Company's ownership interest in KFP.  The Company expects that the fire damage will be fully repaired and the KFP facility will be fully operational in the second or third quarter of 1997. The Company also anticipates that it will be required to fund a capital call in the second quarter of 1997 relating to certain cost overruns on the construction of the KFP project.  The amount of the capital call is expected to be approximately $410,000, reduced by a receivable the Company has from KFP in the amount of approximately $260,000.  The net amount of the capital call, or approximately $150,000, will be funded by the Company from available cash or a short-term promissory note with KFP.  This capital call does not include any uninsured losses resulting from the December 1996 fire.  Presently, the Company does not expect that KFP will have any significant uninsured losses.  There are no assurances that additional capital calls will not be required to be funded by the Company in 1997.   ITEM 8.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA
