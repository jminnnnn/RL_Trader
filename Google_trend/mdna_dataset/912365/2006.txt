ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS                   The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with, and arequalified by reference to, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto in Item 8 of this report and Selected Financial Data included in Item 6 of this report.  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform tocurrent year presentation.  Certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform of 1995.  Refer to the “Cautions About Forward LookingStatements” preceding Item 1 of this report.  Also, for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business and operations see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report.   Overview                   We offer combined energy, environmental and economic solutions to coal-fired power generating facilities and industrial coal users inthe United States and internationally.  Our proprietary K-Fuel process uses heat and pressure to physically and chemically transform high moisture, low-Btu PRB coals, such as subbituminous coal and lignite, into a more energy efficient, lower‑emissionfuel.  A co-benefit of the K-Fuel process is the removal of significant amounts of impurities, including mercury, and the reduction of emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.                   The following discussion is focused on the recent events that we believe have the most significant impact on our business.                       •         We have substantially completed the construction of our 750,000-tons per year K-Fuel plant and mine project in Wyoming's PRB, which is our first commercial plant implementing the K-Fuel process;                                •         We completed our first two production runs using feedstock coal with less than 8,000 Btus at the 750,000-tons per year plant.  The initial production runs resulted in coal that was approximately 11,000 Btus, with amoisture content of between 8% and 12%, meeting our desired specifications for K-Fuel product.  Further, the initial product showed a reduction in mercury of approximately 70% from the feedstock coal;                                •         We entered into a stock purchase agreement with Keller Group, Inc. to acquire its wholly owned subsidiary Buckeye Industrial Mining Co. Buckeye's primary business is to mine, process and sell coal to power generatingfacilities and industrial users.  The acquisition would provide us with established markets, infrastructure, blending facilities, coal supply, and operating cash flow;                                •         In February 2006, we sold 7 million shares of common stock at a price to the public of $18.75 per share pursuant to a follow-on common stock offering.  On February 27, 2006, the underwriters exercised in full theirover allotment option, purchasing an additional 1.1 million shares of common stock.  Including the over-allotment, the offering totaled 8.1 million shares of common stock at a price of $18.75, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $144.4 million afterdeducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.  We plan to use the proceeds from this offering to fund the contemplated acquisition of Buckeye, new plant facility construction costs, the purchase of a coal-fired boiler andgeneral corporate purposes.  If we are unable to close the acquisition of Buckeye, we intend to use the proceeds to further the development of our K-Fuel plants and for any acquisitions we may identify in the future;                                •         We have signed agreements to evaluate the potential of constructing and operating plants located in the PRB.  We have also signed a memorandum of understanding with a coal producer to access their mine site location inLouisiana to determine the viability of a K-Fuel plant at that location;                                         •         We strengthened our executive management team by adding an experienced operational Chief Executive Officer; and                                         •         We purchased MR&E, a research engineering and project management firm focused on thermal process engineering, including upgrading and processing of clean coal.                      Our financial statements include all of our wholly owned subsidiaries, including MR&E, acquired in March 2005 and Landrica,acquired in May 2004; both are more fully discussed in Item 1 of this report.  During 2003, as part of an exchange transaction with Kennecott, we transferred our ownership of Pegasus to Kennecott for the remaining interest in KFL that we did not own.  As aresult of this exchange, we have accounted for Pegasus as a discontinued operation and have accordingly removed its effects from our results of continuing operations for 2003.  KFL is now a wholly-owned subsidiary.   17                     Historically, we reported results for our business in one segment.  In December 2004, we entered into an agreement to license ourproprietary coal processing technology.  Due to this licensing agreement we now operate our business in two segments, the licensing segment and the operating segment.  The licensing segment represents revenue and costs related to the licensing of ourtechnology, which comprises of virtually all of our revenue in 2005 and 2004.  The operating segment contains all other operations.  As we operated our business in a single segment in prior years, our discussion is focused on our overall operations, ratherthan by segment, unless otherwise indicated.   Significant Trends                   For the last several years, our operations have been focused on developing our technology and the construction of the 750,000-tons peryear plant.  As a result, we have limited revenues and most of our costs are related to general and administrative expenses.  In the future, we plan to own and operate K-Fuel production facilities domestically, both wholly owned and through joint ventures,as well as to license the K-Fuel technology to third parties, primarily internationally.  As our operations expand, we expect our revenue and cost structure will also expand.  The following discussion and analysis is focused on the events and trends that webelieve have the most significant impact on our business.                      Revenue Trends                   In the future we expect to generate revenue from the following sources:                       •         sales of K-Fuel from joint ventures and wholly owned production facilities;                       •         licensing of our technology, including license fees for constructing a plant and royalty fees for operating a plant; and                       •         consulting services to parties who license our technology.                      In addition, to the extent that we execute on our vertical integration strategy and acquire companies that conform to our businessstrategy, we anticipate revenues from those sources as well.  For example, we have entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire Buckeye, and if we complete this acquisition, we could begin recognizing revenue related to their business.                    We have granted certain rights and limited licenses for the use of certain K-Fuel technology, which may limit our revenue fromproduction of K-Fuel to the extent that the rights are exercised.                     Expense Trends                   As we begin to operate our wholly owned and potential joint venture plants, we expect that our cost structure will change. Currently, the majority of our costs are related to general and administrative efforts.  As plants begin operations, we will incur additional expenses, the most significant of which are:                       •         Feedstock;                       •         non-cash, share-based compensation;                       •         payroll;                       •         utilities; and                       •         royalty costs, relating to fees we owe to parties who own certain rights that support our patents and proprietary technology, primarily the Koppelman estate.                      We anticipate that accounting for non-cash, share-based compensation will add approximately $9 to $10 million per year in theforeseeable future to our expenses.  In the event we should achieve certain performance goals, we would significantly accelerate recognition of these costs.  Costs such as feedstock, payroll and utilities are variable costs that increase with the size andthe location of the plant and the year in which they are incurred.  As a result, we cannot currently estimate what these costs will be until such time as a plant becomes operational.  See further discussion of the royalty owed to the estate of EdwardKoppelman in Note 5 – Deferred Royalty Costs in Item 8 of this report.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Revenue                   Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005, was $984,000.  For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, our revenues wereinconsequential to our business.  The majority of the increase in 2005 was attributed to the recognition of revenue of $768,000 on the $7.5 million up-front licensing fee received in December 2004 and recorded in our licensing segment.  To   18     date we have completed all of our contractual deliverables for the licensing fee and are waiting for Cook Inlet Coal LLC to provided specific site information before the next phase of revenue recognition cancommence.    General and Administrative                   The following table summarizes our general and administrative costs for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and2003.        Year Ended December 31                                                                                             2005      2004      2003                       (in thousands)       Employee-related costs    $    6,234      $    2,234      $    1,692           Professional fees     6,059             5,314                 4,588       Travel and entertainment costs     719       219       461       Office expenses     530       365       411       Insurance     478       321       252       Other     6,181       334       88                         Total general and administrative    $    20,201      $    8,787      $    7,492                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Employee-related costs primarily include salaries and wages, bonuses, benefits, and related benefits, as well as non-cash, share-basedemployee compensation costs.  Employee-related costs were $6.2 million, $2.2 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  We recognized non-cash expense for equity compensation in the amount of $2.2 million,$463,000 and $467,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The remaining increases in 2005 and 2004 were primarily related to an increase in salaries and related burdens as we hired more employees at our corporate and plant officeand from the acquisition of MR&E in 2005.                   Professional fees include legal, audit and accounting, public relations and similar costs.  Professional fees were $6.1 million,$5.3 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  We experienced fluctuations in professional fees due to the following:                    •         2005 included $2.4 million of non-cash expense related to the issuance of stock to a consultant in exchange for services performed;                    •         2004 included $2.2 million of consulting fees relating to assistance with regulatory issues, the majority of which is non-cash for the issuance of warrants and stock;                    •         2003 included $1.1 million of legal fees related to a lawsuit settled in January 2004.  In 2004, we negotiated a reduction in our legal costs, which we had previously accrued in 2003.  This reduction of $521,000 wasapplied to legal fees expensed in 2004.                       Travel and entertainment costs are primarily comprised of airfare, lodging and meals.  Our travel and entertainment costs were$719,000, $219,000 and $461,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The increase in 2005 was due to additional non-plant related employees and management traveling to the 750,000-tons per year plant site and increasedinternational travel related to visits to Lurgi South Africa’s facilities and other business development opportunities.  During 2003, there was significant travel as we evaluated different methods of improving our K-fuel product and process, primarilyrelated to the implementation of Lurgi South Africa’s equipment.                   Office expenses include rent, office supplies, phone, utilities, publications, and subscriptions.  Office expense were $530,000,$365,000 and $411,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The increase was due to increases in all aspects of office expense due to the expansion of our business and the increase in the number of employees.                   Insurance primarily includes costs related to our commercial and liability insurance.  Insurance expense were $478,000, $321,000and $252,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Increases were attributed to an overall increase in general and commercial liability premiums for our 750,000-tons per year plant.                   Other general and administrative is comprised of expenses that cannot be categorized elsewhere and include, among other costs, variousbusiness and franchise taxes, repair and maintenance and board of director fees and expenses.  Other general and administrative expenses were $6.2 million, $334,000 and $88,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  In 2005, weincurred $5.8 million of non-cash expense related to the issuance of warrants to Arch Coal, Inc.  In   19     2004, we recognized non-cash stock-based compensation for a member of the board of directors of $136,000 for the extension of the expiration date of his options.   Mine and Plant Expenses                   Mine expenses include costs associated with security, Mine Safety and Health Association regulatory compliance, property taxes, assetretirement obligation accretion expense and other costs necessary to maintain an open-pit coal mine.  Additionally, these expenses include payments associated with evaluating the potential for utilizing our coal mine to provide feedstock supply to our K-Fuelplant such as: maintenance to the pit roads, coal testing, and other feasibility study costs.  Plant expenses include pre-operating costs incurred to prepare our 750,000-tons per year plant for operations, such as: costs incurred to hire and train personnel forthe operation of our plant, establish health and safety plans, develop environmental compliance plans, define operating manual procedures and other administrative costs.  Plant expenses also include administrative personnel, office supplies, utilities, vehiclemaintenance and other insignificant purchases.  Mine and plant costs were $­­­­1.9 million and $154,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.  There were no such expenses for the period ended December 31, 2003.  We expectthese costs to increase once we begin commercial production at our 750,000-tons per year plant and coalmine.   Research and Development                   The following table summarizes our research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.        Year Ended December 31             2005      2004      2003                   (in thousands)       Laboratory facilities    $    596            $    302                $    321           Technical and engineering services     1,015       394       1,295                         Total research and development    $    1,611      $    696      $    1,616                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Research and development costs include costs incurred to advance, test, and or otherwise either modify our proprietary technology ordevelop new technologies, costs incurred to operate and maintain our demonstration facilities and professional fees.  Research and development costs were $1.6 million, $696,000 and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,respectively.                   The majority of the increase for the year ended December 31, 2005 can be attributed to an increase in the number of employees andrelated overhead at our laboratory facilities located.  Increased activity at our laboratory facilities is indicative of internal coal testing.                   Technical and engineering services are primarily comprised of costs related to consultants that assist us in the development of ourtechnology and the commercial viability of our product.  Technical and engineering services  were $1.0 million, $394,000 and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The majority of the increase in 2005 wasattributed to an increase in new technology development and feasibility studies for future large-scale plant sites.  The decline from 2003 to 2004 related to consulting services as we designed improvements to our process incorporating the Lurgi South Africaequipment, which did not meet the criteria to be capitalized.   Depreciation and Amortization                   Depreciation and amortization is comprised of depreciation on our property and equipment and amortization related to our patents. Depreciation expense was $563,000, $268,000 and $111,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The increases are primarily attributable to new assets placed into service during 2005 and 2004, including MR&E assets acquired inMarch 2005 and Landrica assets acquired in May 2004.  Amortization of our patents was $210,000, $152,000 and $264,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.    20     Cost of License and Consulting Revenue                   Cost of license and consulting revenue includes costs to transfer our technology related to the 2004 licensing agreement, includingamortization of deferred royalty costs, salaries and wages of certain personnel and professional fees.  Cost of licensing and consulting revenue was $448,000 and $5,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  The majority of thesecosts were in direct correlation to the revenue recognized on the licensing agreement we entered into in 2004.   Bad Debt and Asset Impairment Charges                   Through two transactions in 2003, Pegasus Technologies, Inc. became indebted to us.  During the year ended December 31, 2005, wedetermined that Pegasus might not have sufficient contracts to continue to meet this obligation.  Therefore, we have recorded an allowance for the note receivable of $1.3 million.  Despite this allowance for bad debt, we retain all of our rights to collectpayments under this note from Pegasus and to demand payment upon certain events of default.  See Note 9 – Discontinued Operations Pegasus and Note Receivable in Item 8 of this report.                   The  $1.3 million plant development impairment in 2004 was primarily related to certain site-specific and plant size-specificcosts incurred associated with evaluating three other locations for our 750,000-tons per year plant.  Impairments during 2003 totaled $107,000, relating primarily to scrap metal, which was deemed to have no expected future cash value as of December 31,2003.   Other Income Expense                   Other income (expense), net for 2004, was primarily comprised of proceeds from the settlement of a derivative lawsuit in January2004.  Interest income for 2005 and 2004 relates to the short-term, highly liquid investment of our cash balance in each of those years and was higher as our overall cash balance increased in 2005.  Interest income (expense), net for 2003, decreased$748,000, which represents the recognition of a previously recorded debt discount due to the repayment of debt in 2003 and is offset by increased interest income of $352,000.                   Equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates in 2003 was comprised of our share of KFL’s loss.  As we now consolidate KFL,there are no such losses in 2004 or 2005.   Deferred Tax Benefit                   We have not reflected a deferred tax benefit from net operating loss carryforwards, which approximate $112 million at December 31,2005, since based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, management has determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets may not be realized.  The primary evidence was our history of net operating losses.  Aswe begin to earn revenue and realize net income, we will continue to evaluate our valuation allowance and at such time as there is sufficient evidence that we will utilize at least some portion of our deferred tax assets, we will reverse a related portion of ourvaluation allowance.                    Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limits the annual amount of net operating losses that can be used to offset taxable income aftersignificant ownership changes, such as those caused by our 2003 capital infusions.  We believe our annual limitation is $11.3 million on the use of our pre-2004 net operating losses of approximately $67.6 million.  In the event we achieve profitableoperations and taxable income, any Section 382 limitation would have the effect of increasing our income tax liability and reducing available cash resources.   Liquidity and Capital Resources                   In February 2006, we sold 7 million shares of common stock at a price to the public of $18.75 per share pursuant to a follow-oncommon stock offering.  On February 27, 2006, the underwriters exercised in full their over allotment option, purchasing an additional 1.1 million shares of common stock.  Including the over-allotment, the offering totaled 8.1 million shares of common stockat a price of $18.75, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $144.4 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.  We plan to use the proceeds from this offering to fund the contemplated acquisition ofBuckeye, new plant facility construction costs, the purchase of a coal-fired boiler and general corporate purposes.  If we are unable to close the acquisition of Buckeye, we intend to use the proceeds to further the development of our K-Fuel plants and for anyacquisitions we may identify in the future.  We believe our cash level, including the offering, is sufficient to support our operations for the next year, complete our 750,000-tons per year plant and mine site project, and start preliminary site investigation,design, obtain permits and similar long-lead-time activities related to other large-scale commercial plants.   21                     Our cash will primarily be used to fund operations and for capital expenditures.  The capital budget for 2006 is $91 million,including remaining expenditures related to our 750,000-tons per year plant.  We estimate our total project costs for our initial K-Fuel plant and KFx mine project to be approximately $79.7 million.  We estimate our total plant cost, including operatingequipment, will be approximately $69 million.  The estimated total project costs through March 31, 2006 are summarized in the table below:       Project Item           750,000-tons per year plant and operating equipment    $    69.0       Train loadout silo     4.3       Mine and site improvements     4.1       Start up and other costs     2.6                      Total project costs     80.0       Less: Expenditures through December 31, 2005     (71.6    )                     Remaining project costs    $    8.4                                                                                                                                                                       We expect to spend the majority our remaining capital budget on preliminary site investigation, design and other costs related to theconstruction of commercial K-Fuel plants.                   We believe we will need to obtain additional funding in order to construct large-scale commercial plants.  We plan to seekadditional capital from time to time as needed through:  (1)  equity offerings or the exercise of outstanding options and warrants; (2) debt offerings; (3) partnering with third parties in the construction and operation for some of our large-scalecommercial plants through the formation of joint ventures, and (4) fees from additional licensing of our K-Fuel technology.  While we believe we will obtain additional capital through one or more of the alternatives described, we can provide no assurance thatany of the alternatives will be available to us or be on terms acceptable to us.   Payment Obligations                   The following table summarizes our future commitments as of December 31, 2005:        Payments due by period           (Dollars in thousands)           2006     2007     2008     2009     2010     Thereafter     Total                             Operating leases    $    457     $    420     $    398     $    380     $    213     $    —     $    1,868      Capital lease and other obligations     91      59      26      18      8      —      202      Purchase commitment obligations     2,927      265      105      —      —      —      3,297                                  Total commitments    $    3,475     $    744     $    529     $    398     $    221     $    —     $    5,367                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  This table does not include accounts payable, accrued expenses nor asset retirement obligation, which are reported in ourDecember 31, 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheets.  We have not included any obligation in which either party has the right to terminate.  Additionally, we have not included royalty payments, as we cannot presently determine when such payments will be madeas such payments are based upon our receipt of cash for licensing and royalties.                   We are obligated under non-cancelable operating leases with initial terms exceeding one year relating to office space and certainequipment and vehicle leases.  Rent expense in the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $242,000, $223,000 and $255,000, respectively.  Through September 30, 2004 certain of the leased property, principally office space, was sublet to thirdparties under a non-cancelable operating sublease.  Such sub-lease agreement expired on September 30, 2004.  Sublease income was $124,000 and $143,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.                   Purchase commitments related to our 750,000-tons per year plant relate to outstanding, non-cancelable purchase orders, primarily forthe fabrication of the process modules.  Contractual commitments include agreements with consultants to advise us on proposed legislation and regulations and advocate our interests before the U.S. Congress and regulatory agencies that extend four of thecurrently active consulting agreements for periods of 12 to 43 months and a take or pay obligation relating to a feedstock supply agreement.   22     Historical View                   While our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Operations were presented with specific line items for discontinued operationsour Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows presentation did not change considerably from prior periods.  However, the following discussion primarily focuses on cash provided by or used in our continuing operations.   Cash (Used in) Provided by Continuing Operating Activities                   We used cash in our operations of  $12.1 million and $8.2 million in 2005 and 2003, respectively.  Cash provided by operatingactivities were $2.0 million in 2004.  The majority of the cash used in operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2003, related to cash utilized in our on-going operations as adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets andliabilities.  The year ended December 31, 2004 had cash provided by operations primarily due to a cash receipt of $7.5 million related to the license agreement we entered into in December 2004.  We received the up-front cash payment but are required todefer and amortize the underlying revenue in our financial statements.  The most significant adjustments to net loss to arrive at cash used in operating activities were:                       •         Non-cash expense related to the issuance of warrants and options to employees, directors and consultants of $11.0 million, $3.8 million and $2.4 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.                       •         In 2005, we recorded a $1.3 million non-cash charge to establish an allowance for a note receivable.                       •         We recorded asset impairments of $1.3 million and $207,000 in 2004 and 2003, respectively.                       •         In 2003, we entered into an exchange transaction whereby we disposed of our interest in Pegasus Technologies, Inc. and as a result we recognized a gain of $3.4 million.      Cash Used in Continuing Investing Activities                   We used cash in investing activities of $50.0 million, $16.3 million and $5.7 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Themajority of the uses of cash relate to the following:                       •         We spent $47.1 million, $12.6 million and $5.0 million on our 750,000-tons per year plant in each of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.                       •         We had capital expenditures related to other purchases of property and equipment of $851,000, $44,000 and $352,000 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively..                       •         We were required to restricted cash to serve as collateral of $1.8 million and $3.4 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, to collateralize other contractual obligations and our asset retirement obligation.      Cash Provided by Continuing Financing Activities                   We received cash from financing activities of $11.5 million, $69.9 million and $32.1 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003,respectively.  The majority of our financing activities related to the exercise of options and warrants and the issuance of common stock in private placements.  We received cash related to the exercise of options and warrants of $11.7 million, $22.6 millionand $14.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  In addition, in 2004 and 2003, we generated cash from the issuance of common stock from private placements of $47.4 million and $18.3 million.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates                   We have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our current and future business operations and the understanding ofour results of operations.  For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies, see the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.  These policies and estimates are considered“critical” because they either had a material impact or they have the potential to have a material impact on our financial statements, and because they require significant judgments, assumptions or estimates.  The preparation of our financialstatements in this annual report on Form 10-K requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect both the results of operations as well as the carrying values of our assets and liabilities.  Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult andsubjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.  We base estimates on historical experience and/or on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the resultsof which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under differentassumptions or conditions, making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the near term.  Set forth below is a summary of our most critical accounting policies.   23     Policies and Estimates Impacting our Current and Future Operations                    Revenue recognition, accounts receivable and allowances.   We recognize revenue from K-Fuel licenses androyalties when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, generally when an agreement has been signed, all significant obligations have been satisfied, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.  Any up-front fees receivedrelated to licenses granted are deferred and recognized over the provision of specific deliverables as defined in the agreement.  As our history related to customer relationships is limited, we may be required to change the estimated period over which weamortize our revenue as more information becomes available.  Arrangements that include multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine whether the elements are separable based on objective evidence.  If the elements are deemed separable, totalconsideration is allocated to each element and the revenue associated with each element is recognized as earned.  If the elements are not deemed separable, total consideration is deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual period or theexpected customer relationship period.  We believe that the accounting estimates related to customer relationship periods and to the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable are “critical accounting estimates” because: (1) theyrequire management to make assumptions about how long we will retain customers, for which we have limited history; (2) the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable can be subjective; and (3) the impact of changes in actual retention periodsversus these estimates on the revenue amounts reported in our consolidated statements of operations could be material.                    Useful lives of our long-lived assets.    Selecting the useful lives of long-lived assets to be depreciated oramortized requires a significant amount of judgment.  As construction of our 750,000-tons per year plant and other anticipated future plants are completed and they are placed into service, our depreciation will increase significantly.  A significant portionof the costs to design and construct our plants relate to technology that has never been used for this application.  As a result, there is no history on which to base the economic life of the equipment and we will be required to make a number of assumptions andestimates in determining the life.                    Valuation of long-lived assets.   The valuation of our long-lived and intangible assets, including our 750,000-tonsper year plant and patents, are significant related to our results of operations and financial condition.  We must assess the realizable value of these assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying valuemay not be recoverable.  In assessing the recoverability of these assets, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets.  In addition, we must make assumptions regardingthe useful lives of these assets.  If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.                    Asset retirement obligations.   We are required to record the fair value of legally required removal costs andretirement obligations as a liability and we also recorded an offsetting asset.  Initially, our asset retirement obligation was recorded at its fair value using an expected cash flow approach, in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflected the range ofpossible outcomes and a credit-adjusted risk-free rate were applied.  The liability is then accreted over time by applying the interest method of allocation at a rate we estimate to be 5.4%.  In determining the initial liability, we must make assumptionsregarding estimated future cash flows and other factors.  In addition, the rate of accretion is based upon our best estimate of the rate at which cost to complete the reclamation will increase.  If these estimates and their related assumptions are incorrector change in the future, we may be required to increase our obligation.   Policies and Estimates Impacting our Past Operations                   Our policy regarding accounting for discontinued operations is significant because of the restated financial statements resulting fromthe disposal of the Pegasus operations.  For purposes of discontinued operations presentation in these Consolidated Financial Statements we have separately identified the assets and liabilities of the Pegasus operations.  Pegasus was previously reported andaccounted for as an operating segment.  The loss from operating Pegasus has been aggregated for reporting purposes into a single line on the Consolidated Statements of Operations called “Loss from discontinued operations” for the ended December 31,2003.  We have made the determination to account for the disposal of these operations as discontinued in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” because (a) it has been determined that theoperations and cash flows of Pegasus were eliminated from our on-going operations in November 2003 and (b) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of Pegasus after the disposal transaction.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements                   In May 2005, the FASB, as part of an effort to conform to international accounting standards, issued SFAS No. 154,“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” which is effective for us beginning on January 1, 2006.  SFAS No. 154 requires that all voluntary changes in accounting principles be retrospectively applied to prior financial statements as ifthat principle had always been used, unless it is impracticable to do so.  When it is impracticable to calculate the effects on all prior periods, SFAS   24     No. 154 requires that the new principle be applied to the earliest period practicable.  The adoption of SFAS No. 154 is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position or results ofoperations.                   In December 2004, the FASB issued  SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payments,” or SFAS 123R.  SFAS 123Rrequires that compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued.  SFAS 123R covers a wide range of share-based compensation arrangementsincluding share options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans.  Effective April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission extended the implementation date to the beginning of aregistrant’s next fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005.  As a result, we will implement SFAS 123R beginning January 1, 2006.  We anticipate that adoption will result in non-cash stock-based compensation expense between $10 million to $12million during 2006 based on the number of unvested stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2005.   ITEM 7A.      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK                   We are not currently subject to a significant level of direct market risk related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,commodity prices or equity prices.  However, as we are commissioning and expect to start commercial production at our 750,000-tons per year plant, we are evaluating our exposure to the commodity risk of natural gas prices.  We are indirectly exposed tofluctuations in fuel commodity prices.  To the extent that fuel prices rise or fall, there may be greater or lesser demand for our K-Fuel production services.  At this time we are unable to fully determine the impact these costs will have on ouroperations.  However, to reduce our exposure to natural gas prices we are planning to install a coal-fired boiler to replace the currently installed natural gas-boiler at our 750,000-tons per year plant.  We own (or hold) no derivative instruments orfloating rate debt and do not expect to derive a material amount of our revenues from such interest bearing securities.  Currently, we have no significant foreign operations.  We were required to establish an irrevocable standby letter of credit in Euros,which will be adjusted to account for the change in foreign currency rates.  As these adjustments are made we will either increase or decrease our restricted cash balance.  At this time we are still evaluating our exposure to these foreign currency rateadjustments.  However, to the extent that we establish significant foreign operations in the future, we may attempt to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates contractually and through the use of hedging activities and other meansconsidered appropriate.  KFx holds no equity market securities, but is subject to equity market risk relative to its own equity securities.
