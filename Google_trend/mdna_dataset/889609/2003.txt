ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The following analysis of the financial condition of the Company should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report. The Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002 include the results of operations of MFN Financial Corporation for the period subsequent to March 8, 2002, the Merger date, through December 31, 2002. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   OVERVIEW   Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") primarily engage in the business of purchasing, selling and servicing retail automobile installment sale contracts ("Contracts") originated by automobile dealers ("Dealers") located throughout the United States. Through its purchase of Contracts, the Company provides indirect financing to Dealer customers with limited credit histories, low incomes or past credit problems, who generally would not be expected to qualify for financing provided by banks or by automobile manufacturers' captive finance companies.   On March 8, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of MFN Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("MFN") and its subsidiaries, by the merger (the "Merger") of CPS Mergersub, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Mergersub") and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of CPS, with and into MFN. In the Merger, MFN became a wholly owned subsidiary of CPS. The Company thus acquired the assets of MFN, consisting principally of interests in automobile installment sales finance Contracts and the facilities for originating and servicing such Contracts. The Merger was accounted for as a purchase. MFN, through its primary operating subsidiary, Mercury Finance Company LLC, was engaged in business substantially similar to that of the Company: purchasing automobile installment sales finance Contracts from Dealers, and securitizing and servicing such Contracts.   The Company historically has generated revenue primarily from the gains recognized on the sale or securitization of its Contracts, servicing fees earned on Contracts sold, and interest earned on Residuals, as defined below, and on finance receivables. In the years ended December 31, 1999 and 2000, the Company did not sell any Contracts in securitization transactions, and therefore recognized no gains on sale from securitization transactions. All sales of Contracts during 1999 were on a servicing released basis, either in the form of bulk sales of Contracts being held by the Company for sale, or as part of a flow through agreement with a third party for which the Company earned fees on a per Contract basis, also known as "the flow purchase program" or "purchases made on a flow basis." During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company entered into another flow through agreement and proceeded to sell nearly all of the Contracts purchased during the year to one or the other third party, for a mark-up above what the Company paid the Dealer. The Company recorded a loss of $22.7 million related to bulk sales in 1999. There were no bulk sales during 2000 or 2001. As a result of the Company's flow through sales during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized gain on sale of Contracts of $5.7 million, $16.6 million and $18.4 million, respectively. One of the two flow purchasers ceased to purchase Contracts in December 2001, and the other has in May 2002. The flow purchase program accordingly ended at that time.                                         18   The Company's securitization structure has generally been as follows:   The Company sells a portfolio of Contracts to a wholly owned Special Purpose Subsidiary ("SPS"), which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the Company's Contracts. The SPS then transfers the same Contracts to an owner trust ("Trust"). The Trust is a qualifying special purpose entity as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 ("SFAS 140"), and is therefore not consolidated in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities (the "Notes"), generally in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal balance of the Contracts. The Company typically sells these Contracts to the Trust at face value and without recourse, except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the Dealer to the Company are provided by the Company to the Trust. One or more investors purchase the Notes issued by the Trust; the proceeds from the sale of the Notes are then used to purchase the Contracts from the Company. The Company may retain subordinated Notes issued by the Trust. The Company purchases a financial guaranty insurance policy, guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest on the senior Notes, from an insurance company (the "Note Insurers"). In addition, the Company provides a credit enhancement for the benefit of the Note Insurers and the investors in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account ("Spread Account") held by the Trust or in the form of subordinated Notes, or both. The agreements governing the securitization transactions (collectively referred to as the "Securitization Agreements") require that the initial deposits to the Spread Accounts be supplemented by a portion of collections from the Contracts until the Spread Accounts reach specified levels, and then maintained at those levels. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related Notes. The specified levels at which the Spread Accounts are to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of Contracts held by the Trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among the Company, the SPS, the Note Insurers and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the portfolios, and have also varied by Securitization Agreement. The Securitization Agreements generally grant the Company the option to repurchase the sold Contracts from the Trust when the aggregate outstanding balance has amortized to 10% or less of the initial aggregate balance.   The Company's continuous securitization structure is similar to the above, except that (i) the SPS that purchases the Contracts pledges the Contracts to secure promissory notes issued directly by the SPS, (ii) the initial purchaser of such notes has the right, but not the obligation, to require that the Company repurchase the Contracts, (iii) the promissory notes are in an aggregate principal amount of not more than 72.5% to 73% of the aggregate principal balance of the Contracts (that is, up to 27.5% over-collateralization), and (iv) no Spread Account is involved. The SPS is a qualifying special purpose entity and is therefore not consolidated in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.   Upon each sale of Contracts in a securitization, whether a term securitization or a continuous securitization, the Company removes from its Consolidated Balance Sheet the Contracts held for sale and adds to its Consolidated Balance Sheet (i) the cash received and (ii) the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that the Company retains in Contracts sold in the securitization. That retained interest (the "Residual") consists of (a) the cash held in the Spread Account, if any, (b) over collateralization, if any, (c) subordinated Notes retained, if any, and (d) receivables from Trust, which include the net interest receivables ("NIRs"). NIRs represent the estimated discounted cash flows to be received from the Trust in the future, net of principal and interest payable with respect to the Notes, and certain expenses. The excess of the cash received and the assets retained by the Company over the carrying value of the Contracts sold, less transaction costs, equals the net gain on sale of Contracts recorded by the Company.   The Company allocates its basis in the Contracts between the Notes and the Residuals sold and retained based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of the sale. The Company recognizes gains or losses attributable to the change in the fair value of the Residuals, which are recorded at estimated fair value. The Company is not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of interests such as the Residuals; accordingly, the Company determines the estimated fair value of the Residuals by discounting the amount and timing of anticipated cash flows that it estimates will be released to the Company in the future (the cash out method), using a discount rate that the Company believes is appropriate for the risks involved. The Company estimates the value of its                                         19   optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the Securitization Agreements primarily based on its estimate of the amount and timing of cash flows that it anticipates will be received from the repurchased receivables following exercise of the optional right. The anticipated cash flows include collections from both current and charged off receivables. The Company has used an effective discount rate of approximately 14% per annum, which it believes is appropriate for the risks involved.   The Company receives periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the Contracts. In addition, the Company is entitled to the cash flows from the Residuals that represent collections on the Contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the Notes, the base servicing fees, and certain other fees (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments are in most cases defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of the Notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related Contracts (excluding those Contracts that have been charged off). Some of the Securitization Agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the Notes is reduced to a specified percentage of the aggregate principal balance of the related Contracts. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create "over-collateralization" of the Notes.   If the amount of cash required for payment of fees, interest and principal exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is drawn from the Spread Account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations, and there is no shortfall in the related Spread Account, the excess is released to the Company, or in certain cases is transferred to other Spread Accounts that may be below their required levels. If the Spread Account balance is not at the required credit enhancement level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the Spread Account until the specified level is achieved. Although Spread Account balances are held by the Trusts on behalf of the Company's SPS as the owner of the Residuals, the cash in the Spread Accounts is restricted from use by the Company. Cash held in the various Spread Accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the Securitization Agreements. The interest rate payable on the Contracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the Notes. As a result, the Residuals described above are a significant asset of the Company. In determining the value of the Residuals, the Company must estimate the future rates of prepayments, delinquencies, defaults and default loss severity, and the value of the Company's optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the Securitization Agreements, as all of these factors affect the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows. The Company estimates prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable Contracts. The Company has used prepayment estimates of approximately 20% to 23% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts. The Company estimates defaults and default loss severity using available historical loss data for comparable Contracts and the specific characteristics of the Contracts purchased by the Company. The Company estimates recovery rates of previously charged off receivables using available historical recovery data and projected future recovery levels. In valuing the Residuals, the Company estimates that gross losses as a percentage of the original principal balance will approximate 13% to 18% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts, with recovery rates approximating 2% to 5% of the original principal balance.   In future periods, the Company will recognize additional revenue from the Residuals if the actual performance of the Contracts is better than the original estimate, or the Company would increase the estimated fair value of the Residuals. If the actual performance of the Contracts were worse than the original estimate, then a downward adjustment to the carrying value of the Residuals would be required.   The Noteholders and the related securitization Trusts have no recourse to the Company for failure of the Contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis. The Company's Residuals, however, are subordinate to the Notes until the Noteholders are fully paid, and the Company is therefore at risk to that extent. See "Critical Accounting Policies."                                         20   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   The Company believes that its accounting policies related to (a) Allowance for Finance Credit Losses, (b) Residual Interest in Securitizations and Gain on Sale of Contracts and (c) Income Taxes could be considered critical. Such policies are described below.   (a) ALLOWANCE FOR FINANCE CREDIT LOSSES   In order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses to be incurred on finance receivables, the Company uses a loss reserving methodology commonly referred to as "static pooling," which stratifies its finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, the Company estimates an allowance for finance credit losses, which management believes is adequate for known and inherent losses in the finance receivable Contract portfolio. Provision for loss is charged to the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. Charge offs are charged to the allowance. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio and the value of the underlying collateral. As conditions change, the Company's level of provisioning and/or allowance may change as well.   (b) RESIDUAL INTEREST IN SECURITIZATIONS AND GAIN ON SALE OF CONTRACTS   Gain on sale may be recognized on the disposition of Contracts either outright or in securitization transactions. In its securitization transactions, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company retains a residual interest in the Contracts that are sold. The Company's securitization transactions include "term" securitizations (purchaser holds the Contracts for substantially their entire term) and "continuous" securitizations (the Contracts sold may be put back to the Company, and subsequently replaced with other Contracts).   The residual interest in term securitizations and the residual interest in the Contracts sold continuously are reflected in the line item "residual interest in securitizations" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. In either case, the residual interest represents the discounted sum of expected future releases from securitization trusts. Accordingly, the valuation of the residual is heavily dependent on estimates of future performance.   The key economic assumptions used in measuring all retained interests remaining as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 are included in the table below. The discount rate remained constant at 14%.                                                         2002              2001                                                 --------------    -------------- Prepayment speed (Cumulative)................   19.8% - 22.9%     22.0% - 27.2% Credit losses (Cumulative)...................   10.0% - 15.4%     12.0% - 17.5%                                         21   Key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those assumptions are as follows:                                                                  DECEMBER 31, 2002                                                                -----------------                                                                   (DOLLARS IN                                                                    THOUSANDS)  Carrying amount/fair value of residual interest in securitizations    $127,170 Weighted average life in years ...................................        3.90  Prepayment Speed Assumption (Cumulative) ......................... 19.8% - 22.9% Estimated fair value assuming 10% adverse change .................    $126,647 Estimated fair value assuming 20% adverse change .................     126,144  Expected Credit Losses (Cumulative) .............................. 10.0% - 15.4% Estimated fair value assuming 10% adverse change .................    $120,302 Estimated fair value assuming 20% adverse change .................     113,424  Residual Cash Flows Discount Rate (Annual) .......................        14.0% Estimated fair value assuming 10% adverse change .................    $124,723 Estimated fair value assuming 20% adverse change .................     122,351   These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on 10% and 20% percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption; in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses), which could magnify or counteract the sensitivities.   (c) INCOME TAXES   The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income and combined state franchise tax returns. The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company has estimated a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax asset whose utilization in future periods is not more than likely.                                         22   In determining the possible realization of deferred tax assets, future taxable income from the following sources are considered: (a) the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (b) future operations exclusive of reversing temporary differences, and (c) tax planning strategies that, if necessary, would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into periods in which net operating losses might otherwise expire.   See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   MFN FINANCIAL CORPORATION ACQUISITION   MFN, through its primary operating subsidiary, Mercury Finance Company LLC, was in the business of purchasing Contracts from Dealers, and securitizing and servicing such Contracts. CPS intends to continue to use the assets acquired in the Merger in the automobile finance business, but a portion of such assets have been disposed of. CPS has ceased to use the acquired assets for the purchase of Contracts, and does not anticipate recommencing such use. In connection with the termination of MFN origination activities and the integration and consolidation of other activities, the Company recognized as a liability its estimate of the costs to exit these activities and terminate the affected employees of MFN. The terminated activities include service departments such as accounting, finance, human resources, information technology, administration, payroll and executive management. The estimated costs include the following:                                                                   MARCH 8,                 DECEMBER 31,                                                                 2002       ACTIVITY       2002 (2)                                                                 ----       --------       --------                                  (IN THOUSANDS)        Severance payments and consulting contracts...........      $     3,215   $   (2,644)  $       571 Facilities closures (1)...............................            2,152         (157)        1,995 Termination of contracts, leases, services        and other obligations..........................              597         (274)          323 Acquisition expenses accrued but unpaid...............              250         (199)           51                                                             -----------   -----------  -----------                 Total liabilities assumed.............      $     6,214   $   (3,274)  $     2,940                                                             ===========   ===========  ===========   - ------------ (1) Activity resulting in a net charge $157,000 includes charges against liability of $1.4 million, and the "reclassification" of an existing accrual for offices closed prior to the Merger Date of approximately $1.2 million. (2) Approximately $2.9 million of remaining accrual is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company at December 31, 2002. The Company believes that this amount provides adequately for anticipated remaining costs related to exiting certain activities of MFN, and that amounts indicated above are reasonably allocated.   Upon effectiveness of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of MFN converted into the right to receive $10.00 per share in cash. The total Merger consideration payable to stockholders of MFN was approximately $99.9 million. The amount of such consideration was agreed to as the result of arms'-length negotiations between CPS and MFN. The aggregate purchase price, including expenses related to the transaction, was approximately $123.2 million.   Acquisition financing was provided to CPS by Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, New York Branch ("WestLB") and Levine Leichtman Capital Partners II, L.P ("LLCP"). CPS obtained acquisition financing from LLCP through its issuance and sale of certain senior secured notes to LLCP in the aggregate principal amount of $35 million.   The Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002 include the results of operations of MFN for the period subsequent to March 8, 2002, the Merger date.                                         23   The Company has recorded certain purchase accounting adjustments recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheet, which are estimates based on available information. In addition, the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes an extraordinary gain related to the excess of net assets acquired over purchase price ("negative goodwill") totaling $17.4 million.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001   REVENUE. During the year ended December 31, 2002, revenues increased $29.9 million, or 48.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. Net gain on sale of Contracts decreased by $16.3 million, from $32.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The primary reason for the decrease in the gain on sale component of revenue is the termination of the Company's flow purchase program in May 2002, offset in part by an increase in the amount of Contracts securitized by the Company in 2002 compared to 2001. The Company securitized $281.2 million of Contracts during the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $141.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2001. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company sold $181.1 million of Contracts on a flow basis compared to $537.9 million of Contracts in the year ended December 31, 2001.   Gain on sale of Contracts also includes the effect of fluctuations in the Company's estimate of the required provision for losses on certain CPS Contracts and recovery of losses on such Contracts. During 2001, recoveries exceeded the provision for losses; in 2002 the provision for losses was greater than recoveries. During 2002, the amount of Contracts for which the Company recorded a provision for Contract losses has increased, requiring the Company to provide for losses on such Contracts in an amount exceeding related recoveries. For the year ended December 31, 2002 the Company recorded a $2.6 million provision for Contract losses, compared to a reduction of the provision for Contract losses of $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Also during 2002, as a result of revised Company estimates resulting from analyses of the current and historical performance of certain of the Company's securitized pools, the Company recorded a reduction to gain on sale of approximately $2.0 million.   Interest income increased $31.4 million to $48.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2002, from $17.2 million in the prior year. The increase in interest income is primarily due to the expansion of the Company's servicing portfolio, primarily as a result of the MFN Merger, as well as the addition of Contracts to the CPS portfolio and the related increase in the Company's residual interest in securitizations as a result of the increased level of securitizations. As of December 31, 2002, the servicing portfolio, net of unearned income on pre-computed Contracts, was $595.2 million, compared to $285.5 million as of December 31, 2001.   Servicing fees increased by $4.0 million, or 37.1%, to $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, from $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Servicing fees are composed of base fees, which are payable at the rate of 2.5% per annum on the principal balance of the outstanding CPS Contracts (5.0% on MFN Contracts) in the related Trusts, plus any other fees collected by the Company, such as late fees and returned check fees. The increase in servicing fees is primarily due to the increase in the Company's servicing portfolio.   EXPENSES. During the year ended December 31, 2002, operating expenses increased by $30.2 million, or 49.0%, to $91.9 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2001 operating expenses of $61.7 million. The Company's operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and other operating expenses, which are incurred as applications and Contracts are received, processed and                                          24   serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, and mix of business between Contracts purchased on a flow basis and Contracts purchased on an other than flow basis. The overall increase in expenses is primarily attributable to the MFN Merger. Personnel costs increased $13.8 million, or 57.4%, to $37.8 million in 2002 from $24.0 million in 2001. Personnel costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding warrants and stock options, and are the Company's most significant operating expenses, representing approximately 41.1% of 2002 operating expenses. These costs generally fluctuate with the level of applications and Contracts processed and serviced, with the mix of revenue and with overall portfolio performance. Other material operating expenses include facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services (including personnel costs associated with information technology support), professional services, marketing and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization.   In connection with the termination of MFN origination activities and the integration and consolidation of certain activities (see above), the Company has recognized certain liabilities related to the costs to exit these activities and terminate the affected employees of MFN. These activities include service departments such as accounting, finance, human resources, information technology, administration, payroll and executive management. Such exit and termination costs have been charged against these liabilities and are not reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations.   General and administrative expenses increased by $7.5 million, or 59.2%, and represented 21.9% of total operating expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the MFN Merger and an increase in costs associated with servicing the Company's expanded portfolio. Also included in 2002 general and administrative expenses is $669,000 related to the write off a related party receivable from CARSUSA, Inc. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Interest expense increased by $9.6 million, or 66.9%, and represented 26.0% of total operating expenses. The increase is due to the interest expense resulting from the MFN acquisition, including interest expense related to acquisition debt and the interest expense related to the Notes Payable to Securitization Trust. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources."   Marketing expenses decreased by $1.6 million, or 25.0%, and represented 5.3% of total operating expenses. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in Contracts purchased during the year ended December 31, 2002.   Occupancy expenses increased by $860,000, or 27.2%, and represented 4.4% of total operating expenses. The increase is primarily due to the addition of facilities acquired in the MFN Merger.   Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $119,000, or 11.7%, and represented 1.2% of total operating expenses.   The results for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, include net income of $116,732 and $161,710, respectively, from the Company's subsidiary CPS Leasing, Inc.   Income tax benefit of $2.9 million, including the elimination of the valuation allowance of $3.2 million, was recorded in the 2002 period pursuant to relevant tax statutes and regulations. The Company's provision for income taxes was zero for the year ended December 31, 2001.                                         25   THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000   REVENUE. During the year ended December 31, 2001, revenues increased $26.1 million, or 72.5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. Net gain on sale of Contracts increased by $16.5 million, from $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $32.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The primary reason for the increase in the gain on sale component of revenue is the Company's securitization of approximately $141.7 million of Contracts in the 2001 period, resulting in a gain on sale of Contracts of $9.2 million. The availability and structure of the Company's note purchase facility enabled it to execute securitization sales during 2001; no such sales occurred in the prior year. In addition, the Company completed a term securitization in September 2001. Substantially all of the proceeds from the September 2001 transaction were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the Company's floating rate variable note purchase facility. Additionally, gain on sale of Contracts includes the effect of fluctuations in the Company's estimate of the required provision for losses on Contracts and in recoveries of losses on Contracts. During 2001, recoveries exceeded the provision for losses; in 2000 the provision for losses was greater than recoveries. The Company makes recoveries on Contracts previously held on balance sheet or from pools for which the Company has exercised its optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the Securitization Agreements. The amount of Contracts for which the Company requires a provision for Contract losses has contracted, while the amount recovered increased. As such the Company is able to recover its provision for Contract losses. For the year ended December 31, 2001 the Company recorded a reduction of the provision for Contract losses of $5.7 million, compared to a charge of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.   During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company sold $537.9 million of Contracts on a flow basis compared to $600.4 million of Contracts in the year ended December 31, 2000. The Company's flow purchase program ended in May 2002.   Interest income increased $13.7 million to $17.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2001, from $3.5 million in the prior year. The increase in interest income is primarily due to the increase in residual interest income resulting from a change in the method residual interest income was calculated beginning in the second quarter of 2000. The increase in residual interest income is due to the Company refining its methodology of calculation of such interest income beginning with the three-month period ended June 30, 2000. The refined method is designed to accrete residual interest income on a level yield basis. The Company now uses an accretion rate that approximates the discount rate used to value the residual interest in securitizations, approximately 14% per annum. Prior to such period, the Company recognized residual interest income as the excess cash flows generated by the Trusts over the related obligations of the Trusts, net of any amortization of the related NIRs. This prior method of residual interest income recognition had approximated a level yield rate of residual interest income due to the continued addition of new securitizations. Since the Company had not securitized any Contracts since December 1998, this prior method would not have reflected the appropriate level yield and thus was refined during the second quarter of 2000. The effect of this refinement has been offset, in part, by the contraction of the Company's servicing portfolio.   Servicing fees decreased by $5.2 million, or 32.7%, to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, from $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Servicing fees are composed of base fees, which are payable at the rate of 2% to 2.5% per annum on the principal balance of the outstanding Contracts in the related Trusts, plus any other fees collected by the Company, such as late fees and returned check fees. The decrease in servicing fees is primarily due to the decrease in the Company's servicing portfolio. As of December 31, 2001, the servicing portfolio, net of unearned income on pre-computed Contracts, was $285.5 million, compared to $411.9 million as of December 31, 2000.                                         26   EXPENSES. During the year ended December 31, 2001, operating expenses decreased by $6.7 million, or 9.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. Personnel costs were effectively flat year over year, decreasing $640,000, or 2.6%, to $24.0 million in 2001 from $24.6 million in 2000. Personnel costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding warrants and stock options, and are the Company's most significant operating expenses, representing approximately 38.9% of total operating expenses. These costs generally fluctuate with the level of applications and Contracts processed and serviced, with the mix of revenue and with overall portfolio performance. Other material operating expenses include facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services (including personnel costs associated with information technology support), professional services, marketing and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization. General and administrative expenses decreased by $3.1 million, or 19.8%, and represented 20.5% of total operating expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the decrease in costs associated with servicing the Company's diminished portfolio.   Interest expense decreased by $2.9 million, or 16.9%, and represented 23.2% of total operating expenses. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the reductions in non-warehouse indebtedness from the prior year. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources."   Marketing expenses increased by $399,000, or 6.5%, and represented 10.6% of total operating expenses. The increase is primarily due to the increase in Contracts purchased during the year ended December 31, 2001.   Occupancy expenses decreased by $241,000, or 7.1%, and represented 5.1% of total operating expenses. The decrease is primarily due to additional property taxes paid during 2000, not due in 2001. In November 1998, the Company moved its headquarters to a new 115,000 square foot facility. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $142,000, or 12.2%, and represented 1.7% of total operating expenses.   The results for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, include net earnings of $161,710 and $19,816, respectively, from the Company's subsidiary CPS Leasing, Inc. The increase in net income of CPS Leasing, Inc. is primarily attributable to the decision to cease lease receivable origination and to simply service the existing receivables, resulting in significant expense reductions.   The results for the year ended December 31, 2000, include net operating losses of $755,000 from the Company's investment in 38% of NAB Asset Corp.   The Company's effective tax rate was zero and 31.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   LIQUIDITY   The Company's business requires substantial cash to support its purchases of Contracts and other operating activities. The Company's primary sources of cash have been cash flows from operating activities, including proceeds from sales of Contracts, amounts borrowed under various revolving credit facilities (also sometimes known as warehouse credit facilities), servicing fees on portfolios of Contracts previously sold, customer payments of principal and interest on Contracts held for sale, fees for origination of Contracts, and releases of cash                                          27   from credit enhancements provided by the Company for the financial guaranty insurers (Note Insurers) and Investors, initially made in the form of a cash deposit to an account (Spread Account), and releases of cash from securitized pools of Contracts in which the Company has retained a residual ownership interest. The Company's primary uses of cash have been the purchases of Contracts, repayment of amounts borrowed under lines of credit and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses, the establishment of and further contributions to "Spread Accounts" (cash posted to enhance credit of securitized pools), and income taxes. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from Spread Accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in the Company's servicing portfolio, and the terms upon which the Company is able to acquire, sell, and borrow against Contracts.   Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, was $146.9 million, $3.7 million and $38.7 million, respectively. Cash from operating activities is generally provided by the net releases from the Company's securitization Trusts and from the amortization and liquidation of Contracts. Such amortization and liquidation of Contracts increased in 2002 compared to prior years as a result of the MFN Merger and the addition of Contracts to the CPS servicing portfolio and related increase in securitization transactions. On March 8, 2002, the Company completed the MFN Merger (See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.). The acquisition cost was approximately $123.2 million, and was substantially funded by existing cash and borrowings. Cash flows from the underlying purchased assets are expected to provide adequate liquidity to fund the acquisition borrowings, as well as generate positive cash flows from which to fund the Company's operating activities.   Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, was $29.8 million, $536,000 and $623,000, respectively. Cash used in the acquisition of MFN Financial Corporation, net of the cash acquired in the transaction, totaled $29.5 million.   Net cash used in financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, was $86.8 million, $19.7 million and $20.4 million, respectively. In connection with the acquisition of MFN Financial Corporation the Company incurred debt related to the MFN 2001-A Securitization Trust (See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) and additional senior secured debt (See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.). Cash used in financing activities is primarily attributable to the repayment of outstanding debt. In connection with the MFN Merger the amount of outstanding debt, securitization trust debt and senior secured debt, and the required repayment thereof, increased compared to prior years.   The Company believes that cash flows generated as a result of the acquisition of MFN Financial Corporation will be sufficient to meet the obligations incurred as a result of the Merger. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet such cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of the securitized pools. At the time of the Merger, MFN had outstanding $22.5 million in principal amount of senior subordinated debt, which was due and repaid in full on March 23, 2002. Such debt bore interest at the rate of 11.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears.   Contracts are purchased from Dealers for a cash price approximating their principal amount, and generate cash flow over a period of years. As a result, the Company has been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase Contracts, and on the availability of cash from outside sources in order to finance its continuing operations, as well as to fund the portion of Contract purchase prices not financed under warehouse credit facilities. During 2001 and through May 2002, the Company's Contract purchasing program consisted of both (i) purchases for the Company's own account made on other than a flow basis,                                          28   funded primarily by advances under a revolving warehouse credit facility, and (ii) flow purchases for immediate resale to non-affiliates. Flow purchases allowed the Company to purchase Contracts with minimal demands on liquidity. The Company's revenues from the resale of flow purchase Contracts, however, were materially less than those that may be received by holding Contracts to maturity or by selling Contracts in securitization transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company purchased $181.1 million of Contracts on a flow basis, and $282.2 million on an other than flow basis for its own account, compared to $537.9 million and $134.4 million, respectively, of Contracts purchased in 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company purchased $600.4 million of Contracts on a flow basis and $31.1 million on an other than flow basis. The Company's flow purchase program ended in May 2002.   During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company purchased Contracts to for resale into securitization transactions. The Company did not sell Contracts in a securitization transaction during 2000 or 1999; however, since November 2000, the Company has been able to purchase Contracts for its own account, which are generally resold into a term securitization transaction, using proceeds from two warehouse lines of credit. These warehouse lines of credit consist of a $125 million floating rate variable funding note facility, and a $75 million floating rate variable funding note facility. These facilities are independent of each other, and are funded and insured by different institutions. Approximately 73.0% and 72.5%, respectively, of the principal balance of Contracts may be advanced to the Company under these facilities, subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants.   The $125 million warehouse facility is structured to allow CPS to fund a portion of the purchase price of Contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by CPS Warehouse Trust. This facility was established in March 7, 2002, in the maximum amount of $100 million. Such maximum amount was increased to $125 million in November 2002. Approximately 73% of the principal balance of Contracts may be advanced to the Company under this facility, subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants. Notes under this facility bear interest at a rate of one-month Commercial Paper plus 1.18% per annum. This facility was renewed on March 6, 2003.   The $75 million warehouse facility is structured to allow CPS to fund a portion of the purchase price of Contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by CPS Funding LLC. Approximately 72.5% of the principal balance of Contracts may be advanced to the Company under this facility subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants, notes under this facility bear interest at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus 0.60% per annum.   These facilities are independent of each other, and are funded and insured by different institutions. Sales of Contracts to the facility-related special purpose subsidiaries ("SPS") are treated as ongoing securitizations. The Company, therefore, removes the securitized Contracts and related debt from its Consolidated Balance Sheet and recognizes a gain on sale in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company securitized $281.2 million of Contracts during the year ending December 31, 2002, resulting in a gain on sale of $16.9 million, compared to $141.7 million of Contracts securitized during the year ending December 31, 2001, resulting in a gain on sale of $9.2 million. The Company completed a $68.5 million term securitization (through its subsidiary, CPS Receivables Corp.) on September 7, 2001, retaining a residual interest therein. In a private placement, qualified institutional buyers purchased notes backed by automotive receivables. The notes, issued by CPS Auto Receivables Trust 2001-A, consist of two classes: $44.5 million of 4.37% Class A-1 Notes, and $24.0 million of 5.28% Class A-2 Notes. The Company completed an additional securitization (through its subsidiary, CPS Receivables Corp.) on March 8, 2002, retaining a residual interest therein. In that transaction, $45.65 million of notes backed by automotive receivables were issued in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers by CPS Auto Receivables Trust 2002-A. The notes                                          29   consist of two classes: $26.5 million of 3.741% Class A-1 Notes, and $19.15 million of 4.814% Class A-2 Notes. In both transactions, the Class A-1 and A-2 Notes, rated AAA/Aaa by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, were priced at par. Substantially all of the proceeds from the September 2001 and the March 2002 transaction were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the CPS Funding LLC floating rate variable note purchase facility.   On August 22, 2002, CPS (through its subsidiary, CPS Receivables Two Corp.) sold Contracts to CPS Auto Receivables Trust 2002-B in a private placement securitization transaction, retaining a residual interest therein. In this transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $130.48 million of notes backed by automotive Contracts that were originated by Consumer Portfolio Services. The Notes, issued by CPS Auto Receivables Trust 2002-B, consist of two classes: $50.24 million of 2.00% Class A-1 Notes, and $80.24 million of 3.50% Class A-2 Notes. CPS completed another securitization (through its subsidiary, CPS Receivables Two Corp.) on December 19, 2002, by selling automobile installment sales finance Contracts to CPS Auto Receivables Trust 2002-C in a private placement securitization transaction, retaining a residual interest therein. In this transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $99.30 million of notes backed by automotive Contracts that were originated by Consumer Portfolio Services. The Notes, issued by CPS Auto Receivables Trust 2002-C, consist of two classes: $30.78 million of 1.90% Class A-1 Notes, and $68.52 million of 3.52% Class A-2 Notes. In both the CPS Warehouse Trust transactions, the Class A-1, rated A1+/Prime-1 by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, and A-2 Notes, rated AAA/Aaa, were priced at par. The proceeds from the August 2002 and the December 2002 transaction were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the CPS Warehouse Trust floating rate variable note purchase facility and for general corporate purposes.   The Company previously purchased Contracts on a flow basis, which, as compared with purchases of Contracts for the Company's own account, involved a materially reduced demand on the Company's cash. The Company's plan for meeting its liquidity needs is to match its levels of Contract purchases to its availability of cash.   Cash used for subsequent deposits to Spread Accounts for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, was $24.2 million, $24.6 million and $15.0 million, respectively. Cash released from Spread Accounts to the Company for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, was $60.4 million, $43.7 million and $80.6 million, respectively. Changes in deposits to and releases from Spread Accounts are affected by the relative size, seasoning and performance of the various pools of Contracts sold that make up the Company's servicing portfolio to which the respective Spread Accounts are related. During the year ended December 31, 2002 the Company made initial deposits to the related Spread Accounts of $16.7 million related to its term securitization transactions, compared to $2.5 million in the 2001 period. No such initial deposits were made in 2000, as there were no securitizations during that year. The acquisition of Contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions, and the need to fund Spread Accounts when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the Company's Contract purchases (other than flow purchases), the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established Spread Accounts either release cash to the Company or capture cash from collections on sold Contracts. The Company is currently limited in its ability to purchase Contracts due to certain liquidity constraints. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had cash on hand of $32.9 million and available Contract purchase commitments from its warehouse credit facilities of $53.2 million. The Company received an additional Contract purchase commitment from its CPS Funding LLC warehouse credit facility of $75 million upon closing in January 2003. The Company's plans to manage the need for liquidity include the completion of additional term securitizations that would provide additional credit availability from the warehouse credit facilities, and matching its levels of Contract purchases to its availability of cash. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete the term securitizations on favorable economic terms or that the Company will be able to complete term securitizations at all. If the Company is unable to complete such securitizations, servicing fees and other portfolio related income would decrease.                                         30   The Company's ability to adjust the quantity of Contracts that it purchases and sells will be subject to general competitive conditions and the continued availability of the floating rate variable note purchase facilities. There can be no assurance that the desired level of Contract acquisition can be maintained or increased. Obtaining releases of cash from the Spread Accounts is dependent on collections from the related Trusts generating sufficient cash to maintain the Spread Accounts in excess of the amended specified levels. There can be no assurance that collections from the related Trusts will generate cash in excess of the amended specified levels.   Certain of the Company's securitization transactions and the CPS Warehouse Trust floating rate variable note purchase facility contain various covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of the date of this report.   CREDIT FACILITIES   The terms on which credit has been available to the Company for purchase of Contracts have varied over the three-year period ended December 31, 2002, as shown in the following recapitulation:   In November 2000, the Company (through its subsidiary CPS Funding LLC) entered into a floating rate variable note purchase facility under which up to $75 million of notes may be outstanding at any time subject to collateral tests and other conditions. The Company uses funds derived from this facility to purchase Contracts, which are pledged to secure the notes. The collateral tests and other conditions generally allow the Company to borrow up to approximately 72.5% of the price paid for such Contracts. Notes issued under this facility bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum. The balance of notes outstanding related to this facility at December 31, 2001 was zero. This facility was renewed and restated in January 2003.   Additionally, in March 2002, the Company (through its subsidiary CPS Warehouse Trust) entered in to a second floating rate variable note purchase facility, under which up to $125.0 million of notes may be outstanding at any time, subject to collateral tests and other conditions. The Company uses funds derived from this facility to purchase Contracts, which are pledge to secure the notes. The collateral tests and other conditions generally allow the Company to borrow up to approximately 73% of the price paid for such Contracts. Notes issued under this facility bear interest at commercial paper plus 1.18% per annum. The balance of notes outstanding related to this facility at December 31, 2002 was $71.8 million. This facility was renewed on March 6, 2003.   CAPITAL RESOURCES   Prior to 1999, and again in 2001 and 2002, the Company has funded increases in its servicing portfolio through off balance sheet securitization transactions, as discussed above, and funded its other capital needs with cash from operations and with the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and/or equity.   The acquisition of Contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions, and the need to fund Spread Accounts when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the Company's Contract purchases (other than purchases made on a flow basis), the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the Spread Accounts either release cash to the Company or capture cash from collections on sold Contracts. The Company plans to adjust its levels of Contract purchases so as to match anticipated releases of cash from Spread Accounts with its capital requirements.                                         31   CAPITALIZATION   Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2002, the Company has managed its capitalization by issuing and restructuring debt and issuing/purchasing common stock and equivalents, as summarized in the following table:                                                                        YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                                              --------------------------------------                                                                  2002          2001         2000                                                              -----------   -----------  -----------                                                                          (IN THOUSANDS)        Securitization trust debt: Beginning balance.........................................   $       --    $       --   $       --  Assumption in connection with MFN Merger.................      156,923            --           --   Payments................................................

The following review of the terms of such issuances of debt and equity shows that the Company's cost of capital was relatively consistent between 2000 and 2002. There were no material issuances in 2001.   In March 2000, the Company and Levine Leichtman Capital Partners II, L.P. ("LLCP") restructured the outstanding indebtedness of the Company in favor of LLCP, which had been in default. In the restructuring (i) all existing defaults were waived or cured, (ii) LLCP lent an additional $16 million ("Term A") to the Company, (iii) the proceeds of that loan (net of fees and expenses) were used to repay all of the Company's outstanding senior secured indebtedness, (iv) the outstanding $30 million of subordinated indebtedness in favor of LLCP was exchanged for senior indebtedness ("Term B"), (v) the Company granted a blanket security interest in favor of LLCP, to secure both Term A and Term B, and (vi) LLCP released Stanwich Financial Services Corp. ("SFSC"), an affiliate of the then Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors (Mr. Charles E. Bradley, Sr.), and its affiliates (including Mr. Bradley, Sr., Mr. Bradley, Jr., and Mr. Poole, directors of the Company) of any liability for failure to invest $15 million in the Company. Term A has been repaid in accordance with its terms; Term B is due November 2003, and bears interest at 14.50% per annum. In each case the interest                                          32   rate is subject to increase by 2.0% in the event of a default by the Company. In the restructuring, the Company paid a fee of $325,000, paid accrued default interest of $300,000, issued 103,500 shares of common stock to LLCP, and paid out-of-pocket expenses of approximately $214,000. The shares of common stock issued were valued at approximately $155,000, were included in deferred interest expense, and are being amortized over the life of the related debt. The terms of the transaction were determined by negotiation between the Company and LLCP. Approximately $21.8 million related to Term B remains outstanding at December 31, 2002.   Also in March 2000, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the issuance of 103,500 shares of the Company's common stock to SFSC in conjunction with the $1.5 million of promissory note issued by the Company to SFSC in August and September 1999. The shares of common stock issued were valued at approximately $155,000 were included in deferred interest expense, and are being amortized over the life of the related debt.   During the first quarter of 2001, the Company purchased a total of $8,000,000 of outstanding indebtedness held by LLCP and SFSC. The Company purchased and retired $4,000,000 of subordinated debt held by SFSC in exchange for payment of $3,920,000, and purchased and retired $4,000,000 of senior secured debt held by LLCP in exchange for payment of $4,200,000. The LLCP debt by its terms called for a prepayment penalty of 3% (or $120,000); the additional 2% (or $80,000) paid in connection with its February 2001 prepayment was absorbed by SFSC.   In March 2002, the Company and LLCP entered into an additional series of agreements under which LLCP provided additional funding to enable the Company to acquire MFN Financial Corporation. Under the March 2002 agreements, the Company borrowed $35 million from LLCP as a Bridge Note (Bridge Note) and approximately $8.5 million ("Term C") on a deemed principal amount of approximately $11.2 million. The Bridge Note requires principal payments of $2.0 million a month, which began in June 2002, with a final balloon payment in the amount of $17.0 million, which was made pursuant to the terms of the Bridge Note in February 2003. The Term C Note repayment schedule is based on the performance of a certain securitized pool. As the subordinated Note of the pool is repaid from the Trust, principal payments are due on the Term C Note. The maturity date of the Term C Note is March 2008. Interest is due monthly on the Bridge Note at a rate of 13.5% per annum and on the Term C Note at a rate of 12.0% per annum. In connection with the March 2002 agreements and the acquisition of MFN, the Company paid LLCP a structuring fee of $1.75 million and an investment banking fee of $1.0 million, and paid LLCP's out-of-pocket expenses of approximately $315,000. In addition, the Company paid LLCP certain other fees and interest amounting to $426,181. Approximately $1.4 million of the fees and other amounts paid to LLCP were deferred as financing costs and are being amortized over the life of the related debt. The remaining fees and other costs were included in the purchase price of MFN. At December 31, 2002, there was $21.0 million and $7.3 million principal outstanding on the Bridge Note and Term C, respectively.   At the time of the Merger, MFN had outstanding $22.5 million in principal amount of senior subordinated debt, which was due and repaid in full on March 23, 2002. Such debt bore interest at the rate of 11.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears.   LLCP holds approximately 22.2% of the Company's outstanding common shares. SFSC is an affiliate of the Company's former Chairman, Charles E. Bradley, Sr., and SFSC and Mr. Bradley, Sr. together hold approximately 14.6% of the Company's outstanding common shares.   The Company must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that the Company maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend                                          33   restrictions. The Company is in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of December 31, 2002. Such covenants relate primarily to financial reporting requirements, restricted payments and the Company's debt coverage ratio as defined in the various debt agreements.   In July 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $5,000,000 of outstanding debt and equity securities of the Company, inclusive of the mandatory annual purchase or redemption of $1,000,000 of the Company's outstanding "RISRS" subordinated debt securities, due 2006. In October 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional $5,000,000 of outstanding debt or equity securities. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had purchased $3.0 million in principal amount of the RISRS, and $2.6 million of its common stock, representing 1,592,611 shares.   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   This report on Form 10-K includes certain "forward-looking statements," including, without limitation, the statements or implications to the effect that (i) gross losses as a percentage of original balances will approximate 13% to 18% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts, with recovery rates approximating 2% to 5% of original principal balances, (ii) that the Company believes it will achieve operating expense savings or synergies in connection with the Merger, and (iii) that management anticipates that the Company will earn taxable income during the current year. Other forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "estimates," or words of like meaning. As to the specifically identified forward-looking statements, factors that could affect gross losses and recovery rates include changes in the general economic climate, which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of Contracts, changes in laws respecting consumer finance, which could affect the ability of the Company to enforce rights under Contracts, and changes in the market for used vehicles, which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles. Factors that could affect operating expense savings include the ability of Company staff to perform tasks previously performed by others, and the real estate markets in regions in which the Company may close facilities. Factors that could affect the Company's revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools of Contracts, which would affect the Company's ability to purchase Contracts, the terms on which the Company is able to finance such purchases, the willingness of Dealers to sell Contracts to the Company on the terms that it offers, and the terms on which the Company is able to sell Contracts once acquired. Factors that could affect the Company's expenses in the current year include those that affect its ability to achieve expense savings, identified above, competitive conditions in the market for qualified personnel, and interest rates (which affect the rates that the Company pays on Notes issued in its securitizations).   Additional risk factors, any of which could have a material effect on the Company's performance, are set forth below:   DEPENDENCE ON WAREHOUSE FINANCING. The Company's primary source of day-to-day liquidity is continuous securitization of Contracts, under which it sells Contracts to a special-purpose subsidiary as often as once a week. Such transactions function as a "warehouse," in which Contracts are held pending their future sale into a term securitization. The Company expects to continue to effect similar transactions (or to obtain replacement or additional financing) as current arrangements expire or become fully utilized; however, there can be no assurance that such financing will be obtainable on favorable terms. To the extent that the Company is unable to maintain its existing structure or is unable to arrange new warehouse facilities, the Company may have to curtail Contract purchasing activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.   DEPENDENCE ON SECURITIZATION PROGRAM. The Company is dependent upon its ability to continue to pool and sell Contracts in term securitizations in order to generate cash proceeds for new purchases. Adverse changes in the market for securitized Contract pools, or a substantial lengthening of the warehousing period, would burden the Company's financing capabilities, could require the Company to curtail its purchase of Contracts, and could have a material adverse                                          34   effect on the Company. In addition, as a means of reducing the percentage of cash collateral that the Company would otherwise be required to deposit and maintain in Spread Accounts, all of the Company's securitizations since June 1994 have utilized credit enhancement in the form of financial guaranty insurance policies issued by monoline financial guaranty insurers. The Company believes that financial guaranty insurance policies reduce the costs of securitizations relative to alternative forms of credit enhancements available to the Company. No insurer is required to insure Company-sponsored securitizations and there can be no assurance that any will continue to do so. Similarly, there can be no assurance that any securitization transaction will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. The timing of any securitization transaction is affected by a number of factors beyond the Company's control, any of which could cause substantial delays, including, without limitation, market conditions and the approval by all parties of the terms of the securitization.   RISK OF GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. The Company's business is directly related to sales of new and used automobiles, which are affected by employment rates, prevailing interest rates and other domestic economic conditions. Delinquencies, foreclosures and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Because of the Company's focus on Sub-Prime Customers, the actual rates of delinquencies, repossessions and losses on such Contracts could be higher under adverse economic conditions than those experienced in the automobile finance industry in general. Any sustained period of economic slowdown or recession could adversely affect the Company's ability to sell or securitize pools of Contracts. The timing of any economic changes is uncertain, and sluggish sales of automobiles and weakness in the economy could have an adverse effect on the Company's business and that of the Dealers from which it purchases Contracts.   DEPENDENCE ON PERFORMANCE OF SOLD CONTRACTS. Under the financial structures the Company has used to date in its term securitizations, certain excess servicing cash flows generated by the Contracts sold in the term securitizations are retained in a Spread Account within the securitization trusts to provide liquidity and credit enhancement. While the specific terms and mechanics of the Spread Account vary among transactions, the Company's Securitization Agreements generally provide that the Company will receive excess cash flows only if the Spread Account balances have reached specified levels and/or the delinquency or losses related to the Contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies and losses on the Contracts exceed such levels, the terms of the securitization may require increased Spread Account balances to be accumulated for the particular pool; may restrict the distribution to the Company of excess cash flows associated with other pools; or, in certain circumstances, may permit the insurers to require the transfer of servicing on some or all of the Contracts to another servicer. Any of these conditions could materially adversely affect the Company's liquidity and financial condition.   CREDITWORTHINESS OF CONSUMERS. The Company specializes in the purchase, sale and servicing of Contracts to finance automobile purchases by Sub-Prime Customers, which entail a higher risk of non-performance, higher delinquencies and higher losses than Contracts with more creditworthy customers. While the Company believes that the underwriting criteria and collection methods it employs enable it to control the higher risks inherent in Contracts with Sub-Prime Customers, no assurance can be given that such criteria and methods will afford adequate protection against such risks. The Company has experienced fluctuations in the delinquency and charge-off performance of its Contracts. In the event that portfolios of Contracts sold and serviced by the Company experience greater defaults, higher delinquencies or higher losses than anticipated, the Company's income could be negatively affected. A larger number of defaults than anticipated could also result in adverse changes in the structure of the Company's future securitization transactions, such as a requirement of increased cash collateral in such transactions.   POSSIBLE INCREASE IN COST OF FUNDS. The Company's profitability is determined by, among other things, the difference between the rate of interest charged on the Contracts purchased by the Company and the rate of interest payable to purchasers of Notes issued in securitizations. The Contracts purchased by the Company generally bear finance charges close to or at the maximum permitted by                                          35   applicable state law. The interest rates payable on such Notes the Company are fixed, based on interest rates prevailing in the market at the time of sale. Consequently, increases in market interest rates tend to reduce the "spread" or margin between Contract finance charges and the interest rates required by investors and, thus, the potential operating profits to the Company from the purchase, sale and servicing of Contracts. Operating profits expected to be earned by the Company on portfolios of Contracts previously sold are insulated from the adverse effects of increasing interest rates because the interest rates on the related Notes were fixed at the time the Contracts were sold. Any future increases in interest rates would likely increase the interest rates on Notes issued in future term securitizations and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.   PREPAYMENT AND DEFAULT RISK. Gains from the sale of Contracts in the Company's past securitization transactions have constituted a significant portion of the net income of the Company and are likely to continue to represent a significant portion of the Company's net income. A portion of the gains is based in part on management's estimates of future prepayment and default rates and other considerations in light of then-current conditions. If actual prepayments with respect to Contracts occur more quickly than was projected at the time such Contracts were sold, as can occur when interest rates decline, or if default rates are greater than projected at the time such Contracts were sold, a charge to income may be required and would be taken in the period of adjustment. If actual prepayments occur more slowly or if default rates are lower than estimated with respect to Contracts sold, total revenue would exceed previously estimated amounts.   COMPETITION. The automobile financing business is highly competitive. The Company competes with a number of national, local and regional finance companies. In addition, competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as commercial banks, savings and loan associations, leasing companies, credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers such as General Motors Acceptance Corporation, Ford Motor Credit Corporation, Chrysler Financial Corporation and Nissan Motors Acceptance Corporation. Many of the Company's competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, marketing, technical, personnel and other resources than the Company. Moreover, the Company's future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of its capital relative to that of its competitors. The Company's competitors and potential competitors include far larger, more established companies that have access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade rated debt instruments, and to other funding sources which may be unavailable to the Company. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with Dealers and may provide other financing to Dealers, including floor plan financing for the Dealers' purchases of automobiles from manufacturers, which is not offered by the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to compete successfully.   LITIGATION. Because of the consumer-oriented nature of the industry in which the Company operates and the application of certain laws and regulations, industry participants are regularly named as defendants in class-action litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations and consumer law torts, including fraud. Many of these actions involve alleged violations of consumer protection laws. Although the Company is not involved in any material litigation, a significant judgment against the Company or within the industry in connection with any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.   DEPENDENCE ON DEALERS. The Company is dependent upon establishing and maintaining relationships with unaffiliated Dealers to supply it with Contracts. During the year ended December 31, 2002, no Dealer accounted for more than 1.0% of the Contracts purchased by the Company. The Dealer Agreements do not require Dealers to submit a minimum number of Contracts for purchase by the Company. The failure of Dealers to submit Contracts that meet the Company's underwriting criteria would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.                                         36   GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. The Company's business is subject to numerous federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, which, among other things: (i) require the Company to obtain and maintain certain licenses and qualifications; (ii) limit the interest rates, fees and other charges the Company is allowed to charge; (iii) limit or prescribe certain other terms of its Contracts; (iv) require the Company to provide specified disclosures; and (v) regulate certain servicing and collection practices and define its rights to repossess and sell collateral. An adverse change in existing laws or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof, the promulgation of any additional laws or regulations, or the failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   The Company will adopt in future periods new accounting pronouncements. For information on how adoption has affected and will affect the Financial Statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  INTEREST RATE RISK   Although the Company utilized its floating rate variable note purchase facility and completed term securitizations during the year ended December 31, 2002, the structures did not lend themselves to some of the strategies the Company has used in the past to minimize interest rate risk, as described below. Specifically, the rate on the Notes issued by the floating rate variable note purchase facility is adjustable and there is no pre-funding component to the floating rate variable note purchase facility or term securitization. The Company does intend to issue fixed rate Notes and to include pre-funding structures for future term securitization transactions, whereby the amount of asset-backed securities issued exceeds the amount of Contracts initially sold to the Trusts. In pre-funding, the proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until the Company sells the additional Contracts to the Trust in amounts up to the balance of the pre-funded escrow account. In pre-funded securitizations, the Company locks in the borrowing costs with respect to the Contracts it subsequently delivers to the Trust. However, the Company incurs an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of Contracts and the interest rate paid on the asset-backed securities outstanding, the amount as to which there can be no assurance. In addition, the Contracts the Company does purchase and securitize have fixed rates of interest, whereas the Company's interest expense related to the current note purchase facility is based on a variable rate. Historically, the Company's term securitization facilities had fixed rates of interest. Therefore, some of the strategies the Company has used in the past to minimize interest rate risk do not currently apply.   The Company is subject to market risks due to fluctuations in interest rates primarily through its outstanding indebtedness and to a lesser extent its outstanding interest earning assets, and commitments to enter into new Contracts. The table below outlines the carrying values and estimated fair values of such financial instruments:                                         37                                                                                   DECEMBER 31,                                                                --------------------------------------------                                                                         2002                   2001                                                                ---------------------  ---------------------                                                                 CARRYING      FAIR     CARRYING       FAIR         FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT                                      VALUE       VALUE      VALUE        VALUE         --------------------                                      -----       -----      -----        -----                                                                               (IN THOUSANDS)                    Finance receivables, net...........................    $  84,592  $  84,592   $      --  $      --         Notes payable......................................          673        673       1,590      1,590         Securitization trust debt..........................       71,630     71,630          --         --         Senior secured debt................................       50,072     50,072      26,000     26,000         Subordinated debt..................................       36,000     32,800      36,989     24,791         Related party debt.................................       17,500     15,400      17,500     11,974   Much of the information used to determine fair value is highly subjective. When applicable, readily available market information has been utilized. However, for a significant portion of the Company's financial instruments, active markets do not exist. Therefore, considerable judgments were required in estimating fair value for certain items. The subjective factors include, among other things, the estimated timing and amount of cash flows, risk characteristics, credit quality and interest rates, all of which are subject to change. Since the fair value is estimated and do not reflect amounts of which amounts outstanding could be settled by the Company, the amounts that will actually be realized or paid at settlement or maturity of the instruments could be significantly different.
