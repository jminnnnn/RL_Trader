Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysisof Financial Condition and Results of Operations     The following discussionand analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information includedor incorporated by reference herein.     Overview     We are a specialtyfinance company. Our business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobiledealers and, to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, lighttrucks and passenger vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealerswho have limited credit histories or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative sourceof financing for dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditionalsources, such as commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers.In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we also originate vehicle purchase money loansby lending directly to consumers and have (i) acquired installment purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions,and (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loans from non-affiliated lenders. In this report, we refer toall of such contracts and loans as "automobile contracts."     We were incorporatedand began our operations in March 1991. From inception through December 31, 2020, we have originated a total of approximately $17.0billion of automobile contracts, primarily by purchasing retail installment sales contracts from dealers, and to a lesser degree,by originating loans secured by automobiles directly with consumers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 millionof automobile contracts in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2011. Contract purchase volumes and managed portfoliolevels for the five years ended December 31, 2020 are shown in the table below. Managed portfolio comprises both contracts we ownedand those we were servicing for non-affiliates.       Contract Purchases and Outstanding    Managed Portfolio        $    in thousands     Year    Contracts    Purchased in Period      Managed    Portfolio at Period End     2016    $ 1,088,785      $ 2,308,070     2017      859,069        2,333,530     2018      902,416        2,380,847     2019      1,002,782        2,416,042     2020      742,584        2,174,972        Our principal executive offices are inLas Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwritingfunctions are performed primarily in our California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevadabranches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida and Illinois branches.     Coronavirus Pandemic     In December 2019, anew strain of coronavirus (the “COVID-19 virus”) originated in Wuhan, China. Since its discovery, the COVID-19 virushas spread throughout the world, and the outbreak has been declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We referfrom time to time in this report to the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 virus as “the pandemic.” In March 2020at the outset of the pandemic we complied with government mandated shutdown orders in the five locations we operate by arrangingfor many of our staff to work from home and invoking various safety protocols for workers who remained in our offices. In April2020, we laid off approximately 100 workers, or about 10% of our workforce, throughout our offices because of significant reductionsin new contract originations. As of December 31, 2020, most of our staff who work in the Irvine location were working from home,while most of our staff from our other locations were working from our offices.                  36           The pandemic itself, if sufficient numbersof people were to be afflicted, could cause obligors under our automobile contracts to be unable to pay their contractual obligations.As the future course of the COVID-19 pandemic is as yet unknown, its direct effect on future obligor payments is likewise uncertain.     The mandatory shutdownof large portions of the United States economy pursuant to emergency restrictions has impaired and will impair the ability of obligorsunder our automobile contracts to pay their contractual obligations. The extent to which that ability will be impaired, and theextent to which public ameliorative measures such as stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits may restore such ability,cannot be estimated. Other effects of the pandemic on our operations is referred to throughout this report.     The programs we offerto dealers and consumers are intended to serve a wide range of sub-prime customers, primarily through franchised new car dealers.We originate automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizationsare transactions in which we sell a specified pool of contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours, which in turn issues asset-backedsecurities to fund the purchase of the pool of contracts from us.     Securitization and Warehouse Credit Facilities     Throughout the period for which informationis presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis throughsecuritizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identificationof specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries,and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactionsmay be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings.All of our active securitizations are structured as secured financings.     When structured to be treated as a securedfinancing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the relateddebt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interestand fee income on the contracts, and (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction. For automobilecontracts acquired before 2018, we also periodically record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts; for automobilecontracts acquired after 2017 we take account of estimated credit losses in our computation of a level yield used to determinerecognition of interest on the contracts.     Since 1994 we haveconducted 87 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated under our regular programs. As of December 31, 2020,21 of those securitizations are active and all are structured as secured financings. We generally conduct our securitizations ona quarterly basis, near the beginning of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, wecompleted only three securitizations in 2020. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemicand the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completedsecuritizations in June and September 2020.     Our history of term securitizations, overthe most recent ten years, is summarized in the table below:       Recent Asset-Backed Term Securitizations        $ in thousands     Period    Number of Term Securitizations      Amount of Receivables     2011      4      $ 335,593     2012      4        603,500     2013      4        778,000     2014      4        923,000     2015      3        795,000     2016      4        1,214,997     2017      4        870,000     2018      4        883,452     2019      4        1,014,124     2020      3        741,867                  37           Generally, prior to asecuritization transaction we fund our automobile contract acquisitions primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities.Our current short-term funding capacity is $200 million, comprising two credit facilities. The first $100 million credit facilitywas established in May 2012. This facility was most recently renewed in December 2020, extending the revolving period to December2022, with an optional amortization period through December 2023. In November 2015, we entered into another $100 million facility.This facility was renewed in November 2017 and again in December 2019, extending the revolving period to December 2021, followedby an amortization period to December 2023.     We previously had a third$100 million facility. This facility was established in April 2015 and was renewed in April 2017 and again in February 2019, extendingthe revolving period to February 2021. We repaid this facility in full at its maturity in 2021.     In a securitizationand in our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similarto the representations and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breachany of our representations or warranties, we will be obligated to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principalbalance plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the sellingdealer to repurchase the contract at a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subjectto any recourse against dealers, we will bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contractsthat we repurchase.     In a securitization,the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitizedautomobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we useto fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore havea material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations.     Critical Accounting Policies     We believe that ouraccounting policies related to (a) Finance Receivables at Fair Value, (b) Allowance for Finance Credit Losses, (c) Amortizationof Deferred Origination Costs and Acquisition Fees, (d) Term Securitizations, (e) Accrual for Contingent Liabilities and (f) IncomeTaxes are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Such policies are described below.     Allowance for Finance Credit Losses     In order to estimatean appropriate allowance for losses incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as " static pooling, " which stratifies our finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on the period of origination. Using analyticaland formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable incurredcredit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of automobile contracts. Net losses incurred on finance receivablesare charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristicsof the portfolio, prospective liquidation values of the underlying collateral and general economic and market conditions. As circumstanceschange, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change as well. Receivables acquired after 2017, are accounted for usingfair value and will have no allowance for finance credit losses in accordance with the fair value method of accounting for financereceivables.     Broad economic factorssuch as recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does theweighted average age of the receivables at any given time. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivableshave lower levels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and incrementallosses gradually increasing to a peak around 18 months, after which they gradually decrease.                  38           The credit performanceof our portfolio is also significantly influenced by our underwriting guidelines and credit criteria we use when evaluating contractsfor purchase from dealers. We regularly evaluate our portfolio credit performance and modify our purchase criteria to maximizethe credit performance of our portfolio, while maintaining competitive programs and levels of service for our dealers.     We generally do notlower the contractual interest rate or waive or forgive principal when our borrowers incur financial difficulty on either a temporaryor permanent basis. An exception to this policy is when a court order mandates the terms of the contract to be modified, such asin a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding. In such cases, which represent an immaterial portion of our portfolio of finance receivables,we have estimated the amount of impairment that results from such modification and established an appropriate allowance withinour Allowance for Finance Credit Losses.     EffectiveJanuary 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 326, which changes the criteria underwhich credit losses on financial instruments (such as the Company’s finance receivables) are measured. ASC 326 introduceda new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model, which replaces the incurredloss impairment methodology previously used under U.S. GAAP with a methodology that records currently the expected lifetime creditlosses on financial instruments. The adoption of CECL required that we establish an allowance for the remaining expected lifetimecredit losses on the portion of the Company’s receivable portfolio for which the Company was not already using fair valueaccounting. We refer to that portion, which is those receivables that were originated prior to January 2018, as our “legacyportfolio”. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million.     At the onset of the pandemic in March 2020,Government mandated shutdowns of large portions of the United States economy impaired and will likely continue to impair the abilityof obligors under our automobile contracts to make their monthly payments. The extent to which that ability will be impaired, andthe extent to which public ameliorative measures such as stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits may restore suchability, cannot be estimated.     During the twelve-monthperiod ended December 31, 2020, we supplemented our allowance for finance credit losses by $14.1 million to provide for additionallosses that we may incur due to the pandemic.     Finance Receivables Measured at FairValue     Effective January 1,2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For each finance receivableacquired after 2017, we consider the price paid on the purchase date as the fair value for such receivable.  We estimate thecash to be received in the future with respect to such receivables, based on our experience with similar receivables acquired inthe past.  We then compute the internal rate of return that results in the present value of those estimated cash receiptsbeing equal to the purchase date fair value. Thereafter, we recognize interest income on such receivables on a level yield basisusing that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. Cash received with respect to such receivables is applied firstagainst such interest income, and then to reduce the recorded value of the receivables.     We re-evaluate thefair value of such receivables at the close of each measurement period. If the reevaluation were to yield a value materially differentfrom the recoded value, an adjustment would be required. In the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020, the Company consideredthe effect of the pandemic on the portfolio of finance receivables carried at fair value and recorded a mark down to that portfolioof $29.5 million. The mark down is reflected as a reduction in revenue.                  39           Anticipated creditlosses are included in our estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables.  Because such credit losses areincluded in our computation of the appropriate level yield, we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses, asour best estimate of the lifetime aggregate of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also because we include anticipatedcredit losses in our computation of the level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractualrate applicable to the receivables. Because our initial recorded value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, ratherthan as the contractual principal balance, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables,nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the periodincurred.     Term Securitizations     Our term securitization structure has generallybeen as follows:     We sell automobilecontracts we acquire to a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, which has been established for the limited purpose of buyingand reselling our automobile contracts. The special-purpose subsidiary then transfers the same automobile contracts to anotherentity, typically a statutory trust. The trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities, in a principal amount equal toor less than the aggregate principal balance of the automobile contracts. We typically sell these automobile contracts to the trustat face value and without recourse, except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to us areprovided by us to the trust. One or more investors purchase the asset-backed securities issued by the trust; the proceeds fromthe sale of the asset-backed securities are then used to purchase the automobile contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinatedasset-backed securities issued by the trust or by a related entity.     We structure our securitizationsto include internal credit enhancement for the benefit the investors (i) in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account( " spread account " )held by the trust, (ii) in the form of overcollateralization of the senior asset-backed securities, where the principal balanceof the senior asset-backed securities issued is less than the principal balance of the automobile contracts, (iii) in the formof subordinated asset-backed securities, or (iv) some combination of such internal credit enhancements. The agreements governingthe securitization transactions require that the initial level of internal credit enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collectionsfrom the automobile contracts until the level of internal credit enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained.The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related automobilecontracts. The specified levels at which the internal credit enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performanceof the portfolios of automobile contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement amongus, our special purpose subsidiary, the insurance company, if any, and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased fromtime to time based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied from one transaction to another. The agreementsgoverning the securitizations generally grant us the option to repurchase the sold automobile contracts from the trust when theaggregate outstanding balance of the automobile contracts has amortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance.     Upon each transferof automobile contracts in a transaction structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes, we retain on ourconsolidated balance sheet the related automobile contracts as assets and record the asset-backed notes or loans issued in thetransaction as indebtedness.     We receive periodicbase servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the automobile contracts. Under our securitization structures treated assecured financings for financial accounting purposes, such servicing fees are included in interest income from the automobile contracts.In addition, we are entitled to the cash flows from the trusts that represent collections on the automobile contracts in excessof the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the asset-backed securities, base servicing fees, and certain other feesand expenses (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the asset-backed notes are generally definedas the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of such notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the relatedautomobile contracts (excluding those automobile contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of suchbalance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related securitization agreements require accelerated payment of principaluntil the principal balance of the asset-backed securities is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal paymentis said to create overcollateralization of the asset-backed notes.                  40           If the amount of cashrequired for payment of fees, expenses, interest and principal on the senior asset-backed notes exceeds the amount collected duringthe collection period, the shortfall is withdrawn from the spread account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceedsthe amount necessary for the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated asset-backed notes, and thereis no shortfall in the related spread account or the required overcollateralization level, the excess is released to us. If thespread account and overcollateralization is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the trustuntil the specified level is achieved. Although spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of our special-purposesubsidiaries as the owner of the residual interests (in the case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financialaccounting purposes) or the trusts (in the case of securitization transactions structured as secured financings for financial accountingpurposes), we are restricted in use of the cash in the spread accounts. Cash held in the various spread accounts is invested inhigh quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the securitization agreements. The interest rate payable on the automobilecontracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the asset-backed notes. As a result, the residual interests describedabove historically have been a significant asset of ours.     In all of our termsecuritizations and warehouse credit facilities, whether treated as secured financings or as sales, we have sold the automobilecontracts (through a subsidiary) to the securitization entity. The difference between the two structures is that in securitizationsthat are treated as secured financings we report the assets and liabilities of the securitization trust on our consolidated balancesheet. Under both structures, recourse to us by holders of the asset-backed securities and by the trust, for failure of the automobilecontract obligors to make payments on a timely basis, is limited to the automobile contracts included in the securitizations orwarehouse credit facilities, the spread accounts and our retained interests in the respective trusts.     Accrual for Contingent Liabilities     We are routinely involvedin various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Ourlegal counsel has advised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indicationthat it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined.     We have recorded aliability as of December 31, 2020, which represents our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies at thatdate. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such informationas is available to us, we believe that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies describedor referenced above, as of December 31, 2020, and in excess of the liability we have recorded, does not exceed $3 million.     Accordingly, we believethat the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies, after taking into account our current litigation reserves,should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertaintiesinherent in contested proceedings, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantlyexceed the reserves we have accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to our operating results fora particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income forthat period.     Income Taxes     We account for incometaxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expectedfuture tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets andliabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities usingenacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rateson deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.     Deferred tax assetsare recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognizedfor a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of thedeferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such judgements, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectivelyverified.                  41           In determining thepossible future realization of deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversalof taxable temporary differences; and (b) forecasted future net earnings from operations. Based upon those considerations, we haveconcluded that it is more likely than not that the U.S. and state net operating loss carryforward periods provide enough time toutilize the deferred tax assets pertaining to the existing net operating loss carryforwards and any net operating loss that wouldbe created by the reversal of the future net deductions which have not yet been taken on a tax return. Our estimates of taxableincome are forward-looking statements, and there can be no assurance that our estimates of such taxable income will be correct.Factors discussed under "Risk Factors," and in particular under the subheading "Risk Factors -- Forward-LookingStatements" may affect whether such projections prove to be correct.     We recognize interestand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statementsof operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.     Uncertainty of Capital Markets and General Economic Conditions     We depend upon theavailability of warehouse credit facilities and access to long-term financing through the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralizedby our automobile contracts. Since 1994, we have completed 87 term securitizations of approximately $15.1 billion in contracts.We generally conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizationsper calendar year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitizationdue to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequentlywe successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020.     Financial Covenants      Certain of our securitizationtransactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratiosand results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels.In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certaincreditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2020 we were in compliancewith all such financial covenants.     Results of Operations     Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December31, 2020 with the year ended December 31, 2019      Revenues . Duringthe year ended December 31, 2020, our revenues were $271.2 million, a decrease of $74.6 million, or 21.6%, from the prior yearrevenues of $345.8 million. The primary reason for the decrease in revenues is a decrease in interest income and a mark down tothe recorded value of the portion of the receivables portfolio accounted for at fair value. Interest income for the year endedDecember 31, 2020 decreased $42.1 million, or 12.5%, to $295.0 million from $337.1 million in the prior year. The primary reasonfor the decrease in interest income is the continued runoff of our portfolio of finance receivables originated prior to January2018, which accrued interest at an average of 18.5%, which is offset only in part by the increase in our portfolio of receivablesmeasured at fair value, which are those originated since January 2018. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair valueis reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The table belowshows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries for the year months ended December31, 2020 and 2019:               42                  Year    Ended December 31,          2020      2019          (Dollars in    thousands)          Average             Interest      Average             Interest          Balance      Interest      Yield      Balance      Interest      Yield     Interest    Earning Assets                                             Finance receivables    $ 684,259      $ 126,716        18.5%      $ 1,192,484      $ 214,037        17.9%     Finance receivables measured    at fair value      1,631,491        168,266        10.3%        1,212,226        123,059        10.2%     Total    $ 2,315,750      $ 294,982        12.7%      $ 2,404,710      $ 337,096        14.0%        Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 include a $29.5 millionmark down to the recorded value of the finance receivables measured at fair value. The mark down is an estimate based on our evaluationof the appropriate fair value and future earnings rate of existing receivables compared to recently acquired receivables and ourassessment of potential additional future net losses arising from the pandemic.     Other income decreasedby $3.0 million, or 34.4%, to $5.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from $8.7 million in the prior year. The decreasein other income generally resulted from a decrease of $1.3 million in revenues associated with direct mail and other related productsand services that we offer to our dealers and a decrease of $1.0 million in payments from third-party providers of conveniencefees paid by our customers for web based and other electronic payments.     Expenses . Our operatingexpenses consist largely of interest expense, provision for credit losses, employee costs, sales and general and administrativeexpenses. Provision for credit losses is affected by the balance and credit performance of our portfolio of finance receivables(other than our portfolio of finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect ofreducing the interest rate applicable to such receivables). Interest expense is significantly affected by the volume of automobilecontracts we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and the use of our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizationsto finance those contracts. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobilecontracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile andautomobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level.     Employee costs includebase salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstandingstock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options)generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced.     Other operating expensesconsist largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales andadvertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization.     Total operating expenseswere $251.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $336.6 million for the prior year, a decrease of $85.6 million,or 25.4%. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in provision for credit losses and interest expense.     Employee costs decreasedby $679,000 or 0.8%, to $80.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, representing 31.9% of total operating expenses,from $80.9 million for the prior year, or 24.0% of total operating expenses. In the first quarter of 2020, prior to the onset ofthe pandemic, our employee costs were greater than in the first quarter of 2019. Those increases have been partially offset bydecreases since the first quarter of 2020, which are the result of staff reductions due in part to the fact that our contract purchaseshave not returned to pre-pandemic levels. If our contract purchase volumes remain at current levels, we expect lower employee costsin future periods.               43           The table below summarizesour employees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December31, 2020 and 2019:            December    31, 2020      December    31, 2019          Amount      Amount          ($ in millions)     Contracts purchased (dollars)    $ 742.6      $ 1,002.8     Contracts purchased (units)      39,887        55,919     Managed portfolio outstanding (dollars)    $ 2,175.0      $ 2,416.0     Managed portfolio outstanding (units)      163,177        181,498                           Number of Originations staff      157        202     Number of Marketing staff      96        122     Number of Servicing staff      460        612     Number of other staff      74        74     Total number of employees      787        1,010        General and administrativeexpenses include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities,credit services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $32.0 million, a decrease of $1.0 million, or3.1%, compared to the previous year and represented 12.7% of total operating expenses.     Interest expense forthe year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $9.2 million to $101.3 million, or 8.3%, compared to $110.5 million in the previousyear. Interest expense represented 40.4% of total operating expenses in 2020.     Interest on securitizationtrust debt decreased by $8.8 million, or 9.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. The average balanceof securitization trust debt decreased 7.5% to $2,017.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2,181.5 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2019. The blended interest rates on new term securitizations have generally increased in 2017 and2018 before declining in 2019 and 2020. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimatelythe result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bondsare priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing to accept, which in turn, is influenced by investordemand for our bonds at the time of the securitization. These and other factors have resulted in fluctuations in our securitizationtrust debt interest costs. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below:       Blended Cost of Funds on Recent Asset-Backed Term Securitizations   Period     Blended Cost of Funds   January 2017     3.91%   April 2017     3.45%   July 2017     3.52%   October 2017     3.39%   January 2018     3.46%   April 2018     3.98%   July 2018     4.18%   October 2018     4.25%   January 2019     4.22%   April 2019     3.95%   July 2019     3.36%   October 2019     2.95%   January 2020     3.08%   June 2020     4.09%   September 2020     2.39%             44           The annualized averagerate on our securitization trust debt was 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The annualized average rate is influencedby the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increase over time on any particularsecuritization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repayment of the shorter term,lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds.     Interest expense on warehouselines of credit decreased by $724,000, or 8.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. The average rateon the debt was 8.3% in 2020 compared to 9.7% in the prior year while the average balance of the warehouse debt increased to $92.5million from $86.2 million.     Interest expense on residualinterest financing was $3.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $3.8 million in the prior year as the averagebalance has decreased.     Interest expense on oursubordinated renewable notes increased by $741,000, or 51.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year.The average balance of the notes increased from $15.0 million in the prior year to $19.3 million for the year ended December 31,2020. The average interest rate on our subordinated notes increased to 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 9.6% forthe year ended December 31, 2019.     The following table presentsthe components of interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2020and 2019:            Year    Ended December 31,          2020      2019          (Dollars in thousands)                        Annualized                    Annualized          Average             Average      Average             Average          Balance    (1)      Interest      Yield/Rate      Balance    (1)      Interest      Yield/Rate     Interest    Earning Assets                                                         Finance receivables gross (2)    $ 684,259      $ 126,716        18.5%      $ 1,157,910      $ 214,037        18.5%     Finance receivables at fair    value      1,631,491        168,266        10.3%        1,212,226        123,059        10.2%            2,315,750        294,982        12.7%        2,370,136        337,096        14.2%                                                               Interest    Bearing Liabilities      $                                                  Warehouse lines of credit    $ 92,481        7,678        8.3%      $ 86,200        8,402        9.7%     Residual interest financing      34,906        3,454        9.9%        40,000        3,822        9.6%     Securitization trust debt      2,017,152        88,031        4.4%        2,181,545        96,870        4.4%     Subordinated renewable notes      19,340        2,175        11.2%        14,982        1,434        9.6%          $ 2,163,879        101,338        4.7%      $ 2,322,727        110,528        4.8%            $                                                  Net interest income/spread             $ 193,644                        $ 226,568              Net interest margin (3)      $                 8.4%                          9.6%                                                               Ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing    liabilities      107%                          102%                          ___________________           (1)  Average balances are based on month    end balances except for warehouse lines of credit, which are based on daily balances.        (2)  Net of deferred fees and direct    costs.         (3)  Net interest income divided by average    interest earning assets.                   45                  Year Ended December 31, 2020          Compared    to December 31, 2019          Total      Change Due      Change Due          Change      to    Volume      to    Rate     Interest Earning Assets    (In thousands)     Finance receivables gross    $ (87,321 )    $ (87,553 )    $ 232     Finance receivables at fair value      45,207        42,562        2,645            (42,114 )      (44,991 )      2,877     Interest Bearing    Liabilities                              Warehouse lines of credit    (724 )      612        (1,336 )   Residual interest financing      (368 )      (487 )      119     Securitization trust debt      (8,839 )      (7,300 )      (1,539 )   Subordinated renewable notes      741        417        324            (9,190 )      (6,758 )      (2,432 )                                  Net interest income/spread    $ (32,924 )    $ (38,233 )    $ 5,309         The reduction in the annualized yield onour finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year period is the result of the lower interestyield on the receivables measured at fair value. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take accountof expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The average balance of these receivableswas $1,631.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,212.2 million in the prior year period.     Effective January1, 2020, the Company adopted  Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurementof Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  The amendment introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current ExpectedCredit Loss model, generally referred to as CECL. Adoption of CECL required the establishment of an allowance for the remainingexpected lifetime credit losses on the portion of the Company’s receivable portfolio that was originated prior to January2018. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million. In accordancewith the rules for adopting CECL, the offset to the addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reductionto retained earnings using the modified retrospective method.     Provision for credit losses was $14.1 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2020. The provision represents our estimate of additional losses that may be incurred on the portfolioof finance receivables resulting from the pandemic. Such losses were not considered in our initial estimate of remaining lifetimelosses that we recorded with the adoption of CECL in January 2020. In the prior year period, prior to the adoption of CECL, provisionfor credit losses was $85.8 million.     The allowance appliesonly to our finance receivables originated through December 2017, which we refer to as our legacy portfolio.  Finance receivablesthat we have originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognizeinterest income net of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measuredat fair value.     Sales expense consistsprimarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salaryplus commissions based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers,such as training programs, internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Sales expense decreased by $3.7 million to $14.2 millionduring the year ended December 31, 2020 and represented 5.7% of total operating expenses. We purchased $742.6 million of new contractsduring the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,002.8 million in the prior year period. In our second quarter of 2020, weexperienced a significant reduction in contract purchases due to the pandemic and partial shutdown of the economy. Subsequently,our contract purchase volumes have increased but have not recovered to pre-pandemic levels.     Occupancy expenses decreasedby $66,000 or 0.9%, to $7.4 million compared to $7.5 million in the previous year and represented 3.0% of total operating expenses.               46           Depreciation and amortizationexpenses increased by $709,000 or 65.9%, to $1.8 million compared to $1.1 million in the previous year and represented 0.6% oftotal operating expenses.     Income tax benefitwas $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which includes an $8.8 million tax benefit. On March 27, 2020, the CoronavirusAid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was passed into law, providing wide ranging economic relief for individualsand businesses. One component of the CARES Act provides the Company with an opportunity to carry back net operating losses (“NOLs”)arising from 2018, 2019 and 2020 to the prior five tax years. The Company has previously valued its NOLs at the federal corporateincome tax rate of 21%. However, the CARES Act provides for NOL carryback claims to be calculated based on a rate of 35%, whichwas the federal corporate tax rate in effect for the carryback years. The result of the revaluation of NOLs and other tax adjustmentsis a net tax benefit of $8.8 million. Excluding the tax benefit, income tax expense would have been $7.2 million, representingan effective income tax rate of 36%. For the prior year period, income tax expense was $3.8 million, which represents an effectiveincome tax rate of 41%.     Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December31, 2019 with the year ended December 31, 2018     Revenues .  Duringthe year ended December 31, 2019, our revenues were $345.8 million, a decrease of $44.0 million, or 11.3%, from the prior yearrevenues of $389.8 million. The primary reason for the decrease in revenues is a decrease in interest income. Interest income forthe year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $43.2 million, or 11.4%, to $337.1 million from $380.3 million in the prior year. Theprimary reason for the decrease in interest income is the lower interest yield on the receivables measured at fair value. The interestyield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yieldon other finance receivables. The table below shows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held by consolidatedsubsidiaries for the year months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:             Year    Ended December 31,          2019      2018          (Dollars in thousands)          Average             Interest      Average             Interest          Balance      Interest      Yield      Balance      Interest      Yield     Interest Earning Assets                                             Finance receivables    $ 1,192,484    $ 214,037        17.9%      $ 1,860,388      $ 336,434        18.1%     Finance receivables measured at fair value      1,212,226        123,059        10.2%        447,167        43,863        9.8%     Total    $ 2,404,710    $ 337,096        14.0%      $ 2,307,555      $ 380,297        16.5%        Other income decreased by $730,000, or 7.2%, to $9.5 million in theyear ended December 31, 2018 from $10.2 million during the prior year. The decrease in other income resulted from a decreaseof $1.2 million in revenues associated with direct mail and other related products and services that we offer to our dealers. Thisdecrease was partially offset by an increase of $740,000 in payments from third-party providers of convenience fees paid by ourcustomers for web based and other electronic payments.     Expenses .  Our operatingexpenses consist largely of interest expense, provision for credit losses, employee costs, sales and general and administrativeexpenses. Provision for credit losses is affected by the balance and credit performance of our portfolio of finance receivables(other than our portfolio of finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect ofreducing the interest rate applicable to such receivables). Interest expense is significantly affected by the volume of automobilecontracts we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and the use of our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizationsto finance those contracts. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobilecontracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile andautomobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level.                  47           Employee costs includebase salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstandingstock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options)generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced.     Other operating expensesconsist largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales andadvertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization.     Total operating expenseswere $336.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $371.1 million for the prior year, a decrease of $34.4 million,or 9.3%. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in provision for credit losses, offsetting increases in interest expense,employee costs, and general and administrative expenses.     Employee costs increasedby $1.6 million or 2.0%, to $80.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, representing 24.0% of total operating expenses,from $79.3 million for the prior year, or 24.5% of total operating expenses. The table below summarizes our employees by categoryas well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2019 and 2018:            December    31, 2019      December    31, 2018          Amount      Amount          ($ in millions)     Contracts purchased (dollars)    $ 1,002.8      $ 902.4     Contracts purchased (units)      55,919        52,731     Managed portfolio outstanding (dollars)    $ 2,416.0      $ 2,380.8     Managed portfolio outstanding (units)      181,498        176,042                           Number of Originations staff      202        215     Number of Marketing staff      122        132     Number of Servicing staff      612        610     Number of other staff      74        75     Total number of employees      1,010        1,032        General and administrativeexpenses include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities,credit services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $33.0 million, an increase of $2.0 million, or6.3%, compared to the previous year and represented 9.8% of total operating expenses.     Interest expense forthe year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $9.1 million to $110.5 million, or 8.9%, compared to $101.5 million in the previousyear. Interest expense represented 32.8% of total operating expenses in 2019.                     48           Interest on securitizationtrust debt increased by $6.9 million, or 7.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The average balanceof securitization trust debt increased 1.9% to $2,181.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $2,140.1 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2018. The cost of securitization debt during the year ended December 31, 2019 also increased to4.4% from 4.2% in the prior year period. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds isultimately the result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against whichour bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing accept, which in turn, is influenced by investordemand for our bonds at the time of the securitization. The cost of funds had moved up in 2018 before trending downward in 2019.The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below:       Blended Cost of Funds on Recent Asset-Backed Term Securitizations             Period     Blended Cost of Funds   January 2017     3.91%   April 2017     3.45%   July 2017     3.52%   October 2017     3.39%   January 2018     3.46%   April 2018     3.98%   July 2018     4.18%   October 2018     4.25%   January 2019     4.22%   April 2019     3.95%   July 2019     3.36%   October 2019     2.95%      The annualized averagerate on our securitization trust debt was 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 4.2% in the prior year. The annualizedaverage rate is influenced by the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increaseover time on any particular securitization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repaymentof the shorter term, lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds.     Interest expense on oursubordinated renewable notes decreased by $11,000, or 0.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. Theaverage balance of the notes decreased from $16.5 million in the prior year to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.However, the average interest rate on our subordinated notes increased to 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 8.7% forthe year ended December 31, 2018.     Interest expense on residualinterest financing was $3.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $2.3 million in the prior year. This transactionclosed in May 2018 and was not outstanding for the full year in 2018.     Interest expense on warehouselines of credit increased by $650,000, or 8.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The increase ininterest expense was due to the higher utilization of our warehouse lines in 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was partiallyoffset by a decrease in the average interest rate on our warehouse credit line debt from 11.6% in 2018 to 9.7% in 2019.                  49           The following table presentsthe components of interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2019and 2018:             Year Ended December 31,          2019      2018          (Dollars in thousands)                        Annualized                    Annualized          Average             Average      Average             Average          Balance    (1)      Interest      Yield/Rate      Balance    (1)      Interest      Yield/Rate     Interest Earning    Assets                                                         Finance receivables gross (2)    $ 1,157,910      $ 214,037        18.5%      $ 1,860,388      $ 336,434        18.1%     Finance receivables at fair value      1,212,226        123,059        10.2%        447,167        43,863        9.8%            2,370,136        337,096        14.2%        2,307,555        380,297        16.5%                                                               Interest Bearing    Liabilities                                                         Warehouse lines of credit    $ 86,200        8,402        9.7%      $ 66,984        7,752        11.6%     Residual interest financing      40,000        3,822        9.6%        25,000        2,343        9.4%     Securitization trust debt      2,181,545        96,870        4.4%        2,140,093        89,926        4.2%     Subordinated renewable notes      14,982        1,434        9.6%        16,533        1,445        8.7%          $ 2,322,727        110,528        4.8%      $ 2,248,610        101,466        4.5%                                                               Net interest income/spread             $ 226,568                        $ 278,831              Net interest margin (3)                        9.6%                          12.1%     Ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest    bearing liabilities      102%                          103%                          _______________________       (1)  Averagebalances are based on month end balances except for warehouse lines of credit, which are based on daily balances.       (2)  Netof deferred fees and direct costs.       (3)  Netinterest income divided by average interest earning assets.            Year Ended December 31, 2019          Compared to December    31, 2018          Total      Change Due      Change Due          Change      to    Volume      to    Rate     Interest Earning Assets    (In thousands)     Finance receivables gross    $ (122,397 )      (127,037 )    $ 4,640     Finance receivables at fair value      79,196        75,045        4,151            (43,201 )      (51,992 )      8,791     Interest Bearing    Liabilities                              Warehouse lines of credit      650        2,224        (1,574 )   Residual interest financing      1,479        1,406        73     Securitization trust debt      6,944        1,742        5,202     Subordinated renewable notes    (11 )      (136 )      125            9,062        5,236        3,826                                    Net interest income/spread    $ (52,263 )      (57,228 )    $ 4,965                    50           The reduction in the annualized yield onour finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period is the result of the lower interestyield on the receivables measured at fair value. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take accountof expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The average balance of these receivableswas $1,212.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 compared to $447.2 million in the prior year period.     Provision for credit losses was $85.8 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $47.3 million, or 35.5% compared to the prior year and represented 25.5% oftotal operating expenses. The provision for credit losses maintains the allowance for finance credit losses at levels that we feelare adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated. Our approach for establishing the allowancerequires greater amounts of provision for credit losses early in the terms of our finance receivables. In addition, we monitorthe delinquency and net charge off rates in our portfolio to consider how such rates may affect the allowance for finance creditlosses. The allowance applies only to our finance receivables originated through December 2017, which we refer to as our legacyportfolio. Since no receivables have been added to the legacy portfolio since December 2017, it has seasoned to the point whereits weighted age is 42 months at December 31, 2019. We have also observed that receivables originated in 2017 have incurred creditlosses at a significantly lower rate than receivables we originated in 2015 and 2016. The age of the legacy portfolio, its continuouslydeclining balance and the significant variance of the relative credit performance of the vintage pools that make up the legacyportfolio have contributed to lower provisions for credit losses and lower levels of the allowance for finance credit losses. Financereceivables that we have originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting,we recognize interest income under the interest method on a level yield basis based on forecasted future cash flows net of expectedcredit losses. Thus, no provision for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value.     Sales expenses consistprimarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salaryplus commissions based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers,such as training programs, internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Sales expenses increased by $321,000, or 1.8%, to $17.9million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $17.6 million in the prior year, and represented 5.3% of total operatingexpenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we purchased 55,919 contracts representing $1,002.8 million in receivables comparedto 52,731 contracts representing $902.4 million in receivables in the prior year.     Occupancy expenses decreasedby $120,000 or 1.6%, to $7.5 million compared to $7.6 million in the previous year and represented 2.2% of total operating expenses.     Depreciation and amortizationexpenses increased by $84,000 or 8.5%, to $1,076,000 compared to $992,000 in the previous year and represented 0.2% of total operatingexpenses.     For the year ended December31, 2019, we recorded income tax expense of $3.8 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 41.0%. For the year endedDecember 31, 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $3.8 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 20.5%. This includes$2.1 million of income tax benefit related to certain tax planning strategies and other adjustments. Excluding the impact of thetax benefit, the effective tax rate for 2018 would have been 31.8%.                  51             Liquidity and Capital Resources     Liquidity     Our business requiressubstantial cash to support our purchases of automobile contracts and other operating activities. Our primary sources of cash havebeen cash flows from the proceeds from term securitization transactions and other sales of automobile contracts, amounts borrowedunder various revolving credit facilities (also sometimes known as warehouse credit facilities), customer payments of principaland interest on finance receivables, fees for origination of automobile contracts, and releases of cash from securitization transactionsand their related spread accounts. Our primary uses of cash have been the purchases of automobile contracts, repayment of amountsborrowed under lines of credit, securitization transactions and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest, occupancyexpenses and other general and administrative expenses, the establishment of spread accounts and initial overcollateralization,if any, the increase of credit enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions, and income taxes. There can be noassurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet our cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cashwill depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from those pools and their relatedspread accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in our managed portfolio, and the terms upon which we are able to acquireand borrow against automobile contracts.     Net cash provided byoperating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $238.8 million, $216.8 million and $216.2 million,respectively. Net cash from operating activities is generally provided by net income from operations adjusted for significant non-cashitems such as our provision for credit losses and interest accretion on fair value receivables.     Net cash provided byinvesting activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $93.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the yearsended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $229.4 million and $242.2 million, respectively. Cash provided by investing activities primarilyresults from principal payments and other proceeds received on finance receivables. Cash used in investing activities generallyrelates to purchases of automobile contracts. Purchases of finance receivables were $739.7 million (includes acquisition fees paid),$1,004.2 million and $914.9 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.     Net cash used in financingactivities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $328.5 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the years endedDecember 31, 2019 and 2018 was $23.3 million and $31.4 million, respectively. Cash used or provided by financing activities isprimarily related to the issuance of securitization trust debt, reduced by the amount of repayment of securitization trust debtand net proceeds or repayments on our warehouse lines of credit and other debt. We issued $714.5 million in new securitizationtrust debt in 2020 compared to $1,000.5 million in 2019 and $855.8 million in 2018. Repayments of securitization debt were $1,010.0million, $966.1 million and $876.1 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.     We purchase automobilecontracts from dealers for a cash price approximately equal to their principal amount, adjusted for an acquisition fee which mayeither increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price. Those automobile contracts generate cash flow, however, overa period of years. We have been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase automobile contracts and our securitizationtransactions for long term financing of our contracts. In addition, we have accessed other sources, such as residual financingsand subordinated debt in order to finance our continuing operations.     The acquisition ofautomobile contracts for subsequent financing in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initialovercollateralization, if any, and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuingneed for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, therequired level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established trusts andtheir related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. Ofthose, the factor most subject to our control is the rate at which we purchase automobile contracts.                  52        We are and may in thefuture be limited in our ability to purchase automobile contracts due to limits on our capital. As of December 31, 2020, we hadunrestricted cash of $13.5 million and $179.5 million aggregate available borrowings under our three warehouse credit facilities(assuming the availability of sufficient eligible collateral). As of December 30, 2020, we had approximately $33.5 million of sucheligible collateral. In February 2021, we repaid in full one of the facilities at maturity, leaving us with two facilities of $100million each thereafter. During 2020, we completed three securitizations aggregating $714.5 million of notes sold. Our plans tomanage our liquidity include maintaining our rate of automobile contract purchases at a level that matches our available capital,and, as appropriate, minimizing our operating costs. If we are unable to complete such securitizations, we may be unable to increaseour rate of automobile contract purchases, in which case our interest income and other portfolio related income could decrease.     Our liquidity willalso be affected by releases of cash from the trusts established with our securitizations. While the specific terms and mechanicsof each spread account vary among transactions, our securitization agreements generally provide that we will receive excess cashflows, if any, only if the amount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and the delinquency or net losses relatedto the automobile contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies or net losses on theautomobile contracts exceed such levels, the terms of the securitization may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulatedfor the particular pool. There can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will continue to generate sufficientcash.     Our warehouse creditfacilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintainingminimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain of our debt agreementsother than our term securitizations contain cross-default provisions. Such cross-default provisions would allow the respectivecreditors to declare a default if an event of default occurred with respect to other indebtedness of ours, but only if such otherevent of default were to be accompanied by acceleration of such other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliancewith all such financial covenants.     We have and will continueto have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1,969.4 million of debt outstanding.Such debt consisted primarily of $1,803.7 million of securitization trust debt and $119.0 million of debt from warehouse linesof credit. Since 2005, we have offered renewable subordinated notes to the public on a continuous basis, and such notes have maturitiesthat range from six months to 10 years. We had $21.3 million in subordinated renewable notes outstanding at December 31, 2020.On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. At December31, 2020, $25.6 million of this residual interest financing debt remains outstanding ($25.4 million net of deferred financing costs).     Although we believewe are able to service and repay our debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If our plans for future operationsdo not generate sufficient cash flows and earnings, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. If wefail to pay our indebtedness when due, it could have a material adverse effect on us and may require us to issue additional debtor equity securities.     Contractual Obligations     The following tablesummarizes our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):            Payment Due by Period (1)                 Less than      2 to 3      4 to 5      More than          Total      1 Year      Years      Years      5 Years     Long Term Debt (2)    $ 21,323      $ 9,506      $ 6,681      $ 3,484      $ 1,652     Operating Leases      18,020        8,687        8,597        736        –     _____________________    (1) Securitization trust debt, in the aggregate amount of $1,803.7 million as of December 31, 2020,is omitted from this table because it becomes due as and when the related receivables balance is reduced by payments and charge-offs.Expected payments, which will depend on the performance of such receivables, as to which there can be no assurance, are $818.4million in 2021, $450.9 million in 2022, $350.7 million in 2023, $81.1 million in 2024, $83.7 million in 2025, and $18.7 millionin 2026.   (2) Long-term debt represents subordinated renewable notes.               53           Weanticipate repaying debt due in 2021 with a combination of cash flows from operations and the potential issuance of new debt.     Warehouse Credit Facilities     The terms on whichcredit has been available to us for purchase of automobile contracts have varied in recent years, as shown in the following summaryof our warehouse credit facilities:     Facility Establishedin May 2012.  On May 11, 2012, we entered into a $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A. The facilityis structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility toour consolidated subsidiary Page Eight Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 82.0% of eligible financereceivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 3.75%per annum. In December 2020, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to December 2022 and to include an amortizationperiod through December 2023 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2020there was $45.7 million outstanding under this facility.     Facility Establishedin April 2015.  On April 17, 2015, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Fortress InvestmentGroup. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing froma credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Six Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0%of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 5.50% per annum, with a minimumrate of 6.50% per annum. In February 2019, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to February 2021 followed byan amortization period through February 2023. At December 31, 2020 there was $42.6 million outstanding under this facility. InFebruary 2021, we repaid this facility in full at its maturity date and elected not to renew it.     Facility Establishedin November 2015.  On November 24, 2015, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with affiliatesof Credit Suisse Group and Ares Management LP. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price ofautomobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Nine Funding, LLC. The facility providesfor effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at a commercialpaper rate plus 4.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 5.00% per annum. In December 2019, this facility was amended to extendthe revolving period to December 2021 followed by an amortization period through December 2023 for any receivables pledged to thefacility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2020 there was $32.3 million outstanding under this facility.     Capital Resources     Securitization trustdebt is repaid from collections on the related receivables, and becomes due in accordance with its terms as the principal amountof the related receivables is reduced. Although the securitization trust debt also has alternative final maturity dates, thosedates are significantly later than the dates at which repayment of the related receivables is anticipated, and at no time in ourhistory have any of our sponsored asset-backed securities reached those alternative final maturities.     The acquisition ofautomobile contracts for subsequent transfer in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization,if any, when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavilydependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations,and the extent to which the trusts and related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitizedautomobile contracts. We plan to adjust our levels of automobile contract purchases and the related capital requirements to matchanticipated releases of cash from the trusts and related spread accounts.                  54           Capitalization     Over the period fromJanuary 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 we have managed our capitalization by issuing and refinancing debt as summarized in thefollowing table:            Year Ended December 31,          2020      2019      2018          (Dollars in thousands)     RESIDUAL INTEREST FINANCING:                              Beginning balance    $ 39,478      $ 39,106      $ –          Issuances      –        –        40,000          Payments      (14,424 )      –        –          Capitalization of deferred financing costs      –        –        (1,081 )        Amortization of deferred financing costs      372        372        187     Ending balance    $ 25,426      $ 39,478      $ 39,106                                    SECURITIZATION TRUST DEBT:                              Beginning balance    $ 2,097,728      $ 2,063,627      $ 2,083,215          Issuances      714,543        1,000,501        855,828          Payments      (1,009,988 )      (966,144 )      (876,094 )        Capitalization of deferred financing costs      (4,862 )      (6,808 )      (6,198 )        Amortization of deferred financing costs      6,252        6,552        6,876     Ending balance    $ 1,803,673      $ 2,097,728      $ 2,063,627                                    SUBORDINATED RENEWABLE NOTES:                              Beginning balance    $ 17,534      $ 17,290      $ 16,566          Issuances      6,750        5,764        3,175          Payments      (2,961 )      (5,520 )      (2,451 )   Ending balance    $ 21,323      $ 17,534      $ 17,290        Residual InterestFinancing.    On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issuedsecuritizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backednotes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017.The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a couponof 8.595%. As of December 31, 2020, $25.6 million of residual interest financing debt remains outstanding. This amount does notexclude $150,000 in unamortized debt issuance costs. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carryingamount of the debt on our consolidated balance sheets.                  55            The agreed valuationof the collateral for the 2018-1 Notes is the sum of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each relatedsecuritization and the over-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principalbalances of the related receivables less the principal balance of the outstanding notes issued in the related securitization. Withrespect to the securitizations conducted by CPS in 2017, only 80% of such amounts are included in the collateral. On each monthlypayment date, the 2018-1 Notes are entitled to interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessary tomaintain a specified minimum collateral ratio.     Securitization TrustDebt.    Since 2011, we treated all 37 of our securitizations of automobile contracts as secured financings for financialaccounting purposes, and the asset-backed securities issued in such securitizations remain on our consolidated balance sheet assecuritization trust debt. We had $1,803.7 million of securitization trust debt outstanding at December 31, 2020.     Subordinated RenewableNotes Debt.    In June 2005, we began issuing registered subordinated renewable notes in an ongoing offering to thepublic. Upon maturity, the notes are automatically renewed for the same term as the maturing notes, unless we repay the notes orthe investor notifies us within 15 days after the maturity date of his note that he wants it repaid. Renewed notes bear interestat the rate we are offering at that time to other investors with similar note maturities. Based on the terms of the individualnotes, interest payments may be required monthly, quarterly, annually or upon maturity. At December 31, 2020 there were $21.3 millionof such notes outstanding.     We must comply withcertain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certainfinancial ratios related to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividendrestrictions. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that wouldallow certain creditors to declare default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2020, we were incompliance with all such covenants.     Forward-looking Statements     This report on Form10-K includes certain "forward-looking statements". Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of wordssuch as "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "estimates," or words of like meaning. As tothe specifically identified forward-looking statements, factors that could affect charge-offs and recovery rates include unexpectedexogenous events, such as a widespread plague that might affect the ability or willingness of obligors to pay pursuant to the termsof contracts; mandates imposed in reaction to such events, such as prohibitions of otherwise permissible activity, which mightimpair the obligation to perform contracts, or the abilty of obligors to earn; changes in the general economic climate, which couldaffect the willingness or ability of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of contracts; changes in laws respecting consumer finance,which could affect our ability to enforce rights under contracts; and changes in the market for used vehicles, which could affectthe levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles. Factors that could affect our revenues in the current year includethe levels of cash releases from existing pools of contracts, which would affect our ability to purchase contracts, the terms onwhich we are able to finance such purchases, the willingness of dealers to sell contracts to us on the terms that it offers, andthe terms on which we are able to complete term securitizations once contracts are acquired. Factors that could affect our expensesin the current year include competitive conditions in the market for qualified personnel, investor demand for asset-backed securitiesand interest rates (which affect the rates that we pay on asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations). The statementsconcerning structuring securitization transactions as secured financings and the effects of such structures on financial itemsand on future profitability also are forward-looking statements. Any change to the structure of our securitization transactioncould cause such forward-looking statements to be inaccurate. Both the amount of the effect of the change in structure on our profitabilityand the duration of the period in which our profitability would be affected by the change in securitization structure are estimates.The accuracy of such estimates will be affected by the rate at which we purchase and sell contracts, any changes in that rate,the credit performance of such contracts, the financial terms of future securitizations, any changes in such terms over time, andother factors that generally affect our profitability.            56           Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures AboutMarket Risk     Interest Rate Risk     We are subject to interestrate risk during the period between when contracts are purchased from dealers and when such contracts become part of a term securitization.Specifically, the interest rate due on our warehouse credit facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the contractsare fixed. Therefore, if interest rates increase, the interest we must pay to our lenders under warehouse credit facilities islikely to increase while the interest we receive from warehoused automobile contracts remains the same. As a result, excess spreadcash flow would likely decrease during the warehousing period. Additionally, automobile contracts warehoused and then securitizedduring a rising interest rate environment may result in less excess spread cash flow to us. Historically, our securitization facilitieshave paid fixed rate interest to security holders set at prevailing interest rates at the time of the closing of the securitization,which may not take place until several months after we purchased those contracts. Our customers, on the other hand, pay fixed ratesof interest on the automobile contracts, set at the time they purchase the underlying vehicles. A decrease in excess spread cashflow could adversely affect our earnings and cash flow.     To mitigate, but noteliminate, the short-term risk relating to interest rates payable under the warehouse facilities, we have historically held automobilecontracts in the warehouse credit facilities for less than four months. To mitigate, but not eliminate, the long-term risk relatingto interest rates payable by us in securitizations, we have structured our term securitization transactions to include pre-fundingstructures, whereby the amount of notes issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts. We expect to continueto use pre-funding structures in our securitizations. In pre-funding, the proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrowaccount until we sell the additional contracts to the trust. In pre-funded securitizations, we lock in the borrowing costs withrespect to the contracts we subsequently deliver to the securitization trust. However, we incur an expense in pre-funded securitizationsequal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contractsand the interest rate paid on the notes outstanding. The amount of such expense may vary. Despite these mitigation strategies,an increase in prevailing interest rates would cause us to receive less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thuscould adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.     Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
