Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysisof Financial Condition and Results of Operations     The following discussion and analysis shouldbe read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or incorporatedby reference herein.     Overview     We are a specialty finance company. Ourbusiness is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and, to alesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passengervans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credithistories, low incomes or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financingfor dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, suchas commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In additionto purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we have also (i) acquired installment purchase contracts infour merger and acquisition transactions, (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loans from non-affiliatedlenders, and (iii) directly originated an immaterial amount of vehicle purchase money loans by lending money directly to consumers.In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as "automobile contracts."     We were incorporated and began our operationsin March 1991. From inception through December 31, 2018, we have originated a total of approximately $15.2 billion of automobilecontracts, primarily by purchasing retail installment sales contracts from dealers, and to a lesser degree, by originating loanssecured by automobiles directly with consumers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobilecontracts in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and, most recently, in September 2011. The September 2011 acquisitionconsisted of approximately $217.8 million of automobile contracts that we purchased from Fireside Bank of Pleasanton, California.In 2004 and 2009, we were appointed as a third-party servicer for certain portfolios of automobile contracts originated and ownedby non-affiliated entities. Recent contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels are shown in the table below:        Contract Purchases and Outstanding Managed Portfolio            $ in thousands     Year      Contracts  Purchased  in Period      Managed  Portfolio  at Period End     2008      $ 296,817      $ 1,664,122     2009        8,599        1,194,722     2010        113,023        756,203     2011        284,236        794,649     2012        551,742        897,575     2013        764,087        1,231,422     2014        944,944        1,643,920     2015        1,060,538        2,031,136     2016        1,088,785        2,308,070     2017        859,069        2,333,530     2018        902,416        2,380,847        Our principal executiveoffices are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Creditand underwriting functions are performed primarily in that California branch with certain of these functions also performed inour Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida and Illinoisbranches.               34           The programs we offerto dealers and consumers are intended to serve a wide range of sub-prime customers, primarily through franchised new car dealers.We originate automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizationsare transactions in which we sell a specified pool of contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours, which in turn issues asset-backedsecurities to fund the purchase of the pool of contracts from us.     Securitization and Warehouse Credit Facilities     Throughout the periodfor which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing themon a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financingshave involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to oneof our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Dependingon the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobilecontracts or as secured financings.     When structured to betreated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobilecontracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically(i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transactionand (iii) record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts.     Since 1994 we haveconducted 80 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated. As of December 31, 2018, 19 of those securitizationsare active, all of which are structured as secured financings. From 1994 through April 2008 we generally utilized financial guaranteesfor the senior asset-backed notes issued in the securitization. Since September 2010 we have utilized senior subordinated structureswithout any financial guarantees. We have generally conducted our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the end of each calendarquarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, in 2015, we elected to defer what would have been our Decembersecuritization in favor of a securitization in January 2016, and since that time have generally conducted our securitizations nearthe beginning of each calendar quarter.     Our history of term securitizations, overthe most recent ten years, is summarized in the table below:        Recent Asset-Backed Term Securitizations            $ in thousands     Period      Number of Term Securitizations      Amount of Receivables     2008        2        509,022     2009        0        –     2010        1        103,772     2011        3        335,593     2012        4        603,500     2013        4        778,000     2014        4        923,000     2015        3        795,000     2016        4        1,214,997     2017        4        870,000     2018        4        883,452                 35           Generally, prior to a securitization transactionwe fund our automobile contract purchases primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term fundingcapacity is $300 million, comprising three credit facilities. The first $100 million credit facility was established in May 2012.This facility was most recently renewed in September 2018, extending the revolving period to September 2020, and adding an amortizationperiod through September 2021. In April 2015, we entered into a second $100 million facility. This facility was renewed in April2017 and again in February 2019, extending the revolving period to February 2021, followed by an amortization period to April 2023.In November 2015, we entered into a third $100 million facility. This facility was renewed in November 2017, extending the revolvingperiod to November 2019, followed by an amortization period to November 2021.     In a securitization and in our warehousecredit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representationsand warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representationsor warranties, we will be obligated to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accruedand unpaid interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchasethe contract at a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourseagainst dealers, we will bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase.     Whether a securitization is treated as asecured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to releaseexcess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Suchreleases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performanceof securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations,regardless of whether such automobile contracts are treated as having been sold or as having been financed.     Critical Accounting Policies     We believe that our accounting policiesrelated to (a) Finance Receivables at Fair Value, (b) Allowance for Finance Credit Losses, (c) Amortization of Deferred OriginationCosts and Acquisition Fees, (d) Term Securitizations, (e) Accrual for Contingent Liabilities and (f) Income Taxes are the mostcritical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Such policies are described below.     Allowance for Finance Credit Losses     In order to estimate an appropriate allowancefor losses incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as  " staticpooling, "  which stratifies our finance receivable portfoliointo separately identified pools based on the period of origination. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimatean allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonablyestimated in our portfolio of automobile contracts. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. Weevaluate the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, prospective liquidationvalues of the underlying collateral and general economic and market conditions. As circumstances change, our level of provisioningand/or allowance may change as well. Receivables acquired after 2017, are accounted for using fair value and will have no allowancefor finance credit losses in accordance with the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables.               36           Broad economic factors such as recessionand significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted averageage of the receivables at any given time. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lowerlevels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and losses graduallyincreasing to a peak between 36 and 42 months, after which they gradually decrease. The historical weighted average seasoning ofour total owned portfolio including Finance Receivables at Fair Value, is summarized in the table below:        December 31,      Weighted Average Age in Months of Owned Portfolio     2009        33     2010        37     2011        27     2012        18     2013        14     2014        14     2015        16     2016        18     2017        21     2018        23         The credit performance of our portfoliois also significantly influenced by our underwriting guidelines and credit criteria we use when evaluating contracts for purchasefrom dealers. We regularly evaluate our portfolio credit performance and modify our purchase criteria to maximize the credit performanceof our portfolio, while maintaining competitive programs and levels of service for our dealers.     We generally do not lower the contractualinterest rate or waive or forgive principal when our borrowers incur financial difficulty on either a temporary or permanent basis.An exception to this policy is when a court order mandates the terms of the contract to be modified, such as in a Chapter 13 bankruptcyproceeding. In such cases, which represent an immaterial portion of our portfolio of finance receivables, we have estimated theamount of impairment that results from such modification and established an appropriate allowance within our Allowance for FinanceCredit Losses.     Finance Receivables Measured at FairValue     Effective January 1,2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For each finance receivableacquired after 2017, we consider the price paid on the purchase date as the fair value for such receivable.  We estimate thecash to be received in the future with respect to such receivables, based on our experience with similar receivables acquired inthe past.  We then compute the internal rate of return that results in the present value of those estimated cash receiptsbeing equal to the purchase date fair value. Thereafter, we recognize interest income on such receivables on a level yield basisusing that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. Cash received with respect to such receivables is applied firstagainst such interest income, and then to reduce the carrying value of the receivables.     We re-evaluate thefair value of such receivables at the close of each measurement period. If the reevaluation were to yield a value materially differentfrom the carrying value, an adjustment would be required.               37           Anticipated creditlosses are included in our estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables.  Because such credit losses areincluded in our computation of the appropriate level yield, we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses, asour best estimate of the lifetime aggregate of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also because we include anticipatedcredit losses in our computation of the level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractualrate applicable to the receivables. Because our initial carrying value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, ratherthan as the contractual principal balance, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables,nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the periodincurred.     Amortization of Deferred Originations Costsand Acquisition Fees     Upon purchase of a contract from a dealer,we generally either charge or advance the dealer an acquisition fee. In addition, we incur certain direct costs associated withacquisitions of our contracts. All such acquisition fees and direct costs are applied to the carrying value of finance receivablesand are accreted into earnings as an adjustment to the yield over the estimated life of the contract using the interest method.Receivables acquired after 2017 are accounted for using fair value. In accordance with the fair value method of accounting forfinance receivables, any dealer acquisition fees will be incorporated into acquisition price of the receivables and no direct costswill be deferred.     Term Securitizations     Our term securitization structure has generallybeen as follows:     We sell automobile contracts we acquireto a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling our automobilecontracts. The special-purpose subsidiary then transfers the same automobile contracts to another entity, typically a statutorytrust. The trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities, in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principalbalance of the automobile contracts. We typically sell these automobile contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse,except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to us are provided by us to the trust. One ormore investors purchase the asset-backed securities issued by the trust; the proceeds from the sale of the asset-backed securitiesare then used to purchase the automobile contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated asset-backed securities issued bythe trust or by a related entity.     We structure our securitizations to includeinternal credit enhancement for the benefit the investors (i) in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account ( " spreadaccount " ) held by the trust, (ii) in the form of overcollateralizationof the senior asset-backed securities, where the principal balance of the senior asset-backed securities issued is less than theprincipal balance of the automobile contracts, (iii) in the form of subordinated asset-backed securities, or (iv) some combinationof such internal credit enhancements. The agreements governing the securitization transactions require that the initial level ofinternal credit enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the automobile contracts until the level of internalcredit enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentageof the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related automobile contracts. The specified levels at which the internal creditenhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of automobile contracts held by the trustsand on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among us, our special purpose subsidiary, the insurance company, ifany, and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios,and have also varied from one transaction to another. The agreements governing the securitizations generally grant us the optionto repurchase the sold automobile contracts from the trust when the aggregate outstanding balance of the automobile contracts hasamortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance.     Upon each transfer of automobile contractsin a transaction structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes, we retain on our consolidated balance sheetthe related automobile contracts as assets and record the asset-backed notes or loans issued in the transaction as indebtedness.               38           We receive periodic base servicing feesfor the servicing and collection of the automobile contracts. Under our securitization structures treated as secured financingsfor financial accounting purposes, such servicing fees are included in interest income from the automobile contracts. In addition,we are entitled to the cash flows from the trusts that represent collections on the automobile contracts in excess of the amountsrequired to pay principal and interest on the asset-backed securities, base servicing fees, and certain other fees and expenses(such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the asset-backed notes are generally defined as the paymentssufficient to keep the principal balance of such notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related automobile contracts(excluding those automobile contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentageis less than 100%, the related securitization agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance ofthe asset-backed securities is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create overcollateralizationof the asset-backed notes.     If the amount of cash required for paymentof fees, expenses, interest and principal on the senior asset-backed notes exceeds the amount collected during the collection period,the shortfall is withdrawn from the spread account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessaryfor the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated asset-backed notes, and there is no shortfall inthe related spread account or the required overcollateralization level, the excess is released to us. If the spread account andovercollateralization is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the trust until the specifiedlevel is achieved. Although spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of our special-purpose subsidiaries as theowner of the residual interests (in the case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes)or the trusts (in the case of securitization transactions structured as secured financings for financial accounting purposes),we are restricted in use of the cash in the spread accounts. Cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality,liquid investment securities, as specified in the securitization agreements. The interest rate payable on the automobile contractsis significantly greater than the interest rate on the asset-backed notes. As a result, the residual interests described abovehistorically have been a significant asset of ours.     In all of our term securitizations and warehousecredit facilities, whether treated as secured financings or as sales, we have sold the automobile contracts (through a subsidiary)to the securitization entity. The difference between the two structures is that in securitizations that are treated as securedfinancings we report the assets and liabilities of the securitization trust on our consolidated balance sheet. Under both structures,recourse to us by holders of the asset-backed securities and by the trust, for failure of the automobile contract obligors to makepayments on a timely basis, is limited to the automobile contracts included in the securitizations or warehouse credit facilities,the spread accounts and our retained interests in the respective trusts.     Accrual for Contingent Liabilities     We are routinely involved in various legalproceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Our legal counsel hasadvised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indication that it isboth probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined.     We have recorded a liability as of December31, 2018, which represents our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies at that date. The amount of lossesthat may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, webelieve that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies described or referenced above,as of December 31, 2018, and in excess of the liability we have recorded, does not exceed $3 million.     Accordingly, we believe that the ultimateresolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies, after taking into account our current litigation reserves, should not havea material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherentin contested proceedings, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceedthe reserves we have accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to our operating results for a particularperiod, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period.             39           Income Taxes     We account for income taxes under the assetand liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequencesof events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determinedbased on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effectfor the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilitiesis recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.     Deferred tax assets are recognized subjectto management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred taxasset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assetwill not be realized. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified.     In determining the possible future realizationof deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversal of taxable temporarydifferences; and (b) forecasted future net earnings from operations. Based upon those considerations, we have concluded that itis more likely than not that the U.S. and state net operating loss carryforward periods provide enough time to utilize the deferredtax assets pertaining to the existing net operating loss carryforwards and any net operating loss that would be created by thereversal of the future net deductions which have not yet been taken on a tax return. Our estimates of taxable income are forward-lookingstatements, and there can be no assurance that our estimates of such taxable income will be correct. Factors discussed under "RiskFactors," and in particular under the subheading "Risk Factors -- Forward-Looking Statements" may affect whethersuch projections prove to be correct.     We recognize interest and penalties relatedto unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accruedinterest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.     Uncertainty of Capital Markets and General Economic Conditions     We depend upon the availability of warehousecredit facilities and access to long-term financing through the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by our automobilecontracts. Since 1994, we have completed 80 term securitizations of approximately $13.4 billion in contracts. From the fourth quarterof 2007 through the end of 2009, we observed unprecedented adverse changes in the market for securitized pools of automobile contracts.These changes included reduced liquidity, and reduced demand for asset-backed securities, particularly for securities carryinga financial guaranty and for securities backed by sub-prime automobile receivables. Moreover, during that period many of the firmsthat previously provided financial guarantees, which were an integral part of our securitizations, suspended offering such guarantees.These adverse changes caused us to conserve liquidity by significantly reducing our purchases of automobile contracts. However,since September 2009 we have established new funding facilities and gradually increased our contract purchases and the frequencyand amount of our term securitizations.     Financial Covenants      Certain of our securitization transactionsand our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results.Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition,certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditorsto declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2018 we were in compliance with all suchfinancial covenants.               40           Results of Operations     Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December31, 2018 with the year ended December 31, 2017     Revenues .  During the yearended December 31, 2018, our revenues were $389.8 million, a decrease of $44.6 million, or 10.3%, from the prior year revenuesof $434.4 million. The primary reason for the decrease in revenues is a decrease in interest income. Interest income for the yearended December 31, 2017 decreased $43.9 million, or 10.3%, to $380.3 million from $424.2 million in the prior year. The primaryreason for the decrease in interest income is the lower interest yield on the receivables measured at fair value. The interestyield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yieldon other finance receivables. The table below shows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held by consolidatedsubsidiaries for the year months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:             Year Ended December 31,          2018      2017          (Dollars in thousands)          Average             Interest      Average             Interest          Balance      Interest      Yield      Balance      Interest      Yield     Interest Earning Assets                                                         Finance receivables    $ 1,860,388      $ 336,434        18.1%      $ 2,299,218      $ 424,174        18.4%     Finance receivables measured at fair value      447,167        43,863        9.8%        –        –        –     Total    $ 2,307,555      $ 380,297        16.5%      $ 2,299,218      $ 424,174        18.4%         Other income decreased by $730,000, or 7.2%, to$9.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 from $10.2 million during the prior year. The decrease in other income resultedfrom a decrease of $600,000 in revenues associated with direct mail and other related products and services that we offer to ourdealers, and a decrease of $200,000 in payments from third-party providers of convenience fees paid by our customers for web basedand other electronic payments.      Expenses .  Our operating expenses consist largelyof provision for credit losses, interest expense, employee costs and general and administrative expenses. Provision for creditlosses and interest expense are significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-monthperiod and by the outstanding balance of finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries (other than our portfolio of financereceivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the interest rate applicableto such receivables). Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contractsare received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobilefinance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level.     Employee costs include base salaries, commissionsand bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options, and are oneof our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with thelevel of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced.     Other operating expenses consist largely offacilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, marketing and advertisingexpenses, and depreciation and amortization.     Total operating expenses were $371.1 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $402.3 million for the prior year, a decrease of $31.2 million, or 7.8%. Thedecrease is primarily due to a decrease in provision for credit losses, offsetting increases in employee costs, interest expense,marketing and general and administrative expenses.               41           Employee costs increased by $6.4 million or8.7%, to $79.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, representing 21.4% of total operating expenses, from $73.0 millionfor the prior year, or 18.1% of total operating expenses. Employee costs for the prior year period were net of $5.4 million ofdirect employee costs associated with the originations of contracts during that period. Such deferred costs are then recognizedover the life of the related receivables using the interest method. The table below summarizes our employees by category as wellas contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2018 and 2017:             December 31, 2018      December 31, 2017          Amount      Amount          ($ in millions)     Contracts purchased (dollars)    $ 902.4      $ 859.1     Contracts purchased (units)      52,731        52,643     Managed portfolio outstanding (dollars)    $ 2,380.8      $ 2,333.5     Managed portfolio outstanding (units)      176,042        177,760                           Number of Originations staff      215        212     Number of Marketing staff      132        120     Number of Servicing staff      610        597     Number of other staff      75        70     Total number of employees      1,032        999         General and administrative expenses includecosts associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, creditservices, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $31.0 million, an increase of $4.5 million, or 16.8%,compared to the previous year and represented 8.4% of total operating expenses.     Interest expense for the year ended December31, 2018 increased by $9.1 million to $101.5 million, or 9.9%, compared to $92.3 million in the previous year.     Interest on securitizationtrust debt increased by $6.8 million, or 8.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. The average balanceof securitization trust debt decreased 1.5% to $2,140.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2,172.1 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, the blended interest rates on our term securitizations have generally increasedsince June 2014. As a result, the cost of securitization debt during the year ended December 31, 2018 was 4.2%, compared to 3.8%in the prior year period. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately theresult of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds arepriced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demandfor our bonds at the time of the securitization. These and other factors have resulted in a general trend toward higher securitizationtrust debt interest costs in 2018 compared to 2017. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are summarized inthe table below:        Blended Cost of Funds on Recent Asset-Backed Term Securitizations              Period      Blended Cost of Funds     January 2017      3.91%     April 2017      3.45%     July 2017      3.52%     October 2017      3.39%     January 2018      3.46%     April 2018      3.98%     July 2018      4.18%     October 2018      4.22%                   42           The annualized averagerate on our securitization trust debt was 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 3.8% in the prior year. The annualizedaverage rate is influenced by the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increaseover time on any particular securitization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repaymentof the shorter term, lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds.     Interest expense on our subordinated debtincreased by $117,000, or 8.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. The increase was the result ofan increase in the average interest rate on our subordinated renewable notes to 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from8.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was also the result of an increase in the average balance of the notesfrom $16.0 million in the prior year to $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.     Interest expense on residual interest financingwas $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. There was no residual interest financing debt outstanding during 2017.     Interest expense on warehouse lines of creditdecreased by $181,000, or 2.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. The decrease is due primarily toa decrease in the average interest rate on our warehouse credit line debt from 12.7% in 2017 to 11.6% in 2018. However, most ofthe decrease in interest expense was offset by higher utilization of our warehouse lines in 2018 compared to 2017.     The following table presents the componentsof interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:              Year Ended December 31,         2018      2017         (Dollars in thousands)                       Annualized                    Annualized         Average             Average      Average             Average         Balance (1)      Interest      Yield/Rate      Balance (1)      Interest      Yield/Rate   Interest Earning Assets                                                       Finance receivables gross (2)     $ 1,860,388      $ 336,434        18.1%      $ 2,299,218      $ 424,174      18.4%   Finance receivables at fair value       447,167        43,863        9.8%        –        –      -           2,307,555        380,297        16.5%        2,299,218        424,174                                                                   Interest Bearing Liabilities                                                       Warehouse lines of credit     $ 66,984        7,752        11.6%      $ 62,353        7,933      12.7%   Residual interest financing       25,000        2,343        9.4%        –        –      -   Securitization trust debt       2,140,093        89,926        4.2%        2,172,145        83,084      3.8%   Subordinated renewable notes       16,533        1,445        8.7%        16,028        1,328      8.3%         $ 2,248,610        101,466        4.5%      $ 2,250,526        92,345      4.1%                                                           Net interest income/spread              $ 278,831                        $ 331,829           Net interest margin (3)                         12.1%                        14.4%   Ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities       103%                          102%                            (1)  Average balances are based on month end balances except for warehouse lines of credit, which are based on daily balances        (2)  Net of deferred fees and direct costs        (3)  Net interest income divided by average interest earning assets             43                  Year Ended December 31, 2018          Compared to December 31, 2017          Total      Change Due      Change Due          Change      to Volume      to Rate     Interest Earning Assets    (In thousands)     Finance receivables gross    $ (87,740 )    $ (80,958 )    $ (6,782 )   Finance receivables at fair value      43,863        43,863        –            (43,877 )      (37,095 )      (6,782 )   Interest Bearing Liabilities                              Warehouse lines of credit      (181 )      589        (770 )   Residual interest financing      2,343        2,343        –     Securitization trust debt      6,842        (1,226 )      8,068     Subordinated renewable notes      117        42        75            9,121        1,748        7,373                                    Net interest income/spread    $ (52,998 )    $ (38,843 )    $ (14,155 )      Provision for credit losses was $133.1 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $53.6 million, or 28.7% compared to the prior year and represented 35.9% oftotal operating expenses. The provision for credit losses maintains the allowance for finance credit losses at levels that we feelare adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated. Finance receivables that we have originatedsince January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognize interest income underthe interest method on a level yield basis based on forecasted future cash flows net of expected credit losses. Thus, no provisionfor credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value. This is the primary reason for the reductionin provision for credit losses in 2018.     Marketing expenses consist primarily of commission-basedcompensation paid to our employee marketing representatives. Our marketing representatives earn a salary plus commissions basedon volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers, such as training programs,internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Marketing expenses increased by $2.0 million, or 12.5%, to $17.6 million duringthe year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $15.6 million in the prior year, and represented 4.7% of total operating expenses.For the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased 52,731 contracts representing $902.4 million in receivables compared to 52,643contracts representing $859.1 million in receivables in the prior year.     Occupancy expenses increased by $445,000 or6.2%, to $7.6 million compared to $7.2 million in the previous year and represented 2.1% of total operating expenses.     Depreciation and amortization expenses increasedby $58,000 or 6.2%, to $992,000 compared to $934,000 in the previous year and represented 0.3% of total operating expenses.     For the year ended December 31, 2018,we recorded income tax expense of $3.8 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 20.5%. This includes $2.1million of income tax benefit related to certain tax planning strategies and other adjustments. Excluding the impact of thetax benefit, the effective tax rate for 2018 would have been 31.8%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded incometax expense of $28.3 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 88.3%. This includes $15.1 million of income taxexpense related to the effects of the Tax Act, which are required to be recorded in the period of enactment. Excluding theimpact of the Tax Act, the effective tax rate for 2017 would have been 41.1%.               44           Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December31, 2017 with the year ended December 31, 2016     Revenues .  During the year ended December 31,2017, our revenues were $434.4 million, an increase of $12.1 million, or 2.9%, from the prior year revenues of $422.3 million.The primary reason for the increase in revenues is an increase in interest income. Interest income for the year ended December31, 2017 increased $15.2 million, or 3.7%, to $424.2 million from $409.0 million in the prior year. The primary reason for theincrease in interest income is the increase in finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries, which increased from $2,307.9million at December 31, 2016 to $2,333.5 million at December 31, 2017.     Other income decreased by $3.1 million, or23.2%, to $10.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 from $13.3 million during the prior year. The decrease in otherincome resulted from a decrease of $2.8 million in revenues associated with direct mail and other related products and servicesthat we offer to our dealers, a decrease of $245,000 in payments from third-party providers of convenience fees paid by our customersfor web based and other electronic payments and a decrease of $203,000 in recoveries on previously charged off receivables.     Expenses .  Our operating expenses consist largelyof provision for credit losses, interest expense, employee costs and general and administrative expenses. Provision for creditlosses and interest expense are significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-monthperiod and by the outstanding balance of finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries. Employee costs and general andadministrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors thataffect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factorssuch as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level.     Employee costs include base salaries, commissionsand bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options, and are oneof our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with thelevel of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced.     Other operating expenses consist largely offacilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, marketing and advertisingexpenses, and depreciation and amortization.     Total operating expenses were $402.3 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $372.6 million for the prior year, an increase of $29.7 million, or 8.0%. Theincrease is primarily due to the increase in interest expense, provision for credit losses and servicing costs.     Employee costs increased by $7.4 million or11.3%, to $73.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, representing 18.1% of total operating expenses, from $65.5 millionfor the prior year, or 17.6% of total operating expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we added Servicing staff toaccommodate the increase in the number of accounts in our managed portfolio. The table below summarizes our employees by categoryas well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2017 and 2016:             December 31, 2017      December 31, 2016          Amount      Amount          ($ in millions)     Contracts purchased (dollars)    $ 859.1      $ 1,088.8     Contracts purchased (units)      52,643        66,527     Managed portfolio outstanding (dollars)    $ 2,333.5      $ 2,308.1     Managed portfolio outstanding (units)      177,760        169,720                           Number of Originations staff      212        215     Number of Marketing staff      120        114     Number of Servicing staff      572        542     Number of other staff      95        89     Total number of employees      999        960                 45           General and administrative expenses includecosts associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, creditservices, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $26.6 million, an increase of $1.8 million, or 7.0%,compared to the previous year and represented 6.6% of total operating expenses.     Interest expense for the year ended December31, 2017 increased by $12.4 million to $92.3 million, or 15.5%, compared to $79.9 million in the previous year.     Interest on securitizationtrust debt increased by $13.9 million, or 20.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. The average balanceof securitization trust debt increased 4.7% to $2,172.1 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $2,075.1 million at December 31,2016. In addition, the blended interest rates on our term securitizations have generally increased since June 2014. As a result,the cost of securitization debt during the year ended December 31, 2017 was 3.8%, compared to 3.3% in the prior year period. Forany particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the result of many factors includingthe market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are priced and the margin over thosebenchmarks that investors are willing accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand for our bonds at the time of thesecuritization. These and other factors have resulted in a general trend toward higher securitization trust debt interest costssince June 2014, although that trend has reversed somewhat since July 2016. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizationsare summarized in the table below:        Blended Cost of Funds on Recent Asset-Backed Term Securitizations              Period      Blended Cost of Funds     June 2014      2.37%     September 2014      2.71%     December 2014      3.07%     March 2015      3.04%     June 2015      3.18%     September 2015      3.78%     January 2016      4.34%     April 2016      4.65%     July 2016      4.48%     October 2016      3.66%     January 2017      3.91%     April 2017      3.45%     July 2017      3.52%     October 2017      3.39%        The annualized averagerate on our securitization trust debt was 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.3% in the prior year. The annualizedaverage rate is influenced by the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increaseover time on any particular securitization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repaymentof the shorter term, lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds.     Interest expense on our subordinated debtdecreased by $20,000, or 1.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. The reduction was the result ofa decrease in the average interest rate on our subordinated renewable notes to 8.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 8.9%for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was mostly offset by an increase in the average balance of the notes from $15.1million in the prior year to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.               46           Interest expense on residual interest financingwas $846,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016. This debt was repaid in full in November 2016.     Interest expense on warehouse lines of creditdecreased by $636,000, or 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. The decrease is due primarily tolower utilization of our warehouse lines in 2017 compared to 2016.     The following table presents the componentsof interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:              Year Ended December 31,         2017   2016         (Dollars in thousands)                       Annualized                    Annualized         Average             Average      Average             Average         Balance (1)      Interest      Yield/Rate      Balance (1)      Interest      Yield/Rate   Interest Earning Assets                                                       Finance receivables gross (2)     $ 2,299,218      $ 424,174        18.4%      $ 2,188,852      $ 408,996      18.7%                                                           Interest Bearing Liabilities                                                       Warehouse lines of credit     $ 62,353        7,933        12.7%      $ 76,208        8,569      11.2%   Residual interest financing       –        –        –        6,413        846      13.2%   Securitization trust debt       2,172,145        83,084        3.8%        2,075,127        69,178      3.3%   Subordinated renewable notes       16,028        1,328        8.3%        15,062        1,348      8.9%         $ 2,250,526        92,345        4.1%      $ 2,172,810        79,941      3.7%                                                           Net interest income/spread              $ 331,829                        $ 329,055           Net interest margin (3)                         14.4%                        15.0%   Ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities       102%                          101%                            (1)  Average balances are based on month end balances except for warehouse lines of credit, which are based on daily balances.        (2)  Net of deferred fees and direct costs.        (3)  Net interest income divided by average interest earning assets.                47                  Year Ended December 31, 2017          Compared to December 31, 2016          Total      Change Due      Change Due          Change      to Volume      to Rate     Interest Earning Assets    (In thousands)     Finance receivables gross    $ 15,178      $ 20,622      $ (5,444 )                                  Interest Bearing Liabilities                              Warehouse lines of credit      (636 )      (1,558 )      922     Residual interest financing      (846 )      (846 )      –     Securitization trust debt      13,906        3,234        10,672     Subordinated renewable notes      (20 )      86        (106 )          12,404        916        11,488                                    Net interest income/spread    $ 2,774      $ 19,706      $ (16,932 )      Provision for credit losses was $186.7 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $8.2 million, or 4.6% compared to the prior year and represented 46.4% oftotal operating expenses. The provision for credit losses maintains the allowance for finance credit losses at levels that we feelare adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated. Our approach for establishing the allowancerequires greater amounts of provision for credit losses early in the terms of our finance receivables, and also takes into accountthe performance of the receivables. Consequently, the increase in provision expense is the result of the larger portfolio ownedby our consolidated subsidiaries compared to the prior year and an adverse trend in the performance of our receivables.     Marketing expenses consist primarily of commission-basedcompensation paid to our employee marketing representatives. Our marketing representatives earn a salary plus commissions basedon volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers, such as training programs,internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Marketing expenses decreased by $2.2 million, or 12.4%, to $15.6 million duringthe year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $17.8 million in the prior year, and represented 3.9% of total operating expenses.For the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased 52,643 contracts representing $859.1 million in receivables compared to 66,527contracts representing $1,088.8 million in receivables in the prior year.     Occupancy expenses increased by $2.0 millionor 38.1%, to $7.2 million compared to $5.2 million in the previous year and represented 1.8% of total operating expenses. The increasein occupancy expense is a result of leases for additional office space in Irvine, California and Las Vegas, Nevada.     Depreciation and amortization expenses increasedby $157,000 or 20.2%, to $934,000 compared to $777,000 in the previous year and represented 0.1% of total operating expenses.     For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recordedincome tax expense of $28.3 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 88.3%. This includes $15.1 million of incometax expense related to the effects of the Tax Act, which are required to be recorded in the period of enactment. Excluding theimpact of the Tax Act, the effective tax rate for 2017 would have been 41.1%. In 2016, we recorded $20.4 million of income taxexpense, representing a 41.0% effective income tax rate.             48           Liquidity and Capital Resources     Liquidity     Our business requires substantial cash tosupport our acquisitions of automobile contracts and other operating activities. Our primary sources of cash have been cash flowfrom operating activities, including proceeds from term securitization transactions and other sales of automobile contracts, amountsborrowed under warehouse credit facilities, servicing fees on portfolios of automobile contracts previously sold in securitizationtransactions or serviced for third parties, customer payments of principal and interest on finance receivables, fees for originationof automobile contracts, and releases of cash from securitized portfolios of automobile contracts in which we have retained a residualownership interest and the related spread accounts. Our primary uses of cash have been the acquisitions of automobile contracts,repayment of securitization trust debt, repayment of amounts borrowed under warehouse credit facilities, operating expenses suchas employee, interest, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses, the establishment of spread accounts andinitial overcollateralization, if any, and the increase of credit enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions,and income taxes. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet our cash demands. The sufficiencyof internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from thoseportfolios and their related spread accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in our managed portfolio, and the terms uponwhich we are able to purchase, sell, and borrow against automobile contracts.     Net cash provided by operating activitiesfor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $216.2 million, $215.6 million and $196.3 million, respectively. Net cashfrom operating activities is generally provided by net income from operations adjusted for significant non-cash items such as ourprovision for credit losses and accretion of deferred acquisition fees.     Net cash used in investingactivities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $242.2 million, $210.6 million and $437.8 million, respectively.Cash provided by investing activities primarily results from principal payments and other proceeds received on finance receivablesheld for investment. Cash used in investing activities generally relates to acquisitions of finance receivables. Acquisitions offinance receivables held for investment were $914.9 million (includes acquisition fees paid), $859.1 million and $1,088.8 millionin 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.     Net cash provided by financing activitiesfor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016 was $31.4 million and $242.8 million, respectively. Net cash used in financing activitiesfor the year ended December 31, 2017 was $7.0 million. Cash used or provided by financing activities is primarily attributableto the repayment or issuance of debt, and in particular, securitization trust debt and portfolio acquisition financing. We issued$855.8 million in new securitization trust debt in 2018 compared to $852.6 million in 2017 and $1,197.5 million in 2016. Repaymentsof securitization debt were $876.1 million, $851.2 million and $834.9 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.     We purchase automobile contracts from dealersfor a cash price approximating their principal amount, adjusted for an acquisition fee which may either increase or decrease theautomobile contract purchase price. Those automobile contracts generate cash flow, however, over a period of years. As a result,we have been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase automobile contracts and on access to the asset-backed securitizationmarket for long-term financing of our portfolio of automobile contracts. In addition, from time to time, we have relied on theavailability of cash from outside sources in order to finance our continuing operations, as well as to fund the portion of automobilecontract purchase prices not financed under revolving warehouse credit facilities.     The acquisition of automobile contractsfor subsequent financing in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization,if any, and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. Theamount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initialcredit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established trusts and their related spread accountseither release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. Of those, the factor most subjectto our control is the rate at which we acquire automobile contracts.         49           We are and may in the future be limitedin our ability to purchase automobile contracts due to limits on our capital. As of December 31, 2018, we had unrestricted cashof $12.8 million. We had an aggregate of $161.9 million available under our three $100 million warehouse credit facilities (subjectto available eligible collateral and our own capital). During 2018 we completed four securitizations aggregating $883.5 millionof receivables, and we intend to continue completing securitizations regularly during 2019, although there can be no assurancethat we will be able to do so. Our plans to manage our liquidity include maintaining our rate of automobile contract purchasesat a level that matches our available capital, and, as appropriate, minimizing our operating costs. If we are unable to completesuch securitizations, we may be unable to increase our rate of automobile contract purchases, in which case our interest incomeand other portfolio related income could decrease.     Our liquidity will also be affected by releasesof cash from the trusts established with our securitizations. While the specific terms and mechanics of each spread account varyamong transactions, our securitization agreements generally provide that we will receive excess cash flows, if any, only if theamount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and the delinquency, defaults or net losses related to the automobilecontracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies, defaults or net losses on the automobilecontracts exceed such levels, the terms of the securitization: (i) may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulated forthe particular pool; or (ii) in certain circumstances, may permit the transfer of servicing on some or all of the automobile contractsto another servicer. There can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will continue to generate sufficient cash.     We currently have and will continue to havea substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately $2,256.9 million of debt outstanding. Such debtconsisted primarily of $2,063.6 million of securitization trust debt, $136.8 million of warehouse lines of credit, $39.1 millionof residual interest financing debt and $17.3 million in subordinated renewable notes. We are also currently offering the subordinatedrenewable notes to the public on a continuous basis, and such notes have maturities that range from three months to 10 years.     Although we believe we are able to serviceand repay our debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If our plans for future operations do not generate sufficientcash flows and earnings, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. Failure to pay our indebtedness whendue could have a material adverse effect and may require us to issue additional debt or equity securities.     Contractual Obligations     The following table summarizes our materialcontractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):             Payment Due by Period (1)                     Less than        2 to 3        4 to 5        More than            Total        1 Year        Years        Years        5 Years     Long Term Debt (2)    $ 17,290      $ 6,867      $ 5,773      $ 1,973      $ 2,677     Operating Leases      30,942        7,684        15,064        7,505        689          (1) Securitization trust debt, in the aggregate amount of $2,063.6 million as of December 31, 2018, is omitted from this tablebecause it becomes due as and when the related receivables balance is reduced by payments and charge-offs. Expected payments, whichwill depend on the performance of such receivables, as to which there can be no assurance, are $780.0 million in 2019, $587.5 millionin 2020, $378.8 million in 2021, $194.6 million in 2022, $116.0 million in 2023, and $6.8 million in 2024.   (2) Long-term debt represents subordinated renewable notes.     We anticipate repayingdebt due in 2019 with a combination of cash flows from operations and the potential issuance of new debt.               50           Warehouse Credit Facilities     The terms on which credit has been availableto us for purchase of automobile contracts have varied in recent years, as shown in the following summary of our warehouse creditfacilities:     Facility Established in May 2012. On May 11, 2012, we entered into a $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A.

At December 31, 2018 there was no amount outstandingunder this facility.     Capital Resources     Securitization trust debt is repaid fromcollections on the related receivables, and becomes due in accordance with its terms as the principal amount of the related receivablesis reduced. Although the securitization trust debt also has alternative final maturity dates, those dates are significantly laterthan the dates at which repayment of the related receivables is anticipated, and at no time in our history have any of our sponsoredasset-backed securities reached those alternative final maturities.     The acquisition of automobile contractsfor subsequent transfer in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization,if any, when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavilydependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations,and the extent to which the trusts and related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitizedautomobile contracts. We plan to adjust our levels of automobile contract purchases and the related capital requirements to matchanticipated releases of cash from the trusts and related spread accounts.               51           Capitalization     Over the period from January 1, 2016 throughDecember 31, 2018 we have managed our capitalization by issuing and refinancing debt as summarized in the following table:             Year Ended December 31,          2018      2017      2016          (Dollars in thousands)     RESIDUAL INTEREST FINANCING:                              Beginning balance    $ –      $ –      $ 9,042     Issuances      40,000        –        –     Payments      –        –        (9,042 )   Capitalization of deferred financing costs      (1,081 )      –        –     Amortization of deferred financing costs      187        –        –     Ending balance    $ 39,106      $ –      $ –                                    SECURITIZATION TRUST DEBT:                              Beginning balance    $ 2,083,215      $ 2,080,900      $ 1,731,598     Issuances      855,828        852,615        1,197,515     Payments      (876,094 )      (851,193 )      (834,880 )   Amortization of discount      –        –        20     Reclassification of deferred financing costs      –        –        (11,579 )   Capitalization of deferred financing costs      (6,198 )      (6,104 )      (8,367 )   Amortization of deferred financing costs      6,876        6,997        6,593     Ending balance    $ 2,063,627      $ 2,083,215      $ 2,080,900                                    SUBORDINATED RENEWABLE NOTES:                              Beginning balance    $ 16,566      $ 14,949      $ 15,138     Issuances      3,175        4,083        2,911     Payments      (2,451 )      (2,466 )      (3,100 )   Ending balance    $ 17,290      $ 16,566      $ 14,949        Residual Interest Financing.     On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 millionsecuritization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualifiedinstitutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizationsconsecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residualinterests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto SecuritizationTrust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. As of December 31, 2018, $40.0 million of residual interest financingdebt remains outstanding. This amount does not exclude $894,000 in unamortized debt issuance costs. These debt issuance costs arepresented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the debt on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.             52           The agreed valuation of the collateral forthe 2018-1 Notes is the sum of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each related securitization and theover-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principal balances of therelated receivables less the principal balance of the outstanding notes issued in the related securitization. With respect to thesecuritizations conducted by CPS in 2017, only 80% of such amounts are included in the collateral. On each monthly payment date,the 2018-1 Notes are entitled to interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessary to maintain a specifiedminimum collateral ratio.     Securitization Trust Debt.   Since 2011, we treated all 30 of our securitizations of automobile contracts as secured financings for financial accounting purposes,and the asset-backed securities issued in such securitizations remain on our consolidated balance sheet as securitization trustdebt. We had $2,063.6 million of securitization trust debt outstanding at December 31, 2018.     Subordinated Renewable Notes Debt.   In June 2005, we began issuing registered subordinated renewable notes in an ongoing offering to the public. Upon maturity,the notes are automatically renewed for the same term as the maturing notes, unless we repay the notes or the investor notifiesus within 15 days after the maturity date of his note that he wants it repaid. Renewed notes bear interest at the rate we are offeringat that time to other investors with similar note maturities. Based on the terms of the individual notes, interest payments maybe required monthly, quarterly, annually or upon maturity. At December 31, 2018 there were $17.3 million of such notes outstanding.     We must comply with certain affirmativeand negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratiosrelated to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions.In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certaincreditors to declare default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance withall such covenants.     Forward-looking Statements     This report on Form 10-K includes certain " forward-looking statements ". Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as  " anticipates, "" expects, " " plans, "" estimates, "  or words of like meaning. As to thespecifically identified forward-looking statements, factors that could affect charge-offs and recovery rates include changes inthe general economic climate, which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of contracts,changes in laws respecting consumer finance, which could affect our ability to enforce rights under contracts, and changes in themarket for used vehicles, which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles. Factors that could affectour revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools of contracts, which would affect our abilityto purchase contracts, the terms on which we are able to finance such purchases, the willingness of dealers to sell contracts tous on the terms that it offers, and the terms on which we are able to complete term securitizations once contracts are acquired.Factors that could affect our expenses in the current year include competitive conditions in the market for qualified personnel,investor demand for asset-backed securities and interest rates (which affect the rates that we pay on asset-backed securities issuedin our securitizations). The statements concerning structuring securitization transactions as secured financings and the effectsof such structures on financial items and on future profitability also are forward-looking statements. Any change to the structureof our securitization transaction could cause such forward-looking statements to be inaccurate. Both the amount of the effect ofthe change in structure on our profitability and the duration of the period in which our profitability would be affected by thechange in securitization structure are estimates. The accuracy of such estimates will be affected by the rate at which we purchaseand sell contracts, any changes in that rate, the credit performance of such contracts, the financial terms of future securitizations,any changes in such terms over time, and other factors that generally affect our profitability.               53           Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures AboutMarket Risk     Interest Rate Risk     We are subject to interest rate risk duringthe period between when contracts are purchased from dealers and when such contracts become part of a term securitization. Specifically,the interest rate due on our warehouse credit facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the contracts are fixed. Therefore,if interest rates increase, the interest we must pay to our lenders under warehouse credit facilities is likely to increase whilethe interest we receive from warehoused automobile contracts remains the same. As a result, excess spread cash flow would likelydecrease during the warehousing period. Additionally, automobile contracts warehoused and then securitized during a rising interestrate environment may result in less excess spread cash flow to us. Historically, our securitization facilities have paid fixedrate interest to security holders set at prevailing interest rates at the time of the closing of the securitization, which maynot take place until several months after we purchased those contracts. Our customers, on the other hand, pay fixed rates of intereston the automobile contracts, set at the time they purchase the underlying vehicles. A decrease in excess spread cash flow couldadversely affect our earnings and cash flow.     To mitigate, but not eliminate, the short-termrisk relating to interest rates payable under the warehouse facilities, we have historically held automobile contracts in the warehousecredit facilities for less than four months. To mitigate, but not eliminate, the long-term risk relating to interest rates payableby us in securitizations, we have structured our term securitization transactions to include pre-funding structures, whereby theamount of notes issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts. We expect to continue to use pre-funding structuresin our securitizations. In pre-funding, the proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until we sell theadditional contracts to the trust. In pre-funded securitizations, we lock in the borrowing costs with respect to the contractswe subsequently deliver to the securitization trust. However, we incur an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the differencebetween the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interestrate paid on the notes outstanding. The amount of such expense may vary. Despite these mitigation strategies, an increase in prevailinginterest rates would cause us to receive less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affectour earnings and cash flows.     Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
