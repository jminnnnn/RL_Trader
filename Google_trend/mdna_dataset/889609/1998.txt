Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS     The following analysis of the financial condition of the Company should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report.     Overview     The Company specializes in the business of purchasing, selling and servicing retail automobile installment sales Contracts originated by Dealers in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans and has done so since its inception on March 8, 1991.  Through its purchases, the Company provides indirect financing to borrowers with limited credit histories, low incomes or past credit problems.     The Company generates earnings primarily from the gains recognized on the sale or securitization of its Contracts, servicing fees earned on Contracts sold, and interest earned on Contracts held for sale.  Earnings from gains on sale, interest and servicing fees for the year ended December 31, 1997, were $39.1 million, $23.5 million, and $14.5 million, respectively.  Such earnings for the year ended December 31, 1996, were $23.3 million, $20.0 million, and $7.9 million, respectively. For the nine-month period ended December 31, 1995, such earnings were $11.5 million, $9.2 million and $3.5 million, respectively. The Company's income is affected by losses incurred on Contracts, whether such Contracts are held for sale or have been sold in securitizations. The Company's cash requirements have been and will continue to be significant. Net cash used in operating activities for the year, ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the nine-month period ended December 31, 1995 were $26.1 million, $8.4 million and $18.5 million, respectively.     The Company purchases Contracts with the primary intention of reselling them to Investors as asset-backed securities through securitizations.  The securitizations are generally structured as follows: First, the Company sells a portfolio of Contracts to a wholly owned subsidiary ("SPS") which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the Company's Contracts. The SPS then transfers the same Contracts to either a Grantor Trust or an Owner Trust (the "Trust"), and the Trust in turn issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities (the "Certificates") generally in an amount equal to the aggregate principal balance of the Contracts. The Company typically sells these Contracts at face value and without recourse except that the normal representations and warranties provided by the Dealer to the Company are similarly provided by the Company to the Trust.  One or more investors purchase these Certificates; the proceeds from the sale of the certificates are then used to purchase the Contracts from the Company.  In addition, the Company provides a credit enhancement for the benefit of the investors in the form of an initial cash deposit to a specific account ("Spread Account") held by the Trust.  The Spread Account is required by the Servicing Agreement to be maintained at specified levels.     At the closing of each securitization, the Company removes from its consolidated balance sheet the Contracts held for sale and adds to its consolidated balance sheet (i) the cash received and (ii) the estimated fair value of the portion of the Contracts retained from the securitizations ("Residuals"), which consist of (a) the cash held in the Spread Account and (b) the net interest receivables ("NIRs").  NIRs represent the discounted cash flows to be received by the Trust in the future.  The excess of the cash received and the assets retained by the Company over the carrying value of the Contracts sold, less transaction costs, equals the net gain on sale of Contracts recorded by the Company.     The Company is not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of residuals, and accordingly, the Company determines the estimated fair value of the Residuals by discounting the expected excess cash flows released from the Spread Account (the cash out method) using a discount rate which the Company believes is commensurate with the risks involved.  The Company has utilized an effective discount rate of approximately 14% on the estimated cash flows released from the Spread Account to value the Residuals.       The Company receives periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the Contracts.  In addition, the Company is entitled to the cash flows from the Trusts that represent collections on the Contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay the Certificate principal and interest, the base servicing fees and certain other                                         17   Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. Form 10-K  December 31, 1997  fees such as trustee and custodial fees. At the end of each collection period, the aggregate cash collections from the Contracts are allocated first to the base servicing fees and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees for the period, then to the certificateholders for interest at the pass-through rate on the certificates plus principal as defined in the Servicing Agreements. If the amount of cash required for the above allocations exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is drawn from the Spread Account. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations, and there is no shortfall in the related Spread Account, the excess is released to the Company. If the Spread Account balance is not at the required credit enhancement level the excess cash collected is retained in the Spread Account until the specified level is achieved. Cash held in the various Spread Accounts is invested in either high quality liquid investment securities, as specified in the securitization agreements or, pursuant to certain securitization agreements, is used to make accelerated principal paydowns on the Certificates to create excess collateral (over- collateralization or OC account), which is held by the Trusts on behalf of the Company as the Residual holder. The specified credit enhancement levels are defined in the Servicing Agreements as the Spread Account balance, expressed generally as a percentage of the current collateral principal balance. The Spread Account includes both the cash and OC accounts.       The annual percentage rate ("APR") on the Contracts is relatively high in comparison to the pass through rate on the Certificates; accordingly, the Residuals described above can be a significant asset of the Company.  In determining the value of the Residuals described above, the Company must estimate the future rates of prepayments, delinquencies, defaults and default loss severity as they impact the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows. The Company estimates prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable Contracts and the impact of trends in the industry. The Company has used a constant prepayment estimate of 15%. The Company estimates defaults and default losses using available historical loss data for comparable Contracts and the specific characteristics of the Contracts purchased by the Company. In addition, the Company has used default losses of 11.5% to 13.5% as a percentage of the original principal balance over the life of the Contracts.        In future periods, the Company will recognize additional revenue from the Residuals if the actual performance of the Contracts is higher than the original estimate or the Company may increase the estimated fair value of the Residuals. If the actual performance of the Contracts is lower than the original estimate, then an adjustment to the carrying value of the Residuals may be required if the estimated fair value of the Residuals is less than its carrying value.       For the year ended December 31, 1997 the Trusts received $31.7 million in cash flows which was $255,000 in excess of the cash flows estimated to be received by the Trusts during this period. As of December 31, 1997 the Trusts had received cumulatively $4.2 million of cash flows in excess of the amounts estimated for all the Company's securitizations.     For the year ended December 31, 1997, initial deposits to Spread Accounts, cash deposited to Spread Accounts and cash released from Spread Accounts was $20.1 million, $31.7 million, and $15.8 million, respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 1996, initial deposits to Spread Accounts, cash deposited to Spread Accounts and cash released from Spread Accounts was $12.3 million, $18.8 million, and $17.9 million, respectively. For the nine-month period ended December 31, 1995, initial deposits to Spread Accounts, cash deposited to Spread Accounts and cash released from Spread Accounts was $4.9 million, $7.6 million, and $7.7 million, respectively.     During 1997 eight of the 21 Trusts incurred cumulative net losses as a percentage of the original contract balance in excess of the predetermined levels specified in the respective Securitization Agreements.  Accordingly, pursuant to the Securitization Agreements, the specified credit enhancement levels were increased.  As a result of this and certain cross collateralization arrangements excess cash flows that would otherwise have been released to the                                        18   Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. Form 10-K  December 31, 1997  Company were retained by the Spread Accounts to bring the balance of those Spread Accounts up to the higher level.  Approximately $7.0 million of cash flows were delayed and retained in the Spread Accounts as of December 31, 1997.     The Year Ended December 31, 1997 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 1996     Results Of Operations     Revenue.  During the year ended December 31, 1997, revenue increased $28.1 million, or 55.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 1996. Gain on sale of Contracts, net, increased by $15.8 million, or 67.8%, and represented 49.3% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 1997. The increase in gain on sale is largely due to the volume of Contracts which were sold in the period. During the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company sold $573.3 million in Contracts, compared to $341.0 million in the year ended December 31, 1996.     Interest income increased by $3.5 million, or 17.7%, representing 29.7% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1997. The increase is due to the increase in the volume of contracts purchased and held for sale.  During the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company purchased $632.1 million in Contracts from Dealers, compared to $351.4 million in the year ended December 31, 1996.     Servicing fees increased by $6.6 million, or 83.5%, and represented 18.3% of total revenue.  The increase in servicing fees is due to the Company's continued expansion of its Contract purchase, sale and servicing activities.  As of December 31, 1997, the Company was earning servicing fees on 77,731 Contracts approximating $830.9 million compared to 45,363 Contracts approximating $483.1 million as of December 31, 1996.  In addition to the $830.9 million in sold Contracts on which servicing fees were earned, the Company was holding for sale and servicing an additional $71.8 million in Contracts for an aggregate servicing portfolio of $902.7 million. Amortization of NIRs increased by $7.2 million and represented 59.0% of residual interest income for the year ended December 31, 1997 versus 38.0% for year  ended December 31, 1996.  The increase is primarily due to the increase in the average age of the Contracts making up the Company's servicing portfolio and consequently the increase in charge-offs and corresponding reduction of residual interest income. The Company expects these increases in the ratio of amortization of NIRs to Residual interest income to continue until the size and average age of the servicing portfolio stabilizes.     Expenses.  During the year ended December 31, 1997, operating expenses increased $19.9 million, or 72.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 1996. Employee costs increased by $7.0 million, or 78.0%, and represented 33.5% of total operating expenses.  The increase is due to the addition of staff necessary to accommodate the Company's growth and certain increases in salaries of existing staff.  General and administrative expenses increased by $6.9 million, or 95.2% and represented 29.9% of total operating expenses.  Increases in general and administrative expenses included increases in telecommunications, stationery, credit reports and other related items as a result of increases in the volume of purchasing and servicing of Contracts.     Interest expense increased $3.4 million, or 58.9%, and represented 19.4% of total operating expenses.  The increase is due in part to the interest paid on an additional $35 million in subordinated debt securities issued by the Company during 1997.  Interest expense was also impacted by the volume of Contracts held for sale as well as by the Company's cost of borrowed funds.     During the year ended December 31, 1997, the provision for losses on Contracts held for sale increased by $1.3 million, or 48.4%, and represented 8.6% of total operating expenses.  The increase in the provision reflects somewhat higher charge-off rates and a larger volume of Contracts held prior to sale when compared to the year ended December 31, 1996.     Marketing expenses increased by $170,789 or 10.2%, and represented 3.9% of total expenses.  The increase is primarily due to the increase in printing, travel, promotion and convention expenses. Fees paid to marketing  representatives for their role in the submission of Contracts ultimately  purchased by the Company are included as a component in gain on sale of  Contracts, net.     Occupancy expenses increased by $635,506 or 82.7%, and represented 3.0% of total expenses.  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $481,548 or 174.9%, and represented 1.6% of total expenses.  During 1997, the Company established a satellite collection branch in Chesapeake, Virginia and leased additional office space near                                         19   Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. Form 10-K  December 31, 1997  its headquarters in Irvine, California. This resulted in an increase in base  rent expense of $906,066 for the year ended December 31, 1997.  The increase in occupancy, depreciation and amortization is due primarily to the establishment of this additional office space and the related furniture, fixtures and equipment.  The Company has agreed to lease a new headquarters facility, which  is currently under construction.  The lease will be for a ten-year term, with  base rent of $1,904,400 for the first five years, and $2,097,600 for years six  through ten.  In addition to base rent, the Company has agreed to pay property taxes, maintenance, and other expenses of the property. Occupancy of the new building can be expected to increase the Company's overall occupancy expenses in the future beginning with commencement of the lease, which will commence upon completion of the building, currently scheduled for September 1998.     The results for the year ended December 31, 1997 include net earnings of $1.2 million from the Company's subsidiary Samco. For the year ended December 31, 1996, Samco incurred a net operating loss of $491,000.     The results for the year ended December 31, 1997 also include net operating losses of $11,000 from the Company's subsidiary LINC. For the year ended December 31, 1996, LINC incurred a net operating loss of $324,000.     In addition, the Company's results for the year ended December 31, 1997, include $88,000 in net operating losses from the Company's subsidiary, CPS Leasing, Inc., which was acquired in January 1997, and $849,000 in net earnings from the Company's investment in 38% of NAB Asset Corp.     The Company's effective tax rate was 42.0% for the year ended December 31,  1997 and 40.5% for the year ended December 31, 1996.  See note 11 to the Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Year Ended December 31, 1996 Compared to the Nine-Month Transition Period Ended December 31, 1995     The Company changed its fiscal year-end from March 31 to December 31, effective with the nine-month period ended December 31, 1995. Accordingly, readers should take into account that the following discussion compares figures for a full twelve month year to a nine-month period.  The discussion below does not attempt to explain, for each item discussed, the extent to which the differing length of these periods has affected the figures.     Revenue.  During the year ended December 31, 1996, revenue increased $26.9 million, or 111.1%, compared to the nine-month transition period ended December 31, 1995.  Gain on sale of Contracts, net, increased by $11.8 million, or 101.9%, and represented 45.6% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 1996. The increase in gain on sale is largely due to the volume of Contracts which were sold in the period. During the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company sold $341.0 million in Contracts, compared to $155.7 million in the nine-month transition period ended December 31, 1995.     Servicing fees increased by $4.4 million, or 126.5%, and represented 15.4% of total revenue.  The increase in servicing fees is due to the Company's continued expansion of its Contract purchase, sale and servicing activities.  As of December 31, 1996, the Company was earning servicing fees on 45,363 Contracts approximating $483.1 million compared to 25,398 Contracts approximating $268.2 million as of December 31, 1995.  In addition to the $483.1 million in sold Contracts on which servicing fees were earned, the Company was holding for sale and servicing an additional $22.8 million in Contracts for an aggregate servicing portfolio of $505.9 million.     Interest income increased by $10.8 million, or 116.7%, representing 39.0% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1996. The increase is due to the increase in the volume of contracts held for sale, and the increase in the amount of sold contracts.  During the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company purchased $351.4 million in Contracts from Dealers, compared to $160.1 million in the nine-month transition period ended December 31, 1995.     Expenses.  During the year ended December 31, 1996, operating expenses increased $15.9 million, or 137.1%, compared to the nine-month transition period ended December 31, 1995.  Employee costs increased by $5.6 million, or 169.6%, and represented 32.4% of total operating expenses.  The increase is due to the addition of staff necessary to accommodate the Company's growth and certain increases in salaries of existing staff.  General and administrative expenses increased by $4.4 million, or 158.9% and represented 26.4% of total operating expenses.  Increases in general and administrative expenses included increases in telecommunications, stationery, credit reports and other related items as a result of increases in the volume of purchasing and servicing of Contracts. Additionally, general and administrative expenses increased by $595,000 as a result of including the company's share of losses incurred by NAB Asset Corporation, in which the Company made a 38% equity investment on June 6, 1996.                                        20   Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. Form 10-K  December 31, 1997     Marketing expenses increased by $447,564, or 36.4%, and represented 6.1% of total expenses.  The increase is primarily due to the increase in the volume of contracts purchased as marketing representatives are compensated directly in proportion to the number of Contracts the Company purchases from Dealers serviced by the marketing representative.  Additional increases in marketing expense relate to other marketing expenses such as travel, promotion and convention expenses.     Interest expense increased $3.1 million, or 112.2%, and represented 21.0% of total operating expenses.  The increase is primarily due to the interest paid on the $20.0 million in subordinated debt securities issued on December 20, 1995. Interest expense was also impacted by the volume of Contracts held for sale as well as by the Company's cost of borrowed funds.     During the year ended December 31, 1996, the provision for losses on Contracts held for sale increased by $1.9 million, or 232.6%, and represented 10.0% of total operating expenses.  The increase in the provision reflects somewhat higher charge-off rates and a larger volume of Contracts held prior to sale when compared to the nine-month transition period ended December 31, 1995.     The results for the year ended December 31, 1996 include net operating losses of $491,000 from the Company's subsidiary Samco. The results for the year ended December 31, 1996 also include net operating losses of $324,000 from the Company's subsidiary LINC.     The Company's effective tax rate was 40.5% for the year ended December 31,  1996 and 40.2% for the nine months ended December 31, 1995.

The Company's primary uses of cash include its normal operating expenses, the establishment and build- up of Spread Accounts used for credit enhancement to their specified levels, and income taxes.     Net cash used in operating activities was $26.1 million during the year ended December 31, 1997 compared to net cash used of $8.4 million during the year ended December 31, 1996. Cash used for purchasing Contracts was $632.1 million, an increase of $280.7 million, or 79.9%, over cash used for purchasing Contracts in the year ended December 31, 1996.  Cash provided from the liquidation of Contracts was $581.4 million, an increase of $234.9 million, or 67.8%, over cash provided from liquidation of Contracts in the year ended December 31, 1996.       The Company's cash requirements have been and will continue to be significant.  The Securitization Agreements require the Company to make a significant initial cash deposit, for purposes of credit enhancement, to the Spread Accounts.  Excess cash flows from the securitized Contracts are also deposited into the Spread Accounts until such time as the Spread Account balance reaches its requisite level, which is computed as a specified percent of the outstanding balance of the related asset-backed securities or collateral.                                        22    Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. Form 10-K  December 31, 1997       During the year ended December 31, 1997, cash used for initial deposits to Spread Accounts was $20.1 million, an increase of $7.8 million, or 63.5%, from the amount of cash used for initial deposits to Spread Accounts in the year ended December 31, 1996.  Cash deposited to Spread Accounts for the year ended December 31, 1997, was $31.7 million, an increase of $12.9 million, or 68.6%, over cash deposited to Spread Accounts in the year ended December 31, 1996.  The cash deposited in Spread Accounts in 1997 includes $9.6 million of cash used to pay down the senior certificates to create excess collateral in an over- collateralization account.  Cash released from Spread Accounts for the year ended December 31, 1997, was $15.8 million, a decrease of $2.1 million, or 11.7%, of cash released from Spread Accounts in the year ended December 31, 1996.  Changes in deposits to and releases from Spread Accounts are affected by the relative size, seasoning and performance of the various pools of sold Contracts that make up the Company's Servicing Portfolio.       The Securitization Agreements call for the requisite levels of the various Spread Accounts to increase if the related receivables experience delinquencies, repossessions or net losses in excess of certain predetermined levels.  During the Company's history, the predetermined levels have frequently been reached, causing the requisite levels of certain Spread Accounts to be raised.  The requisite levels of the Spread Accounts may be returned to the original lower levels if the related receivables delinquency, repossession and net loss performance of the related receivables is reduced below the pre-determined levels.  In addition, on two occasions, the parties to the pertinent agreements have made modifications that effectively raised the permissible delinquency, repossession and net loss levels, thus resulting in Spread Accounts reverting to their original requisite levels.  As of December 31, 1997, the Spread Accounts for eight of the Company's 21 securitized pools were at higher than original requisite levels due to delinquency, repossession or net loss performance.  Such Spread Account balances therefore included approximately $7.0 million more than would have been required at the original requisite levels.                                        23   Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc.

Inc. Form 10-K  December 31, 1997  (1)  Commencing with the securitization completed on June 28, 1994, the      principal and interest due on the asset-backed securities issued by the      various grantor trusts have been guaranteed by Financial Security Assurance      Inc. ("FSA"), enabling the issuer to obtain Aaa/AAA ratings for the asset-      backed securities issued in such transactions.  See "Business -- Purchase      and Sale of Contracts -- Securitization and Sale of Contracts to      Institutional Investors." (2)  Commencing with the securitization completed on June 27, 1996, asset-backed      securities with Aaa/AAA ratings have been sold through public offerings      pursuant to registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange      Commission. (3)  Commencing with the securitization completed on August 15, 1997, the      Company began using an "owner trust" structure rather than the "grantor      trust" structure that had been used on all previous securitizations.     The Company funds its daily purchases of Contracts by use of two warehouse lines of credit.  Borrowings under those lines of credit rise as the Company purchases Contracts and then are substantially repaid when the Company completes a Contract securitization.  Such securitizations and substantial repayments have occurred at least once each quarter during the past three fiscal years.     Under one of the two warehouse lines of credit, the Company borrows from Redwood Receivables Corporation ("Redwood"), with the loans funded by commercial paper issued by Redwood and secured by Contracts pledged periodically by the Company.  A standby line of credit with General Electric Capital Corporation ("GECC") is available if, but only if, Redwood does not provide funding as described above.  It has never been necessary to draw on the standby line, which is secured by Contracts and substantially all the other assets of the Company. The Redwood/GECC line has an aggregate maximum lending amount of $100.0 million. The maximum amount outstanding under the Redwood/GECC line in 1997 was $100.0 million and the average was $51.3 million.  The Company's other warehouse line of credit was opened in December 1997.  Under this second line of credit, an affiliate of First Union Capital Markets lends to the Company, with the loans funded by commercial paper issued by that affiliate, and secured by Contracts pledged periodically by the Company. The First Union line has a maximum lending amount of $150.0 million.  Interest under each line is at a variable rate, indexed to prevailing rates for commercial paper. The two lines together had an outstanding balance of $61.7 million at December 31, 1997, as compared to $13.3 million under the Redwood/GECC line alone at December 31, 1996.  The Company uses the warehouse lines of credit in tandem, pledging specific Contracts to each lender alternatively.     In August 1997, to supplement its working capital resources the Company entered into a line of credit agreement (the "Stanwich Line"), with Stanwich Financial Services Corp. ("SFSC"). SFSC is a financial services company that was owned by Stanwich Holdings, Inc. ("Stanwich Holdings") at the time. Charles E. Bradley, Sr., Charles E. Bradley, Jr., and John G. Poole, who are officers and directors of the Company, collectively owned 92.5% of the common stock of Stanwich Holdings at the time of the transaction, and Mr. Bradley, Sr., was the president and a director of Stanwich Holdings. Under the Stanwich Line, SFSC agreed to lend up to $25 million to the Company from time to time upon request, through December 19, 1997. Any amount outstanding at December 31, 1997, would be due at that time. Borrowings under the Stanwich Line bore interest at the rate of 10% per annum, and the Company paid a $250,000 (one percent) commitment fee to SFSC in connection with opening the line of credit. The Company drew the full amount of the line at its inception, none of which remained outstanding at December 31, 1997. NAB Asset Corp. purchased all outstanding stock of Stanwich Holdings on March 2, 1998.     The Company funds the increase in its servicing portfolio through off balance sheet securitization transactions, as discussed above, and funds its other capital needs with cash from operations and with the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.  During the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company completed five securitization transactions, issued $20 million of 10.50% Participating Equity Notes due 2004 ("PENs") and borrowed $15 million in an unsecured related party loan due 2004 ("RPL").     The PENs are long-term subordinated debt instruments issued in a registered public offering in April 1997. After deduction of underwriting commissions, the proceeds of that offering were $18.8 million. The PENs have a 10.5% fixed coupon rate of interest per annum, payable monthly beginning May 15, 1997. The fixed interest rate payable on the PENs may be considered comparable to the rising interest rate payable on the $20 million of debt securities (Rising Interest Subordinated Redeemable Securities or "RISRS") that the Company issued in December 1995: the RISRS interest rate was 10.25% per annum throughout 1997 and will rise by .25% per annum in each                                       25   Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. Form 10-K  December 31, 1997  calendar year through 2004, and then by an additional .50% per annum for the final year prior to maturity on December 31, 2005. The RISRS may be redeemed without premium at any time after January 1, 2000, and the PENs may be redeemed without premium at any time after April 15, 2000. The PENs are also partially convertible into equity. At maturity or earlier redemption of the PENs, the holders thereof will have the option to convert 25% of the principal amount into common stock of the Company, at a conversion rate of $10.15 per share.     The RPL is long-term subordinated debt representing $15 million borrowed in June 1997 from SFSC.  The RPL has a fixed rate of interest of 9% per annum, payable monthly beginning July 1997.  The Company may pre-pay the RPL without penalty at any time on or after June 12, 2000.  At maturity or early repayment of the RPL, the holder thereof will have the option to convert 20% of the principal amount into common stock of the Company, at a conversion rate of $11.86 per share.  In conjunction with the RPL, in May 1997, the Company entered into two additional transactions; (i) the Company purchased $14.5 million of preferred stock of Stanwich Holdings, with dividends cumulative at the rate of 9% per annum and redeemable at an aggregate price of $14.6 million, plus accrued dividends, and (ii) the Company borrowed $14.5 million with interest at 8% per annum under a 60-day related party loan from SFSC. In August 1997, the Company received $14.9 million in redemption of the preferred stock of Stanwich Holdings and repaid the 60-day related party loan in its entirety.     The Company anticipates that the proceeds from the PENs, the RPL, funds available under the two warehouse lines, proceeds from the sale of Contracts and cash from operations will be sufficient to satisfy the Company's estimated cash requirements for the next twelve months, assuming that the Company continues to have a means by which to sell its warehoused Contracts.  If for any reason the Company is unable to sell its Contracts, or if the Company's available cash otherwise proves to be insufficient to fund operations (because of future changes in the industry, general economic conditions, unanticipated increases in expenses, or other factors), the Company may be required to seek additional funding.     In addition to capital required for the Company's existing business and its growth, the Company may require additional capital resources if it should choose to expand its operations by acquisition of other businesses.  Although the Company has no commitments to make any acquisition, it does regularly review proposals to make acquisitions in the financial services field.     There can be no assurance that such additional financing, if required, will be available to the Company, nor can there be any assurance as to the cost of any such financing that may be available.  The Company is exploring the possibility of issuing additional debt to provide additional capital, but has no commitment to do so.     In January 1997, the Company acquired a company engaged in the equipment leasing business.  Any material growth in that subsidiary's business will require significant capital resources, to allow that subsidiary to purchase equipment for lease.  In March 1997, the leasing company obtained a $5 million line of credit to purchase equipment for lease.                                         26   Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. Form 10-K  December 31, 1997  Forward-Looking Statements     The descriptions of the Company's business and activities set forth in this report and in other past and future reports and announcements by the Company may contain forward-looking statements and assumptions regarding the future activities and results of operations of the Company.  Actual results may be adversely affected by various factors including the following:  increases in unemployment or other changes in domestic economic conditions which adversely affect the sales of new and used automobiles and may result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures and losses on Contracts; adverse economic conditions in geographic areas in which the Company's business is concentrated; changes in interest rates, adverse changes in the market for securitized receivables pools, or a substantial lengthening of the Company's warehousing period, each of which could restrict the Company's ability to obtain cash for new Contract originations and purchases; increases in the amounts required to be set aside in Spread Accounts or to be expended for other forms of credit enhancement to support future securitizations; the reduction or unavailability of warehouse lines of credit which the Company uses to accumulate Contracts for securitization transactions; increased competition from other automobile finance sources; reduction in the number and amount of acceptable Contracts submitted to the Company by its automobile Dealer network; changes in government regulations affecting consumer credit; and other economic, financial and regulatory factors beyond the Company's control.  A further discussion of factors that may cause actual results to differ, or may otherwise have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations, is contained in the exhibit to this report titled "risk factors," incorporated herein by this reference.  New Accounting Pronouncements       The Company has adopted in 1997 and will adopt in future periods new  accounting pronouncements.  For information on how adoption has and will affect  the Financial Statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial  Statements.  Year 2000       The Company has performed an examination of its major software applications to ensure that each system is prepared to accommodate the year 2000. This examination included a review of program code which is maintained by the Company as well as obtaining confirmation from outside software vendors that their products are year 2000 compliant. In addition, the Company has communicated with firms with whom it does significant business to determine their readiness for the year 2000. The Company believes that based on their current examination that the year 2000 will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's operations. However, there can be no assurance that software incompatibility with the year 2000 on the part of the Company or any of its significant suppliers will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.                                        27   Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc.
