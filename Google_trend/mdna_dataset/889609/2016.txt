Item 7.  Management’s Discussion And AnalysisOf Financial Condition And Results Of Operations     The following discussion and analysis shouldbe read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or incorporatedby reference herein.     Overview     We are a specialty finance company. Ourbusiness is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and, to alesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passengervans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credithistories, low incomes or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financingfor dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, suchas commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In additionto purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we have also (i) acquired installment purchase contracts infour merger and acquisition transactions, (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loans from non-affiliatedlenders, and (iii) directly originated an immaterial amount of vehicle purchase money loans by lending money directly to consumers.In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as "automobile contracts."     We were incorporated and began our operationsin March 1991. From inception through December 31, 2015, we have purchased a total of approximately $12.4 billion of automobilecontracts from dealers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergers andacquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and, most recently, in September 2011. The September 2011 acquisition consisted of approximately$217.8 million of automobile contracts that we purchased from Fireside Bank of Pleasanton, California. In 2004 and 2009, we wereappointed as a third-party servicer for certain portfolios of automobile contracts originated and owned by non-affiliated entities.From 2008 through 2010, our managed portfolio decreased each year due to our strategy of limiting contract purchases to conserveour liquidity during the financial crisis and resulting recession, as discussed further below. However, since October 2009, wehave gradually increased contract purchase which, in turn, has resulted in recent increases in our managed portfolio. Recent contractpurchase volumes and managed portfolio levels are shown in the table below:     Contract Purchases and Outstanding Managed Portfolio            $ in thousands     Year    Contracts Purchased in Period      Managed Portfolio at Period End     2008    $ 296,817      $ 1,664,122     2009      8,599        1,194,722     2010      113,023        756,203     2011      284,236        794,649     2012      551,742        897,575     2013      764,087        1,231,422     2014      944,944        1,643,920     2015      1,060,538        2,031,136         Our principal executiveoffices are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Creditand underwriting functions are performed primarily in that California branch with certain of these functions also performed inour Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida and Illinoisbranches.     The programs we offerto dealers are intended to serve a wide range of sub-prime customers, primarily through franchised new car dealers. We purchaseautomobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactionsin which we sell a specified pool of contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours, which in turn issues asset-backed securitiesto fund the purchase of the pool of contracts from us.         31           Securitization and Warehouse Credit Facilities     Throughout the periodfor which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing themon a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financingshave involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to oneof our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Dependingon the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobilecontracts or as secured financings.     When structured to betreated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobilecontracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our unaudited condensed consolidated balancesheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, (ii) recognize interest expense on the securitiesissued in the transaction and (iii) record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts.     Since 1994 we haveconducted 68 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we purchased from dealers. As of December 31, 2015, 18 of thosesecuritizations are active and all but one are structured as secured financings. The exception is our September 2010 transaction,which is structured as a sale of the related contracts. From 1994 through April 2008 we generally utilized financial guaranteesfor the senior asset-backed notes issued in the securitization. Since September 2010 we have utilized senior subordinated structureswithout any financial guarantees. We have generally conducted our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the end of each calendarquarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, in 2015, we elected to defer what would have been our Decembersecuritization in favor of a securitization in January 2016.     Our history of term securitizations, overthe most recent ten years, is summarized in the table below:     Recent Asset-Backed Term Securitizations            $ in thousands     Period    Number of Term Securitizations      Amount of Receivables     2006      4        957,681     2007      4        1,118,097     2008      2        509,022     2009      0        –     2010      1        103,772     2011      3        335,593     2012      4        603,500     2013      4        778,000     2014      4        923,000     2015      3        795,000        From time to timewe have also completed financings of our residual interests in other securitizations that we and our affiliates previously sponsored.As of December 31, 2015 we have one such residual interest financing outstanding.     Since December 2011,our securitizations have included a pre-funding feature in which a portion of the receivables to be sold to the trust were notdelivered until after the initial closing. As a result, our restricted cash balance at December 31, 2014 included $85.3 millionfrom the proceeds of the sale of the asset-backed notes that were held by the trustee pending delivery of the remaining receivables.In January 2015, the requisite additional receivables were delivered to the trust and we received the related restricted cash,most of which was used to repay amounts owed under our warehouse credit facilities. Since we did not do a securitization in Decemberof 2015, there was no related amount of restricted cash representing the pre-funding proceeds.         32           Generally, prior to a securitization transactionwe fund our automobile contract purchases primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term fundingcapacity is $300 million, comprising three credit facilities. The first $100 million credit facility was established in May 2012.This facility was renewed in August 2014, extending the revolving period to August 2016, and adding an amortization period throughAugust 2017. In April 2015, we entered into a new $100 million facility, with a revolving period extending to April 2017, followedby an amortization period to April 2019. In November 2015, we entered into a third $100 million facility, with a revolving periodextending to November 2017, followed by an amortization period to November 2019.     In a securitization and in our warehousecredit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representationsand warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representationsor warranties, we will be obligated to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accruedand unpaid interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchasethe contract at a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourseagainst dealers, we will bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase.     Whether a securitization is treated as asecured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to releaseexcess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Suchreleases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performanceof securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations,regardless of whether such automobile contracts are treated as having been sold or as having been financed.     Credit Risk Retained      Whether a sale of automobile contracts inconnection with a securitization or warehouse credit facility is treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financial accountingpurposes, the related special-purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the relatedautomobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we useto fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of such automobile contracts could therefore have a materialadverse effect on both our liquidity and our results of operations, regardless of whether such automobile contracts are treatedfor financial accounting purposes as having been sold or as having been financed. For estimation of the magnitude of such risk,it may be appropriate to look to the size of our  " managedportfolio, "  which represents both financed and sold automobilecontracts as to which such credit risk is retained. Our managed portfolio as of December 31, 2015 was approximately $2,031 million.     Critical Accounting Policies     We believe that our accounting policiesrelated to (a) Allowance for Finance Credit Losses, (b) Amortization of Deferred Origination Costs and Acquisition Fees, (c) TermSecuritizations, (d) Finance Receivables and Related Debt Measured at Fair Value (e) Accrual for Contingent Liabilities and (f)Income Taxes are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Such policies are describedbelow.     Allowance for Finance Credit Losses     In order to estimate an appropriate allowancefor losses incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as  " staticpooling, "  which stratifies our finance receivable portfoliointo separately identified pools based on the period of origination. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimatean allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonablyestimated in our portfolio of automobile contracts. For each monthly pool of contracts that we purchase, we begin establishingthe allowance in the month of acquisition and increase it over the subsequent 11 months, through a provision for credit lossescharged to our consolidated statement of operations, with the goal of establishing an allowance that approximates the next 12 monthsof expected net losses. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of theallowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, prospective liquidation values of the underlyingcollateral and general economic and market conditions. As circumstances change, our level of provisioning and/or allowance maychange as well.         33           Broad economic factors such as recessionand significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted averageage of the receivables at any given time. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lowerlevels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and losses graduallyincreasing to a peak between 36 and 42 months, after which they gradually decrease. The historical weighted average seasoningof our total owned portfolio excluding Fireside, is summarized in the table below:        December 31,     Weighted Average Age in Months of Owned Portfolio   2009     33   2010     37   2011     27   2012     18   2013     14   2014     14   2015     16      The credit performance of our portfoliois also significantly influenced by our underwriting guidelines and credit criteria we use when evaluating contracts for purchasefrom dealers. We regularly evaluate our portfolio credit performance and modify our purchase criteria to maximize the credit performanceof our portfolio, while maintaining competitive programs and levels of service for our dealers.     Amortization of Deferred Originations Costsand Acquisition Fees     Upon purchase of a contract from a dealer,we generally either charge or advance the dealer an acquisition fee. In addition, we incur certain direct costs associated withoriginations of our contracts. All such acquisition fees and direct costs are applied to the carrying value of finance receivablesand are accreted into earnings as an adjustment to the yield over the estimated life of the contract using the interest method.     Term Securitizations     Our term securitization structure has generallybeen as follows:     We sell automobile contracts we acquireto a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling our automobilecontracts. The special-purpose subsidiary then transfers the same automobile contracts to another entity, typically a statutorytrust. The trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities, in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principalbalance of the automobile contracts. We typically sell these automobile contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse,except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to us are provided by us to the trust. One ormore investors purchase the asset-backed securities issued by the trust; the proceeds from the sale of the asset-backed securitiesare then used to purchase the automobile contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated asset-backed securities issued bythe trust or by a related entity. Through 2008, we generally purchased external credit enhancement for most of our term securitizationsin the form of a financial guaranty insurance policy, guaranteeing timely payment of interest and ultimate payment of principalon the senior asset-backed securities, from an insurance company. We did not execute any securitizations in 2009 due to our lackof warehouse lines of credit at that time. In our 19 most recent securitizations since 2010, we have not purchased financial guarantyinsurance policies and do not expect to do so in the near future.     We structure our securitizations to includeinternal credit enhancement for the benefit the investors (i) in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account ( " spreadaccount " ) held by the trust, (ii) in the form of overcollateralizationof the senior asset-backed securities, where the principal balance of the senior asset-backed securities issued is less than theprincipal balance of the automobile contracts, (iii) in the form of subordinated asset-backed securities, or (iv) some combinationof such internal credit enhancements. The agreements governing the securitization transactions require that the initial level ofinternal credit enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the automobile contracts until the level of internalcredit enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentageof the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related automobile contracts. The specified levels at which the internal creditenhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of automobile contracts held by the trustsand on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among us, our special purpose subsidiary, the insurance company, ifany, and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios,and have also varied from one transaction to another. The agreements governing the securitizations generally grant us the optionto repurchase the sold automobile contracts from the trust when the aggregate outstanding balance of the automobile contracts hasamortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance.         34           Our September 2008 securitization and thesubsequent re-securitization of the remaining receivables from such transaction in September 2010 were each in substance salesof the underlying receivables, and have been treated as sales for financial accounting purposes. They differ from those treatedas secured financings in that the trust to which our special-purpose subsidiaries sold the automobile contracts met the definitionof a "qualified special-purpose entity" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 (ASC 860). As a result,assets and liabilities of those trusts are not consolidated into our consolidated balance sheet.     Our warehouse credit facility structuresare similar to the above, except that (i) our special-purpose subsidiaries that purchase the automobile contracts pledge the automobilecontracts to secure promissory notes that they issue, and (ii) no increase in the required amount of internal credit enhancementis contemplated. Our current maximum revolving warehouse financing capacity is $300 million.     Upon each transfer of automobile contractsin a transaction structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes, whether a term securitization or a warehousefinancing, we retain on our consolidated balance sheet the related automobile contracts as assets and record the asset-backed notesor loans issued in the transaction as indebtedness.     We receive periodic base servicing feesfor the servicing and collection of the automobile contracts. Under our securitization structures treated as secured financingsfor financial accounting purposes, such servicing fees are included in interest income from the automobile contracts. In addition,we are entitled to the cash flows from the trusts that represent collections on the automobile contracts in excess of the amountsrequired to pay principal and interest on the asset-backed securities, base servicing fees, and certain other fees and expenses(such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the asset-backed notes are generally defined as the paymentssufficient to keep the principal balance of such notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related automobile contracts(excluding those automobile contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentageis less than 100%, the related securitization agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance ofthe asset-backed securities is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create overcollateralizationof the asset-backed notes.     If the amount of cash required for paymentof fees, expenses, interest and principal on the senior asset-backed notes exceeds the amount collected during the collection period,the shortfall is withdrawn from the spread account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessaryfor the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated asset-backed notes, and there is no shortfall inthe related spread account or the required overcollateralization level, the excess is released to us. If the spread account andovercollateralization is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the trust until the specifiedlevel is achieved. Although spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of our special-purpose subsidiaries as theowner of the residual interests (in the case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes)or the trusts (in the case of securitization transactions structured as secured financings for financial accounting purposes),we are restricted in use of the cash in the spread accounts. Cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality,liquid investment securities, as specified in the securitization agreements. The interest rate payable on the automobile contractsis significantly greater than the interest rate on the asset-backed notes. As a result, the residual interests described abovehistorically have been a significant asset of ours.     In all of our term securitizations and warehousecredit facilities, whether treated as secured financings or as sales, we have sold the automobile contracts (through a subsidiary)to the securitization entity. The difference between the two structures is that in securitizations that are treated as securedfinancings we report the assets and liabilities of the securitization trust on our consolidated balance sheet. Under both structures,recourse to us by holders of the asset-backed securities and by the trust, for failure of the automobile contract obligors to makepayments on a timely basis, is limited to the automobile contracts included in the securitizations or warehouse credit facilities,the spread accounts and our retained interests in the respective trusts.         35           Finance Receivables and Related Debt Measured at FairValue     In September 2011 we purchased finance receivablesfrom Fireside Bank. These receivables are pledged as collateral for debt that was structured specifically for the acquisition ofthis portfolio. Since the Fireside receivables were originated by another entity with its own underwriting guidelines and procedures,we have elected to account for the Fireside receivables and the related debt secured by those receivables at their estimated fairvalues so that changes in fair value will be reflected in our results of operations as they occur. There are limited observableinputs available to us for measurement of such receivables, or for the related debt. We use our own assumptions about the factorsthat we believe market participants would use in pricing similar receivables and debt, and are based on the best information availablein the circumstances. The valuation method used to estimate fair value may produce a fair value measurement that may not be indicativeof ultimate realizable value. Furthermore, while we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those usedby other market participants, the use of different methods or assumptions to estimate the fair value of certain financial instrumentscould result in different estimates of fair value. Those estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would havebeen used had a readily available market for such receivables or debt existed, or had such receivables or debt been liquidated,and those differences could be material to the financial statements.     Accrual for Contingent Liabilities     We are routinely involved in various legalproceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Our legal counsel hasadvised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indication that it isboth probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined.     We have recorded a liability as of December31, 2015, which represents our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies. The amount of losses that mayultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believethat the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies described or referenced above, as of December31, 2015, and in excess of the liability we have recorded, is from $0 to $250,000.     Accordingly, we believe that the ultimateresolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies, after taking into account our current litigation reserves, should not havea material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherentin contested proceedings, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceedthe reserves we have accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to our operating results for a particularperiod, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period.     Income Taxes     We account for income taxes under the assetand liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequencesof events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determinedbased on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effectfor the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilitiesis recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.     Deferred tax assets are recognized subjectto management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred taxasset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assetwill not be realized. In making such judgements, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified.     Our net deferred tax asset of $37.6 millionconsists of approximately $29.9 million of net U.S. federal deferred tax assets and $7.7 million of net state deferred tax assets.The major components of the deferred tax asset are $13.5 million in net operating loss carryforwards and built in losses and $24.1million in net deductions which have not yet been taken on a tax return.     As of December 31, 2015, we had net operatingloss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of $67.3 million. These state net operating losses begin to expire in 2016.     In determining the possible future realizationof deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversal of taxable temporarydifferences; and (b) forecasted future net earnings from operations. Based upon those considerations, we have concluded that itis more likely than not that the U.S. and state net operating loss carryforward periods provide enough time to utilize the deferredtax assets pertaining to the existing net operating loss carryforwards and any net operating loss that would be created by thereversal of the future net deductions which have not yet been taken on a tax return. Our estimates of taxable income are forward-lookingstatements, and there can be no assurance that our estimates of such taxable income will be correct. Factors discussed under "RiskFactors," and in particular under the subheading "Risk Factors -- Forward-Looking Statements" may affect whethersuch projections prove to be correct.         36           We recognize interest and penalties relatedto unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accruedinterest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.     Uncertainty of Capital Markets and General Economic Conditions     We depend upon the availability of warehousecredit facilities and access to long-term financing through the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by our automobilecontracts. Since 1994, we have completed 68 term securitizations of approximately $10.2 billion in contracts. From the fourth quarterof 2007 through the end of 2009, we observed unprecedented adverse changes in the market for securitized pools of automobile contracts.These changes included reduced liquidity, and reduced demand for asset-backed securities, particularly for securities carryinga financial guaranty and for securities backed by sub-prime automobile receivables. Moreover, during that period many of the firmsthat previously provided financial guarantees, which were an integral part of our securitizations, suspended offering such guarantees.These adverse changes caused us to conserve liquidity by significantly reducing our purchases of automobile contracts. However,since September 2009 we have established new funding facilities and gradually increased our contract purchases and the frequencyand amount of our term securitizations.     Financial Covenants      Certain of our securitization transactionsand our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results.Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition,certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditorsto declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2015 we were in compliance with all suchfinancial covenants.     Results of Operations     Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December31, 2015 with the year ended December 31, 2014     Revenues .  During the year ended December31, 2015, our revenues were $363.7 million, an increase of $63.4 million, or 21.1%, from the prior year revenues of $300.3 million.The primary reason for the increase in revenues is an increase in interest income. Interest income for the year ended December31, 2015 increased $63.2 million, or 22.0%, to $349.9 million from $286.7 million in the prior year. The primary reason for theincrease in interest income is the increase in finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries, which increased from $1,642.2million at December 31, 2014 to $2,031.1 million at December 31, 2015. The table below shows the average balances of our portfolioheld by consolidated subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:             Average Balances for the Year Ended          December 31, 2015      December 31, 2014          Amount      Amount     Finance Receivables Owned by Consolidated Subsidiaries    ($ in millions)     CPS Originated Receivables    $ 1,844.5      $ 1,414.3     Fireside      0.4        5.9     Total    $ 1,844.9      $ 1,420.2        Servicing fees totaling $319,000 in the yearended December 31, 2015 decreased $1.1 million, or 76.8%, from $1.4 million in the prior year. We earn base servicing fees on threeportfolios that are decreasing in size as we receive customer payments and, consequently, base servicing fees are decreasing also.         37           At December 31, 2015, we were generatingincome and fees on a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance of $2,031.1 million (this amount includes $345,000of automobile contracts on which we earn servicing fees and own a residual interest, compared to a managed portfolio with an outstandingprincipal balance of $1,643.9 million as of December 31, 2014). At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the managed portfolio compositionwas as follows:            December 31, 2015      December 31, 2014          Amount (1)      %(2)      Amount (1)      %(2)     Originating Entity    ($ in millions)     CPS    $ 2,030.7        100.0 %    $ 1,640.9        99.8 %   Fireside      0.1        0.0 %      1.7        0.1 %   Third Party Portfolio      0.3        0.0 %      1.3        0.1 %   Total    $ 2,031.1        100.0 %    $ 1,643.9        100.0 %        (1) Contractual balances.  (2) Percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding.       Other income increased by $1.3 million, or10.5%, to $13.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 from $12.1 million during the prior year. The increase consistsof an increase of $983,000 in fees associated with direct mail and other related products and services that we offer to our dealers,a net increase of $936,000 on payments to us for our interest in certain sold charge off portfolios and acquired third-party portfoliosand an increase of $116,000 in sales tax refunds. The increases were somewhat offset by a decrease of $690,000 in payments fromthird-party providers of convenience fees paid by our customers for web based and other electronic payments. In addition, in theprior year period, we incurred a markdown of $72,000 in the fair value of the principal balance and related debt of the Firesideportfolio.     Expenses .  Our operating expenses consist largelyof provision for credit losses, interest expense, employee costs and general and administrative expenses. Provision for creditlosses and interest expense are significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-monthperiod and by the outstanding balance of finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries. Employee costs and general andadministrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors thataffect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factorssuch as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level.     Employee costs include base salaries, commissionsand bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options, and are oneof our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with thelevel of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced.     Other operating expenses consist largely offacilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, marketing and advertisingexpenses, and depreciation and amortization.     Total operating expenses were $302.3 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $248.0 million for the prior year, an increase of $54.3 million, or 21.9%. Theincrease is primarily due to the increase in the amount of new contracts we purchased the resulting increase in our consolidatedportfolio and associated interest expense, servicing costs, and the related increase in our provision for credit losses.     Employee costs increased by $9.4 million or18.8%, to $59.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, representing 19.7% of total operating expenses, from $50.1 millionfor the prior year, or 20.2% of total operating expenses. Since 2010, we have added employees in our Originations and Marketingdepartments to accommodate the increase in contract purchases. More recently, we have also added Servicing staff to accommodatethe increase in the number of accounts in our managed portfolio. The table below summarizes our employees by category as well ascontract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2015 and 2014:         38                    December                                         31, 2015        December                                         31, 2014            Amount        Amount            ($ in millions)     Contracts purchased (dollars)    $ 1,060.5      $ 944.9     Contracts purchased (units)      64,130        59,276     Managed portfolio outstanding (dollars)    $ 2,031.1      $ 1,643.9     Managed portfolio outstanding (units)      149,158        124,074                           Number of Originations staff      243        210     Number of Marketing staff      140        155     Number of Servicing staff      487        445     Number of other staff      65        59     Total number of employees      935        869        General and administrative expenses includecosts associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, creditservices, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $20.2 million, an increase of $907,000, or 4.7%, comparedto the previous year and represented 6.7% of total operating expenses.     Interest expense for the year ended December31, 2015 increased by $7.3 million to $57.7 million, or 14.6%, compared to $50.4 million in the previous year.     The debt associated with the Fireside portfoliocredit facility was repaid in January of 2015 resulting in a decrease of $772,000 in interest expense compared to the prior year.     Interest on securitization trust debt increasedby $10.1 million, or 26.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. The increase is due primarily to theincrease in the average balance of securitization trust debt, which increased 30.9% to $1,698.8million for the year ended December31, 2015 from $1,298.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.     We repaid in full $39.2 million in seniorsecured debt in the first quarter of 2014. As a result, we incurred $1.7 million in interest expense on such debt in 2014, comparedto zero in 2015. In addition, we reduced the average balance balance of our outstanding subordinated renewable notes by $2.0 millionfrom $17.1 million at December 31, 2014 to $15.1 million at December 31, 2015, resulting in a decrease of $626,000 in interestexpense on subordinated debt. The reduction in interest expense was also a result of our decreasing the average interest rate onour subordinated renewable notes from 12.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015.     Interest expense on residual interest financingdecreased $585,000 in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. The decrease is due to the repayments on thatfacility of $3.3 million during the year.     Interest expense on warehouse lines of creditincreased by $910,000, or 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. The increase is due primarilyto the increase in our contracts purchased, which increased by 12.2% from $944.9 million in 2014 to $1,060.5 million in 2015 andthe delay of the December securitization to January 2016.         39           The following table presents the componentsof interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:            Year Ended December 31,          2015    2014            (Dollars in thousands)            Average Balance (1)        Interest        Annualized Average Yield/Rate        Average Balance (1)        Interest        Annualized Average Yield/Rate     Interest Earning Assets                                                         Finance receivables gross (2)    $ 1,818,644      $ 349,465        19.2 %    $ 1,383,193      $ 285,169        20.6 %   Finance receivables measured at fair value      427        447        104.7 %      5,919        1,565        26.4 %        $ 1,819,071        349,912        19.2 %    $ 1,389,112        286,734        20.6 %                                                             Interest Bearing Liabilities                                                         Warehouse lines of credit    $ 62,104        6,127        9.9 %    $ 52,596        5,217        9.9 %   Residual interest financing      10,948        1,405        12.8 %      14,225        1,989        14.0 %   Debt secured by receivables measured at fair value      –        –                 5,561        772        13.9 %   Securitization trust debt      1,698,777        48,631        2.9 %      1,298,033        38,558        3.0 %   Senior secured debt, related party      –        –        –        9,471        1,651        17.4 %   Subordinated renewable notes      15,102        1,582        10.5 %      17,074        2,208        12.9 %          1,786,931        57,745        3.2 %    $ 1,396,960        50,395        3.6 %   Net interest income/spread             $ 292,167                        $ 236,339              Net interest margin (3)                        16.1 %                        17.0 %   Ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities      102 %                        99 %                        (1)  Averagebalances are based on month end balances except for warehouse lines of credit, which are based on daily balances.

The provision for credit losses maintains the allowance for finance credit losses at levels that we feelare adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated. Our approach for establishing the allowancerequires greater amounts of provision for credit losses early in the terms of our finance receivables, and also takes into accountthe performance of the receivables. Consequently, the increase in provision expense is the result of the increase in contract purchasesduring the last year, the larger portfolio owned by our consolidated subsidiaries compared to the prior year, and an adverse trendin the performance of our receivables, which we believe is consistent with the aging of our portfolio and may also be related tocertain procedural changes in our servicing practices that were required by a consent decree to which we became subject in June2014.            40           Marketing expenses consist primarily ofcommission-based compensation paid to our employee marketing representatives. Our marketing representatives earn a salaryplus commissions based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer ourdealers, such as training programs, internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Marketing expenses increased by $1.4million, or 8.4%, to $17.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $16.1 million in the prior year, andrepresented 5.3% of total operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we purchased 64,130 contractsrepresenting $1,060.5 million in receivables compared to 59,276 contracts representing $944.9 million in receivables in theprior year.     Occupancy expenses increased by $618,000 or17.8%, to $4.1 million compared to $3.5 million in the previous year and represented 1.2% of total operating expenses. In July2015, we increased our Irvine, California office by entering into a lease for additional 20,000 square feet.     Depreciation and amortization expenses increasedby $209,000 or 48.8%, to $637,000 compared to $428,000 in the previous year and represented 0.2% of total operating expenses.     For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recordedincome tax expense of $26.7 million, representing a 43.5% effective income tax rate. In the prior year, we recorded $22.7 millionof income tax expense, also representing a 43.5% effective income tax rate.     Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December31, 2014 with the year ended December 31, 2013     Revenues .  In April 2013, we repurchased theoutstanding Class D notes from our first 2008 securitization for a cash payment and a new note. We subsequently exercised our “clean-upcall” option and repurchased the remaining collateral from the related securitization trust. The aggregate value of our considerationfor the Class D notes was $10.9 million less than our carrying value of the Class D notes at the time of the repurchase. As a resultof the repurchase of the Class D notes and the termination of the securitization trust, we realized a gain of $10.9 million, or4.3% of our total revenues of $255.8 million for year ended December 31, 2013. The discussion below excludes the gain of $10.9million for 2013 for comparative purposes.     During the year ended December 31, 2014, our revenues were$300.3 million, an increase of $55.4 million, or 22.6%, from the prior year revenue of $244.8 million. The primary reason forthe increase in revenues is an increase in interest income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $55.4million, or 24.0%, to $286.7 million from $231.3 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the increase in interest incomeis the increase in finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries, which increased from $1,222.5 million at December 31,2013 to $1,642.2 million at December 31, 2014. The table below shows the average balances of our portfolio held by consolidatedsubsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:             Average Balances for the Year Ended          December 31, 2014      December 31, 2013          Amount      Amount     Finance Receivables Owned by Consolidated Subsidiaries    ($ in millions)     CPS Originated Receivables    $ 1,414.3      $ 1,044.7     Fireside      5.9        31.3     Total    $ 1,420.2      $ 1,076.0        Servicing fees totaling $1.4 in the yearended December 31, 2014 decreased $1.7 million, or 55.5%, from $3.1 million in the prior year. We earn base servicing fees onthree portfolios that are decreasing in size as we receive customer payments and, consequently, base servicing fees are decreasingalso. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, our managed portfolio owned by consolidated vs. non-consolidated subsidiaries and otherthird parties was as follows:         41                  December 31, 2014      December 31, 2013          Amount (1)      %(2)      Amount (1)      %(2)     Total Managed Portfolio    ($ in millions)     Owned by Consolidated Subsidiaries                                       CPS Originated Receivables    $ 1,640.5        99.8 %    $ 1,207.7        98.1 %   Fireside      1.7        0.1 %      14.8        1.2 %   Owned by Non-Consolidated Subsidiaries      0.4        0.0 %      4.0        0.3 %   Third-Party Servicing Portfolios      1.3        0.1 %      4.9        0.4 %   Total    $ 1,643.9        100.0 %    $ 1,231.4        100.0 %       (1) Contractual balances.  (2) Percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding.     At December 31, 2014, we were generatingincome and fees on a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance of $1,643.9 million (this amount includes $390,000of automobile contracts on which we earn servicing fees and own a residual interest and also includes another $1.3 million ofautomobile contracts on which we earn base and incentive servicing fees), compared to a managed portfolio with an outstandingprincipal balance of $1,231.4 million as of December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the managed portfolio compositionwas as follows:              December 31, 2014        December 31, 2013            Amount (1)        % (2)        Amount (1)        % (2)     Originating Entity      ($ in millions)     CPS    $ 1,640.9        99.8 %    $ 1,211.8        98.4 %   Fireside      1.7        0.1 %      14.8        1.2 %   Third Party Portfolio      1.3        0.1 %      4.8        0.4 %   Total    $ 1,643.9        100.0 %    $ 1,231.4        100.0 %        (1) Contractual balances.  (2) Percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding.       Other income increased by $1.7 million, or16.7%, to $12.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 from $10.4 million during the prior year. The increase consistsof a net increase of $150,000 in the fair value of the receivables and debt associated with the Fireside portfolio acquisition,an increase of $971,000 in fees associated with direct mail and other related products and services that we offer to our dealers,an increase of $303,000 in sales tax refunds and an increase of $335,000 in payments from third-party payment processors.     Expenses .  Our operating expenses consist largelyof provision for credit losses, interest expense, employee costs and general and administrative expenses. Provision for creditlosses and interest expense are significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-monthperiod and by the outstanding balance of finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries. Employee costs and general andadministrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors thataffect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factorssuch as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level.     Employee costs include base salaries, commissionsand bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options, and are oneof our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with thelevel of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced.     Other operating expenses consist largely offacilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, marketing and advertisingexpenses, and depreciation and amortization.         42           During the year ended December 31, 2013, werecognized $7.8 million in contingent liability expenses to either record or increase the amounts we believe we may incur relatedto various pending litigation. The amount was allocated in part to a long running case we refer to as the Stanwich litigation,and also to more recent matters including two California class action suits where we are the defendant, and a governmental inquiry,in which the United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has informally proposed that the we refrain from certainallegedly unfair trade practices, and make restitutionary payments into a consumer relief fund. The discussion below omits the$7.8 million contingent liability expense from the year ended December 31, 2013 for comparative purposes.     Total operating expenses were $248.0 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $210.8 million for the prior year, an increase of $37.3 million, or 17.7%. Theincrease is primarily due to the increase in the amount of new contracts we purchased, the resulting increase in our consolidatedportfolio and associated servicing costs, and the related increase in our provision for credit losses. Increases in core operatingexpenses and provision for credit losses were partially offset by decreases in interest expense.     Employee costs increased by $7.2 million or16.7%, to $50.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, representing 20.2% of total operating expenses, from $43.0 millionfor the prior year, or 20.4% of total operating expenses. Since 2010, we have added employees in our Originations and Marketingdepartments to accommodate the increase in contract purchases. More recently, we have also added Servicing staff to accommodatethe increase in the number of accounts in our managed portfolio. The table below summarizes our employees by category as well ascontract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2014 and 2013:             December 31, 2014      December 31, 2013          Amount      Amount          ($ in millions)     Contracts purchased (dollars)    $ 944.9      $ 764.1     Contracts purchased (units)      59,276        48,995     Managed portfolio outstanding (dollars)    $ 1,643.9      $ 1,231.4     Managed portfolio outstanding (units)      124,074        99,842                           Number of Originations staff      210        172     Number of Marketing staff      155        119     Number of Servicing staff      445        348     Number of other staff      59        66     Total number of employees      869        705        General and administrative expenses includecosts associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, creditservices, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $19.3 million, an increase of $2.9 million, or 17.8%,compared to the previous year and represented 7.8% of total operating expenses.     Interest expense for the year ended December31, 2014 decreased by $7.8 million to $50.4 million, or 13.4%, compared to $58.2 million in the previous year.     Interest expense on the Fireside portfoliocredit facility decreased by $3.1 million compared to the prior year as the Fireside portfolio and the related debt have paid downto significantly lower levels over the last year.     Interest on securitization trust debt increasedby $3.8 million, or 10.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. Although the average balance of securitizationtrust debt increased 37.9% to $1,298.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $941.6 million for the year ended December31, 2013, the blended interest rates on new term securitizations since 2013 have been significantly lower than in previous years.As a result, during 2014, portions of our securitization trust debt that were outstanding at December 31, 2013 at higher blendedinterest rates were repaid as we added new securitization trust debt at significantly lower blended interest rates.     Interest expense on senior secured debt andsubordinated renewable notes decreased by $7.4 million, or 65.6%. This was due primarily to the repayment in full of $39.2 millionin senior secured debt in the first quarter of 2014. In addition, we reduced the balance of our outstanding subordinated renewablenotes by $3.9 million from $19.1 million at December 31, 2013 to $15.2 million at December 31, 2014. The reduction in interestexpense was also a result of our decreasing the average interest rate on our subordinated renewable notes from 14.5% for the yearended December 31, 2013 to 12.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014.         43           Interest expense on residual interest financingdecreased $1.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. The decrease is due to the repayments onthat facility of $6.8 million during the year.     Interest expense on warehouse lines of creditincreased by $214,000, or 4.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. Although we increased our contractpurchases by $180.9 million, or 23.7%, to $944.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year, we attemptto minimize the use of our warehouse credit facilities and rely more on unrestricted cash balances to fund our contract purchasesprior to securitization.     The following table presents the componentsof interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:            Year Ended December 31,          2014      2013          (Dollars in thousands)           Average  Balance (1)      Interest      Annualized Average  Yield/Rate      Average  Balance (1)      Interest      Annualized Average  Yield/Rate     Interest Earning Assets                                             Finance receivables gross (2)    $ 1,383,193      $ 285,169        20.6 %    $ 1,015,404      $ 225,268        22.2 %   Finance receivables measured at fair value      5,919        1,565        26.4 %      31,294        6,062        19.4 %        $ 1,389,112        286,734        20.6 %    $ 1,046,698        231,330        22.1 %                                                             Interest Bearing Liabilities                                                         Warehouse lines of credit    $ 52,596        5,217        9.9 %    $ 40,285        5,003        12.4 %   Residual interest financing      14,225        1,989        14.0 %      24,107        3,330        13.8 %   Debt secured by receivables measured at fair value      5,561        772        13.9 %      27,506        3,877        14.1 %   Securitization trust debt      1,298,033        38,558        3.0 %      941,591        34,744        3.7 %   Senior secured debt, related party      9,471        1,651        17.4 %      41,906        8,064        19.2 %   Subordinated renewable notes      17,074        2,208        12.9 %      21,763        3,161        14.5 %        $ 1,396,960        50,395        3.6 %    $ 1,097,158        58,179        5.3 %   Net interest income/spread           $ 236,339                        $ 173,151              Net interest margin (3)                      17.0 %                        16.5 %   Ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities      99 %                        95 %                        (1)  Average balances arebased on month end balances except for warehouse lines of credit, which are based on daily balances.

The provision for credit losses maintains the allowance for finance credit losses at levels that we feelare adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated. Our approach for establishing the allowancerequires greater amounts of provision for credit losses early in the terms of our finance receivables. Consequently, the increasein provision expense is the result of the increase in contract purchases during the last year and the larger portfolio owned byour consolidated subsidiaries compared to the prior year.     Marketing expenses consist primarily of commission-basedcompensation paid to our employee marketing representatives. Our marketing representatives earn a salary plus commissions basedon volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers, such as training programs,internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Marketing expenses increased by $2.8 million, or 20.6%, to $16.1 million duringthe year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $13.4 million in the prior year, and represented 6.5% of total operating expenses.For the year ended December 31, 2014, we purchased 59,276 contracts representing $944.9 million in receivables compared to 48,995contracts representing $764.1 million in receivables in the prior year.     Occupancy expenses increased by $856,000 or32.8%, to $3.5 million compared to $2.6 million in the previous year and represented 1.4% of total operating expenses. In April2014, we established our fifth servicing center located in Las Vegas, Nevada.     Depreciation and amortization expenses decreasedby $9,000 or 2.1%, to $428,000 compared to $437,000 in the previous year and represented 0.2% of total operating expenses.     For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recordedincome tax expense of $22.7 million, representing a 43.5% effective income tax rate. In the prior year, we recorded $16.2 millionof income tax expense, also representing a 43.5% effective income tax rate.     Liquidity and Capital Resources     Liquidity     Our business requires substantial cash tosupport purchases of automobile contracts and other operating activities. Our primary sources of cash have been cash flow fromoperating activities, including proceeds from term securitization transactions and other sales of automobile contracts, amountsborrowed under warehouse credit facilities, servicing fees on portfolios of automobile contracts previously sold in securitizationtransactions or serviced for third parties, customer payments of principal and interest on finance receivables, fees for originationof automobile contracts, and releases of cash from securitized portfolios of automobile contracts in which we have retained a residualownership interest and the related spread accounts. Our primary uses of cash have been the purchases of automobile contracts, repaymentof securitization trust debt, repayment of amounts borrowed under warehouse credit facilities, operating expenses such as employee,interest, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses, the establishment of spread accounts and initial overcollateralization,if any, and the increase of credit enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions, and income taxes. There can beno assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet our cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generatedcash will depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from those portfolios and theirrelated spread accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in our managed portfolio, and the terms upon which we are able topurchase, sell, and borrow against automobile contracts.     Net cash provided by operating activitiesfor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $187.6 million, $135.8 million and $99.4 million, respectively. Net cashfrom operating activities is generally provided by net income from operations adjusted for significant non-cash items such as ourprovision for credit losses, accretion of deferred acquisition fees and the $10.9 million gain on cancellation of debt in 2013.     Net cash used in investingactivities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $441.3 million, $541.2 million and $409.6 million, respectively.Cash provided by investing activities primarily results from principal payments and other proceeds received on finance receivablesheld for investment. Cash used in investing activities generally relates to purchases of finance receivables. Purchases of financereceivables held for investment were $1,060.5 million, $944.9 million and $764.1 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.The results for 2015 also reflect a decrease of $69.3 million in restricted cash. Our restricted cash balance at December 31, 2014included $85.3 million from the proceeds of the sale of the asset-backed notes that were held by the trustee pending delivery ofthe remaining receivables. Since we did not do a securitization in December of 2015, there was no related amount of restrictedcash representing the pre-funding proceeds.         45           Net cash provided by financing activitiesfor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $255.2 million, $401.1 million and $319.3 million, respectively. Cashused or provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to the repayment or issuance of debt, and in particular, securitizationtrust debt and portfolio acquisition financing. We issued $795.0 million in new securitization trust debt in 2015 compared to $923.0million in 2014 and $778.0 million in 2013. The decrease in new securitization trust debt from 2014 to 2015 is the result of ourforgoing what would have been our December 2015 securitization to January 2016. Repayments of securitization debt were $662.0 million,$502.2 million and $382.6 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.     We purchase automobile contracts from dealersfor a cash price approximating their principal amount, adjusted for an acquisition fee which may either increase or decrease theautomobile contract purchase price. Those automobile contracts generate cash flow, however, over a period of years. As a result,we have been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase automobile contracts, and on the availability of cash from outsidesources in order to finance our continuing operations, as well as to fund the portion of automobile contract purchase prices notfinanced under revolving warehouse credit facilities.     The acquisition of automobile contractsfor subsequent financing in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization,if any, and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. Theamount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initialcredit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established trusts and their related spread accountseither release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. Of those, the factor most subjectto our control is the rate at which we purchase automobile contracts.     We are and may in the future be limitedin our ability to purchase automobile contracts due to limits on our capital. As of December 31, 2015, we had unrestricted cashof $19.3 million. We had an aggregate of $103.5 million available under our three $100 million warehouse credit facilities (subjectto available eligible collateral). During 2015 we completed three securitizations aggregating $795.0 million of receivables, andwe intend to continue completing securitizations regularly during 2016, although there can be no assurance that we will be ableto do so. Our plans to manage our liquidity include maintaining our rate of automobile contract purchases at a level that matchesour available capital, and, as appropriate, minimizing our operating costs. If we are unable to complete such securitizations,we may be unable to increase our rate of automobile contract purchases, in which case our interest income and other portfolio relatedincome could decrease.     Our liquidity will also be affected by releasesof cash from the trusts established with our securitizations. While the specific terms and mechanics of each spread account varyamong transactions, our securitization agreements generally provide that we will receive excess cash flows, if any, only if theamount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and the delinquency, defaults or net losses related to the automobilecontracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies, defaults or net losses on the automobilecontracts exceed such levels, the terms of the securitization: (i) may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulated forthe particular pool; or (ii) in certain circumstances, may permit the transfer of servicing on some or all of the automobile contractsto another servicer. There can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will continue to generate sufficient cash.Moreover, some of our spread account balances are pledged as collateral to our residual interest financing and, under certain circumstances,releases from our spread account balances could be diverted to repay such residual interest financing.     We have and will continue to have a substantialamount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $1,952.2 million of debt outstanding. Such debt consisted primarilyof $1,731.6 million of securitization trust debt, $196.5 million of warehouse lines of credit, $9.0 million of residual interestfinancing and $15.1 million in subordinated renewable notes. We are also currently offering the subordinated notes to the publicon a continuous basis, and such notes have maturities that range from three months to 10 years.     Our recent operating results include pre-taxearnings of $61.4 million, $52.2 million, $37.2 million and $9.2 million in 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, preceded bypre-tax losses of $14.5 million and $16.2 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. We believe that our 2011 and 2010 results werematerially and adversely affected by the disruption in the capital markets that began in the fourth quarter of 2007, by the recessionthat began in December 2007, and by related high levels of unemployment.     Although we believe we are able to serviceand repay our debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If our plans for future operations do not generate sufficientcash flows and earnings, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. Failure to pay our indebtedness whendue could have a material adverse effect and may require us to issue additional debt or equity securities.         46           Contractual Obligations     The following table summarizes our materialcontractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):            Payment Due by Period (1)                 Less than      2 to 3      4 to 5      More than          Total      1 Year      Years      Years      5 Years     Long Term Debt (2)    $ 24,180      $ 12,310        9,533        618        1,719     Operating Leases    $ 33,341      $ 4,713        11,528        9,413        7,687         (1) Securitization trust debt, in the aggregate amount of $1,731.6 million as of December 31, 2015, is omitted from this tablebecause it becomes due as and when the related receivables balance is reduced by payments and charge-offs. Expected payments, whichwill depend on the performance of such receivables, as to which there can be no assurance, are $669.2 million in 2016, $506.5 millionin 2017, $315.4 million in 2018, $172.2 million in 2019, $64.3 million in 2020, and $4.0 million in 2021.   (2) Long-term debt includes residual interest debt and subordinated renewable notes.     For debt that is duein 2016, we anticipate repaying it with a combination of cash flows from operations and the potential issuance of new debt.     Warehouse Credit Facilities     The terms on which credit has been availableto us for purchase of automobile contracts have varied in recent years, as shown in the following summary of our warehouse creditfacilities:     Facility Established in December 2010. In December 2010 we entered into a $100 million two-year warehouse credit line with affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co. andFortress Investment Group.

We repaid the facility in full in April 2015.     Facility Established in May 2012. On May 11, 2012, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A. The facility isstructured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to ourconsolidated subsidiary Page Eight Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables.The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 5.50% per annum, with a minimum rate of 6.25% per annum. InAugust 2014, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to August 2016 and to include an amortization period throughAugust 2017 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2015 there was $73.9million outstanding under this facility.     Facility Established in April 2015.

At December 31, 2015 there was $31.0 million outstanding under this facility.         47           Capital Resources     Securitization trust debt is repaid fromcollections on the related receivables, and becomes due in accordance with its terms as the principal amount of the related receivablesis reduced. Although the securitization trust debt also has alternative final maturity dates, those dates are significantly laterthan the dates at which repayment of the related receivables is anticipated, and at no time in our history have any of our sponsoredasset-backed securities reached those alternative final maturities.     The acquisition of automobile contractsfor subsequent transfer in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization,if any, when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavilydependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations,and the extent to which the trusts and related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitizedautomobile contracts. We plan to adjust our levels of automobile contract purchases and the related capital requirements to matchanticipated releases of cash from the trusts and related spread accounts.     Capitalization     Over the period from January 1, 2013 throughDecember 31, 2015 we have managed our capitalization by issuing and refinancing debt as summarized in the following table:             Year Ended December 31,          2015      2014      2013          (Dollars in thousands)     RESIDUAL INTEREST FINANCING:                              Beginning balance    $ 12,327      $ 19,096      $ 13,773     Issuances      –        –        20,000     Payments      (3,285 )      (6,769 )      (14,677 )   Ending balance    $ 9,042      $ 12,327      $ 19,096                                    SECURITIZATION TRUST DEBT:                              Beginning balance    $ 1,598,496      $ 1,177,559      $ 792,497     Issuances      795,000        923,000        778,000     Payments      (661,960 )      (502,193 )      (382,591 )   Amortization of discount      62        130        600     Cancellation of debt      –        –        (10,947 )   Ending balance    $ 1,731,598      $ 1,598,496      $ 1,177,559                                    SENIOR SECURED DEBT, RELATED PARTY:                              Beginning balance    $ –      $ 38,559      $ 50,135     Issuances      –        –        5,284     Payments      –        (39,182 )      (18,852 )   Debt discount net of amortization      –        623        1,992     Ending balance    $ –      $ –      $ 38,559                                    SUBORDINATED RENEWABLE NOTES:                              Beginning balance    $ 15,233      $ 19,142      $ 23,281     Issuances      1,551        579        1,276     Payments      (1,646 )      (4,488 )      (5,415 )   Ending balance    $ 15,138      $ 15,233      $ 19,142                                    DEBT SECURED BY RECEIVABLES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE:                              Beginning balance    $ 1,250      $ 13,117      $ 57,107     Payments      (1,250 )      (12,456 )      (45,969 )   Accretion of premium      –        712        2,726     Mark to fair value      –        (123 )      (747 )   Ending balance    $ –      $ 1,250      $ 13,117            48           Residual Interest Financing.     In April 2013, we established a five-year$20 million term residual facility. The facility is secured by eligible residual interests in two previously securitized poolsof automobile receivables. The facility provides for effective advances up to 70.0% of the related borrowing base. Notes issuedunder the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 11.75% per annum. At December 31, 2015, there was $9.0 million outstandingunder this facility.     Securitization Trust Debt.   FromJuly 2003 through April 2008, we treated all securitizations of automobile contracts as secured financings for financial accountingpurposes, and the asset-backed securities issued in such securitizations remain on our consolidated balance sheet as securitizationtrust debt. Our September 2008 and the re-securitization of the remaining receivables from such transaction in September 2010 wereeach structured as a sale for financial accounting purposes and the asset-backed securities issued in those transactions have notbeen and are not on our consolidated balance sheet. Since 2011 all 18 of our securitizations have been treated as secured financingsand make up $1,731.6 million of our securitization trust debt at December 31, 2015.     Subordinated Renewable Notes Debt.   In June 2005, we began issuing registered subordinated renewable notes in an ongoing offering to the public. Upon maturity,the notes are automatically renewed for the same term as the maturing notes, unless we repay the notes or the investor notifiesus within 15 days after the maturity date of his note that he wants it repaid. Renewed notes bear interest at the rate we are offeringat that time to other investors with similar note maturities. Based on the terms of the individual notes, interest payments maybe required monthly, quarterly, annually or upon maturity. At December 31, 2015 there were $15.1 million of such notes outstanding.     We must comply with certain affirmativeand negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratiosrelated to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions.In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certaincreditors to declare default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance withall such covenants.     Forward-looking Statements     This report on Form 10-K includes certain " forward-looking statements ". Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as  " anticipates, "  " expects, "  " plans, "  " estimates, " or words of like meaning. As to the specifically identified forward-looking statements, factors that could affect charge-offs andrecovery rates include changes in the general economic climate, which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to paypursuant to the terms of contracts, changes in laws respecting consumer finance, which could affect our ability to enforce rightsunder contracts, and changes in the market for used vehicles, which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessedvehicles. Factors that could affect our revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools ofcontracts, which would affect our ability to purchase contracts, the terms on which we are able to finance such purchases, thewillingness of dealers to sell contracts to us on the terms that it offers, and the terms on which we are able to complete termsecuritizations once contracts are acquired. Factors that could affect our expenses in the current year include competitive conditionsin the market for qualified personnel, investor demand for asset-backed securities and interest rates (which affect the rates thatwe pay on asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations).   Thestatements concerning structuring securitization transactions as secured financings and the effects of such structures on financialitems and on future profitability also are forward-looking statements. Any change to the structure of our securitization transactioncould cause such forward-looking statements to be inaccurate. Both the amount of the effect of the change in structure on our profitabilityand the duration of the period in which our profitability would be affected by the change in securitization structure are estimates.The accuracy of such estimates will be affected by the rate at which we purchase and sell contracts, any changes in that rate,the credit performance of such contracts, the financial terms of future securitizations, any changes in such terms over time, andother factors that generally affect our profitability.        Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures AboutMarket Risk     Interest Rate Risk     We are subject to interest rate risk duringthe period between when contracts are purchased from dealers and when such contracts become part of a term securitization. Specifically,the interest rate due on our warehouse credit facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the contracts are fixed. Therefore,if interest rates increase, the interest we must pay to our lenders under warehouse credit facilities is likely to increase whilethe interest we receive from warehoused automobile contracts remains the same. As a result, excess spread cash flow would likelydecrease during the warehousing period. Additionally, automobile contracts warehoused and then securitized during a rising interestrate environment may result in less excess spread cash flow to us. Historically, our securitization facilities have paid fixedrate interest to security holders set at prevailing interest rates at the time of the closing of the securitization, which maynot take place until several months after we purchased those contracts. Our customers, on the other hand, pay fixed rates of intereston the automobile contracts, set at the time they purchase the underlying vehicles. A decrease in excess spread cash flow couldadversely affect our earnings and cash flow.         49           To mitigate, but not eliminate, the short-termrisk relating to interest rates payable under the warehouse facilities, we have historically held automobile contracts in the warehousecredit facilities for less than four months. To mitigate, but not eliminate, the long-term risk relating to interest rates payableby us in securitizations, we have structured our term securitization transactions to include pre-funding structures, whereby theamount of notes issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts. We expect to continue to use pre-funding structuresin our securitizations. In pre-funding, the proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until we sell theadditional contracts to the trust. In pre-funded securitizations, we lock in the borrowing costs with respect to the contractswe subsequently deliver to the securitization trust. However, we incur an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the differencebetween the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interestrate paid on the notes outstanding. The amount of such expense may vary. Despite these mitigation strategies, an increase in prevailinginterest rates would cause us to receive less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affectour earnings and cash flows.        Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
