ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS        The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or incorporated by reference herein.  OVERVIEW        We are a specialty finance company engaged in purchasing and servicing new and used retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealerships and, to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers of used automobiles in the United States. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to sub-prime customers who have limited credit history, low income or past credit problems and who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources. We are headquartered in Irvine, California and have three additional servicing branches in Virginia, Florida and Illinois.        On March 8, 2002, we acquired MFN Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries in a merger. On May 20, 2003, we acquired TFC Enterprises, Inc. and its subsidiaries in a second merger. Each merger was accounted for as a purchase. MFN Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries and TFC Enterprises, Inc. and its subsidiaries were engaged in businesses similar to ours: buying automobile contracts from dealers and servicing those automobile contracts. MFN Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries ceased acquiring automobile contracts in May 2002; TFC continues to acquire automobile contracts under its "TFC programs," which provide financing exclusively for vehicle purchases by members of the United States Armed Forces.        On April 2, 2004, we purchased a portfolio of automobile contracts and certain other assets from SeaWest Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries. In addition, we were named the successor servicer of three term securitization transactions originally sponsored by SeaWest. We do not offer financing programs similar to those previously offered by SeaWest.        From inception through June 2003, we generated revenue primarily from the gains recognized on the sale or securitization of automobile contracts, servicing fees earned on automobile contracts sold, interest earned on residuals interests retained in securitizations, and interest earned on finance receivables. Since July 2003, we have not recognized any gains from the sale of automobile contracts. Instead, since July 2003 our revenues have been derived from interest on finance receivables and, to a lesser extent, servicing fees and interest earned on residual interests in securitizations.  SECURITIZATION AND WAREHOUSE CREDIT FACILITIES  GENERALLY        Throughout the periods for which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through our warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to fund the transactions. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings.        When structured to be treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically: (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction, and (iii) record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts. Since July 2003, all of our securitizations have been structured in this fashion.        When structured to be treated as a sale for accounting purposes, the assets and liabilities of the special-purpose subsidiary are not consolidated with us. Accordingly, the transaction removes the sold automobile contracts from our consolidated balance sheet, the related debt does not appear as our debt, and our consolidated balance sheet shows, as an asset, a retained residual interest in the sold automobile contracts. The residual interest represents the discounted value of what we expect will be the excess of future collections on the automobile contracts over principal and interest due on the asset-backed securities. That residual interest appears on our consolidated balance sheet as "residual interest in securitizations," and the determination of its value is dependent on our estimates of the future performance of the sold automobile contracts. Since July 2003, none of our securitizations have been structured to be treated as a sale for accounting purposes.                                          26    CREDIT RISK RETAINED        Whether a sale of automobile contracts in connection with a securitization or warehouse credit facility is treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes, the related special-purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the related automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of such automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and our results of operations, regardless of whether such automobile contracts are treated for financial accounting purposes as having been sold or as having been financed. For estimation of the magnitude of such risk, it may be appropriate to look to the size of our "managed portfolio," which represents both financed and sold automobile contracts as to which such credit risk is retained. Our managed portfolio as of December 31, 2007 was approximately $2,126.2 million (this amount includes $422,000 of automobile contracts securitized by SeaWest, on which we earn only servicing fees and have no credit risk).  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES        We believe that our accounting policies related to (a) Allowance for Finance Credit Losses, (b) Amortization of Deferred Originations Costs and Acquisition Fees (c) Residual Interest in Securitizations and Gain on Sale of Automobile Contracts and (d) Income Taxes are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Such policies are described below.  ALLOWANCE FOR FINANCE CREDIT LOSSES        In order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses to be incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as "static pooling," which stratifies our finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on the period of origination. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of automobile contracts. Provision for losses is charged to our consolidated statement of operations. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, prospective liquidation values of the underlying collateral and general economic and market conditions. As circumstances change, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change as well.  AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ORIGINATIONS COSTS AND ACQUISITION FEES        Upon purchase of a contract from a dealer, we generally either charge or advance the dealer an acquisition fee. In addition, we incur certain direct costs associated with originations of our contracts. All such acquisition fees and direct costs are applied to the carrying value of finance receivables and are accreted into earnings as an adjustment to the yield over the estimated life of the contract using the interest method, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 91, Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases.  TERM SECURITIZATIONS        Our term securitization structure has generally been as follows:        We sell automobile contracts we acquire to a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling our automobile contracts. The special-purpose subsidiary then transfers the same automobile contracts to another entity, typically a statutory trust. The trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities, in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal balance of the automobile contracts. We typically sell these automobile contracts to the trust at face                                          27    value and without recourse, except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to us are provided by us to the trust. One or more investors purchase the asset-backed securities issued by the trust; the proceeds from the sale of the asset-backed securities are then used to purchase the automobile contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated asset-backed securities issued by the trust or by a related entity. We purchase external credit enhancement in the form of a financial guaranty insurance policy, guaranteeing timely payment of interest and ultimate payment of principal on the senior asset-backed securities, from an insurance company. In addition, we structure our securitizations to include internal credit enhancement for the benefit of the insurance company and the investors (i) in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account ("spread account") held by the trust, (ii) in the form of overcollateralization of the senior asset-backed securities, where the principal balance of the senior asset-backed securities issued is less than the principal balance of the automobile contracts, (iii) in the form of subordinated asset-backed securities, or (iv) some combination of such internal credit enhancements. The agreements governing the securitization transactions require that the initial level of internal credit enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the automobile contracts until the level of internal credit enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related automobile contracts. The specified levels at which the internal credit enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of automobile contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among us, our special purpose subsidiary, the insurance company and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied from one transaction to another. The agreements governing the securitizations generally grant us the option to repurchase the sold automobile contracts from the trust when the aggregate outstanding balance of the automobile contracts has amortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance.        The prior securitizations that were treated as sales for financial accounting purposes differ from those treated as secured financings in that the trust to which our special-purpose subsidiaries sold the automobile contracts met the definition of a "qualified special-purpose entity" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 ("SFAS 140"). As a result, assets and liabilities of those trusts are not consolidated into our consolidated balance sheet.        Our warehouse credit facility structures are similar to the above, except that (i) our special-purpose subsidiaries that purchase the automobile contracts pledge the automobile contracts to secure promissory notes that they issue, (ii) no increase in the required amount of internal credit enhancement is contemplated, and (iii) we do not purchase financial guaranty insurance. The primary agreements for our two warehouse facilities provide for an advance rate of up to 83% of eligible automobile contracts and aggregate borrowings of up to $400 million. In January and February 2007, both warehouse lines were amended to provide for an advance of up to 93% of the aggregate principal balance of eligible automobile contracts and aggregate borrowings of up to $425 million. The 2007 amendments relating to the 93% advance rate and the additional $25 million in borrowings have since expired and we have entered into a series of short-term extensions with the related lenders as we discuss longer term extensions. There can be no assurance as to the terms, if any, on which we may be able to agree to longer term extensions; however, we expect that those terms will include (i) a decreased advance rate, and (ii) and increased interest rate.        Upon each sale of automobile contracts in a transaction structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes, whether a term securitization or a warehouse financing, we retain on our consolidated balance sheet the related automobile contracts as assets and record the asset-backed notes issued in the transaction as indebtedness.        Under the prior securitizations and warehouse credit facilities structured as sales for financial accounting purposes, we removed from our consolidated balance sheet the automobile contracts sold and added to our consolidated balance sheet (i) the cash received, if any, and (ii) the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that we retained in the automobile contracts sold in the transaction. That retained or residual interest consisted of (a) the cash held in the spread account, if any, (b) overcollateralization, if any, (c) subordinated asset-backed securities retained, if any, and (d) receivables from the trust, which include the net interest receivables. Net interest receivables represent the estimated discounted cash flows to be received from the trust in the future, net of principal and interest payable with respect to the asset-backed notes, the premium paid to the insurance company, and certain other expenses. The excess of the cash received and the assets we retained over the carrying value of the automobile contracts sold, less transaction costs, equaled the net gain on sale of automobile contracts we recorded.                                         28          We receive periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the automobile contracts. (Under our current securitization structure, such servicing fees are included in interest income from the automobile contracts). In addition, we are entitled to the cash flows from the trusts that represent collections on the automobile contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the asset-backed securities, base servicing fees, and certain other fees and expenses (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of such notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related automobile contracts (excluding those automobile contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related securitization agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the asset-backed securities is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create overcollateralization of the asset-backed notes.        If the amount of cash required for payment of fees, expenses, interest and principal exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is withdrawn from the spread account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations, and there is no shortfall in the related spread account or the required overcollateralization level, the excess is released to us. If the spread account and overcollateralization is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the trust until the specified level is achieved. Although spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of our special-purpose subsidiaries as the owner of the residual interests (in the case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes) or the trusts (in the case of securitization transactions structured as secured financings for financial accounting purposes), we are restricted in use of the cash in the spread accounts. Cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the securitization agreements. The interest rate payable on the automobile contracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the asset-backed notes. As a result, the residual interests described above historically have been a significant asset of ours.        In all of our term securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, whether treated as secured financings or as sales, we have sold the automobile contracts (through a subsidiary) to the securitization entity. The difference between the two structures is that in securitizations that are treated as secured financings we report the assets and liabilities of the securitization trust on our consolidated balance sheet. Under both structures, recourse to us by holders of the asset-backed securities and by the trust, for failure of the automobile contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis, is limited to the automobile contracts included in the securitizations or warehouse credit facilities, the spread accounts and our retained interests in the respective trusts.        Since the third quarter of 2003, we have conducted 22 term securitizations. Of these 22, 17 were quarterly securitizations of automobile contracts that we purchased from automobile dealers under our regular programs. In addition, in March 2004 and November 2005, we completed securitizations of our retained interests in other securitizations that we and our affiliates previously sponsored. The debt from the March 2004 transaction was repaid in August 2005, and the debt from the November 2005 transaction was repaid in May 2007. Also, in June 2004, we completed a securitization of automobile contracts purchased in the SeaWest asset acquisition and under our TFC programs. Further, in December 2005 and June 2007, we completed securitizations that included automobile contracts purchased under the TFC programs, automobile contracts purchased under the CPS programs and automobile contracts we repurchased upon termination of prior securitizations of our MFN and TFC subsidiaries. All such securitizations since the third quarter of 2003 have been structured as secured financings.  INCOME TAXES        We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.        We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes.                                          29          In determining the possible realization of deferred tax assets, we consider future taxable income from future operations exclusive of reversing temporary differences and tax planning strategies that, if necessary, would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into periods in which net operating losses might otherwise expire.        In June 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation ("FIN") No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes," which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." FIN No. 48 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of FIN 48 and in subsequent periods. This interpretation also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.        We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES, on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of Interpretation 48, we recognized approximately a $1.1 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as a reduction to the January 1, 2007, balance of retained earnings.        We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet.  UNCERTAINTY OF CAPITAL MARKETS        We are dependent upon the continued availability of warehouse credit facilities and access to long-term financing through the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by our automobile contracts. Since 1994, we have completed 47 term securitizations comprising approximately $6.1 billion in contracts. We conducted four term securitizations in 2006 and four in 2007, including our most recent in September 2007. However, within the period of approximately four months prior to the filing of this report, we have observed unprecedented adverse changes in the market for securitized pools of automobile contracts. These changes include reduced liquidity, increased financial guaranty premiums and reduced demand for asset-backed securities, including for securities carrying a financial guaranty and for securities backed by sub-prime automobile receivables. We believe that these adverse changes in the capital markets are primarily the result of widespread defaults of sub-prime mortgages securing a variety of term securitizations and related financial instruments, including instruments carrying financial guarantees similar to those we typically obtain for our own term securitizations.        We have not securitized a pool of receivables since September 2007. As a result, we are approaching the limits of our warehouse credit facilities, as discussed below. We have engaged an investment banker to securitize our receivables prior to reaching those limits; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. We expect the structure of our next securitization to include substantially greater credit enhancement than recent past securitizations, including larger spread accounts, greater over-collateralization, a greater portion of subordinated bonds, or a combination of any or all of such forms of enhancement. All such forms of greater credit enhancement are likely to reduce the amount of cash available to us, both at inception of the securitization, and over the life of the transaction. Moreover, due to current conditions in the capital markets, we believe that any securitization transactions that we may execute during 2008 are likely to include substantially higher costs to us in the form of higher premiums for financial guaranty insurance, higher interest rates paid on the bonds sold by the securitization trust and greater discounts given to the purchasers of subordinated bonds.        The adverse changes that have taken place in the market to date have resulted in a substantial extension of the period during which our automobile contracts are financed through our warehouse credit facilities, which has burdened our financing capabilities, and has caused us to curtail our purchase of such automobile contracts. If the current adverse circumstances that have affected the capital markets preclude us from completing a securitization of our receivables, we may exhaust the capacity of our warehouse credit facilities which would cause us to further curtail or cease our purchases of new automobile contracts. Further adverse changes in the capital markets might result in our inability to securitize automobile contracts which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operations.                                         30          If we were unable to securitize a pool of receivables by May 2008, we would likely be in default under the terms of our two revolving warehouse facilities. The defaults would arise because a significant portion of the collateral securing those facilities (pledged automobile contracts) would have been held for more than 180 days and would no longer be eligible for inclusion in each facilities computed "borrowing base." The result would be a reduction in the amount that we would be allowed to borrow under those facilities, without a corresponding reduction in the amount of indebtedness outstanding. We would expect the warehouse facilities to be in default, as the outstanding indebtedness exceeded the permitted amount. In the event of such a default, and assuming no waiver or modification of the underlying agreements, the warehouse lenders would be entitled (1) to receive a default rate of interest, (2) to accelerate the maturity of the outstanding indebtedness, and then to apply all cashflows attributable to the pledged collateral toward accelerated payment of the debt, (3) to terminate us as servicer of the pledged contracts, and (4) to sell the pledged contracts and to apply the proceeds to the debt. We may choose to sell in whole-loan sale transactions some portion of the most seasoned contracts pledged to the warehouse facilities which would postpone a likely default from May 2008 until some future period. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete such whole-loan sales.        If such circumstances caused both warehouse facilities to be unavailable to us, our failure to maintain an available warehouse facility would be a default under two of our 19 outstanding securitization transactions, which are the two that have issued asset-backed securities guaranteed by MBIA Insurance Corporation, and which are named CPS Auto Receivables Trust 2006-B and CPS Auto Receivables Trust 2007-A. Such a default, unless waived, would give MBIA certain rights, including (1) assessing a default insurance premium, (2) trapping excess cash to be retained in the restricted cash spread accounts related to those trusts, and (3) terminating our appointment as servicer of the related contracts.        If we were to be terminated as servicer of two or more securitized pools, that termination would in turn be a default under our combined term and revolving residual interest financing facility. Any such default, unless waived, would permit the residual interest lender to declare all amounts then outstanding immediately due and payable, which would result in cash releases from securitizations pledged to the combined term and residual interest facility being diverted to pay principal and interest due thereunder. Such a diversion of cash to pay down the residual interest facility would significantly decrease the cash available to us to conduct operations and would likely cause us to significantly curtail, if not cease altogether, further purchases of contracts. In any case, the revolving portion of the combined facility matures in July 2008, at which time we intend either to negotiate a renewal with the residual interest lender or to obtain other long-term financing to repay that debt. There can be no assurance that we will be able to do either.        If a default under one or both of the revolving warehouse facilities occurs, and one or both lenders exercised their option to sell the related contracts to satisfy the warehouse debt, we may incur a loss on such sale of the contracts. If the loss were significant, and together with our other results from operations were to result in a significant operating loss for a quarter, such loss could result in an event of default under agreements related to five others of our 19 outstanding securitization transactions, which are those that have issued asset-backed securities guaranteed by XL Capital Assurance Inc. Such a default, unless waived, would give XL Capital certain rights, including (1) assessing a default insurance premium, (2) trapping excess cash to be retained in the restricted cash spread accounts related to those trusts, and (3) terminating our appointment as servicer of the related contracts. However, we believe that transfers of servicing of securitized sub-prime automobile portfolios are rare and would likely have a negative effect on the performance of the portfolios.        Our financing structures are complex. Our warehouse, securitization and residual interest financings all employ bankruptcy-remote, wholly-owned, special purpose entities which serve to isolate pledged assets and the related debt from the parent entity, Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. One effect of these structures is to limit lenders' and insurers' recourse to rights related to their respective collateral. Such rights include termination of CPS as servicer of the related collateral, and foreclosure sale of the related collateral.        If we were unable to securitize a pool of receivables within some 30 to 60 days following this filing and one or more of the events of default and related actions described above should occur, our sources of liquidity would be materially impaired. In that event, we would attempt to reduce our uses of cash by a corresponding amount, principally by significantly curtailing, or by ceasing altogether, to purchase automobile contracts. When we choose to reduce purchases of automobile contracts, as we have recently done as a result of the uncertainty in the capital markets, we do so by (1) tightening our contract purchase criteria, resulting in more selective purchases, (2) withdrawing from selected geographic markets, and (3) terminating selected marketing representatives and dealer relationships.        Although we believe that such reductions in contract purchases would allow us to continue operations even in the face of such events of default and related actions as are described above, a sufficiently steep decrease in our purchases of automobile contracts would result in a decrease in the size of our portfolio of automobile contracts. Such a decrease in portfolio size, together with the effect of some or all of the possible actions associated with the events of default described above, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations. However, continuing cashflows otherwise available to us would be sufficient to meet our remaining operating needs in the near term.                                           31   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006        REVENUES. During the year ended December 31, 2007, revenues were $394.6 million, an increase of $115.7 million, or 41.5%, from the prior year revenue of $278.9 million. The primary reason for the increase in revenues is an increase in interest income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $106.7 million, or 40.5%, to $370.3 million from $263.6 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the increase in interest income is the increase in finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries (resulting in an increase of $109.4 million in interest income) and the increase in interest earned on cash deposits (including restricted cash deposits) of $2.8 million. These increases were partially offset by the decline in the balance of the portfolios of automobile contracts we acquired in the MFN, TFC and SeaWest transactions (in the aggregate, resulting in a decrease of $2.2 million in interest income), and a decrease in interest income on our residual asset of $2.1 million.        Servicing fees totaling $1.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $1.7 million, or 57.9%, from $2.9 million in the prior year. The decrease in servicing fees is the result of the change in securitization structure and the consequent decline in our managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries. As a result of the decision to structure future securitizations as secured financings, our managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries is zero, and future servicing fee revenue is anticipated to be nominal. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, our managed portfolio owned by consolidated vs. non-consolidated subsidiaries and other third parties was as follows:                                                      DECEMBER 31, 2007           DECEMBER 31, 2006                                            --------------------------   --------------------------                                               AMOUNT          %            AMOUNT          %                                            ------------  ------------   ------------  ------------ TOTAL MANAGED PORTFOLIO                                        ($ IN MILLIONS) Owned by Consolidated Subsidiaries.......  $    2,125.8        100.0%   $    1,527.3         97.5% Owned by Non-Consolidated Subsidiaries...             -          0.0%           34.8          2.2% SeaWest Third Party Portfolio............           0.4          0.0%            3.8          0.2%                                            ------------  ------------   ------------  ------------  Total....................................  $    2,126.2        100.0%   $    1,565.9        100.0%                                            ============  ============   ============  ============         At December 31, 2007, we were generating income and fees on a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance of $2,126.2 million (this amount includes $422,000 of automobile contracts securitized by SeaWest, on which we earn only servicing fees), compared to a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance of $1,565.9 million as of December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the managed portfolio composition was as follows:                                                      DECEMBER 31, 2007           DECEMBER 31, 2006                                            --------------------------   --------------------------                                               AMOUNT          %            AMOUNT          %                                            ------------  ------------   ------------  ------------ ORIGINATING ENTITY                                             ($ IN MILLIONS) CPS......................................  $    2,062.8         97.0%   $    1,496.5         95.6% TFC......................................          62.0          3.0%           60.9          3.9% MFN......................................           0.0          0.0%            0.2          0.0% SeaWest..................................           1.0          0.0%            4.5          0.3% SeaWest Third Party Portfolio............           0.4          0.0%            3.8          0.2%                                            ------------  ------------   ------------  ------------ Total....................................  $    2,126.2        100.0%   $    1,565.9        100.0%                                            ============  ============   ============  ============                                           32          Other income increased $10.7 million, or 86.0%, to $23.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 from $12.4 million during the prior year. The year over year increase is the result of a variety of factors. Current year other income includes $6.2 million resulting from an increase in the carrying value of our residual interest in securitizations (a $5.0 million increase over the increase in carrying value for the prior year). The carrying value was increased primarily as a result of the underlying receivables having incurred fewer losses than we had previously estimated, which in turn resulted in actual cash flows exceeding cash flows that were estimated in our valuation of the residual asset at December 31, 2006. We do not expect that future cash flows will significantly exceed the estimates we are currently using for the valuation of our residual interest. The current year period also includes proceeds of $1.8 million from the sale of certain charged off receivables acquired in the MFN, TFC and SeaWest acquisitions. There was no sale of charged off receivables in 2006. In addition, we experienced increases in convenience fees charged to obligors for certain transaction types (an increase of $1.3 million) and $1.0 million in recoveries on a note to a third party that we had previously written off. We also experienced increased revenue on our direct mail services (an increase of $1.6 million). These direct mail services are provided to our dealers and consist of customized solicitations targeted to prospective vehicle purchasers, in proximity to the dealer, who appear to meet our credit criteria. These increases to other income were somewhat offset by decreases in recoveries on MFN and certain other automobile contracts (a decrease of $1.2 million) compared to the prior year.        EXPENSES. Our operating expenses consist primarily of provisions for credit losses, interest expense, employee costs and general and administrative expenses. Provisions for credit losses and interest expense are significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during a period and by the outstanding balance of finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and the unemployment level.        Employee costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding warrants and stock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced.        Other operating expenses consist primarily of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, marketing and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization.        Total operating expenses were $370.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $265.7 million for the prior year, an increase of $104.9 million, or 39.5%. The increase is primarily due to increases in provision for credit losses and interest expense, which increased by $45.2 million and $46.1 million, or 49.1% and 49.5%, respectively. Both interest expense and provision for credit losses are directly affected by the growth in our portfolio of automobile contracts held by consolidated affiliates.        Employee costs increased by 21.4% to $46.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, representing 12.6% of total operating expenses, from $38.5 million for the prior year, or 14.5% of total operating expenses. The decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher total of operating expenses, primarily a result of the increased provision for credit losses and interest expense. The increase in employee costs is the result of additions to our staff, generally throughout all areas of the Company, to accommodate greater volumes of contract purchases and the resulting higher balance of our managed portfolio. As of December 31, 2007 we had 997 employees compared to 789 employees at December 31, 2006.        General and administrative expenses increased by 7.6% to $25.0 million and represented 6.7% of total operating expenses in the year ending December 31, 2007, as compared to the prior year when general and administrative expenses represented 8.7% of total operating expenses. The decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher operating expenses primarily a result of the provision for credit losses and interest expense.        Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $46.1 million, or 49.5%, to $139.2 million, compared to $93.1 million in the previous year. The increase is primarily the result of changes in the amount and composition of securitization trust debt carried on our consolidated balance sheet. Interest on securitization trust debt increased by $40.9 million in 2007 compared to the prior year. We also experienced increases in warehouse interest expense and residual interest financing interest expenses of $5.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively. A portion of the increase in interest expense can also be attributed to a gradual increase in market interest rates during 2007. Increases in interest expense for securitization trust debt, warehouse and residual interest financing were somewhat offset by a decrease of $1.0 million in interest expense for subordinated debt.                                         33          Marketing expenses consist primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee marketing representatives and increased by $4.1 million, or 29.3%, to $18.1 million, compared to $14.0 million in the previous year and represented 4.9% of total operating expenses. The increase is primarily due to the increase in automobile contracts we purchased during the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we purchased 83,246 automobile contracts aggregating $1,282.3 million, compared to 66,504 automobile contracts aggregating $1,019.0 million in the prior year.        Occupancy expenses decreased slightly by $219,000 or 5.5%, to $3.8 million compared to $4.0 million in the previous year and represented 1.0% of total operating expenses.        Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $253,000, or 31.6%, to $547,000 from $800,000 in the previous year.        For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded tax expense of $10.1 million or 42.2% of income before income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded an income tax benefit of $41.8 million related to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, offset by current income tax paid or then payable of $20.2 million, less $4.8 million in deferred tax benefit. As of December 31, 2007, we had remaining deferred tax assets of $68.6 million, partially offset by a valuation allowance of $9.8 million related to federal and state net operating losses and other timing differences, leaving a net deferred tax asset of $58.8 million.  COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005        REVENUES. During the year ended December 31, 2006, revenues were $278.9 million, an increase of $85.2 million, or 44.0%, from the prior year revenue of $193.7 million. The primary reason for the increase in revenues is an increase in interest income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $91.7 million, or 53.4%, to $263.6 million from $171.8 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the increase in interest income is the increase in finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries (resulting in an increase of $102.4 million in interest income). This increase was partially offset by the decline in the balance of the portfolios of automobile contracts we acquired in the MFN, TFC and SeaWest transactions (in the aggregate, resulting in a decrease of $10.9 million in interest income). In addition, interest income on our residual asset increased by $318,000.        Servicing fees totaling $2.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased $3.8 million, or 56.5%, from $6.6 million in the prior year. The decrease in servicing fees is the result of the change in securitization structure and the consequent decline in our managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries. As a result of the decision to structure future securitizations as secured financings, our managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries will continue to decline in future periods, and servicing fee revenue is anticipated to decline proportionately. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, our managed portfolio owned by consolidated vs. non-consolidated subsidiaries and other third parties was as follows:                                                      DECEMBER 31, 2006           DECEMBER 31, 2005                                            --------------------------   --------------------------                                               AMOUNT          %            AMOUNT          %                                            ------------  ------------   ------------  ------------ Total Managed Portfolio                                        ($ IN MILLIONS) Owned by Consolidated Subsidiaries.......  $    1,527.3         97.5%   $    1,000.6         89.2% Owned by Non-Consolidated Subsidiaries...          34.8          2.2%          103.1          9.2% SeaWest Third Party Portfolio............           3.8          0.2%           18.0          1.6%                                            ------------  ------------   ------------  ------------ Total....................................  $    1,565.9        100.0%   $    1,121.7        100.0%                                            ============  ============   ============  ============                                          34          At December 31, 2006, we were generating income and fees on a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance of $1,565.9 million (this amount includes $3.8 million of automobile contracts securitized by SeaWest, on which we earn only servicing fees), compared to a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance of $1,121.7 million as of December 31, 2005. As the portfolios of automobile contracts acquired in the MFN merger, TFC merger, and SeaWest transaction decrease, the portfolio of automobile contracts that we purchased directly from automobile dealers continues to expand. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the managed portfolio composition was as follows:                                                      DECEMBER 31, 2006           DECEMBER 31, 2005                                            --------------------------   --------------------------                                               AMOUNT          %            AMOUNT          %                                            ------------  ------------   ------------  ------------ Originating Entity                                             ($ in millions) CPS......................................  $    1,496.5         95.6%   $    1,017.3         90.7% TFC......................................          60.9          3.9%           68.6          6.1% MFN......................................           0.2          0.0%            2.5          0.2% SeaWest..................................           4.5          0.3%           15.3          1.4% SeaWest Third Party Portfolio............           3.8          0.2%           18.0          1.6%                                            ------------  ------------   ------------  ------------ Total....................................  $    1,565.9        100.0%   $    1,121.7        100.0%                                            ============  ============   ============  ============         Other income decreased $2.8 million, or 18.5%, to $12.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $15.2 million during the prior year. The year over year decrease is the result of a variety of factors. Current year other income includes $1.2 million resulting from an increase in the carrying value of our residual interest in securitizations. The carrying value was increased primarily as a result of the underlying receivables having incurred fewer losses than we had previously estimated. The prior year period included proceeds of $2.4 million from the sale of certain charged off receivables acquired in the MFN, TFC and SeaWest acquisitions. In addition, we experienced decreases in recoveries on MFN and certain other automobile contracts (a decrease of $638,000) compared to the same prior year and decreased revenue on our direct mail services (a decrease of $752,000). These direct mail services are provided to our dealers and consist of customized solicitations targeted to prospective vehicle purchasers, in proximity to the dealer, who appear to meet our credit criteria. We also experienced increases in convenience fees charged to obligors for certain transaction types (an increase of $690,000).        EXPENSES. Our operating expenses consist primarily of provisions for credit losses, interest expense, employee costs and general and administrative expenses. Provisions for credit losses and interest expense are significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during a period and by the outstanding balance of finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and the unemployment level.

Total operating expenses were $265.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $190.3 million for the prior year, an increase of $75.3 million, or 39.6%. The increase is primarily due to increases in provision for credit losses and interest expense, which increased by $33.1 million and $41.4 million, or 56.1% and 80.2%, respectively. Both interest expense and provision for credit losses are directly affected by the growth in our portfolio of automobile contracts held by consolidated affiliates.                                         35          Employee costs decreased slightly to $38.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, representing 14.5% of total operating expenses, from $40.4 million for the prior year, or 21.2% of total operating expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we deferred $2.9 million of direct employee costs associated with the purchase of automobile contracts in the period, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 91, Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases (SFAS 91). Prior to 2006, we have not deferred and amortized such costs as our analyses indicated that the effect of such deferral and amortization would not have been material. However, due to continued increases in volumes of automobile contract purchases and refinements in our methodology to measure direct costs associated with automobile contract purchases, our estimate of direct costs has increased, resulting in the need to defer such costs and amortize them over the lives of the related automobile contracts as an adjustment to the yield in accordance with SFAS 91. The decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher total of operating expenses, primarily a result of the increased provision for credit losses and interest expense.        General and administrative expenses increased slightly to $23.2 million and represented 8.7% of total operating expenses in the year ending December 31, 2006, as compared to the prior year when general and administrative expenses represented 12.1% of total operating expenses. The decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher operating expenses primarily a result of the provision for credit losses and interest expense.        Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $41.4 million, or 80.2%, to $93.1 million, compared to $51.7 million in the previous year. The increase is primarily the result of changes in the amount and composition of securitization trust debt carried on our consolidated balance sheet. Interest on securitization trust debt increased by $40.5 million in 2006 compared to the prior year. We also experienced increases in warehouse interest expense and residual interest financing interest expenses of $2.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively. A portion of the increase in interest expense can also be attributed to a gradual increase in market interest rates during 2006. Increases in interest expense for securitization trust debt, warehouse and residual interest financing were somewhat offset by a decrease of $4.5 million in interest expense for subordinated debt.        Marketing expenses consist primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee marketing representatives and increased by $2.0 million, or 16.9%, to $14.0 million, compared to $12.0 million in the previous year and represented 5.3% of total operating expenses. The increase is primarily due to the increase in automobile contracts we purchased during the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we purchased 66,504 automobile contracts aggregating $1,019.0 million, compared to 46,666 automobile contracts aggregating $691.3 million in the prior year.        Occupancy expenses increased by $583,000 or 17.1%, to $4.0 million compared to $3.4 million in the previous year and represented 1.5% of total operating expenses.        Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $10,000, or 1.3%, to $800,000 from $790,000 in the previous year.        During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded an income tax benefit of $41.8 million related to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, offset by current income tax paid or currently payable of $20.2 million, less $4.8 million in deferred tax benefit. As of December 31, 2006, we had remaining deferred tax assets of $64.1 million, partially offset by a valuation allowance of $9.4 million related to federal and state net operating losses and other timing differences, leaving a net deferred tax asset of $54.7 million.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  LIQUIDITY        Our business requires substantial cash to support purchases of automobile contracts and other operating activities. Our primary sources of cash have been cash flows from operating activities, including proceeds from sales of automobile contracts, amounts borrowed under our warehouse credit facilities, servicing fees on portfolios of automobile contracts previously sold in securitization transactions or serviced for third parties, customer payments of principal and interest on finance receivables, fees for origination of automobile contracts, and releases of cash from securitized portfolios of automobile contracts in which we have retained a residual ownership interest and from the spread accounts associated with such pools. Our primary uses of cash have been the purchases of automobile contracts, repayment of amounts borrowed under warehouse credit facilities and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses, the establishment of spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, and the increase of credit enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions, and income taxes. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet our cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from those portfolios and their related spread accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in our managed portfolio, and the terms upon which we are able to purchase, sell, and borrow against automobile contracts.                                         36          Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $153.4 million, $92.4 million and $69.2 million, respectively. Cash from operating activities is generally provided by net income from our operations. The increase in 2007 vs. 2006, and 2006 vs. 2005, is due in part to our increased net earnings before the significant increase in the provision for credit losses.        Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, was $665.4 million, $603.7 million, and $444.2 million, respectively. Cash used in investing activities generally relates to purchases of automobile contracts. Purchases of finance receivables held for investment were $1,282.3 million, $1,019.0 million and $691.3 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities is also affected by changes in the amounts of restricted cash and equivalents, which in turn, is affected by the timing and structure of our asset-backed securitization transactions. In December of 2006 and 2005, we completed securitization transactions which included a pre-funding component that resulted in specific restricted cash deposits of $70.3 million and $58.1 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In December 2007, we did not complete a securitization transaction with a pre-funding component and, as such, there was no corresponding restricted cash deposit at December 31, 2007.        Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007, was $518.6 million compared with $507.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $378.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Cash used or provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to the issuance or repayment of debt. We issued $1,035.9 million of securitization trust debt in 2007 as compared to $1,003.6 million in 2006 and $662.4 million in 2005. Issuances of securitization debt were offset by repayments of $685.9 million, $487.7 million and $282.6 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.        We purchase automobile contracts from dealers for a cash price approximating their principal amount, adjusted for an acquisition fee which may either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price. Those automobile contracts generate cash flow, however, over a period of years. As a result, we have been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase automobile contracts, and on the availability of cash from outside sources in order to finance our continuing operations, as well as to fund the portion of automobile contract purchase prices not financed under revolving warehouse credit facilities. As of December 31, 2007, we had $425 million in warehouse credit capacity, in the form of two $200 million facilities, and one $25 million subordinated facility. One $200 million facility provides funding for automobile contracts purchased under the TFC programs while both warehouse facilities provide funding for automobile contracts purchased under the CPS programs. The subordinated facility was established on January 12, 2007 and was scheduled to expire on January 12, 2008. We have entered into successive short-term extensions as we discuss longer term arrangements with the subordinated lenders and other prospective lenders.        The first of two warehouse facilities mentioned above is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by our consolidated subsidiary Page Three Funding, LLC. This facility was established on November 15, 2005, and expires on November 14, 2008, although it is renewable with the mutual agreement of the parties. On November 8, 2006 the facility was increased from $150 million to $200 million and the maximum advance rate was increased to 83% from 80% of eligible contracts, subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants. On January 12, 2007 the facility was amended to allow for the issuance of subordinated notes resulting in an increase of the maximum advance rate to 93%. The advance rate is subject to the lender's valuation of the collateral which, in turn, is affected by factors such as the credit performance of our managed portfolio and the terms and conditions of our term securitizations, including the expected yields required for bonds issued in our term securitizations. Senior notes under this facility accrue interest at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum while the subordinated notes accrue interest at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus 5.50% per annum. At December 31, 2007, $103.2 million was outstanding under this facility.        The second of two warehouse facilities is similarly structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by our consolidated subsidiary Page Funding LLC. This facility was entered into on June 30, 2004. On June 29, 2005 the facility was increased from $100 million to $125 million and further amended to provide for funding for automobile contracts purchased under the TFC programs, in addition to our CPS programs. The available credit under the facility was increased again to $200 million on August 31, 2005. In April 2006, the terms of this facility were amended to allow advances to us of up to 80% of the principal balance of automobile contracts that we purchase under our CPS programs, and of up to 70% of the principal balance of automobile contracts that we purchase under our TFC programs, in all events subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants. On June 30, 2006, the terms of this facility were amended to allow advances to us of up to 83% of the principal balance of automobile contracts that we purchase under our CPS programs, in all events subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants. In February 2007 the facility was amended to allow for the issuance of subordinated notes resulting in an increase of the maximum advance rate to 93%.                                          37    The advance rate is subject to the lender's valuation of the collateral which, in turn, is affected by factors such as the credit performance of our managed portfolio and the terms and conditions of our term securitizations. Senior notes under this facility accrue interest at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum while the subordinated notes accrue interest at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus 5.50% per annum. The facility expires on September 30, 2008, unless renewed by us and the lender before that time. At December 31, 2007, $132.7 million was outstanding under this facility. In January 2008 the interest rate on the subordinated notes increased to one-month LIBOR plus 12%.        The balance outstanding under these warehouse facilities generally will increase as we purchase additional automobile contracts, until we effect a securitization utilizing automobile contracts warehoused in the facilities, at which time the balance outstanding will decrease.        We securitized $1,118.1 million of automobile contracts in four private placement transactions during the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $957.7 million of automobile contracts in four private placement transactions during the year ended December 31, 2006. All of these transactions were structured as secured financings and, therefore, resulted in no gain on sale.        In November 2005, we completed a securitization whereby a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote consolidated subsidiary of ours issued $45.8 million of asset-backed notes secured by its retained interest in 10 term securitization transactions. At December 31, 2006 there was $19.6 million outstanding on this facility and in May 2007 the notes were fully repaid. In December 2006 we entered into a $35 million residual credit facility that was secured by our retained interests in additional term securitizations. At December 31, 2006, there was $12.2 million outstanding under this facility. In July 2007, we established a combination term and revolving residual credit facility and used a portion of our initial draw under that facility to repay our remaining outstanding debt under the December 2006 $35 million residual facility.        Under the combination term and revolving residual credit facility, we have used and intend to use eligible residual interests in securitizations as collateral for floating rate borrowings. The amount that we may borrow is computed using an agreed valuation methodology of the residuals, subject to an overall maximum principal amount of $120 million, represented by (i) a $60 million Class A-1 variable funding note (the "revolving note"), and (ii) a $60 million Class A-2 term note (the "term note"). The term note has been fully drawn and is due in July 2009. As of December 31, 2007, we have drawn $10 million on the revolving note. The facility's revolving feature expires in July 2008.        In our annual report on Form 10-K for December 31, 2006, we identified as one of our capital requirements our obligation to repay $25.0 million of outstanding senior secured debt by its maturity date of May 31, 2007. In July 2007, we used a portion of the term note under the combination term and revolving residual credit facility to repay our remaining outstanding senior secured debt, after having been partially repaid and amended with respect to the maturity date during the preceding quarter.        Cash released to us from trusts and their related spread accounts related to the portfolio owned by consolidated subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $2.7 million, $16.5 million and $23.1 million, respectively. Changes in the amount of credit enhancement required for term securitization transactions and releases from trusts and their related spread accounts are affected by the structure of the credit enhancement and the relative size, seasoning and performance of the various pools of automobile contracts securitized that make up our managed portfolio to which the respective spread accounts are related. The trend in our recent securitizations has been towards credit enhancements that require a lower proportion of spread account cash and a greater proportion of over collateralization. This trend has led to somewhat lower levels of restricted cash and releases from trusts relative to the size of our managed portfolio.        The acquisition of automobile contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established trusts and their related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. We may be limited in our ability to purchase automobile contracts due to limits on our capital. As of December 31, 2007, we had unrestricted cash on hand of $20.9 million and available capacity from our warehouse credit facilities of $189.1 million. Warehouse capacity is subject to the availability of suitable automobile contracts to serve as collateral and of sufficient cash to fund the portion of such automobile contracts purchase price not advanced under the warehouse facilities. Our plans to manage the need for liquidity include the completion of additional securitizations that would provide additional credit availability from the warehouse credit facilities, and matching our levels of automobile contract purchases to our availability of cash. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete securitizations on favorable economic terms or that we will be able to complete securitizations at all. If we are unable to complete such securitizations, we may be unable to purchase automobile contracts and interest income and other portfolio related income would decrease.                                         38          Our primary means of ensuring that our cash demands do not exceed our cash resources is to match our levels of automobile contract purchases to our availability of cash. Our ability to adjust the quantity of automobile contracts that we purchase and securitize will be subject to general competitive conditions and the continued availability of warehouse credit facilities. There can be no assurance that the desired level of automobile contract purchases can be maintained or increased. While the specific terms and mechanics of each spread account vary among transactions, our securitization agreements generally provide that we will receive excess cash flows only if the amount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and/or the delinquency, defaults or net losses related to the automobile contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies, defaults or net losses on the automobile contracts exceed such levels, the terms of the securitization: (i) may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulated for the particular pool; (ii) may restrict the distribution to us of excess cash flows associated with other pools; or (iii) in certain circumstances, may permit the insurers to require the transfer of servicing on some or all of the automobile contracts to another servicer. There can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will continue to generate sufficient cash.        Certain of our securitization transactions and the warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels and maximum financial losses. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility.        The agreements under which we receive periodic fees for servicing automobile contracts in securitizations are terminable by the respective insurance companies upon defined events of default, and, in some cases, at the will of the insurance company. Were an insurance company in the future to exercise its option to terminate such agreements, such a termination could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations, depending on the number and value of the terminated agreements. Our note insurers continue to extend our term as servicer on a monthly and/or quarterly basis, pursuant to the servicing agreements.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS        The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands):                                                            PAYMENT DUE BY PERIOD (1)                                      ---------------------------------------------------------                                                  LESS THAN    1 TO 3      4 TO 5     MORE THAN                                        TOTAL      1 YEAR       YEARS       YEARS      5 YEARS                                      ---------   ---------   ---------   ---------   ---------         Long Term Debt (2).........  $  98,133   $  18,351   $  78,389   $   1,363   $      30         Operating Leases...........  $   6,956   $   3,172   $   2,290   $   1,248   $     246   (1)   SECURITIZATION TRUST DEBT, IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1,798.3 MILLION AS       OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, IS OMITTED FROM THIS TABLE BECAUSE IT BECOMES DUE AS       AND WHEN THE RELATED RECEIVABLES BALANCE IS REDUCED. EXPECTED PAYMENTS,       WHICH WILL DEPEND ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH RECEIVABLES, AS TO WHICH       THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, ARE $714.4 MILLION IN 2008, $530.9 MILLION IN       2009, $324.5 MILLION IN 2010, $168.7 MILLION IN 2011, $57.3 MILLION IN       2012, AND $2.5 MILLION IN 2013. (2)   LONG-TERM DEBT INCLUDES RESIDUAL INTEREST DEBT AND SUBORDINATED RENEWABLE       NOTES.  WAREHOUSE CREDIT FACILITIES        The terms on which credit has been available to us for purchase of automobile contracts have varied over the three years 2005-2007 and through December 31, 2007, as shown in the following summary of our warehouse credit facilities:                                         39          FACILITY IN USE FROM JUNE 2004 TO PRESENT. In June 2004, we (through our subsidiary Page Funding LLC) entered into a floating rate variable note purchase facility. Up to $200.0 million of senior notes may be outstanding under this facility at any time subject to certain collateral tests and other conditions. We use funds derived from this facility to purchase automobile contracts under the CPS programs and TFC programs, which are pledged to secure the notes. The collateral tests and other conditions generally allow us to borrow up to approximately 93% of the principal balance of automobile contracts that we purchase under our CPS programs (up to 83.0% in the form of senior notes and the remainder in the form of subordinated notes), and of up to 70% of the principal balance of automobile contracts that we purchase under our TFC programs. The advance rate is subject to the lender's valuation of the collateral which, in turn, is affected by factors such as the credit performance of our managed portfolio and the terms and conditions of our term securitizations, including the expected yields required for bonds issued in our term securitizations. Senior notes issued under this facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum while the subordinated notes accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 5.50% per annum. The balance of notes outstanding related to this facility at December 31, 2006 was $132.7 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2007, the interest rate on the subordinated notes increased to one-month LIBOR plus 12%.        FACILITY IN USE FROM NOVEMBER 2005 TO PRESENT. In November 2005, we (through our subsidiary Page Three Funding LLC) entered into a floating rate variable note purchase facility. Up to $200 million of notes may be outstanding under this facility at any time subject to certain collateral tests and other conditions. We use funds derived from this facility to purchase automobile contracts under the CPS programs, which are pledged to secure the notes. The collateral tests and other conditions generally allow us to borrow up to approximately 93.0% of the principal balance of the automobile contracts (up to 83.0% in the form of senior notes and the remainder in the form of subordinated notes). The advance rate is subject to the lender's valuation of the collateral which, in turn, is affected by factors such as the credit performance of our managed portfolio and the terms and conditions of our term securitizations, including the expected yields required for bonds issued in our term securitizations. Senior notes issued under this facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum while the subordinated notes accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 5.50% per annum. The balance of notes outstanding related to this facility at December 31, 2006 was $103.2 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2007, the interest rate on the subordinated notes increased to one-month LIBOR plus 12%.  CAPITAL RESOURCES        Securitization trust debt is repaid from collections on the related receivables, and becomes due in accordance with its terms as the principal amount of the related receivables is reduced. Although the securitization trust debt also has alternative final maturity dates, those dates are significantly later than the dates at which repayment of the related receivables is anticipated, and at no time in our history have any of our sponsored asset-backed securities reached those alternative final maturities.        The acquisition of automobile contracts for subsequent transfer in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the trusts and related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. We plan to adjust our levels of automobile contract purchases so as to match anticipated releases of cash from the trusts and related spread accounts with our capital requirements.                                          40    CAPITALIZATION        Over the period from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2007 we have managed our capitalization by issuing and refinancing debt as summarized in the following table:                                                             YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                                 ------------------------------------------                                                     2007           2006           2005                                                 ------------   ------------   ------------                                                           (Dollars in thousands)        RESIDUAL INTEREST FINANCING: Beginning balance........................       $     31,378   $     43,745   $     22,204      Issuances...........................             85,860         13,667         45,800      Payments............................

In March 2004, one of our wholly-owned bankruptcy remote consolidated subsidiaries issued $44.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by our retained interests in eight term securitization transactions. The notes were repaid in full in August 2005. In November 2005, we completed a similar securitization in which a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote consolidated subsidiary of ours issued $45.8 million of asset-backed notes secured by our retained interests in 10 term securitization transactions. Those notes were repaid in full in May 2007. In December 2006, we entered into a $35 million residual credit facility that is secured by our retained interests in more recent term securitizations. We repaid this facility in full in July 2007 in conjunction with the establishment of a combination term and revolving residual credit facility. Under the combination term and revolving residual credit facility, we have used and intend to use eligible residual interests in securitizations as collateral for floating rate borrowings. The amount that we may borrow is computed using an agreed valuation methodology of the residuals, subject to an overall maximum principal amount of $120 million, represented by (i) a $60 million Class A-1 variable funding note (the "revolving note"), and (ii) a $60 million term note (the "term note"). The term note has been fully drawn and is due in July 2009. As of December 31, 2007, we have drawn $10 million on the revolving note. The advance rate under the revolving note is subject to the lender's valuation of each residual interest pledged as collateral which, in turn, is primarily affected by the credit performance of the underlying residual interests and their related contracts. The facility's revolving feature expires in July 2008.        SECURITIZATION TRUST DEBT. Since the third quarter of 2003, we have for financial accounting purposes, treated securitizations of automobile contracts as secured financings, and the asset-backed securities issued in such securitizations remain on our balance sheet as securitization trust debt.        SENIOR SECURED DEBT. From 1998 to 2005, we entered into a series of financing transactions with Levine Leichtman Capital Partners, II. In July 2007 we repaid the final amounts due under these financing transactions.                                          41          SUBORDINATED DEBT. In April 1997, we issued $20.0 million in subordinated participating equity notes due April 2004, which we retired in the second quarter of 2004. In 1995, we issued $20.0 million of Rising Interest Subordinated Redeemable Securities, or RISRS, due 2006. The RISRS included a sinking fund in their terms, and we repaid in the first quarter of 2006 the $14.0 million that remained outstanding. In May 2003, in connection with the acquisition of TFC, we assumed $6.3 million in principal amount of subordinated debt that TFC had outstanding. We amortized this debt monthly and repaid it in full in June 2005.        SUBORDINATED RENEWABLE NOTES DEBT. In June 2005, we began issuing registered subordinated renewable notes in an ongoing offering to the public. Upon maturity, the notes are automatically renewed for the same term as the maturing notes, unless we elect not to have the notes renewed or unless the investor notifies us within 15 days after the maturity date for his notes that he wants his notes repaid. Renewed notes bear interest at the rate we are offering at that time to other investors with similar aggregate note portfolios. Based on the terms of the individual notes, interest payments may be required monthly, quarterly, annually or upon maturity.        We must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2007. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare default if a default occurred under a different facility.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS        This report on Form 10-K includes certain "forward-looking statements". Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "estimates," or words of like meaning. As to the specifically identified forward-looking statements, factors that could affect charge-offs and recovery rates include changes in the general economic climate, which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of contracts, changes in laws respecting consumer finance, which could affect our ability to enforce rights under contracts, and changes in the market for used vehicles, which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles. Factors that could affect our revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools of contracts, which would affect our ability to purchase contracts, the terms on which we are able to finance such purchases, the willingness of dealers to sell contracts to us on the terms that it offers, and the terms on which we are able to complete term securitizations once contracts are acquired. Factors that could affect our expenses in the current year include competitive conditions in the market for qualified personnel, and interest rates (which affect the rates that we pay on Notes issued in its securitizations). The statements concerning structuring securitization transactions as secured financings and the effects of such structures on financial items and on future profitability also are forward-looking statements. Any change to the structure of our securitization transaction could cause such forward-looking statements not to be accurate. Both the amount of the effect of the change in structure on our profitability and the duration of the period in which our profitability would be affected by the change in securitization structure are estimates. The accuracy of such estimates will be affected by the rate at which we purchase and sell contracts, any changes in that rate, the credit performance of such contracts, the financial terms of future securitizations, any changes in such terms over time, and other factors that generally affect our profitability.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS        In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS No. 157"). SFAS No. 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 157-2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157", to partially defer FASB Statement No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. SFAS 157 is effective for us on January 1, 2008, except for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis for which our effective date is January 1, 2009. We are in the process of evaluating SFAS No. 157 and do not believe it will have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations.                                         42          In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES-INCLUDING AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 115. SFAS 159 permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Most of the provisions of SFAS 159 are elective, however, the amendment to SFAS 115, ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, applies to all entities with available for sale or trading securities. SFAS 159 is elective as of the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing this Statement to determine whether or not we would elect to measure any financial instruments at their fair value.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS        Prior to July 2003, the Company structured its securitization transactions to meet the accounting criteria for sales of finance receivables. In this structure the notes issued by our special purpose subsidiary do not appear as debt on our consolidated balance sheet. See Critical Accounting Policies for a detailed discussion of our securitization structure.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  INTEREST RATE RISK        We are subject to interest rate risk during the period between when contracts are purchased from dealers and when such contracts become part of a term securitization. Specifically, the interest rates on the warehouse facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the contracts are fixed. Historically, our term securitization facilities have had fixed rates of interest. To mitigate some of this risk, we have in the past, and intend to continue to structure our securitization transactions to include pre-funding structures, whereby the amount of Notes issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the Trusts. In pre-funding, the proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until we sell the additional contracts to the Trust in amounts up to the balance of the pre-funded escrow account. In pre-funded securitizations, we lock in the borrowing costs with respect to the contracts we subsequently deliver to the Trust. However, we incur an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the Notes outstanding, the amount as to which there can be no assurance.        The following table provides information on our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments by expected maturity date as of December 31, 2007:                                       2008           2009           2010           2011           2012        THEREAFTER     FAIR VALUE                              ------------   ------------   ------------   ------------   ------------   ------------   ------------                                                                       (In thousands) Assets: Finance receivables(1)...... $    819,401   $    629,958   $    392,109   $    205,507   $     71,890   $      6,889   $   2,125,754 Weighted average fixed   effective interest rate...        18.24%         18.24%         18.23%         18.22%         18.20%         18.57%  LIABILITIES: Warehouse lines of credit...      235,925              -              -              -              -              -         235,925 Weighted average variable   effective interest rate...         7.35% Residual interest   financing.................       10,000         60,000              -              -              -              -          70,000 Weighted average variable   effective interest rate...        10.96% Securitization trust debt...      714,382        530,879        324,500        168,722         57,326          2,493       1,786,263 Weighted average fixed   effective interest rate...         5.62%          5.70%          5.81%          5.94%          6.01%         6.44% Subordinated renewable   notes.....................        8,351          8,098          9,341            950          1,274           119          28,133 Weighted average fixed   effective interest rate...        10.18%         12.13%         14.10%         11.69%         13.91%        10.03%   (1)   BASED ON SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND EXCLUDING SUCH       COMPONENTS AS DEFERRED ORIGINATIONS COSTS AND DEFERRED ACQUISITION FEES.        Much of the information used to determine fair value is highly subjective. When applicable, readily available market information has been utilized. However, for a significant portion of our financial instruments, active markets do not exist. Therefore, considerable judgments were required in estimating fair value for certain items. The subjective factors include, among other things, the estimated timing and amount of cash flows, risk characteristics, credit quality and interest rates, all of which are subject to change. Since the fair value is estimated as of the dates shown in the table, the amounts that will actually be realized or paid at settlement or maturity of the instruments could be significantly different.                                         43    ITEM 8.
