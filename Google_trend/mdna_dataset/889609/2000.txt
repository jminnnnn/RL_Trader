ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS   The following analysis of the financial condition of the Company should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report.  OVERVIEW  Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") primarily engage in the business of purchasing, selling and servicing retail automobile installment sale contracts ("Contracts") originated by automobile dealers ("Dealers") located throughout the United States. In the past, the Company has purchased contracts in as many as 44 different states. At various times in 1999, the Company suspended its solicitation of Contract purchases in as many as 20 states, and as of the date of this report is active in 29 states. There can be no assurance as to resumption of Contract purchasing activities in other states. Through its purchase of Contracts, the Company provides indirect financing to Dealer customers with limited credit histories, low incomes or past credit problems, who generally would not be expected to qualify for financing provided by banks or by automobile manufacturers' captive finance companies.  The Company historically has generated revenue primarily from the gains recognized on the sale or securitization of its Contracts, servicing fees earned on Contracts sold, and interest earned on Residuals (as defined below) and on Contracts held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 1999, and through the date of this report, the Company did not sell any Contracts in securitization transactions, and therefore recognized no gains on sale. All sales of Contracts were on a servicing released basis either in the form of bulk sales of Contracts being held by the Company for sale, or as part of a pass through agreement with a third party for which the Company earned a fee on a per Contract basis. The net loss on sale of Contracts for the year ended December 31, 1999, was $14.8 million compared to net gains of $58.3 million and $35.0 million for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Revenues from interest and servicing fees for the year ended December 31, 1999, were $3.0 million and $27.8 million, respectively. Such revenues for the year ended December 31, 1998, were $41.8 million and $25.2 million, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 1997, such revenues were $23.5 million and $14.5 million, respectively. The Company's income is affected by losses incurred on Contracts, whether such Contracts are held for sale or have been sold in securitizations. The Company's cash requirements have been significant in the past and will continue to be significant should the Company sell loans in securitization transactions in the future. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 1999, was approximately $170,000, compared to net cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, of $71.1 million and $26.1 million, respectively. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources."  The Company has purchased Contracts with the primary intention of reselling them in securitization transactions as asset-backed securities. From late May 1999 to the present, the Company has purchased Contracts on a flow basis for third parties; that is, the Company purchases a Contract from a Dealer, and sells the Contract the next day to the third party for the same price the Company paid. The Company also receives from the third party a fee for its services. The Company retains no interest in such Contracts, and neither services such Contracts nor earns a servicing fee.  Although the Company has not been able to sell Contracts in a securitization transaction since December 1998, it does plan to securitize in the future, as to which there can be no assurance. The Company's securitization structure has been as follows:  First, the Company sells a portfolio of Contracts to a wholly owned subsidiary ("SPS"), which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the Company's Contracts. The SPS then transfers the same Contracts to either a grantor trust or an owner trust (the "Trust"). The Trust in turn issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities (the "Certificates"), generally in a principal amount equal to the aggregate                                           16    17  principal balance of the Contracts. The Company typically sells these Contracts to the Trust at face value and without recourse, except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the Dealer to the Company are provided by the Company to the Trust. One or more investors purchase the Certificates issued by the Trust; the proceeds from the sale of the Certificates are then used to purchase the Contracts from the Company. The Company purchases a financial guaranty insurance policy, guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest on the senior Certificates, from an insurance company (the "Certificate Insurer"). In addition, the Company provides a credit enhancement for the benefit of the Certificate Insurer and the investors in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account ("Spread Account") held by the Trust. The agreements governing the securitization transactions (collectively referred to as the "Servicing Agreements") require that the initial deposits to the Spread Accounts be supplemented by a portion of collections from the Contracts until the Spread Accounts reach specified levels, and then maintained at those levels. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related Certificates. The specified levels at which the Spread Accounts are to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of Contracts held by the Trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among the Company, the SPS, the Certificate Insurer and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the portfolios, and have also been varied by agreement. The specified levels applicable to the Company's sold pools increased materially in 1998. Effective November 3, 1999, as applied to monthly measurement dates from September 1999 onward, the specified levels have decreased, as is discussed under the heading "Liquidity and Capital Resources."  At the closing of each securitization, the Company removes from its consolidated balance sheet the Contracts held for sale and adds to its consolidated balance sheet (i) the cash received and (ii) the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that the Company retains in the Contracts sold in the securitization. That retained interest (the "Residual") consists of (a) the cash held in the Spread Account and (b) the net interest receivables ("NIRs"). NIRs represent the estimated discounted cash flows to be received by the Trust in the future, net of principal and interest payable with respect to the Certificates, and certain expenses. The excess of the cash received and the assets retained by the Company over the carrying value of the Contracts sold, less transaction costs, equals the net gain on sale of Contracts recorded by the Company.  The Company allocates its basis in the Contracts between the Certificates and the Residuals retained based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of the sale. The Company recognizes gains or losses attributable to the change in the fair value of the Residuals, which are recorded at estimated fair value and accounted for as "held-for-trading" securities. The Company is not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of interests such as the Residuals; accordingly, the Company determines the estimated fair value of the Residuals by discounting the amount and timing of anticipated cash flows released from the Spread Account (the cash out method), using a discount rate that the Company believes is appropriate for the risks involved. For that valuation, the Company has used an effective discount rate of approximately 14% per annum.  The Company receives periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the Contracts. In addition, the Company is entitled to the cash flows from the Residuals that represent collections on the Contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the Certificates, the base servicing fees, and certain other fees (such as trustee and custodial fees). At the end of each collection period, the aggregate cash collections from the Contracts are allocated first to the base servicing fees and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees for the period, then to the Certificateholders for interest at the pass-through rate on the Certificates plus principal as defined in the Servicing Agreements. If the amount of cash required for the above allocations exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is drawn from the Spread Account. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations, and there is no shortfall in the related Spread Account, the excess is released to the Company, or in certain cases is transferred to other Spread Accounts that may be below their specified levels. Pursuant to certain Servicing Agreements, excess cash collected during the period is used to make accelerated principal paydowns on certain Certificates to                                          17    18  create over-collateralization, that is, to reduce the aggregate principal balance of outstanding Certificates below the aggregate principal amount of the related automotive receivables. If the Spread Account balance is not at the required credit enhancement level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the Spread Account until the specified level is achieved. The cash in the Spread Accounts is restricted from use by the Company. Cash held in the various Spread Accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the Servicing Agreements. Spread Account balances are held by the Trusts on behalf of the Company as the owner of the Residuals.  The annual percentage rate payable on the Contracts is significantly greater than the rates payable on the Certificates. Accordingly, the Residuals described above are a significant asset of the Company. In determining the value of the Residuals described above, the Company must estimate the future rates of prepayments, delinquencies, defaults and default loss severity, as they affect the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows. The Company estimates prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable Contracts. The Company has used a constant prepayment estimate of approximately 4% per annum. The Company estimates defaults and default loss severity using available historical loss data for comparable Contracts and the specific characteristics of the Contracts purchased by the Company. In valuing the Residuals, the Company estimates that losses as a percentage of the original principal balance will range from 14% to 16.5% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts.  In future periods, the Company could recognize additional revenue from the Residuals if the actual performance of the Contracts were to be better than originally estimated, or the Company could increase the estimated fair value of the Residuals. If the actual performance of the Contracts were to be worse than the original estimate, then a downward adjustment to the carrying value of the Residuals would be required. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the future performance of the underlying Contracts, the Company has established a provision for future losses on the Residuals.  From March 1999 to the present, the Company has been unable to complete a securitization transaction, due to unavailability of sufficient capital. The above description is included because the Residuals created in past securitizations continue to represent the Company's largest asset, and because the Company plans again to purchase Contracts for sale in securitization transactions, when necessary pre-conditions (including availability of capital) are fulfilled.  During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company has changed its basic system of doing business. Previously, the Company would acquire Contracts for its own account, borrowing from 88% to 97% of the principal balance of such Contracts under "warehouse" lines of credit. Periodically (approximately once every quarter) the Company would then sell most or all of the recently acquired Contracts in a securitization transaction as described above. In such a sale, the Company would retain (1) a residual ownership interest in the Contracts sold, (2) the obligation to service the Contracts sold, and (3) the right to receive servicing fees. At the end of March 1999, the Company learned that it would be unable to sell Contracts in securitization transactions for an indeterminate period. Accordingly, the Company commenced purchasing Contracts for immediate re-sale to a third party, which third party purchases the Contracts in turn on a daily basis. In this arrangement, the Company retains no residual interest in the Contracts, has no servicing obligation, and receives no servicing fee. For its services in acquiring Contracts for purchase, the Company receives a per-Contract fee from the third party.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998  Revenue. During the year ended December 31, 1999, revenue decreased $111.5 million, or 88.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 1998. Gain on sale of Contracts, net, decreased by $73.2 million, or 125.5%, from a $58.3 million gain on sale for the year ended December 31, 1998, to a $14.8 million loss for the year ended December 31, 1999. The change in gain on sale from positive to negative is due to the Company selling Contracts only on a servicing released basis and thus not recording any                                          18    19  NIR gains during the year, as well as to selling Contracts at a loss. During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company sold $318.0 million of Contracts on a servicing released basis, that is, with no residual interest retained, with no servicing obligation, and with no right to receive a servicing fee. Those sales resulted in a net loss of approximately $15.2 million. Expenses of approximately $1.1 million were incurred related to previous securitization transactions, including the amortization of a warrant issued to the Certificate Insurer in November 1998. In addition, the Company sold $241.2 million of Contracts on a flow through basis and received $6.2 million of fees which have been included as a component of gain on sale of Contracts, net. For the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, $5.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively, of provision for losses on Contracts held for sale was charged against gain on sale. The increase in the provision for losses on Contracts held for sale is primarily due to the Company's inability to securitize Contracts during 1999. As a result, Contracts were held for sale for longer periods of time prior to being sold on a servicing released basis, thus requiring additional loss reserves.  Interest income decreased by $38.8 million, or 92.8%, representing 20.5% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999. The decrease is primarily due to decreases in Contracts held for sale and NIRs during 1999. Beginning in May 1999, the Company began to purchase Contracts on a flow through basis and thus did not hold any additional Contracts for sale since that time. Additionally, the Company completed the final sale of Contracts on a servicing released basis, other than those sold on a flow through basis, on September 1, 1999, leaving approximately $4.6 million of Contracts held for sale at the end of September and decreasing to $2.4 million by year end. Such a reduction in Contract purchases is expected to cause a reduction in revenues (both interest and gain on sale) in future periods.  Servicing fees increased by $2.6 million, or 10.4%, and represented 187.5% of total revenue. Servicing fees are composed of base fees, which are payable at the rate of 2% per annum on the principal balance of the outstanding Contracts in the related trusts, plus any other fees collected by the Company, such as late fees and returned check fees. The increase in servicing fees is primarily due to an increase in the fees other than base fees collected during 1999 During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company collected $4.9 million of other servicing fees, an increase of 39.7% over other servicing fees collected in the prior year.  Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 1999, operating expenses increased $5.0 million, or 6.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 1998. Employee costs increased by $1.0 million, or 3.5%, and represented 34.3% of total operating expenses. The increase is due to increases in salaries and wage rates. General and administrative expenses decreased by $1.0 million, or 4.9% and represented 22.5% of total operating expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the decrease in costs associated with purchasing loans such as credit reports. During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company purchased $424.7 million of Contracts compared to $1,076.5 million of Contracts purchased in the prior year.  Interest expense increased $5.4 million, or 24.5%, and represented 31.5% of total operating expenses. The increase is due in part to the interest paid on $25.0 million in subordinated debt securities issued by the Company in November 1998, and $6.5 million of additional subordinated debt securities issued during the year ended December 31, 1999. In addition, the interest rate on the $25.0 million of subordinated debt issued in November 1998, was increased from 13.5% in 1998 to 14.5% in April of 1999. Interest expense was also affected by the volume of Contracts held for sale as well as by the Company's cost of borrowed funds. (See "Liquidity and Captial Resources").  Marketing expenses decreased by $1.5 million or 21.3%, and represented 6.2% of total expenses. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in Contracts purchased during the year ended December 31, 1999. Fees paid to marketing representatives for their role in the submission of Contracts ultimately purchased by the Company are included as a component in gain on sale of Contracts, net.  Occupancy expenses increased by $526,000 or 23.2%, and represented 3.2% of total expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $340,000 or 27.1%, and represented 1.8% of total                                           19    20  expenses. In November 1998, the Company moved its headquarters to a new 115,000 square foot facility. The Company has agreed to lease the new headquarters facility for a ten-year term, with base rent of $1.9 million for the first five years, and $2.1 million for years six through ten. In addition to base rent, the Company has agreed to pay property taxes, maintenance, and other expenses of the property.  The results for the years ended December 31, 1999, and 1998, include a net operating loss of approximately $150,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, from the Company's subsidiary Samco. For the year ended December 31, 1997, Samco had net earnings of $1.2 million. During the first quarter of 1999, Samco ceased its operations.  The results for the year ended December 31, 1999, include a net operating loss of $830,380 from the Company's subsidiary LINC. For the years ended December 31, 1998, and 1997, LINC had net operating losses of $565,333, and $533,222, respectively. During the second quarter of 1999, LINC ceased its operations.  The results for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, include net earnings of $35,131 and $298,000, respectively, from the Company's subsidiary CPS Leasing, Inc. For the year ended December 31, 1997, CPS Leasing had a net operating loss of $88,000. The Company intends to sell CPS Leasing, Inc., during 2000.  The results for the year ended December 31, 1999, include a net operating loss of $2.5 million from the Company's investment in 38% of NAB Asset Corp. The results for the years the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, include $52,000 and $849,000, respectively, in net earnings from the Company's investment in NAB Asset Corp.  The Company's effective tax rate was 38.3% and 42.0%, for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997  Revenue. During the year ended December 31, 1998, revenue increased $51.0 million, or 67.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 1997. Gain on sale of Contracts, net, increased by $23.3 million, or 66.4%, and represented 46.2% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase in gain on sale is largely due to the volume of Contracts that were sold in the period. During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company sold $948.3 million in Contracts, compared to $573.3 million in the year ended December 31, 1997. For the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, $3.5 million and $4.1 million, respectively, of provision for losses on contracts held for sale was charged against gain on sale. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the future performance of the underlying Contracts, the Company during 1998 established a provision for losses on the Residuals in the amount of $7.8 million that was charged against gain on sale.  Interest income increased by $18.3 million, or 77.9%, representing 33.1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase is due to the increase in the volume of contracts purchased and held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company purchased $1,076.5 million in Contracts from Dealers, compared to $632.1 million in the year ended December 31, 1997. The Company expects that Contract purchases in the near future will not exceed $200.0 million per quarter. Such a reduction in Contract purchases is expected to cause a reduction in revenues (both interest and gain on sale) in future periods.  Servicing fees increased by $10.7 million, or 73.6%, and represented 19.9% of total revenue. The increase in servicing fees is due to the increase in Contract purchase, sale and servicing activities. As of December 31, 1998, the Company was earning servicing fees on 128,025 Contracts approximating $1,362.8 million, compared to 77,731 Contracts approximating $830.9 million as of December 31, 1997. In addition to the $1,362.8 million in sold Contracts on which servicing fees were earned, the Company was holding for sale and servicing an additional $176.1 million in Contracts for an aggregate servicing                                           20    21  portfolio of $1,538.9 million. Amortization of NIRs increased by $22.2 million and represented 104.9% of residual interest income for the year ended December 31, 1998, versus 59.0% for year ended December 31, 1997. The increase is due to higher losses on the servicing portfolio and the increase in the NIRs from 1997 to 1998.  Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 1998, operating expenses increased $38.7 million, or 89.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 1997. Employee costs increased by $12.9 million, or 81.5%, and represented 35.2% of total operating expenses. The increase is due to the addition of staff necessary to accommodate the Company's growth and certain increases in salaries of existing staff. General and administrative expenses increased by $6.5 million, or 45.7% and represented 25.2% of total operating expenses. Increases in general and administrative expenses included increases in telecommunications, stationary, credit reports and other related items as a result of increases in the volume of purchasing and servicing of Contracts.  Interest expense increased $12.8 million, or 139.7%, and represented 26.9% of total operating expenses. The increase is due in part to the interest paid on an additional $30.0 million in subordinated debt securities issued by the Company during 1998 as well as interest paid on the outstanding balance on a revolving line of credit (the "Residual Line"). Interest expense was also affected by the volume of Contracts held for sale as well as by the Company's cost of borrowed funds. (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources").  Marketing expenses increased by $5.0 million or 272.7%, and represented 8.4% of total expenses. The increase is primarily due to the increase in printing, travel, promotion and convention expenses. Fees paid to marketing representatives for their role in the submission of Contracts ultimately purchased by the Company are included as a component in gain on sale of Contracts, net.  Occupancy expenses increased by $863,000 or 61.5%, and represented 2.8% of total expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $498,000 or 65.8%, and represented 1.5% of total expenses. In November 1998, the Company moved its headquarters to a new 115,000 square foot facility. The Company has agreed to lease the new headquarters facility for a ten-year term, with base rent of $1.9 million for the first five years, and $2.1 million for years six through ten. In addition to base rent, the Company has agreed to pay property taxes, maintenance, and other expenses of the property. Occupancy of the new building can be expected to increase the Company's overall occupancy expenses in the future beginning with commencement of the lease. The Company has subleased its former headquarters location.  The results for the year ended December 31, 1998, include a net operating loss of $1.1 million from the Company's subsidiary Samco. For the year ended December 31, 1997, Samco had net earnings of $1.2 million.  The results for the years ended December 31, 1998, and 1997 include net operating losses of $565,333, and $533,222, respectively from the Company's subsidiary LINC.  The results for the year ended December 31, 1998, include net earnings of $298,000 from the Company's subsidiary CPS Leasing, Inc. For the year ended December 31, 1997, CPS Leasing, Inc., had a net operating loss of $88,000.  The results for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, include $52,000 and $849,000, respectively, in net earnings from the Company's investment in 38% of NAB Asset Corp.  The Company's effective tax rate was 42.0% for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997.                                           21    22   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  LIQUIDITY  The Company's business requires substantial cash to support its operating activities. The Company's primary sources of cash from operating activities have been proceeds from the sales of Contracts, amounts borrowed under its various warehouse lines, servicing fees on portfolios of Contracts previously sold, proceeds from the sales of Contracts, customer payments of principal and interest on Contracts held for sale, fees for origination of Contracts, and releases of cash from Spread Accounts. The Company's primary uses of cash have been the purchases of Contracts, repayment of amounts borrowed under its warehouse lines and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest, and occupancy expenses, the establishment of and further contributions to Spread Accounts, and income taxes. As a result, the Company has been dependent on its warehouse lines of credit to purchase Contracts, and on the availability of capital from outside sources in order to finance its continued operations, and to fund the portion of Contract purchase prices not borrowed under warehouse lines of credit. The Company is not presently party to any warehouse line of credit, and did not receive any material releases of cash from Spread Accounts from June 1998 through October 1999. The inability to borrow and the lack of cash releases resulted in a liquidity deficiency, which has been progressively alleviated since the recommencement of releases of cash from Spread Accounts began in November 1999.  The Company has maintained its Contract purchasing program in the absence of any warehouse line of credit by entering into flow purchase arrangements. Flow purchases allow the Company to purchase Contracts while maintaining only an immaterial level of Contracts held for sale. The Company's revenues from flow purchase of Contracts, however, are materially less than may be received by holding Contracts to maturity or by selling Contracts in securitization transactions.  Net cash provided by operating activities was $170,000 during the year ended December 31, 1999, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $71.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Net cash released from trusts was $9.7 million, compared to net cash deposited into Trusts of $83.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998.  During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company did not complete a securitization transaction, and therefore, did not use any cash for initial deposits to Spread Accounts, compared to $45.6 million used during the year ended December 31, 1998. Cash used for subsequent deposits to Spread Accounts for the year ended December 31, 1999, was $18.4 million, a decrease of $35.7 million, or 66.1%, from cash used for subsequent deposits to Spread Accounts in the year ended December 31, 1998. Cash released from Spread Accounts for the year ended December 31, 1999, was $28.0 million, an increase of $11.9 million, or 73.9%, from cash released from Spread Accounts in the year ended December 31, 1998. Changes in deposits to and releases from Spread Accounts are affected by the relative size, seasoning and performance of the various pools of sold Contracts that make up the Company's Servicing Portfolio.  Beginning in June 1998, the Company's liquidity was adversely affected by the absence of releases from Spread Accounts. Such releases did not occur because a number of the Trusts had incurred cumulative net losses as a percentage of the original Contract balance or average delinquency ratios in excess of the predetermined levels specified in the respective Servicing Agreements. Accordingly, pursuant to the Servicing Agreements, the specified levels applicable to the Company's Spread Accounts were increased, in most cases to an unlimited amount. Due to cross collateralization provisions of the Servicing Agreements, the specified levels have been increased on 16 of the Company's 18 remaining Trusts. Until the November 1999 effectiveness of an amendment to the Servicing Agreement, described below, no material releases from any of the Spread Accounts were available to the Company. Upon effectiveness of that amendment, the requisite Spread Account levels in general have been set at 21% of the outstanding principal balance of the Certificates issued by the related Trusts, with higher percentages applicable to those Trusts that have amortized to the point that "floor" or minimum levels of credit enhancement are applicable.                                           22    23  In addition to requiring higher Spread Account levels, the Servicing Agreements provide the Certificate Insurer with certain other rights and remedies, some of which have been waived on a monthly basis by the Certificate Insurer with respect to all of the Trusts. Increased specified levels for the Spread Accounts have been in effect from time to time in the past. As a result of the increased Spread Account specified levels and cross collateralization provisions, excess cash flows that would otherwise have been released to the Company instead were retained in the Spread Accounts to bring the balance of those Spread Accounts up to higher levels. As a result of the increased specified levels applicable to the Spread Accounts, approximately $39.1 million of cash that would otherwise have been available to the Company had been delayed and retained in the Spread Accounts as of December 31, 1999. A portion of such cash was subsequently released to the Company, as discussed below.                                          23    24  Since late May 1999, the Company has purchased Contracts from Dealers without use of warehouse lines of credit, in "flow purchase" arrangements with third parties. Under the flow purchase arrangements, the Company purchases Contracts from Dealers and sells such Contracts outright to the third party.  Purchase of Contracts on a flow basis, as compared with purchase of Contracts for the Company's own account, has materially reduced the Company's cash requirements. The Company's plan for meeting its liquidity needs is (1) to increase the quantity of Contracts that it purchases and sells on a flow basis, thus increasing the fees that it receives in connection with such purchases and sales, and (2) to continue to receive releases of cash from its Spread Accounts, pursuant to the Amendment, which became effective on November 3, 1999. There can be no assurance that this plan will be successful.  During the second and third quarters of 1999, the Company sold, on a servicing released basis, $318.0 million of its Contracts held for sale. The remaining Contracts held for sale represent Contracts that did not meet the criteria for the various sales occurring in the second and third quarters. The Company's ability to increase the quantity of Contracts that it purchases and sells on a flow basis will be subject to general competitive conditions and other factors. Although the Company has continued to increase the amount of Contracts purchased and sold on a flow basis, there can be no assurance that the current level of flow production can be maintained or increased.  Obtaining releases of cash from the Spread Accounts is dependent on collections from the related Trusts generating sufficient cash in excess of the amended specified levels. There can be no assurance that collections from the related Trusts will generate cash in excess of the amended specified levels.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  The acquisition of Contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions, and the need to fund Spread Accounts when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the Company's Contract purchases (other than flow purchases), the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the Spread Accounts either release cash to the Company or capture cash from collections on sold Contracts.  In the past, the Company funded the increase in its servicing portfolio through off balance sheet securitization transactions, as discussed above, and funded its other capital needs with cash from operations and with the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and/or equity. During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company did not complete a securitization transaction, issued $5.0 million of subordinated debt, sold $318.0 million of Contracts on a servicing released basis, and received $1.5 million in loans from affiliated parties.                                           24    25  The table below documents the Company's history of Contract securitizations, comprising sales to 25 securitization trusts.

             ==========   (1)     Commencing with the securitization completed on June 28, 1994, the         principal and interest due on the asset-backed securities issued by the         various trusts have been guaranteed by Financial Security Assurance Inc.         ("FSA"), enabling the issuer to obtain Aaa/AAA or P-1/A-1+ ratings for         the asset-backed securities issued in such transactions. See "Business         -- Purchase and Sale of Contracts -- Securitization and Sale of         Contracts to Institutional Investors."                                           25    26  (2)     Commencing with the securitization completed on June 27, 1996,         asset-backed securities with Aaa/AAA or P-1/A-1+ ratings have been sold         through public offerings pursuant to registration statements filed with         the Securities and Exchange Commission.  (3)     These Trusts are structured as "owner trusts" rather than as "grantor         trusts".  (4)     Commencing with the securitization completed on July 28, 1998, the         Company began using a structure that included a guaranteed money market         tranche of asset-backed securities, rated P-1/A-1+.  As noted above, the absence of any significant releases of cash from Spread Accounts since June 1998 had materially impaired the Company's ability to meet such capital requirements. To reduce its capital requirements and to meet those requirements, the Company in November 1998 began to implement a three-part plan: the plan includes (i) issuance of debt and equity securities, (ii) agreements with the Certificate Insurer to reduce the level of initial Spread Account deposits, and to reduce the maximum levels of the Spread Accounts, and (iii) a reduction in the rate of Contract purchases.  As the first step in the plan, the Company in November 1998 and April 1999 issued $25.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, of subordinated promissory notes (collectively, the "LLCP Notes"), to Levine Leichtman Capital Partners, L.P. ("LLCP"). The LLCP Notes are due in 2004, and bear interest at the rate of 14.5% per annum. Net proceeds received from the issuances were approximately $28.5 million. In conjunction with the LLCP Notes, the Company issued warrants to purchase up to 4,450,000 shares of common stock at $0.01 per share, 3,115,000 and 1,334,000 of which were exercised in April 1999 and May 1999, respectively. The effective cost of this new capital represents a material increase in the cost of capital to the Company. As part of the agreements for issuance of the LLCP Notes, Stanwich Financial Services Corp. ("SFSC") agreed to purchase an additional $15.0 million of notes (at least $7.5 million by July 31, 1999, and the remainder by August 31, 1999), and the Company agreed to sell such notes. The chairman and the president of the Company are the principal shareholders of SFSC, and the Company's chairman is the chief executive officer of SFSC. The terms of these transactions were subsequently modified, in March 2000, as discussed below.  Also in November 1998, as the second step in its plan, the Company reached an agreement with the Certificate Insurer regarding initial cash deposits. In this agreement, the Certificate Insurer committed to insure asset-backed securities issued by the Trusts with respect to at least $560.0 million of Contracts, while requiring an initial cash deposit of 3% of principal. Of the $560.0 million committed, $310.0 million was used in the Company's December 1998 securitization transaction. The Company's agreement with the Certificate Insurer also required that the Company issue to the Certificate Insurer or its designee warrants to purchase 2,525,114 shares of the Company's common stock at $3.00 per share, exercisable through the fifth anniversary of the warrants' issuance. The exercise price of the warrants is subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments.  The amendment agreement mentioned above (the "Amendment") fixes the amount of cash to be retained in the Spread Accounts for 16 of the Company's 18 remaining securitization Trusts. The amended level is 21% of the outstanding principal balance of the Certificates issued by such Trusts, computed on a pool by pool basis. The 21% level is subject to adjustment to reflect over collateralization. Older Trusts may require more than 21% if the Certificate balance has amortized to such a level that "floor" or minimum levels of credit enhancement are applicable.  In the event of certain defaults by the Company, the specified level applicable to such Spread Accounts could increase to an unlimited amount, but such defaults are narrowly defined, and the Company does not anticipate suffering such defaults. The Amendment by its terms is applicable from September 1999 onward, and on November 3, 1999, the necessary signatures and conditions were satisfied to make the Amendment effective. The Company on November 4, 1999, received its first material release of cash from the securitized portfolio pursuant to the terms of the Amendment. The releases of cash are expected to continue and to vary in amount from month to month. There can be no assurance that such releases of cash will continue in the future.  As a third part of its plan, the Company reduced its planned level of Contract purchases initially to not more than $200.0 million per quarter beginning November 1998. In the first quarter of 1999, the Company purchased $158.2 million of Contracts. During the second quarter of 1999, the Company purchased $59.3 million of Contracts, of which $34.0 million was on a flow basis, as discussed below. During the third quarter of 1999, the Company purchased $89.6 million of Contracts, all of which was on a flow basis. During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company purchased $117.6 million of Contracts, all of which was on a flow basis. The Company expects to purchase Contracts only on a flow basis in the future until the Company is able to identify appropriate sources of capital to acquire and hold Contracts for the Company's own account. The reduction in the amount of Contracts purchased for the Company's own account has materially reduced the Company's capital requirements.  Over the three-year period ended December 31, 1999, the Company has increased its capitalization by issuing $33.0 million of senior debt, an aggregate of $65.0 million of subordinated debt (which is convertible into, or was issued with warrants to purchase, common stock), $21.5 million of related party debt ($15.0 million of which is partially convertible and $5.0 million which is entirely convertible) and $5.0 million of capital stock. The following review of the terms of such issuances shows that the cost of such capital increased materially beginning in 1998:  In April 1997 the Company issued, in a public offering, $20.0 million of subordinated partially convertible notes due 2004, which bear an interest rate of 10.50% per annum. These notes are convertible as to 25% of their principal amount into common stock of CPS at $10.15 per share. In June 1997 the                                          26    27  Company issued to a related party $15.0 million of partially convertible notes due 2004. These notes are convertible as to 20% of their principal amount into common stock of CPS at $11.25 per share. In April 1998, the Company entered into the Senior Secured Line, described above. CPS borrowed $5.0 million from related parties in August and September 1998, the terms of which were renegotiated in November 1998, in connection with the issuance of $25.0 million of subordinated notes to LLCP. The $25.0 million of subordinated notes issued in November 1998 carried interest at 13.50% per annum, are due November 2003, and were issued together with warrants that would have allowed the investor to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,450,000 shares of the Company's common stock at $3.00 per share. As renegotiated in November 1998, the $5.0 million of related party loans are subordinated both to the Company's general and secured creditors and also to the LLCP Notes, bear interest at 12.50% per annum, are due June 2004, and are convertible into an aggregate of 1,666,667 shares of the Company's common stock at $3.00 per share. A related party also purchased $5.0 million of Company's common stock in July 1998, at $11.275 per share.  The cost of capital increased further in 1999. To meet a portion of its capital requirements, the Company on April 15, 1999, issued an additional $5.0 million in subordinated notes to LLCP (the "New LLCP Notes"). The New LLCP Notes bear interest at 14.5% per annum and include new warrants to purchase 1,335,000 shares of the Company's common stock at $0.01 per share. As part of the agreement to issue the New LLCP Notes, the Company was required to restructure the terms of the $25.0 million subordinated promissory notes discussed above. Such restructuring included an increase in the interest rate from 13.5% to 14.5%, a reduction in the number of warrants issued to purchase the Company's common stock from 3,450,000 to 3,115,000, a waiver by LLCP of certain defaults under the notes sold to LLCP in November 1998, and a reduction in the exercise price of the warrants from $3.00 per share to $0.01 per share. Among the agreements entered into in connection with the issuance of the New LLCP Notes are agreements by Stanwich Financial Services Corp. ("SFSC"), an affiliate of the chairman of the Company's board of directors, to purchase an additional $15.0 million of notes and of the Company to sell such notes. Additionally, the New LLCP Notes have been personally guaranteed by the chairman of the Company's board of directors and the president of the Company.  During 1999, the Company defaulted on certain lending agreements, as a result of which, the related lenders required the balances to be paid in full. Such agreements are discussed below:  In November 1998, the Company entered into a warehouse line of credit agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation (the "GECC Line"). The GECC Line provided for warehouse facility advances up to a maximum of $100 million at a variable interest rate of LIBOR + 3.75%. The GECC Line by its terms was to expire November 30, 1999. During 1999, the Company defaulted on the GECC Line agreements and was required to repay all balances owed. During August 1999, all amounts owed under the GECC Line were repaid and the agreement was terminated.  In November 1997, the Company entered into a warehouse line of credit agreement with First Union Capital Markets ("First Union Line"). The First Union Line provided for a maximum of $150.0 million of advances to the Company, with interest at a variable rate indexed to prevailing commercial paper rates. In July 1998, the advance amount was increased to $200.0 million. In conjunction with the increase in maximum advance amount under the agreement, the expiration date was changed to July 31, 1999, renewable for one year with the mutual consent of the Company and First Union Capital Markets. During 1999, the Company defaulted on the First Union Line agreement and was required to repay the balance outstanding in its entirety. In June 1999, the balance of the First Union Line was repaid in its entirety and the related agreement was terminated.  In December 1996, the Company entered into an overdraft financing facility, with a bank, that provided for maximum borrowings of $2.0 million. Interest was charged on the outstanding balance at the bank's reference rate plus 1.75%. During 1997, the overdraft facility was increased to $4.0 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 1998. During 1999, the Company defaulted under the overdraft facility and was required to repay the outstanding balance in its entirety. In November 1999, the remaining balance outstanding under the overdraft facility was repaid in its entirety and the related agreement was terminated.  In April 1998, the Company established a $33.3 million line of credit (the "Senior Secured Line") with State Street Bank and Trust Company, Prudential Insurance and an affiliate of Prudential. Borrowings under the Senior Secured Line accrued interest at LIBOR + 4.0%, and were secured by all of the Company's assets, including its residual interest in securitizations. The lenders under the Senior Secured Line declared a default in August 1999, and in November 1999 reached an agreement with the Company under which such lenders agreed to refrain from exercising their remedies occasioned by such default, and under which the Company and such lenders agreed to a repayment schedule with respect to all indebtedness under the senior secured loan. As part of the agreement to restructure the repayment schedule of the senior secured loan, the interest rate was increased from LIBOR + 4% to LIBOR + 5%. In March 2000, the Company repaid all amounts owed under the Residual Line.  As of December 31, 1999, the Company's subordinated debt exceeded its consolidated net worth, which excess was an event of default under the indentures governing the RISRS and PENs. The event of default was cured on March 15, 2000, by the issuance of senior secured debt in exchange for outstanding subordinated debt.  In August and September 1999, the Company issued to SFSC $1.5 million of related party subordinated debt bearing interest at 14.5% per annum, representing a portion of the commitment of SFSC to purchase subordinated notes. As part of that agreement, the Company also agreed to issue SFSC warrants to purchase up to 207,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $0.01 per share. Such warrants have been neither issued nor exercised. The Company's agreement to issue such warrants was modified in the March 2000 debt restructuring described below.  In March 2000, the Company issued $16.0 million of new senior secured debt to LLCP, and used the proceeds to repay in full all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Line. The new indebtedness bears interest at 12.5% per annum, and matures in June 2001. The interest rate and maturity of the previously outstanding $30.0 million of indebtedness to LLCP are unchanged, at 14.5% and November 2003, respectively. As additional terms of the restructuring agreement, all prior defaults under the Company's existing agreements with LLCP were waived or cured, all of the Company's indebtedness to LLCP became senior secured debt (rather than subordinated debt), LLCP received 103,500 shares of Company common stock, and the Company agreed with SFSC to reduce by 50% the 207,000 warrants that had been contemplated in connection with SFSC's August and September 1999 investments in the Company.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  The descriptions of the Company's business and activities set forth in this report and in other past and future reports and announcements by the Company may contain forward-looking statements and assumptions regarding the future activities and results of operations of the Company. Actual results may be adversely affected by various factors including the following: increases in unemployment or other changes in domestic economic conditions which adversely affect the sales of new and used automobiles and may result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures and losses on Contracts; adverse economic conditions in geographic areas in which the Company's business is concentrated; changes in interest rates, adverse changes in the market for securitized receivables pools, or a substantial lengthening of the Company's warehousing period, each of which could restrict the Company's ability to obtain cash for new Contract originations and purchases; increases in the amounts required to be set aside in Spread Accounts or to be expended for other forms of credit enhancement to support future securitizations; the unavailability of warehouse lines of credit which the Company plans to use to accumulate Contracts for                                          27    28  securitization transactions; increased competition from other automobile finance sources; reduction in the number and amount of acceptable Contracts submitted to the Company by its automobile Dealer network; changes in government regulations affecting consumer credit; and other economic, financial and regulatory factors beyond the Company's control. A further discussion of factors that may cause actual results to differ, or may otherwise have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations, is contained in the exhibit to this report titled "cautionary statement," incorporated herein by this reference.    NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  The Company will adopt in future periods new accounting pronouncements. For information on how adoption has affected and will affect the Financial Statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  YEAR 2000  The Company did not experience any significant problems associated with the Year 2000. All major applications have continued to function properly with minimal adjustments being made overall.    ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  INTEREST RATE RISK  The Company's funding strategy is largely dependent upon issuing interest bearing asset-backed securities and incurring debt. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates affect the Company's profitability. The Company uses several strategies to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations, including offering only fixed rate contracts to obligors, regular sales of auto Contracts to the Trusts, and pre-funding securitizations, whereby the amount of asset-backed securities issued in a securitization exceeds the amount of Contracts initially sold to the Trusts. The proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until the Company sells the additional Contracts to the Trust in amounts up to the balance of the pre-funded escrow account. In pre-funded securitizations, the Company locks in the borrowing costs with respect to the loans it subsequently delivers to the Trust. However, the Company incurs an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of Contracts and the interest rate paid on the asset-backed securities outstanding.                                          28    29  ITEM 8.
