Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysisof Financial Condition and Results of Operations     The following discussion andanalysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included orincorporated by reference herein.     Overview     We are a specialty financecompany. Our business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and,to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passengervans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit historiesor past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitatingsales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unionsand the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contractsdirectly from dealers, we also originate vehicle purchase money loans by lending directly to consumers and have (i) acquired installmentpurchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions, and (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loansfrom non-affiliated lenders. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as "automobile contracts."     We were incorporated and beganour operations in March 1991. From inception through December 31, 2021, we have originated a total of approximately $18.1 billion of automobilecontracts, primarily by purchasing retail installment sales contracts from dealers, and to a lesser degree, by originating loans securedby automobiles directly with consumers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergersand acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2011. Contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels for the five years ended December31, 2021 are shown in the table below. Managed portfolio comprises both contracts we owned and those we were servicing for third parties.       Contract Purchases and Outstanding Managed Portfolio        $ in    thousands   Year    Contracts Purchased in Period    Managed Portfolio at Period End   2017    $ 859,069      $ 2,333,530     2018      902,416        2,380,847     2019      1,002,782        2,416,042     2020      742,584        2,174,972     2021      1,146,321        2,249,069        Our principal executive offices are in Las Vegas,Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting functions are performedprimarily in our California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobilecontracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida and Illinois branches.     Coronavirus Pandemic     In December 2019, a new strainof coronavirus (the “COVID-19 virus”) originated in Wuhan, China. Since its discovery, the COVID-19 virus has spread throughoutthe world, and the outbreak has been declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We refer from time to time in this reportto the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 virus as “the pandemic.” In March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic we compliedwith government mandated shutdown orders in the five locations we operate by arranging for many of our staff to work from home and invokingvarious safety protocols for workers who remained in our offices. In April 2020, we laid off approximately 100 workers, or about 10% ofour workforce, throughout our offices because of significant reductions in new contract originations. As of December 31, 2021, most ofour staff were working without a significant impact from the pandemic.               34           The pandemic itself, if sufficient numbers ofpeople were to be afflicted, could cause obligors under our automobile contracts to be unable to pay their contractual obligations. Asthe future course of the COVID-19 pandemic is as yet unknown, its direct effect on future obligor payments is likewise uncertain.     The mandatory shutdown oflarge portions of the United States economy pursuant to emergency restrictions has impaired and will impair the ability of obligors underour automobile contracts to pay their contractual obligations. The extent to which that ability will be impaired, and the extent to whichpublic ameliorative measures such as stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits may restore such ability, cannot be estimated.Other effects of the pandemic on our operations is referred to throughout this report.     The programs we offer to dealersand consumers are intended to serve a wide range of sub-prime customers, primarily through franchised new car dealers. We originate automobilecontracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in whichwe sell a specified pool of contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours, which in turn issues asset-backed securities to fund thepurchase of the pool of contracts from us.     Securitization and Warehouse Credit Facilities     Throughout the period for which information ispresented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations,and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts,sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securitiesto be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally acceptedaccounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings. All of our active securitizations are structuredas secured financings.     When structured to be treated as a secured financingfor accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appearas assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee incomeon the contracts, and (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction. For automobile contracts acquired before2018, we also periodically record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts; for automobile contracts acquired after 2017we take account of estimated credit losses in our computation of a level yield used to determine recognition of interest on the contracts.     Since 1994 we have conducted91 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated under our regular programs. As of December 31, 2021, 19 of those securitizationsare active and all are structured as secured financings. We generally conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginningof each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020.In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital marketsin which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020.     Our history of term securitizations, over the mostrecent ten years, is summarized in the table below:       Recent Asset-Backed Term Securitizations        $ in    thousands   Period    Number of Term Securitizations    Amount of Receivables   2012      4      $ 603,500     2013      4        778,000     2014      4        923,000     2015      3        795,000     2016      4        1,214,997     2017      4        870,000     2018      4        883,452     2019      4        1,014,124     2020      3        741,867     2021      4        1,145,002                  35           Generally, prior to a securitizationtransaction we fund our automobile contract acquisitions primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-termfunding capacity is $200 million, comprising two credit facilities. The first $100 million credit facility was established in May 2012.This facility was most recently renewed in December 2020, extending the revolving period to December 2022, with an optional amortizationperiod through December 2023. In November 2015, we entered into another $100 million facility. This facility was most recently renewedin February 2022, extending the revolving period to January 2024, followed by an amortization period to January 2028.     We previously had a third $100million facility. This facility was established in April 2015 and was renewed in April 2017 and again in February 2019, extending therevolving period to February 2021. We repaid this facility in full at its maturity in 2021.     In a securitization and inour warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representationsand warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations orwarranties, we will be obligated to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaidinterest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract ata price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we willbear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase.     In a securitization, the relatedspecial purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contractsfalls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. Anunexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on bothour liquidity and results of operations.     Critical Accounting Policies     We believe that our accountingpolicies related to (a) Finance Receivables at Fair Value, (b) Allowance for Finance Credit Losses, (c)  Term Securitizations, (d) Accrual for Contingent Liabilities and (e) Income Taxes are the most criticalto understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Such policies are described below.     Allowance for Finance Credit Losses     In order to estimate an appropriateallowance for losses incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as  " staticpooling, "  which stratifies our finance receivable portfolio intoseparately identified pools based on the period of origination. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowancefor finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolioof automobile contracts. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowanceby examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, prospective liquidation values of the underlying collateraland general economic and market conditions. As circumstances change, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change as well. Receivablesacquired after 2017, are accounted for using fair value and will have no allowance for finance credit losses in accordance with the fairvalue method of accounting for finance receivables.     Broad economic factors suchas recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted averageage of the receivables at any given time. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lower levelsof delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and incremental losses graduallyincreasing to a peak around 18 months, after which they gradually decrease.     The credit performance ofour portfolio is also significantly influenced by our underwriting guidelines and credit criteria we use when evaluating contracts forpurchase from dealers. We regularly evaluate our portfolio credit performance and modify our purchase criteria to maximize the creditperformance of our portfolio, while maintaining competitive programs and levels of service for our dealers.               36           We generally do not lowerthe contractual interest rate or waive or forgive principal when our borrowers incur financial difficulty on either a temporary or permanentbasis. An exception to this policy is when a court order mandates the terms of the contract to be modified, such as in a Chapter 13 bankruptcyproceeding. In such cases, which represent an immaterial portion of our portfolio of finance receivables, we have estimated the amountof impairment that results from such modification and established an appropriate allowance within our Allowance for Finance Credit Losses.     EffectiveJanuary 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 326, which changes the criteria under which creditlosses on financial instruments (such as the Company’s finance receivables) are measured. ASC 326 introduced a new credit reservingmodel known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model, which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology previouslyused under U.S. GAAP with a methodology that records currently the expected lifetime credit losses on financial instruments. The adoptionof CECL required that we establish an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses on the portion of the Company’sreceivable portfolio for which the Company was not already using fair value accounting. We refer to that portion, which is those receivablesthat were originated prior to January 2018, as our “legacy portfolio”. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded an additionto its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million.      At the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, Governmentmandated shutdowns of large portions of the United States economy impaired and will likely continue to impair the ability of obligorsunder our automobile contracts to make their monthly payments. The extent to which that ability will be impaired, and the extent to whichpublic ameliorative measures such as stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits may restore such ability, cannot be estimated.     During the twelve-month periodended December 31, 2021, we recorded a reduction to provision for finance credit losses in the amount of $14.6 million. The reserve decreasewas primarily due to a decrease in lifetime expected credit losses resulting from improved credit performance.     Finance Receivables Measured at Fair Value     Effective January 1, 2018,we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For each finance receivable acquiredafter 2017, we consider the price paid on the purchase date as the fair value for such receivable.  We estimate the cash to be receivedin the future with respect to such receivables, based on our experience with similar receivables acquired in the past.  We then computethe internal rate of return that results in the present value of those estimated cash receipts being equal to the purchase date fair value.Thereafter, we recognize interest income on such receivables on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicableinterest rate. Cash received with respect to such receivables is applied first against such interest income, and then to reduce the recordedvalue of the receivables.     We re-evaluate the fair valueof such receivables at the close of each measurement period. If the reevaluation were to yield a value materially different from the recodedvalue, an adjustment would be required. In the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021, the Company considered the effect of the pandemicon the portfolio of finance receivables carried at fair value and recorded a mark down to that portfolio of $4.4 million. The mark downis reflected as a reduction in revenue.     Anticipated credit lossesare included in our estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables.  Because such credit losses are included in ourcomputation of the appropriate level yield, we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses, as our best estimate of thelifetime aggregate of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also because we include anticipated credit losses in ourcomputation of the level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractual rate applicable to the receivables.Because our initial recorded value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, rather than as the contractual principal balance,we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables.Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred.               37           Term Securitizations     Our term securitization structure has generallybeen as follows:     We sell automobile contractswe acquire to a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling ourautomobile contracts. The special-purpose subsidiary then transfers the same automobile contracts to another entity, typically a statutorytrust. The trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities, in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principalbalance of the automobile contracts. We typically sell these automobile contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse, exceptthat representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to us are provided by us to the trust. One or more investorspurchase the asset-backed securities issued by the trust; the proceeds from the sale of the asset-backed securities are then used to purchasethe automobile contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated asset-backed securities issued by the trust or by a related entity.     We structure our securitizationsto include internal credit enhancement for the benefit the investors (i) in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account (“spreadaccount”) held by the trust, (ii) in the form of overcollateralization of the senior asset-backed securities, where the principalbalance of the senior asset-backed securities issued is less than the principal balance of the automobile contracts, (iii) in the formof subordinated asset-backed securities, or (iv) some combination of such internal credit enhancements. The agreements governing thesecuritization transactions require that the initial level of internal credit enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collectionsfrom the automobile contracts until the level of internal credit enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained. Thespecified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related automobile contracts.The specified levels at which the internal credit enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfoliosof automobile contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among us, our special purposesubsidiary, the insurance company, if any, and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performanceof the various portfolios, and have also varied from one transaction to another. The agreements governing the securitizations generallygrant us the option to repurchase the sold automobile contracts from the trust when the aggregate outstanding balance of the automobilecontracts has amortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance.     Upon each transfer of automobilecontracts in a transaction structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes, we retain on our consolidated balancesheet the related automobile contracts as assets and record the asset-backed notes or loans issued in the transaction as indebtedness.     We receive periodic base servicingfees for the servicing and collection of the automobile contracts. Under our securitization structures treated as secured financings forfinancial accounting purposes, such servicing fees are included in interest income from the automobile contracts. In addition, we areentitled to the cash flows from the trusts that represent collections on the automobile contracts in excess of the amounts required topay principal and interest on the asset-backed securities, base servicing fees, and certain other fees and expenses (such as trustee andcustodial fees). Required principal payments on the asset-backed notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principalbalance of such notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related automobile contracts (excluding those automobile contractsthat have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related securitizationagreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the asset-backed securities is reduced to the specifiedpercentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create overcollateralization of the asset-backed notes.     If the amount of cash requiredfor payment of fees, expenses, interest and principal on the senior asset-backed notes exceeds the amount collected during the collectionperiod, the shortfall is withdrawn from the spread account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessaryfor the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated asset-backed notes, and there is no shortfall in the relatedspread account or the required overcollateralization level, the excess is released to us. If the spread account and overcollateralizationis not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the trust until the specified level is achieved. Althoughspread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of our special-purpose subsidiaries as the owner of the residual interests (inthe case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes) or the trusts (in the case of securitizationtransactions structured as secured financings for financial accounting purposes), we are restricted in use of the cash in the spread accounts.Cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the securitizationagreements. The interest rate payable on the automobile contracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the asset-backednotes. As a result, the residual interests described above historically have been a significant asset of ours.               38           In all of our term securitizationsand warehouse credit facilities, whether treated as secured financings or as sales, we have sold the automobile contracts (through a subsidiary)to the securitization entity. The difference between the two structures is that in securitizations that are treated as secured financingswe report the assets and liabilities of the securitization trust on our consolidated balance sheet. Under both structures, recourse tous by holders of the asset-backed securities and by the trust, for failure of the automobile contract obligors to make payments on a timelybasis, is limited to the automobile contracts included in the securitizations or warehouse credit facilities, the spread accounts andour retained interests in the respective trusts.     Accrual for Contingent Liabilities     We are routinely involvedin various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Our legalcounsel has advised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indication that itis both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined.     We have recorded a liabilityas of December 31, 2021, which represents our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies at that date. The amountof losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us,we believe that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies described or referenced above, asof December 31, 2021, and in excess of the liability we have recorded, does not exceed $11.3 million.     Accordingly, we believe thatthe ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies, after taking into account our current litigation reserves, shouldnot have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherentin contested proceedings, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserveswe have accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to our operating results for a particular period, dependingon, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period.     Income Taxes     We account for income taxesunder the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future taxconsequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities aredetermined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates ineffect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilitiesis recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.     Deferred tax assets are recognizedsubject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred taxasset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will notbe realized. In making such judgements, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified.     In determining the possiblefuture realization of deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversal of taxabletemporary differences; and (b) forecasted future net earnings from operations. Based upon those considerations, we have concluded thatit is more likely than not that the U.S. and state net operating loss carryforward periods provide enough time to utilize the deferredtax assets pertaining to the existing net operating loss carryforwards and any net operating loss that would be created by the reversalof the future net deductions which have not yet been taken on a tax return. Our estimates of taxable income are forward-looking statements,and there can be no assurance that our estimates of such taxable income will be correct. Factors discussed under "Risk Factors,"and in particular under the subheading "Risk Factors -- Forward-Looking Statements" may affect whether such projections proveto be correct.     We recognize interest andpenalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.               39           Uncertainty of Capital Markets and General Economic Conditions     We depend upon the availabilityof warehouse credit facilities and access to long-term financing through the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by ourautomobile contracts. Since 1994, we have completed 91 term securitizations of approximately $16.2 billion in contracts. We generallyconduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendaryear. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onsetof the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently, we successfullycompleted securitizations in June and September 2020 and four securitizations in 2021.     Financial Covenants      Certain of our securitizationtransactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results.Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certainsecuritization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a defaultif a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2021 we were in compliance with all such financial covenants.     Results of Operations     Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December 31,2021 with the year ended December 31, 2020     Revenues .  Duringthe year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues were $267.8 million, a decrease of $3.4 million, or 1.2%, from the prior year revenuesof $271.2 million. The primary reason for the decrease in revenues is a decrease in interest income. Interest income for the year endedDecember 31, 2021 decreased $28.7 million, or 9.7%, to $266.3 million from $295.0 million in the prior year. The primary reason for thedecrease in interest income is the continued runoff of our legacy portfolio of finance receivables originated prior to January 2018, whichaccrued interest at an average of 20.2%, which is offset only in part by the increase in our portfolio of receivables measured at fairvalue, which are those originated since January 2018. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take accountof expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The table below shows the outstanding and averagebalances of our portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries for the year months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:            Year    Ended December 31,        2021    2020        (Dollars in thousands)        Average         Interest    Average         Interest        Balance    Interest    Yield    Balance    Interest    Yield   Interest Earning Assets                                              Finance receivables    $ 345,021      $ 69,805        20.2%    $ 684,259      $ 126,716      18.5%   Finance receivables measured at fair value      1,802,590        196,461        10.9%      1,631,491        168,266      10.3%   Total    $ 2,147,611      $ 266,266        12.4%    $ 2,315,750      $ 294,982      12.7%      Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are net of mark downsof $4.4 million and $29.5 million, respectively, to the recorded value of the finance receivables measured at fair value. The mark downis an estimate based on our evaluation of the appropriate fair value and future earnings rate of existing receivables compared to recentlyacquired receivables and our assessment of potential additional future net losses arising from the pandemic.     Other income was $6.0 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.               40           Expenses .  Our operating expensesconsist largely of interest expense, provision for credit losses, employee costs, sales and general and administrative expenses. Provisionfor credit losses is affected by the balance and credit performance of our portfolio of finance receivables (other than our portfolioof finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the interest rate applicableto such receivables). Interest expense is significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing12-month period and the use of our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizations to finance those contracts. Employee costsand general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factorsthat affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factorssuch as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level.     Employee costs include basesalaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options,and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate withthe level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced.     Other operating expenses consistlargely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales and advertisingexpenses, and depreciation and amortization.     Total operating expenses were$202.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $251.0 million for the prior year, a decrease of $49.0 million, or 19.5%.The decrease is primarily due to a decreases in interest expense and provisions for credit losses.     Employee costs increased by$336,000 or 0.4%, to $80.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, representing 39.9% of total operating expenses, from $80.2million for the prior year, or 31.9% of total operating expenses. Employee costs for 2021 include approximately $8.0 million for the establishmentof a bonus pool for a segment of employees we classify as Managers.     The table below summarizes ouremployees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2021and 2020:            December 31, 2021    December 31, 2020        Amount    Amount        ($ in millions)   Contracts purchased (dollars)    $ 1,146.3      $ 742.6     Contracts purchased (units)      54,317        39,887     Managed portfolio outstanding (dollars)    $ 2,249.1      $ 2,175.0     Managed portfolio outstanding (units)      156,280        163,177                           Number of Originations staff      170        157     Number of Marketing staff      105        96     Number of Servicing staff      388        460     Number of other staff      76        74     Total number of employees      739        787                  41           General and administrative expensesinclude costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, creditservices, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $34.6 million, an increase of $2.6 million, or 8.2%, comparedto the previous year and represented 17.1% of total operating expenses.     Interest expense for the yearended December 31, 2021 decreased by $26.1 million to $75.2 million, or 25.8%, compared to $101.3 million in the previous year. Interestexpense represented 37.2% of total operating expenses in 2021. The primary reason for the decrease in interest expense is the decreasein securitzation trust debt interest.     Interest on securitization trustdebt decreased by $23.6 million, or 26.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The average balance of securitizationtrust debt decreased 9.8% to $1,819.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2,017.2 million for the year ended December31, 2020. The blended interest rates on new term securitizations have generally decreased since 2019 and have stayed relatively low in2021 despite trending upward throughout the year. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds isultimately the result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which ourbonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing to accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demandfor our bonds at the time of the securitization. These and other factors have resulted in fluctuations in our securitization trust debtinterest costs. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below:       Blended Cost of Funds on Recent Asset-Backed Term Securitizations   Period     Blended Cost of Funds   January 2018     3.46%   April 2018     3.98%   July 2018     4.18%   October 2018     4.25%   January 2019     4.22%   April 2019     3.95%   July 2019     3.36%   October 2019     2.95%   January 2020     3.08%   June 2020     4.09%   September 2020     2.39%   January 2021     1.11%   April 2021     1.65%   July 2021     1.55%   October 2021     2.09%      The annualized average rateon our securitization trust debt was 3.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with 4.4% for 2020. The annualized average rateis influenced by the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increase over time on anyparticular securitization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repayment of the shorterterm, lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds.     Interest expense on warehouselines of credit decreased by $3.2 million, or 42.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The decrease wasprimarily due to the lower utilization of our credit lines during the year. The average balance of our warehouse debt was $51.3 millionduring 2021 compared to $92.5 million in 2020.               42           Interest expense on residualinterest financing was $3.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $3.5 million in the prior year as the average balancehas increased.     Interest expense on our subordinatedrenewable notes increased by $466,000, or 21.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The average balanceof the notes increased from $19.3 million in the prior year to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The average interestrate on our subordinated notes decreased to 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020.     The following table presentsthe components of interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:            2021    2020        (Dollars in thousands)                  Annualized              Annualized        Average         Average    Average         Average        Balance    (1)    Interest    Yield/Rate    Balance    (1)    Interest    Yield/Rate   Interest Earning Assets                                                    Finance receivables gross (2)    $ 345,021      $ 69,805      20.2 %    $ 684,259      $ 126,716      18.5%   Finance receivables at fair value      1,802,590        196,461      10.9 %      1,631,491        168,266      10.3%          2,147,611        266,266      12.4 %      2,315,750        294,982      12.7%                                                        Interest Bearing Liabilities                                                    Warehouse lines of credit    $ 51,313        4,448      8.7 %    $ 92,481        7,678      8.3%   Residual interest financing      42,692        3,763      8.8 %      34,906        3,454      9.9%   Securitization trust debt      1,819,914        64,387      3.5 %      2,017,152        88,031      4.4%   Subordinated renewable notes      25,270        2,641      10.5 %      19,340        2,175      11.2%        $ 1,939,189        75,239      3.9 %    $ 2,163,879        101,338      4.7%                                                        Net interest income/spread             $ 191,027                      $ 193,644           Net interest margin (3)                      8.9 %                      8.4%   Ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities      111 %                      107 %                  _________________________    (1) Average balances are based on monthend balances except for warehouse lines of credit, which are based on daily balances.

The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and istherefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The average balance of these receivables was $1,802.6 million for the twelvemonths ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1,631.5 million in the prior year period.     Effective January 1, 2020,the Company adopted  Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losseson Financial Instruments.  The amendment introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss model, generallyreferred to as CECL. Adoption of CECL required the establishment of an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses onthe portion of the Company’s receivable portfolio that was originated prior to January 2018. To comply with CECL, the Company recordedan addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million. In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset tothe addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospectivemethod.     For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recordeda reduction to provision for credit losses on finance receivables in the amount of $14.6 million. The reserve decrease was primarily dueto a decrease in lifetime expected credit losses resulting from improved credit performance. In the prior year period, we recorded anincrease to provision for credit losses for $14.1 million. That provision represented our estimate in 2020 of additional forecasted lossesthat might be incurred as a result of the pandemic on our portfolio of finance receivables. Such losses were not considered in our initialestimate of remaining lifetime losses that we recorded upon our adoption of CECL in January 2020.     The allowance applies only toour finance receivables originated through December 2017, which we refer to as our legacy portfolio. Finance receivables that wehave originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognize interest incomenet of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value.     Sales expense consists primarilyof commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salary plus commissionsbased on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers, such as training programs,internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Sales expense increased by $2.7 million to $16.9 million during the year ended December31, 2021 and represented 8.4% of total operating expenses. We purchased $1,146.3 million of new contracts during the year ended December31, 2021 compared to $742.6 million in the prior year period. In our second quarter of 2020, we experienced a significant reduction incontract purchases due to the pandemic and partial shutdown of the economy. Since then, our contract purchase volumes have gradually increasedto pre-pandemic levels.     Occupancy expenses increasedby $294,000 or 4.0%, to $7.7 million compared to $7.4 million in the previous year and represented 3.8% of total operating expenses.     Depreciation and amortizationexpenses decreased by $109,000 or 6.1%, to $1.7 million compared to $1.8 million in the previous year and represented 0.8% of total operatingexpenses.     Income tax expense was $18.2million in 2021 compared to an income tax benefit of $1.6 million for 2020. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and EconomicSecurity (“CARES”) Act was passed into law, providing wide ranging economic relief for individuals and businesses. One componentof the CARES Act provides the Company with an opportunity to carry back net operating losses (“NOLs”) arising from 2018, 2019and 2020 to the prior five tax years. The Company has previously valued its NOLs at the federal corporate income tax rate of 21%. However,the CARES Act provides for NOL carryback claims to be calculated based on a rate of 35%, which was the federal corporate tax rate in effectfor the carryback years. The result of the revaluation of NOLs and other tax adjustments is a net tax benefit of $680,000 and $8.8 millionfor 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excluding the tax benefit, income tax expense for 2021 would have been $18.9 million, representing aneffective income tax rate of 29%. For 2020, income tax expense would have been $7.2 million for an effective tax rate of 36%.               44           Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December 31,2020 with the year ended December 31, 2019     Revenues .  Duringthe year ended December 31, 2020, our revenues were $271.2 million, a decrease of $74.6 million, or 21.6%, from the prior year revenuesof $345.8 million. The primary reason for the decrease in revenues is a decrease in interest income and a mark down to the recorded valueof the portion of the receivables portfolio accounted for at fair value. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased$42.1 million, or 12.5%, to $295.0 million from $337.1 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the decrease in interest incomeis the continued runoff of our portfolio of finance receivables originated prior to January 2018, which accrued interest at an averageof 18.5%, which is offset only in part by the increase in our portfolio of receivables measured at fair value, which are those originatedsince January 2018. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is thereforeless than the yield on other finance receivables. The table below shows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held byconsolidated subsidiaries for the year months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:            Year    Ended December 31,        2020    2019        (Dollars in thousands)        Average         Interest    Average         Interest        Balance    Interest    Yield    Balance    Interest    Yield   Interest Earning Assets                                                     Finance receivables    $ 684,259      $ 126,716        18.5%    $ 1,192,484      $ 214,037        17.9%   Finance receivables measured at fair value      1,631,491        168,266        10.3%      1,212,226        123,059        10.2%   Total    $ 2,315,750      $ 294,982        12.7%    $ 2,404,710      $ 337,096        14.0%      Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 include a $29.5 million markdown to the recorded value of the finance receivables measured at fair value. The mark down is an estimate based on our evaluation ofthe appropriate fair value and future earnings rate of existing receivables compared to recently acquired receivables and our assessmentof potential additional future net losses arising from the pandemic.     Other income decreased by $3.0million, or 34.4%, to $5.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from $8.7 million in the prior year. The decrease in other incomegenerally resulted from a decrease of $1.3 million in revenues associated with direct mail and other related products and services thatwe offer to our dealers and a decrease of $1.0 million in payments from third-party providers of convenience fees paid by our customersfor web based and other electronic payments.     Expenses .  Our operating expensesconsist largely of interest expense, provision for credit losses, employee costs, sales and general and administrative expenses. Provisionfor credit losses is affected by the balance and credit performance of our portfolio of finance receivables (other than our portfolioof finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the interest rate applicableto such receivables). Interest expense is significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing12-month period and the use of our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizations to finance those contracts. Employee costsand general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factorsthat affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factorssuch as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level.     Employee costs include basesalaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options,and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate withthe level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced.               45           Other operating expenses consistlargely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales and advertisingexpenses, and depreciation and amortization.     Total operating expenses were$251.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $336.6 million for the prior year, a decrease of $85.6 million, or 25.4%.The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in provision for credit losses and interest expense.     Employee costs decreased by$679,000 or 0.8%, to $80.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, representing 31.9% of total operating expenses, from $80.9million for the prior year, or 24.0% of total operating expenses. In the first quarter of 2020, prior to the onset of the pandemic, ouremployee costs were greater than in the first quarter of 2019. Those increases have been partially offset by decreases since the firstquarter of 2020, which are the result of staff reductions due in part to the fact that our contract purchases have not returned to pre-pandemiclevels. If our contract purchase volumes remain at current levels, we expect lower employee costs in future periods.     The table below summarizes ouremployees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2021and 2020:            December 31, 2021    December 31, 2020        Amount    Amount        ($ in millions)   Contracts purchased (dollars)    $ 1,146.3      $ 742.6     Contracts purchased (units)      54,317        39,887     Managed portfolio outstanding (dollars)    $ 2,249.1      $ 2,175.0     Managed portfolio outstanding (units)      156,280        163,177                           Number of Originations staff      170        157     Number of Marketing staff      105        96     Number of Servicing staff      388        460     Number of other staff      76        74     Total number of employees      739        787        General and administrative expensesinclude costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, creditservices, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $32.0 million, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 3.1%, comparedto the previous year and represented 12.7% of total operating expenses.     Interest expense for the yearended December 31, 2020 decreased by $9.2 million to $101.3 million, or 8.3%, compared to $110.5 million in the previous year. Interestexpense represented 40.4% of total operating expenses in 2020.               46           Interest on securitization trustdebt decreased by $8.8 million, or 9.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. The average balance of securitizationtrust debt decreased 7.5% to $2,017.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2,181.5 million for the year ended December31, 2019. The blended interest rates on new term securitizations have generally increased in 2017 and 2018 before declining in 2019 and2020. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the result of many factors includingthe market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarksthat investors are willing to accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand for our bonds at the time of the securitization.These and other factors have resulted in fluctuations in our securitization trust debt interest costs.

The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and istherefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The average balance of these receivables was $1,631.5 million for the twelvemonths ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,212.2 million in the prior year period.     Effective January 1, 2020,the Company adopted  Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losseson Financial Instruments.  The amendment introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss model, generallyreferred to as CECL. Adoption of CECL required the establishment of an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses onthe portion of the Company’s receivable portfolio that was originated prior to January 2018. To comply with CECL, the Company recordedan addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million. In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset tothe addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospectivemethod.     Provision for credit losses was $14.1 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2020. The provision represents our estimate of additional losses that may be incurred on the portfolioof finance receivables resulting from the pandemic. Such losses were not considered in our initial estimate of remaining lifetime lossesthat we recorded with the adoption of CECL in January 2020. In the prior year period, prior to the adoption of CECL, provision for creditlosses was $85.8 million.     The allowance applies only toour finance receivables originated through December 2017, which we refer to as our legacy portfolio.  Finance receivables that wehave originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognize interest incomenet of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value.     Sales expense consists primarilyof commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salary plus commissionsbased on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers, such as training programs,internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Sales expense decreased by $3.7 million to $14.2 million during the year ended December31, 2020 and represented 5.7% of total operating expenses. We purchased $742.6 million of new contracts during the year ended December31, 2020 compared to $1,002.8 million in the prior year period. In our second quarter of 2020, we experienced a significant reductionin contract purchases due to the pandemic and partial shutdown of the economy. Subsequently, our contract purchase volumes have increasedbut have not recovered to pre-pandemic levels.     Occupancy expenses decreasedby $66,000 or 0.9%, to $7.4 million compared to $7.5 million in the previous year and represented 3.0% of total operating expenses.            49           Depreciation and amortizationexpenses increased by $709,000 or 65.9%, to $1.8 million compared to $1.1 million in the previous year and represented 0.6% of total operatingexpenses.     Income tax benefit was $1.6million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which includes an $8.8 million tax benefit. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Reliefand Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was passed into law, providing wide ranging economic relief for individuals and businesses.One component of the CARES Act provides the Company with an opportunity to carry back net operating losses (“NOLs”) arisingfrom 2018, 2019 and 2020 to the prior five tax years. The Company has previously valued its NOLs at the federal corporate income tax rateof 21%. However, the CARES Act provides for NOL carryback claims to be calculated based on a rate of 35%, which was the federal corporatetax rate in effect for the carryback years. The result of the revaluation of NOLs and other tax adjustments is a net tax benefit of $8.8million. Excluding the tax benefit, income tax expense would have been $7.2 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 36%.For the prior year period, income tax expense was $3.8 million, which represents an effective income tax rate of 41%.     Liquidity and Capital Resources     Liquidity     Our business requires substantialcash to support our purchases of automobile contracts and other operating activities. Our primary sources of cash have been cash flowsfrom the proceeds from term securitization transactions and other sales of automobile contracts, amounts borrowed under various revolvingcredit facilities (also sometimes known as warehouse credit facilities), customer payments of principal and interest on finance receivables,fees for origination of automobile contracts, and releases of cash from securitization transactions and their related spread accounts.Our primary uses of cash have been the purchases of automobile contracts, repayment of amounts borrowed under lines of credit, securitizationtransactions and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses,the establishment of spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, the increase of credit enhancement to required levelsin securitization transactions, and income taxes. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meetour cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines thelevel of releases from those pools and their related spread accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in our managed portfolio,and the terms upon which we are able to acquire and borrow against automobile contracts.     Net cash provided by operatingactivities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $198.2 million, $238.8 million and $216.8 million, respectively. Netcash from operating activities is generally provided by net income from operations adjusted for significant non-cash items such as ourprovision for credit losses and interest accretion on fair value receivables.     Net cash used in investingactivities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $115.4 million. This compares to net cash provided by investing activities of $93.0million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 was $229.4 million.Cash provided by investing activities primarily results from principal payments and other proceeds received on finance receivables. Cashused in investing activities generally relates to purchases of automobile contracts. Purchases of finance receivables were $1,107.5 million(includes acquisition fees paid), $739.7 million and $1,004.2 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.     Net cash used in financingactivities for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $50.4 million and $328.5 million, respectively. Net cash provided by financingactivities for the years ended December 31, 2019 was $23.3 million. Cash used or provided by financing activities is primarily relatedto the issuance of securitization trust debt, reduced by the amount of repayment of securitization trust debt and net proceeds or repaymentson our warehouse lines of credit and other debt. We issued $1,110.7 million in new securitization trust debt in 2021 compared to $714.5million in 2020 and $1,000.5 million in 2019. Repayments of securitization debt were $1,153.1 million, $1,010.0 million and $966.1 millionin 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.     We purchase automobile contractsfrom dealers for a cash price approximately equal to their principal amount, adjusted for an acquisition fee which may either increaseor decrease the automobile contract purchase price. Those automobile contracts generate cash flow, however, over a period of years. Wehave been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase automobile contracts and our securitization transactions for long termfinancing of our contracts. In addition, we have accessed other sources, such as residual financings and subordinated debt in order tofinance our continuing operations.               50           The acquisition of automobilecontracts for subsequent financing in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization,if any, and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amountof capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancementin securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established trusts and their related spread accounts either release cash tous or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. Of those, the factor most subject to our control is the rateat which we purchase automobile contracts.     We are and may in the futurebe limited in our ability to purchase automobile contracts due to limits on our capital. As of December 31, 2021, we had unrestrictedcash of $29.9 million and $94.0 million aggregate available borrowings under our two warehouse credit facilities (assuming the availabilityof sufficient eligible collateral). As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $71.3 million of such eligible collateral. During 2021,we completed four securitizations aggregating $1,110.7 million of notes sold. Our plans to manage our liquidity include maintaining ourrate of automobile contract purchases at a level that matches our available capital, and, as appropriate, minimizing our operating costs.If we are unable to complete such securitizations, we may be unable to increase our rate of automobile contract purchases, in which caseour interest income and other portfolio related income could decrease.     Our liquidity will also beaffected by releases of cash from the trusts established with our securitizations. While the specific terms and mechanics of each spreadaccount vary among transactions, our securitization agreements generally provide that we will receive excess cash flows, if any, onlyif the amount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and the delinquency or net losses related to the automobile contractsin the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies or net losses on the automobile contracts exceed such levels,the terms of the securitization may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulated for the particular pool. There can be no assurancethat collections from the related trusts will continue to generate sufficient cash.     Our warehouse credit facilitiescontain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimumlevels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain of our debt agreements other than ourterm securitizations contain cross-default provisions. Such cross-default provisions would allow the respective creditors to declare adefault if an event of default occurred with respect to other indebtedness of ours, but only if such other event of default were to beaccompanied by acceleration of such other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants.     We currently have and willcontinue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2021, we had approximately $1,945.7 million of debt outstanding.Such debt consisted primarily of $1,760.0 million of securitization trust debt, and also included $105.6 million of warehouse lines ofcredit, $53.7 million of residual interest financing debt and $26.4 million in subordinated renewable notes. We are also currently offeringthe subordinated renewable notes to the public on a continuous basis, and such notes have maturities that range from three months to fiveyears.     Although we believe we areable to service and repay our debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If our plans for future operations do not generatesufficient cash flows and earnings, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. If we fail to pay our indebtednesswhen due, it could have a material adverse effect on us and may require us to issue additional debt or equity securities.     Contractual Obligations     The following table summarizesour material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):            Payment Due by Period (1)                   Less than        2 to 3        4 to 5        More than            Total        1 Year        Years        Years        5 Years     Long Term Debt (2)    $ 26,459      $ 12,002      $ 7,216      $ 5,672      $ 1,569     Operating and Finance Leases    $ 12,867      $ 7,484      $ 2,918      $ 1,305      $ 1,160     ___________________    (1) Securitization trust debt, in the aggregate amount of $1,760.0 million as of December 31, 2021, is omittedfrom this table because it becomes due as and when the related receivables balance is reduced by payments and charge-offs.

In February2022, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to January 2024 followed by an amortization period through January 2028for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period.     Capital Resources     Securitization trust debtis repaid from collections on the related receivables, and becomes due in accordance with its terms as the principal amount of the relatedreceivables is reduced. Although the securitization trust debt also has alternative final maturity dates, those dates are significantlylater than the dates at which repayment of the related receivables is anticipated, and at no time in our history have any of our sponsoredasset-backed securities reached those alternative final maturities.     The acquisition of automobilecontracts for subsequent transfer in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization,if any, when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependenton the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extentto which the trusts and related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts.We plan to adjust our levels of automobile contract purchases and the related capital requirements to match anticipated releases of cashfrom the trusts and related spread accounts.               52           Capitalization     Over the period from January1, 2019 through December 31, 2021 we have managed our capitalization by issuing and refinancing debt as summarized in the following table:            Year Ended December 31,        2021    2020    2019        (Dollars in thousands)   RESIDUAL INTEREST FINANCING:                              Beginning balance    $ 25,426      $ 39,478      $ 39,106     Issuances      50,000        –        –     Payments      (21,265 )      (14,424 )      –     Capitalization of deferred financing costs      (755 )      –        –     Amortization of deferred financing costs      276        372        372     Ending balance    $ 53,682      $ 25,426      $ 39,478                                    SECURITIZATION TRUST DEBT:                              Beginning balance    $ 1,803,673      $ 2,097,728      $ 2,063,627     Issuances      1,110,747        714,543        1,000,501     Payments      (1,153,114 )      (1,009,988 )      (966,144 )   Capitalization of deferred financing costs      (7,058 )      (4,862 )      (6,808 )   Amortization of deferred financing costs      5,724        6,252        6,552     Ending balance    $ 1,759,972      $ 1,803,673      $ 2,097,728                                    SUBORDINATED RENEWABLE NOTES:                              Beginning balance    $ 21,323      $ 17,534      $ 17,290     Issuances      12,298        6,750        5,764     Payments      (7,162 )      (2,961 )      (5,520 )   Ending balance    $ 26,459      $ 21,323      $ 17,534        Residual Interest Financing.   OnMay 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residualinterest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interestsin thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliatethat owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issuedby CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. At December 31, 2021 there was $4.3 millionoutstanding under this facility.     On June 30, 2021, we completeda $50 million securitization of residual interests from other previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction,qualified institutional buyers purchased $50.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in eleven CPS securitizationsconsecutively issued from January 2018 and September 2020. The sold notes (“2021-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto SecuritizationTrust 2021-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 7.86%. At December 31, 2021 there was $50.0 million outstanding under this facility.               53           The agreed valuation of thecollateral for the 2018-1 and 2021-1 Notes is the sum of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each related securitizationand the over-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principal balances of therelated receivables less the principal balance of the outstanding notes issued in the related securitization. On each monthly paymentdate, the 2018-1 Notes and the 2021-1 Notes are entitled to interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessaryto maintain a specified minimum collateral ratio.     Securitization Trust Debt.   Since 2011, we treated all 41 of our securitizations of automobile contracts as secured financings for financial accounting purposes,and the asset-backed securities issued in such securitizations remain on our consolidated balance sheet as securitization trust debt.We had $1,760.0 million of securitization trust debt outstanding at December 31, 2021.     Subordinated RenewableNotes Debt.    In June 2005, we began issuing registered subordinated renewable notes in an ongoing offering to the public.Upon maturity, the notes are automatically renewed for the same term as the maturing notes, unless we repay the notes or the investornotifies us within 15 days after the maturity date of his note that he wants it repaid. Renewed notes bear interest at the rate we areoffering at that time to other investors with similar note maturities. Based on the terms of the individual notes, interest payments maybe required monthly, quarterly, annually or upon maturity. At December 31, 2021 there were $26.4 million of such notes outstanding.     We must comply with certainaffirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratiosrelated to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. Inaddition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditorsto declare default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all such covenants.     Forward-looking Statements     This report on Form 10-K includescertain "forward-looking statements". Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as "anticipates,""expects," "plans," "estimates," or words of like meaning. As to the specifically identified forward-lookingstatements, factors that could affect charge-offs and recovery rates include unexpected exogenous events, such as a widespread plaguethat might affect the ability or willingness of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of contracts; mandates imposed in reaction to suchevents, such as prohibitions of otherwise permissible activity, which might impair the obligation to perform contracts, or the abiltyof obligors to earn; changes in the general economic climate, which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to pay pursuantto the terms of contracts; changes in laws respecting consumer finance, which could affect our ability to enforce rights under contracts;and changes in the market for used vehicles, which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles. Factors thatcould affect our revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools of contracts, which would affectour ability to purchase contracts, the terms on which we are able to finance such purchases, the willingness of dealers to sell contractsto us on the terms that it offers, and the terms on which we are able to complete term securitizations once contracts are acquired. Factorsthat could affect our expenses in the current year include competitive conditions in the market for qualified personnel, investor demandfor asset-backed securities and interest rates (which affect the rates that we pay on asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations).The statements concerning structuring securitization transactions as secured financings and the effects of such structures on financialitems and on future profitability also are forward-looking statements. Any change to the structure of our securitization transaction couldcause such forward-looking statements to be inaccurate. Both the amount of the effect of the change in structure on our profitabilityand the duration of the period in which our profitability would be affected by the change in securitization structure are estimates. Theaccuracy of such estimates will be affected by the rate at which we purchase and sell contracts, any changes in that rate, the creditperformance of such contracts, the financial terms of future securitizations, any changes in such terms over time, and other factors thatgenerally affect our profitability.               54           Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About MarketRisk     Interest Rate Risk     We are subject to interestrate risk during the period between when contracts are purchased from dealers and when such contracts become part of a term securitization.Specifically, the interest rate due on our warehouse credit facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the contracts are fixed.Therefore, if interest rates increase, the interest we must pay to our lenders under warehouse credit facilities is likely to increasewhile the interest we receive from warehoused automobile contracts remains the same. As a result, excess spread cash flow would likelydecrease during the warehousing period. Additionally, automobile contracts warehoused and then securitized during a rising interest rateenvironment may result in less excess spread cash flow to us. Historically, our securitization facilities have paid fixed rate interestto security holders set at prevailing interest rates at the time of the closing of the securitization, which may not take place untilseveral months after we purchased those contracts. Our customers, on the other hand, pay fixed rates of interest on the automobile contracts,set at the time they purchase the underlying vehicles. A decrease in excess spread cash flow could adversely affect our earnings and cashflow.     To mitigate, but not eliminate,the short-term risk relating to interest rates payable under the warehouse facilities, we have historically held automobile contractsin the warehouse credit facilities for less than four months. To mitigate, but not eliminate, the long-term risk relating to interestrates payable by us in securitizations, we have structured our term securitization transactions to include pre-funding structures, wherebythe amount of notes issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts. We expect to continue to use pre-funding structuresin our securitizations. In pre-funding, the proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until we sell the additionalcontracts to the trust. In pre-funded securitizations, we lock in the borrowing costs with respect to the contracts we subsequently deliverto the securitization trust. However, we incur an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money marketyields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the notes outstanding.The amount of such expense may vary. Despite these mitigation strategies, an increase in prevailing interest rates would cause us to receiveless excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.     Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
