ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  The following analysis of the financial condition of the Company should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and the Company's consolidated financial statements and the Notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report.  OVERVIEW  Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") primarily engage in the business of purchasing, selling and servicing retail automobile installment sale contracts ("Contracts") originated by automobile dealers ("Dealers") located throughout the United States. In the past, the Company has purchased contracts in as many as 44 different states. At various times in 1999, the Company suspended its solicitation of Contract purchases in as many as 20 states, and as of the date of this report is active in 37 states. There can be no assurance as to resumption of Contract purchasing activities in other states. Through its purchase of Contracts, the Company provides indirect financing to Dealer customers with limited credit histories, low incomes or past credit problems, who generally would not be expected to qualify for financing provided by banks or by automobile manufacturers' captive finance companies.  The Company historically has generated revenue primarily from the gains recognized on the sale or securitization of its Contracts, servicing fees earned on Contracts sold, and interest earned on Residuals, as defined below, and on Contracts held for sale. Beginning with the year ended December 31, 1999 and through December 31, 2000, the Company did not sell any Contracts in securitization transactions, and therefore recognized no gains on sale from securitization transactions. All sales of Contracts during 1999 were on a servicing released basis, either in the form of bulk sales of Contracts being held by the Company for sale, or as part of a flow through agreement with a third party for which the Company earned fees on a per Contract basis, also known as "the flow purchase program" or "purchases made on a flow basis". During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company entered into another flow through agreement and proceeded to sell nearly all of the Contracts purchased during the year to one or the other third party, for a mark-up above what the Company paid the Dealer. The Company recorded a loss of $22.7 million related to bulk sales in 1999. There were no bulk sales during 2000 or 2001. As a result of the Company's flow through sales during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized a $16.6 million and $18.4 million gain on sale of Contracts, respectively, compared to a net loss on sale of Contracts for the year ended December 31, 1999, of $6.2 million. One of the two flow purchasers ceased to purchase Contracts in December 2001. The other flow purchaser has stated that it will cease such purchases in May 2002. The Company accordingly expects the flow purchase program will terminate in May 2002.  During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company purchased Contracts other than on a flow basis to hold pending sale into a securitization, which it had not done in the two previous years. Funding for the other than flow basis purchases was available from the Company's $75 million revolving note purchase facility, established in November 2000. Since November 2000, the Company has been able to purchase Contracts for its own account using proceeds from that facility. Approximately 75% of the principal balance of Contracts may be advanced to the Company under that facility, subject to a collateral test and certain other conditions and covenants. Notes issued under this facility currently bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus 0.60% per annum. The note purchase facility was modified during March 2001, with the effect that sales of Contracts to the facility-related special purpose subsidiary ("SPS") are treated                                         18   as an ongoing securitization. The Company, therefore, removes the securitized Contracts and related debt from its consolidated balance sheet and recognizes a gain on sale in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Purchases of Contracts made other than on a flow basis require that the Company fund the portion of Contract purchase prices beyond what the related SPS was able to borrow in the continuous securitization structure, which in the aggregate required cash of approximately $32.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2001. The Company securitized $141.7 million of Contracts during the year ending December 31, 2001, resulting in a gain on sale of $9.2 million.  On September 7, 2001, the Company completed a $68.5 million term securitization. In a private placement, qualified institutional buyers purchased notes backed by automotive receivables. The Notes, issued by CPS Auto Receivables Trust 2001-A, consist of two classes: $44.5 million of 4.37% Class A-1 Notes, and $24.0 million of 5.28% Class A-2 Notes. Substantially all of the proceeds from the September 2001 transaction were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the Company's revolving note purchase facility. No additional gain on sale was recognized upon that term securitization.  Total gain (loss) on sale, which also includes the Company's estimate of its provision for (recovery of) losses and other related expenses was $32.8 million, $16.2 million and $(14.8 million) for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Revenues from interest and servicing fees for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, were $17.2 million and $10.7 million, and $3.5 million and $15.8 million, respectively. Such revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999, were $3.0 million and $27.8 million, respectively. The Company's income is affected by losses incurred on Contracts, whether such Contracts are held for sale or have been sold in securitizations. The Company's cash requirements have been significant in the past and will continue to be significant in the future. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was approximately $3.7 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, and net cash used in operating activities of approximately $(180,000) for the year ended December 31, 1999. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources."  The Company has historically purchased Contracts with the primary intention of reselling them in securitization transactions as asset-backed securities. From late May 1999 through the first quarter of 2001, the Company primarily purchased Contracts on a flow basis for third parties; that is, the Company purchased a Contract from a Dealer, and sold the Contract the immediately to the third party for a mark-up above what the Company pays the Dealer. The Company retains no interest in such Contracts, and neither services such Contracts nor earns a servicing fee. As noted above, the Company expects the flow purchase program will terminate in May 2002.  The Company's securitization structure has generally been as follows:  First, the Company sells a portfolio of Contracts to a wholly owned SPS, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the Company's Contracts. The SPS then transfers the same Contracts to either a grantor Trust or an owner Trust. The Trust is a qualifying special purpose entity and is therefore not consolidated in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Trust in turn issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities (the "Certificates"), generally in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal balance of the Contracts. The Company typically sells these Contracts to the Trust at face value and without recourse, except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the Dealer to the Company are provided by the Company to the Trust. One or more investors purchase the Certificates issued by the Trust; the proceeds from the sale of the Certificates are then used to purchase the Contracts from the Company. The Company may retain subordinated Certificates issued by the Trust. The Company purchases a financial guaranty insurance policy, guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest on the senior Certificates, from an insurance company (the "Certificate Insurer"). In addition, the Company provides a credit enhancement for the benefit of the Certificate Insurer and the investors in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account ("Spread Account") held by the Trust or in the form of subordinated Certificates. The agreements governing the securitization transactions (collectively referred to as the "Securitization Agreements")                                         19   require that the initial deposits to the Spread Accounts be supplemented by a portion of collections from the Contracts until the Spread Accounts reach specified levels, and then maintained at those levels. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related Certificates. The specified levels at which the Spread Accounts are to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of Contracts held by the Trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among the Company, the SPS, the Certificate Insurer and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the portfolios, and have also been varied by Securitization Agreement. The Securitization Agreements generally grant the Company the option to repurchase the sold Contracts from the Trust when the aggregate outstanding balance has amortized to 10% or less of the initial aggregate balance.  The revolving note purchase facility continuous securitization structure is similar to the above, except that (i) the SPS that purchases the Contracts pledges the Contracts to secure promissory notes issued directly by the SPS, (ii) the initial purchaser of such notes has the right, but not the obligation, to require that the Company repurchase the Contracts, (iii) the promissory notes are in an aggregate principal amount of not more than 75% of the aggregate principal balance of the Contracts, and (iv) no Spread Account is involved. The SPS is a qualifying special purpose entity and is therefore not consolidated in the Company's consolidated financial statements.  At the closing of each securitization, whether a term securitization or the revolving note purchase facility continuous securitization, the Company removes from its consolidated balance sheet the Contracts held for sale and adds to its consolidated balance sheet (i) the cash received and (ii) the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that the Company retains in Contracts sold in securitization. That retained interest (the "Residual") consists of (a) the cash held in the Spread Account, if any, (b) subordinated Certificates retained, and (c) receivables from Trust, which include the net interest receivables ("NIRs"). NIRs represent the estimated discounted cash flows to be received from the Trust in the future, net of principal and interest payable with respect to the Certificates, and certain expenses. The excess of the cash received and the assets retained by the Company over the carrying value of the Contracts sold, less transaction costs, equals the net gain on sale of Contracts recorded by the Company.  The Company allocates its basis in the Contracts between the Certificates and the Residuals sold and retained based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of the sale. The Company recognizes gains or losses attributable to the change in the fair value of the Residuals, which are recorded at estimated fair value. The Company is not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of interests such as the Residuals; accordingly, the Company determines the estimated fair value of the Residuals by discounting the amount and timing of anticipated cash flows released from the Spread Account (the cash out method), using a discount rate that the Company believes is appropriate for the risks involved and estimating the value of the Company's optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the Servicing Agreements. The Company estimates the value of its optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the Servicing Agreements primarily based on its estimate of the amount and timing of anticipated cash flows released from existing receivables then outstanding and previously charged off receivables repurchased, using a discount rate that the Company believes is appropriate for the risks involved. The Company has used an effective discount rate of approximately 14% per annum.  The Company receives periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the Contracts. In addition, the Company is entitled to the cash flows from the Residuals that represent collections on the Contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the Certificates, the base servicing fees, and certain other fees (such as trustee and custodial                                         20   fees). At the end of each collection period, the aggregate cash collections from the Contracts are allocated first to the base servicing fees and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees for the period, then to the Certificateholders for interest at the pass-through rate on the Certificates plus principal as defined in the Securitization Agreements. If the amount of cash required for the above allocations exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is drawn from the Spread Account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations, and there is no shortfall in the related Spread Account, the excess is released to the Company or in certain cases is transferred to other Spread Accounts that may be below their required levels. Pursuant to certain Securitization Agreements, excess cash collected during the period is used to make accelerated principal paydowns on certain Certificates to create excess collateral (over-collateralization or OC account). If the Spread Account balance is not at the required credit enhancement level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the Spread Account until the specified level is achieved. The cash in the Spread Accounts is restricted from use by the Company. Cash held in the various Spread Accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the Securitization Agreements. Spread Account balances are held by the Trusts on behalf of the Company's SPS as the owner of the Residuals.  The annual percentage rate payable on the Contracts is significantly greater than the pass-through rate on the Certificates. Accordingly, the Residuals described above are a significant asset of the Company. In determining the value of the Residuals described above, the Company must estimate the future rates of prepayments, delinquencies, defaults and default loss severity, and the value of the Company's optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the Servicing Agreements as they affect the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows. The Company estimates prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable Contracts. The Company has used prepayment estimates of approximately 22% to 27% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts. The Company estimates defaults and default loss severity using available historical loss data for comparable Contracts and the specific characteristics of the Contracts purchased by the Company. The Company estimates recovery rates of previously charged off receivables using available historical recovery data and projected future recovery levels. In valuing the Residuals, the Company estimates that gross losses as a percentage of the original principal balance will approximate 16% to 22% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts, with recovery rates approximating 4% to 6%.  In future periods, the Company will recognize additional revenue from the Residuals if the actual performance of the Contracts is better than the original estimate, or the Company would increase the estimated fair value of the Residuals. If the actual performance of the Contracts were worse than the original estimate, then a downward adjustment to the carrying value of the Residuals would be required. The authoritative accounting standard setting bodies are currently deliberating the consolidation of non-qualifying special purpose entities and the accounting treatment for various off-balance sheet financing transactions. The effect of such deliberations may require the Company to treat its securitizations differently. However, the outcome of such deliberations is currently unknown.  The Certificateholders and the related securitization Trusts have no recourse to the Company for failure of the Contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis. The Company's Residuals, however, are subordinate to the Certificates until the Certificateholders are fully paid.                                         21   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000  REVENUE. During the year ended December 31, 2001, revenues increased $26.1 million, or 72.5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. Net gain on sale of Contracts increased by $16.5 million, from $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $32.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The primary reason for the increase in the gain on sale component of revenue is the Company's securitization of approximately $141.7 million of Contracts in the 2001 period, resulting in a gain on sale of Contracts of $9.2 million. The availability and structure of the Company's note purchase facility enabled it to execute securitization transactions during 2001; no such sales occurred in the prior year period. In addition, the Company completed a term securitization in September 2001. Substantially all of the proceeds from the September 2001 transaction were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the Company's revolving note purchase facility. Additionally, gain on sale of Contracts includes the effect of fluctuations in the Company's estimate of the required provision for losses on Contracts and recovery of losses on Contracts. During 2001, recoveries exceeded the provision for losses; in 2000 the provision for losses was greater than recoveries. The Company makes recoveries on Contracts previously held on balance sheet or from pools for which the Company has exercised its optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the Securitization Agreements. The amount of Contracts for which the Company requires a provision for Contract losses has contracted, while the amounts recovered has continued to increase. As such the Company is able to recover its provision for Contract losses. For the year ended December 31, 2001 the Company recorded a reduction of the provision for Contract losses of $5.7 million, compared to a charge of $(1.8 million) for the year ended December 31, 2000.  During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company sold $537.9 million of Contracts on a flow basis compared to $600.4 million of Contracts in the year ended December 31, 2000. The Company expects the flow purchase program will terminate in May 2002.  Interest income increased $13.7 million to $17.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2001, from $3.5 million in the prior year. The increase in interest income is primarily due to the increase in residual interest income resulting from a change in the method residual interest income was calculated beginning in the second quarter of 2000. The increase in residual interest income is due to the Company refining its methodology of calculation of such interest income beginning with the three-month period ended June 30, 2000. The refined method is designed to accrete residual interest income on a level yield basis. The Company now uses an accretion rate that approximates the discount rate used to value the residual interest in securitizations, approximately 14% per annum. Prior to such period, the Company recognized residual interest income as the excess cash flows generated by the Trusts over the related obligations of the Trusts, net of any amortization of the related NIRs. This method of residual interest income recognition approximated a level yield rate of residual interest income due to the continued addition of new securitizations. Since the Company had not securitized any Contracts since December 1998, this method would not have reflected the appropriate level yield and thus was refined during the second quarter of 2000. The effect of this refinement has been offset, in part, by the contraction of the Company's servicing portfolio.  Servicing fees decreased by $5.2 million, or 32.7%, to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, from $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Servicing fees are composed of base fees, which are payable at the rate of 2% to 2.5%, per annum on the principal balance of the outstanding Contracts in the related Trusts, plus any other fees collected by the Company, such as late fees and returned check fees. The decrease in servicing fees is primarily due to the decrease in the Company's servicing portfolio. As of December 31, 2001, the servicing portfolio was $285.5 million, compared to $411.9 million as of December 31, 2000.                                         22   EXPENSES. During the year ended December 31, 2001, operating expenses decreased by $6.7 million, or 9.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. Personnel costs were effectively flat year over year, decreasing $640,000, or 2.6%, to $24.0 million in 2001 from $24.6 million in 2000. Personnel costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding warrants and stock options, and are one of the Company's most significant operating expenses, representing approximately 38.9% of total operating expenses. These costs generally fluctuate with the level of applications and Contracts processed and serviced, with the mix of revenue and with overall portfolio performance. Other material operating expenses include facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services (including personnel costs associated with information technology support), professional services, marketing and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding warrants and stock options.  General and administrative expenses decreased by $3.1 million, or 19.8%, and represented 20.5% of total operating expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the decrease in costs associated with servicing the Company's portfolio.  Interest expense decreased by $2.9 million, or 16.9%, and represented 23.2% of total operating expenses. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the reductions in non-warehouse indebtedness from the prior year. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources."  Marketing expenses increased by $399,000, or 6.5%, and represented 10.6% of total expenses. The increase is primarily due to the increase in Contracts purchased during the year ended December 31, 2001. Fees paid to marketing representatives for their role in the submission of Contracts ultimately purchased by the Company are included as a component in gain on sale of Contracts, net.  Occupancy expenses decreased by $241,000, or 7.1%, and represented 5.1% of total expenses. The decrease is primarily due to additional property taxes paid during 2000, not due in 2001. In November 1998, the Company moved its headquarters to a new 115,000 square foot facility. The Company is leasing the new headquarters facility for a ten-year term, with base rent of $1.9 million for the first five years, and $2.1 million for years six through ten. In addition to base rent, the Company pays property taxes, maintenance, and other expenses of the property.  Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $142,000, or 12.2%, and represented 1.7% of total expenses.  The results for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, include net earnings of $161,710 and $19,816, respectively, from the Company's subsidiary CPS Leasing, Inc. The increase in net earnings of CPS Leasing, Inc. is primarily attributable to the decision to cease lease receivable origination and to simply service the existing receivables, resulting in significant expense reductions.  The results for the year ended December 31, 2000, include net operating losses of $755,000 from the Company's investment in 38% of NAB Asset Corp.  The Company's effective tax rate was zero and 31.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.     THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999  REVENUE. During the year ended December 31, 2000, revenues increased $21.1 million, or 142.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 1999. Net gain on sale of Contracts increased by $31.1 million, from a $14.8 million loss on sale for the year ended December 31, 1999, to a $16.2 million gain for the year ended                                         23   December 31, 2000. The primary reason for the increase is that the prior year included sales of some $318.0 million of Contracts for less than their acquisition costs, resulting in a loss on sale of $15.2 million. Net gain on sale also increased due to an increase in the number of Contracts sold on a flow basis, and an increase in the average fee paid to the Company per Contract sold. During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company sold $600.4 million of Contracts on a flow basis compared to $241.2 million of Contracts in the year ended December 31, 1999. For the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, $1.8 million and $5.3 million, respectively, of provision for losses on Contracts held for sale was charged against gain on sale.  Interest income increased by $448,000, or 14.8%, representing 9.7% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in interest income is primarily due to the increase in residual interest income resulting from a change in the method residual interest income was calculated beginning in the second quarter of 2000. The increase in residual interest income is due to the Company refining its methodology of calculation of such interest income beginning with the three-month period ended June 30, 2000. The refined method is designed to accrete residual interest income on a level yield basis. The Company now uses an accretion rate that approximates the discount rate used to value the residual interest in securitizations, approximately 14% per annum. Prior to such period, the Company recognized residual interest income as the excess cash flows generated by the Trusts over the related obligations of the Trusts, net of any amortization of the related NIRs. This method of residual interest income recognition approximated a level yield rate of residual interest income due to the continued addition of new securitizations. Since the Company had not securitized any Contracts since December 1998, this method would not have reflected the appropriate level yield and thus was refined during the second quarter of 2000. The effect of this refinement has been offset, in part, by the contraction of the Company's servicing portfolio.  Servicing fees decreased by $11.9 million, or 42.9%, and represented 44.1% of total revenue. Servicing fees consist of base fees, which are payable at the rate of 2% to 2.5%, per annum on the principal balance of the outstanding Contracts in the related Trusts, plus any other fees collected by the Company, such as late fees and returned check fees. The decrease in servicing fees is primarily due to the decrease in the Company's servicing portfolio. As of December 31, 2000, the servicing portfolio was $411.9 million compared to $821.0 million as of December 31, 1999.  EXPENSES. During the year ended December 31, 2000, operating expenses decreased by $18.6 million, or 21.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 1999. Employee costs decreased by $5.2 million, or 17.4%, and represented 36.0% of total operating expenses. The decrease is due to the reductions of staff consistent with the decrease in the Company's servicing portfolio. The decrease was offset by an increase in employee costs of $778,000 related to the valuation of certain repriced stock options in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  General and administrative expenses decreased by $3.8 million, or 19.6%, and represented 23.1% of total operating expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the decrease in costs associated with servicing the Company's portfolio.  Interest expense decreased by $10.2 million, or 37.1%, and represented 25.2% of total operating expenses. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the reductions in warehouse and non-warehouse indebtedness from the prior year. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources."  Marketing expenses increased by $703,000 or 13.0%, and represented 9.0% of total expenses. The increase is primarily due to the increase in Contracts purchased during the year ended December 31, 2000.                                         24   Occupancy expenses increased by $615,000 or 22.0%, and represented 5.0% of total expenses. The increase is primarily due to additional property taxes paid during 2000.  Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $434,000 or 27.2%, and represented 1.7% of total expenses.  The results for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, include net losses of $19,816 and net earnings of $35,131 respectively, from the Company's subsidiary CPS Leasing, Inc.  The results for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, include net operating losses of $755,000 and $2.5 million, respectively, from the Company's investment in 38% of NAB Asset Corp.  The Company's effective tax rate was 31.7% and 38.3%, for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decline in the effective tax rate in 2000 reflects the full utilization of net operating loss carryback availability, and the recording of a $3.7 million valuation allowance on a portion of the Company's net deferred tax assets.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     LIQUIDITY  The Company's business requires substantial cash to support its purchases of Contracts and other operating activities. The Company's primary sources of cash have been cash flows from operating activities, including proceeds from sales of Contracts, amounts borrowed under various revolving lines of credit facilities (also sometimes known as warehouse lines), servicing fees on portfolios of Contracts previously sold, customer payments of principal and interest on Contracts held for sale, fees for origination of Contracts, and releases of cash from credit enhancements provided by the Company for the financial guaranty insurer (Certificate Insurer) and Investors, initially made in the form of a cash deposit to an account (Spread Account), and releases of cash from securitized pools of Contracts in which the Company has retained a residual ownership interest. The Company's primary uses of cash have been the purchases of Contracts, repayment of amounts borrowed under lines of credit and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest, and occupancy expenses, the establishment of and further contributions to "Spread Accounts" (cash posted to enhance credit of securitized pools), and income taxes. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on: the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from Spread Accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in the Company's servicing portfolio, and the terms upon which the Company is able to acquire, sell, and borrow against Contracts.  Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, was $3.7 million, $38.7 million and $(180,000), respectively.  Contracts are purchased from Dealers for a cash price approximating their principal amount, and generate cash flow over a period of years. As a result, the Company has been dependent on revolving warehouse lines of credit facilities to purchase Contracts, and on the availability of cash from outside sources in order to finance its continuing operations, as well as to fund the portion of Contract purchase prices not financed under lines of revolving credit facilities. The Company's Contract purchasing program currently comprises both (i) purchases for the Company's own account made on other than a flow basis, funded primarily by advances under a revolving warehouse credit facility, and (ii) flow purchases for immediate resale to non-affiliates. Flow purchases allow the Company to purchase Contracts with minimal demands on liquidity. The Company's revenues from the resale of flow purchase Contracts, however, are materially less than those that may be received by holding Contracts to maturity                                         25   or by selling Contracts in securitization transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company purchased $537.9 million of Contracts on a flow basis, and $134.4 million on an other than flow basis for its own account, compared to $600.4 million and $31.1 million, respectively, of Contracts purchased in 2000. For the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company purchased $424.7 million of Contracts on a flow basis and $241.2 million on an other than flow basis. The Company expects the flow purchase program will terminate in May 2002.  During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company purchased Contracts to be held for sale into a securitization, which it had not done in the previous two years. Funding for the other than flow basis purchases was available from the Company's $75 million revolving note purchase facility, established in November 2000. Since November 2000, the Company has been able to purchase Contracts for its own account using proceeds from that facility. Approximately 75% of the principal balance of Contracts may be advanced to the Company under that facility, subject to a collateral test and certain other conditions and covenants. Notes issued under this facility bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus 0.60% per annum. The note purchase facility was modified during March 2001, with the effect that sales of Contracts to the facility-related special purpose subsidiary are treated as an ongoing securitization. The Company, therefore, removes the securitized Contracts and related debt from its consolidated balance sheet and recognizes a gain on sale in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Such purchases of Contracts made on other than a flow basis require that the Company fund the portion of Contract purchase prices beyond what the related special purpose subsidiary was able to borrow in the continuous securitization structure, which in the aggregate required cash of approximately $32.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2001. The Company securitized $141.7 million of Contracts during the year ending December 31, 2001, resulting in a gain on sale of $9.2 million.  On September 7, 2001, the Company completed a $68.5 million term securitization. In a private placement, qualified institutional buyers purchased notes backed by automotive receivables. The Notes, issued by CPS Auto Receivables Trust 2001-A, consist of two classes: $44.5 million of 4.37% Class A-1 Notes, and $24.0 million of 5.28% Class A-2 Notes. Substantially all of the proceeds from the September 2001 transaction were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the Company's revolving note purchase facility.  The Company also purchases Contracts on a flow basis, which, as compared with purchases of Contracts for the Company's own account, involves a materially reduced demand on the Company's cash. The Company's plan for meeting its liquidity needs is to match its levels of Contract purchases to its availability of cash.  Cash used for subsequent deposits to Spread Accounts for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, was $24.6 million, $15.0 million and $23.1 million, respectively. Cash released from Spread Accounts to the Company for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, was $43.7 million, $80.6 and $28.0 million, respectively. Changes in deposits to and releases from Spread Accounts are affected by the relative size, seasoning and performance of the various pools of Contracts sold that make up the Company's servicing portfolio to which the respective Spread Accounts are related. As a result of the September term securitization transaction the Company made an initial deposit to the related Spread Account of $2.5 million. No such initial deposits were made in 2000 or 1999, as there were no securitizations during those years.  From June 1998 to November 1999, the Company's liquidity was adversely affected by the absence of releases from Spread Accounts. Such releases did not occur because a number of the Trusts had incurred cumulative net losses as a percentage of the original Contract balance or average delinquency ratios in excess of the predetermined levels specified in the respective agreements governing the securitizations. Accordingly, pursuant to the Securitization                                         26   Agreements, the specified levels applicable to the Company's Spread Accounts were increased, in most cases to an unlimited amount. Due to cross collateralization provisions of the Securitization Agreements, the specified levels were increased on the majority of the Company's Trusts. Increased specified levels for the Spread Accounts have been in effect from time to time in the past. As a result of the increased Spread Account specified levels and cross collateralization provisions, excess cash flows that would otherwise have been released to the Company instead were retained in the Spread Accounts to bring the balance of those Spread Accounts up to higher levels. In addition to requiring higher Spread Account levels, the Securitization Agreements provide the Certificate Insurer with certain other rights and remedies, some of which have been waived on a recurring basis by the Certificate Insurer with respect to all of the Trusts. Until the November 1999 effectiveness of an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Securitization Agreements, no material releases from any of the Spread Accounts were available to the Company. Upon effectiveness of the Amendment, the requisite Spread Account levels in general have been set at 21% of the outstanding principal balance of the asset-backed securities ("Certificates") issued by the related Trusts, which were established in 1998 or prior. The 21% level is subject to adjustment to reflect over collateralization. Older Trusts may require more than 21% of credit enhancement if the Certificate balance has amortized to such a level that "floor" or minimum levels of credit enhancement are applicable. In the event of certain defaults by the Company, the specified level applicable to such credit enhancement could increase from 21% to an unlimited amount, but such defaults are narrowly defined, and the Company does not anticipate suffering such defaults. The Amendment has been effective since November 1999, and the Company has received releases of cash from the securitized portfolio on a monthly basis thereafter. The releases of cash are expected to continue and to vary in amount from month to month. There can be no assurance that such releases of cash will continue in the future.  As of December 31, 2001, four of the Company's nine remaining securitized pools had incurred cumulative losses exceeding certain predetermined levels, which, in turn, has given the Certificate Insurer the option to terminate the Servicing Agreements with respect to all of the pools. The Certificate Insurer has held that option at all times from 1999 to the present, and has consistently waived its right to terminate the Servicing Agreements. Were the Certificate Insurer in the future to exercise its option to terminate the Servicing Agreements, such a termination would have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and results of operations. Subsequent to December 31, 2001, the Company exercised its optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the Servicing Agreements on three of the four pools mentioned above. The Company continues to receive servicer extensions on a quarterly basis, and has recently received an extension through the second quarter of 2002. The Company believes that the Certificate Insurer will continue to waive its right to terminate the Servicing Agreements because (i) there is no reason to expect that any replacement servicer would improve the performance of the pools and (ii) there are material costs and transition risks inherent in a transfer of servicing.  The Company's ability to adjust the quantity of Contracts that it purchases and sells will be subject to general competitive conditions and the continued availability of the revolving note purchase facility. There can be no assurance that the desired level of Contract acquisition can be maintained or increased. Obtaining releases of cash from the Spread Accounts is dependent on collections from the related Trusts generating sufficient cash to maintain the Spread Accounts in excess of the amended specified levels. There can be no assurance that collections from the related Trusts will generate cash in excess of the amended specified levels.  The acquisition of Contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions, and the need to fund Spread Accounts when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the Company's Contract purchases (other than flow purchases), the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established Spread Accounts either release cash to the Company or capture cash from collections on sold Contracts.                                         27   The Company is currently limited in its ability to purchase contracts due to certain liquidity constraints. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had cash on hand of $2.6 million and available Contract purchase commitments from the revolving note purchase facility of $36.4 million. The Company's plans to manage the need for liquidity include the completion of additional term securitizations that would provide additional credit availability from the note purchase facility. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete the term securitizations on favorable economic terms or that the Company will be able to complete term securitizations at all. If the Company is unable to complete such securitizations, servicing fees and other portfolio related income would continue to decrease.     CREDIT FACILITIES  The terms on which credit has been available to the Company for purchase of Contracts have varied over the three-year period ended December 31, 2001, as shown in the following recapitulation:  In November 1998, the Company entered into a warehouse line of credit agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation (the "GECC Line"). The GECC Line provided for warehouse facility advances up to a maximum of $100.0 million at a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.75% The GECC Line by its terms was to expire November 30, 1999. During 1999, the Company defaulted on the GECC Line agreements and was required to repay all balances owed. During August 1999, all amounts owed under the GECC Line were repaid and the agreement was terminated.  In November 1997, the Company entered into a warehouse line of credit agreement with First Union Capital Markets ("First Union Line"). The First Union Line provided for a maximum of $150.0 million of advances to the Company, with interest at a variable rate indexed to prevailing commercial paper rates. In July 1998, the advance amount was increased to $200.0 million. In conjunction with the increase in maximum advance amount under the agreement, the expiration date was changed to July 31, 1999, renewable for one year with the mutual consent of the Company and First Union Capital Markets. During 1999, the Company defaulted on the First Union Line agreement and was required to repay the balance outstanding in its entirety. In June 1999, the balance of the First Union Line was repaid in its entirety and the related agreement was terminated.  In December 1996, the Company entered into an overdraft financing facility, with a bank, that provided for maximum borrowings of $2.0 million. Interest was charged on the outstanding balance at the bank's reference rate plus 1.75%. During 1997, the overdraft facility was increased to $4.0 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 1998. During 1999, the Company defaulted under the overdraft facility and was required to repay the outstanding balance in its entirety. In November 1999, the remaining balance outstanding under the overdraft facility was repaid in its entirety and the related agreement was terminated.  In November 2000, the Company entered into a revolving note purchase facility under which up to $75 million of notes may be outstanding at any time subject to a collateral test and other conditions. The Company uses funds derived from this facility to purchase Contracts, which are pledged to secure the notes. The collateral test generally allows the Company to borrow up to approximately 75% of the price paid for such Contracts. Notes issued under this facility bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus 0.60% per annum. The balance of notes outstanding at December 31, 2001, was $38.6 million.  Additionally, in March 2002, the Company entered in to a second revolving note purchase facility, under which up to $100.0 million of notes may be outstanding at any time, subject to a collateral test and other conditions. The Company uses funds derived from this facility to purchase Contracts, which are pledged to secure the notes. The collateral test generally allows the Company to borrow up to approximately 75% of the price paid for such Contracts. Notes issued under this facility bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus 1.18% per annum.                                         28      CAPITAL RESOURCES  Prior to 1999, and again in 2001, the Company has funded increases in its servicing portfolio through off balance sheet securitization transactions, as discussed above, and funded its other capital needs with cash from operations and with the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and/or equity.  The acquisition of Contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions, and the need to fund Spread Accounts when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the Company's Contract purchases (other than purchases made on a flow basis), the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the Spread Accounts either release cash to the Company or capture cash from collections on sold Contracts. The Company plans to adjust its levels of Contract purchases so as to match anticipated releases of cash from Spread Accounts with its capital requirements.     CAPITALIZATION  Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2001, the Company has managed its capitalization by issuing and restructuring debt and issuing/purchasing common stock and equivalents, as summarized in the following table:                                                                    FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                                              ---------------------------------------                                                                 2001          2000          1999                                                              -----------   -----------   -----------                                                                          (IN THOUSANDS)        Senior secured debt: Beginning balance.........................................    $  38,000    $   23,161    $   33,000   Issuances...............................................           --        16,000            --   Payments................................................

The following review of the terms of such issuances of debt and equity shows that the Company's cost of capital increased materially in 1999, and then decreased somewhat in 2000. There were no material issuances in 2001.  In April 1998, the Company borrowed $33.0 million as a senior secured loan, which commenced amortization in May 1999. This loan bore interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 4.0%. CPS borrowed $5.0 million from related parties in August and September 1998, the terms of which were renegotiated in November 1998, in connection with the issuance of $25.0 million of subordinated notes to Levine Leichtman Capital Partners II, L.P. ("LLCP"). The $25.0 million of subordinated notes issued in November 1998 accrued interest at 13.50% per annum, are due November 2003, and were issued together with warrants that allowed the investor to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,450,000 shares of the Company's common stock at $3.00 per share. As renegotiated, the $5.0 million of related party loans are subordinated both to the Company's general and secured creditors and also to the LLCP subordinated notes, accrue interest at 12.50% per annum, are due June 2004, and are convertible into an aggregate of 1,666,667 shares of the Company's common stock at $3.00 per share. A related party also purchased $5.0 million of Company's common stock in July 1998, at $11.275 per share.  The cost of capital increased further in 1999. To meet a portion of its capital requirements, the Company on April 15, 1999, issued $5.0 million in subordinated notes to LLCP (the "New LLCP Notes"). The notes bear interest at 14.5% per annum and include warrants to purchase 1,335,000 shares of the Company's common stock at $0.01 per share. As part of the agreement to issue the New LLCP Notes, the Company was required to restructure the terms of the $25.0 million subordinated promissory notes discussed above. Such restructuring included an increase in the interest rate from 13.5% to 14.5%, a reduction in the number of warrants issued to purchase the Company's common stock from 3,450,000 to 3,115,000, a waiver by LLCP of certain defaults under the notes sold to LLCP in November 1998, and a reduction in the exercise price of the warrants from $3.00 per share to $0.01 per share. Among the agreements entered into in connection with the issuance of the New LLCP Notes were agreements by Stanwich Financial Services Corp. ("SFSC"), an affiliate of the then Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors, to purchase an additional $15.0 million of notes and of the Company to sell such notes. The terms of such notes were to be not less favorable to the Company then (i) those that would be available in a transaction with a non-affiliate, and (ii) those applicable to the New LLCP Notes.  In August and September 1999, the Company issued $1.5 million of such notes, bearing interest at 14.5% per annum, to SFSC. As part of that transaction, the Company also agreed to issue to SFSC warrants to purchase up to 207,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $0.01 per share.  In March 2000, the Company and LLCP restructured the outstanding indebtedness of the Company in favor of LLCP, which had been in default. In the restructuring (i) all existing defaults were waived or cured, (ii) LLCP lent an additional $16 million ("Tranche A") to the Company, (iii) the proceeds of that loan (net of fees and expenses) were used to repay all of the Company's outstanding senior secured indebtedness, (iv) the outstanding $30 million of subordinated indebtedness in favor of LLCP was exchanged for senior indebtedness ("Tranche B"), (v) the Company granted a blanket security interest in favor of LLCP, to secure both Tranche A and Tranche B, and (vi) LLCP released SFSC and its affiliates (including Mr. Bradley, Sr., Mr. Bradley, Jr., and Mr. Poole, directors of the Company) of any liability for failure to invest $15 million in the Company. Tranche A has been repaid in accordance with its terms; Tranche B                                         30   is due November 2003, and bears interest at 14.50% per annum. In each case the interest rate is subject to increase by 2.0% in the event of a default by the Company. In the restructuring, the Company paid a fee of $325,000, paid accrued default interest of $300,000, issued 103,500 shares of common stock to LLCP, and paid out-of-pocket expenses of approximately $214,000. The shares of common stock issued were valued at approximately $155,000, which is included in deferred interest expense to be amortized over the remaining life of the related debt. The terms of the transaction were determined by negotiation between the Company and LLCP. Also in March 2000, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the issuance of 103,500 shares of the Company's common stock to SFSC in conjunction with the $1.5 million of promissory note issued by the Company to SFSC in August and September 1999. The shares of common stock issued were valued at approximately $155,000, which is included in deferred interest expense to be amortized over the remaining life of the related debt.  The Company must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that the Company maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. The Company is in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of December 31, 2001. Such covenants relate primarily to financial reporting requirements, restricted payments and the Company's debt coverage ratio as defined in the various debt agreements.  During the first quarter of 2001, the Company purchased a total of $8,000,000 of outstanding indebtedness held by LLCP and SFSC. The Company purchased and retired $4,000,000 of subordinated debt held by SFSC in exchange for payment of $3,920,000, and purchased and retired $4,000,000 of senior secured debt held by LLCP in exchange for payment of $4,200,000. The LLCP debt by its terms called for a prepayment penalty of 3% (or $120,000); the additional 2% (or $80,000) paid in connection with its February 2001 prepayment was absorbed by SFSC.  LLCP holds approximately 23.6% of the Company's outstanding common shares. SFSC is an affiliate of the Company's former Chairman, Charles E. Bradley, Sr., and SFSC and Mr. Bradley, Sr. together hold approximately 14.4% of the Company's outstanding common shares.  In July 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $5,000,000 of outstanding debt and equity securities of the Company, inclusive of the mandatory annual purchase or redemption of $1,000,000 of the Company's outstanding "RISRS" subordinated debt securities, due 2006. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had purchased $2.0 million in principal amount of the RISRS, and $2.6 million of its common stock, representing 1,583,911 shares.     FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  The descriptions of the Company's business and activities set forth in this report and in other past and future reports and announcements by the Company may contain forward-looking statements and assumptions regarding the future activities and results of operations of the Company. Actual results may be adversely affected by various factors including the following: increases in unemployment or other changes in domestic economic conditions which adversely affect the sales of new and used automobiles and may result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures and losses on Contracts; adverse economic conditions in geographic areas in which the Company's business is concentrated; changes in interest rates, adverse changes in the market for securitized receivables pools, or a substantial lengthening of the Company's warehousing period, each of which could restrict the Company's ability to obtain cash for new Contract                                         31   originations and purchases; increases in the amounts required to be set aside in Spread Accounts or to be expended for other forms of credit enhancement to support future securitizations; the reduction or unavailability of warehouse lines of credit which the Company uses to accumulate Contracts for securitization transactions; increased competition from other automobile finance sources; reduction in the number and amount of acceptable Contracts submitted to the Company by its automobile Dealer network; changes in government regulations affecting consumer credit; and other economic, financial and regulatory factors beyond the Company's control.     CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The Company believes that its accounting policies related to (a) Residual Interest in Securitizations and Gain on Sale of Contracts and (b) Income Taxes could be considered critical. Such policies are described below.  (a) Residual Interest in Securitizations and Gain on Sale of Contracts  Gain on sale may be recognized on the disposition of Contracts either outright (as in the Company's flow purchase program) or in securitization transactions. In its securitization transactions, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company retains a residual interest in the Contracts that are sold.  The residual interest in term securitizations and the residual interest in the Contracts sold continuously are reflected in the line item "residual interest in securitizations" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.  The Company's securitization structure has generally been as follows:  First, the Company sells a portfolio of Contracts to a wholly owned SPS, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the Company's Contracts. The SPS then transfers the same Contracts to either a grantor Trust or an owner Trust. The Trust is a qualifying special purpose entity and is therefore not consolidated in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Trust in turn issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities (the "Certificates"), generally in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal balance of the Contracts. The Company typically sells these Contracts to the Trust at face value and without recourse, except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the Dealer to the Company are provided by the Company to the Trust. One or more investors purchase the Certificates issued by the Trust; the proceeds from the sale of the Certificates are then used to purchase the Contracts from the Company. The Company may retain subordinated Certificates issued by the Trust. The Company purchases a financial guaranty insurance policy, guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest on the senior Certificates, from an insurance company (the "Certificate Insurer"). In addition, the Company provides a credit enhancement for the benefit of the Certificate Insurer and the investors in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account ("Spread Account") held by the Trust or in the form of subordinated Certificates. The agreements governing the securitization transactions (collectively referred to as the "Securitization Agreements") require that the initial deposits to the Spread Accounts be supplemented by a portion of collections from the Contracts until the Spread Accounts reach specified levels, and then maintained at those levels. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related Certificates. The specified levels at which the Spread Accounts are to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of Contracts held by the Trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among the Company, the SPS, the Certificate Insurer and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the portfolios, and have also been varied by Securitization Agreement. The Securitization Agreements generally grant the Company the option to repurchase the sold Contracts from the Trust when the aggregate outstanding balance has amortized to 10% or less of the initial aggregate balance.                                         32   The revolving note purchase facility continuous securitization structure is similar to the above, except that (i) the SPS that purchases the Contracts pledges the Contracts to secure promissory notes issued directly by the SPS, (ii) the initial purchaser of such notes has the right, but not the obligation, to require that the Company repurchase the Contracts, (iii) the promissory notes are in an aggregate principal amount of not more than 75% of the aggregate principal balance of the Contracts, and (iv) no Spread Account is involved. The SPS is a qualifying special purpose entity and is therefore not consolidated in the Company's consolidated financial statements.  At the closing of each securitization, whether a term securitization or the revolving note purchase facility continuous securitization, the Company removes from its consolidated balance sheet the Contracts held for sale and adds to its consolidated balance sheet (i) the cash received and (ii) the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that the Company retains in Contracts sold in securitization. That retained interest (the "Residual") consists of (a) the cash held in the Spread Account, if any, (b) subordinated Certificates retained, and (c) receivables from Trust, which include the net interest receivables ("NIRs"). NIRs represent the estimated discounted cash flows to be received from the Trust in the future, net of principal and interest payable with respect to the Certificates, and certain expenses. The excess of the cash received and the assets retained by the Company over the carrying value of the Contracts sold, less transaction costs, equals the net gain on sale of Contracts recorded by the Company.  The Company allocates its basis in the Contracts between the Certificates and the Residuals sold and retained based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of the sale. The Company recognizes gains or losses attributable to the change in the fair value of the Residuals, which are recorded at estimated fair value. The Company is not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of interests such as the Residuals; accordingly, the Company determines the estimated fair value of the Residuals by discounting the amount and timing of anticipated cash flows released from the Spread Account (the cash out method), using a discount rate that the Company believes is appropriate for the risks involved and estimating the value of the Company's optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the Servicing Agreements. The Company estimates the value of its optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the Servicing Agreements primarily based on its estimate of the amount and timing of anticipated cash flows released from existing receivables then outstanding and previously charged off receivables repurchased using a discount rate that the Company believes is appropriate for the risks involved. The Company has used an effective discount rate of approximately 14% per annum.  The Company receives periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the Contracts. In addition, the Company is entitled to the cash flows from the Residuals that represent collections on the Contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the Certificates, the base servicing fees, and certain other fees (such as trustee and custodial fees). At the end of each collection period, the aggregate cash collections from the Contracts are allocated first to the base servicing fees and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees for the period, then to the Certificateholders for interest at the pass-through rate on the Certificates plus principal as defined in the Securitization Agreements. If the amount of cash required for the above allocations exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is drawn from the Spread Account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations, and there is no shortfall in the related Spread Account, the excess is released to the Company or in certain cases is transferred to other Spread Accounts that may be below their required levels. Pursuant to certain Securitization Agreements, excess cash collected during the period is used to make accelerated principal paydowns on certain Certificates to create excess collateral (over-collateralization or OC account). If the Spread Account balance is not at the required credit enhancement level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the Spread Account until the specified level is achieved. The cash in the Spread Accounts is restricted from use by the Company. Cash held in the various Spread Accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the Securitization Agreements. Spread Account balances are held by the Trusts on behalf of the Company's SPS as the owner of the Residuals.                                         33   The annual percentage rate payable on the Contracts is significantly greater than the pass-through rate on the Certificates. Accordingly, the Residuals described above are a significant asset of the Company. In determining the value of the Residuals described above, the Company must estimate the future rates of prepayments, delinquencies, defaults and default loss severity, and the value of the Company's optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the Servicing Agreements as they affect the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows. The Company estimates prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable Contracts. The Company has used prepayment estimates of approximately 22% to 27% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts. The Company estimates defaults and default loss severity using available historical loss data for comparable Contracts and the specific characteristics of the Contracts purchased by the Company. The Company estimates recovery rates of previously charged off receivables using available historical recovery data and projected future recovery levels. In valuing the Residuals, the Company estimates that gross losses as a percentage of the original principal balance will approximate16% to 22% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts, with recovery rates approximating 4% to 6%.  In future periods, the Company will recognize additional revenue from the Residuals if the actual performance of the Contracts is better than the original estimate, or the Company would increase the estimated fair value of the Residuals. If the actual performance of the Contracts were worse than the original estimate, then a downward adjustment to the carrying value of the Residuals would be required. The authoritative accounting standard setting bodies are currently deliberating the consolidation of non-qualifying special purpose entities and the accounting treatment for various off-balance sheet financing transactions. The effect of such deliberations may require the Company to treat its securitizations differently. However, the outcome of such deliberations is currently unknown.  The Certificateholders and the related securitization Trusts have no recourse to the Company for failure of the Contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis. The Company's Residuals, however, are subordinate to the Certificates until the Certificateholders are fully paid.  Of the key economic assumptions used in measuring all retained interests remaining as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the discount rate remained constant. The range of net credit losses used in measuring all retained interests as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 were as follows:                                                                             2001            2000                                                                      --------------   --------------      Actual and projected prepayment speed...........................        22% - 27%           20% Actual and projected credit losses..............................      12.0% - 17.5%    14.0% - 17.0%   Key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate 10 percent and 20 percent adverse changes in those assumptions are as follows:                                                                                  DECEMBER 31, 2001                                                                                -----------------                                                                                  (DOLLARS IN                                                                                   THOUSANDS)    Carrying amount/fair value of residual interest in securitizations...........     $ 106,103 Weighted average life in years...............................................         1.0  Prepayment Speed Assumption (Cumulative).....................................     22% - 27% Estimated fair value assuming 10% adverse change.............................     $ 105,785 Estimated fair value assuming 20% adverse change.............................       105,462  Expected Credit Losses (Cumulative)..........................................     12.0% -17.5% Estimated fair value assuming 10% adverse change.............................     $ 104,545 Estimated fair value assuming 20% adverse change.............................       103,396  Residual Cash Flows Discount Rate (Annual)...................................         14.0% Estimated fair value assuming 10% adverse change.............................     $  94,746 Estimated fair value assuming 20% adverse change.............................        93,520                                          34   These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on 10 percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption; in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses), which could magnify or counteract the sensitivities.  (b) Income Taxes  The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated Federal income and combined state franchise tax returns. The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company has estimated a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax asset whose utilization in future periods is not more than likely.  In determining the possible realization of deferred tax assets, future taxable income from the following sources are considered: (a) the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (b) future operations exclusive of reversing temporary differences, and (c) tax planning strategies that, if necessary, would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into periods in which bet operating losses might otherwise expire.     NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  The Company will adopt in future periods new accounting pronouncements. For information on how adoption has affected and will affect the Financial Statements, see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements.  ITEM 7a. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  INTEREST RATE RISK  Although the Company utilized its revolving note purchase facility and completed a term securitization during the year ended December 31, 2001, the structures did not lend themselves to some of the strategies the Company has used in the past to minimize interest rate risk, as described below. Specifically, the rate on the Certificates issued by the revolving note purchase facility is adjustable and there is no pre-funding component to the revolving note purchase facility or term securitization. The Company does intend to issue fixed rate Certificates and to include pre-funding structures for future term securitization                                         35   transactions, whereby the amount of asset-backed securities issued exceeds the amount of Contracts initially sold to the Trusts. In pre-funding, the proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until the Company sells the additional Contracts to the Trust in amounts up to the balance of the pre-funded escrow account. In pre-funded securitizations, the Company locks in the borrowing costs with respect to the Contracts it subsequently delivers to the Trust. However, the Company incurs an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of Contracts and the interest rate paid on the asset-backed securities outstanding, the amount as to which there can be no assurance. In addition, the Contracts the Company does purchase and securitize have fixed rates of interest, whereas the Company's interest expense related to the current note purchase facility is based on a variable rate. Historically, the Company's term securitization facilities had fixed rates of interest. Therefore, some of the strategies the Company has used in the past to minimize interest rate risk do not currently apply.  The Company is subject to market risks due to fluctuations in interest rates primarily through its outstanding indebtedness and to a lesser extent its outstanding interest earning assets, and commitments to enter into new Contracts. The table below outlines the carrying values and estimated fair values of such indebtedness:                                                                                  DECEMBER 31,                                                                -------------------------------------------                                                                         2001                   2000                                                                --------------------   --------------------                                                                 CARRYING     FAIR      CARRYING     FAIR         FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT                                      VALUE      VALUE       VALUE      VALUE         --------------------                                   ---------  ---------   ---------  ---------                                                                               (IN THOUSANDS)                  Warehouse lines of credit..........................    $      --  $      --   $   2,003  $   2,003         Notes payable......................................        1,590      1,590       2,414      2,414         Senior secured debt................................       26,000     26,000      38,000     38,000         Subordinated debt..................................       36,989     24,791      37,699     27,709         Related party debt.................................       17,500     11,974      21,500     15,803   Much of the information used to determine fair value is highly subjective. When applicable, readily available market information has been utilized. However, for a significant portion of the Company's financial instruments, active markets do not exist. Therefore, considerable judgments were required in estimating fair value for certain items. The subjective factors include, among other things, the estimated timing and amount of cash flows, risk characteristics, credit quality and interest rates, all of which are subject to change. Since the fair value is estimated and do not reflect amounts of which amounts outstanding could be settled by the Company, the amounts that will actually be realized or paid at settlement or maturity of the instruments could be significantly different.
