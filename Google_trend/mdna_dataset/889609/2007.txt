ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS          OF OPERATIONS           The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or incorporated by reference herein.  OVERVIEW           We are a specialty finance company engaged in purchasing and servicing new and used retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealerships and to a lesser extent by select independent dealers of used automobiles in the United States. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to sub-prime customers, who have limited credit history, low income or past credit problems and who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources. We are headquartered in Irvine, California and have three additional servicing branches in Virginia, Florida and Illinois.           On March 8, 2002, we acquired MFN Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries in a merger. On May 20, 2003, we acquired TFC Enterprises, Inc. and its subsidiaries in a second merger. Each merger was accounted for as a purchase. MFN Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries and TFC Enterprises, Inc. and its subsidiaries were engaged in businesses similar to ours: buying automobile contracts from dealers and servicing those automobile contracts. MFN Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries ceased acquiring automobile contracts in May 2002; TFC continues to acquire automobile contracts under its "TFC Programs," which provide financing exclusively for vehicle purchases by members of the United States Armed Forces.           On April 2, 2004, we purchased a portfolio of automobile contracts and certain other assets from SeaWest Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries. In addition, we were named the successor servicer of three term securitization transactions originally sponsored by SeaWest. We do not offer financing programs similar to those previously offered by SeaWest.           From inception through June 2003, we generated revenue primarily from the gains recognized on the sale or securitization of automobile contracts, servicing fees earned on automobile contracts sold, interest earned on residuals interests retained in securitizations, and interest earned on finance receivables. Since July 2003, we have not recognized any gains from the sale of automobile contracts. Instead, since July 2003 our revenues have been derived from interest on finance receivables and, to a lesser extent, servicing fees and interest earned on residual interests in securitizations.  SECURITIZATION AND WAREHOUSE CREDIT FACILITIES  GENERALLY           Throughout the periods for which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through our warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to fund the transactions. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings.           When structured to be treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically: (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction, and (iii) record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts.           When structured to be treated as a sale for accounting purposes, the assets and liabilities of the special-purpose subsidiary are not consolidated with us. Accordingly, the transaction removes the sold automobile contracts from our consolidated balance sheet, the related debt does not appear as our debt, and our consolidated balance sheet shows, as an asset, a retained residual interest in the sold automobile contracts. The residual interest represents the discounted value of what we expect will be the excess of future collections on the automobile contracts over principal and interest due on the asset-backed securities. That residual interest appears on our consolidated balance sheet as "residual interest in securitizations," and the determination of its value is dependent on our estimates of the future performance of the sold automobile contracts.                                         25   CHANGE IN POLICY           Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, we began to structure our securitization transactions so that they would be treated for financial accounting purposes as secured financings, rather than as sales. All subsequent securitizations of automobile contracts have been so structured. Prior to the third quarter of 2003, we had structured our securitization transactions to be treated as sales of automobile contracts for financial accounting purposes. In our acquisitions of MFN and TFC, we acquired automobile contracts that these companies had previously securitized in securitization transactions that were treated as secured financings for financial accounting purposes. As of December 31, 2006, our consolidated balance sheet included net finance receivables of $1.9 million related to automobile contracts acquired in the two mergers, out of totals of net finance receivables of $1,401.4 million.  CREDIT RISK RETAINED           Whether a sale of automobile contracts in connection with a securitization or warehouse credit facility is treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes, the related special-purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the related automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of such automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and our results of operations, regardless of whether such automobile contracts are treated for financial accounting purposes as having been sold or as having been financed. For estimation of the magnitude of such risk, it may be appropriate to look to the size of our "managed portfolio," which represents both financed and sold automobile contracts as to which such credit risk is retained. Our managed portfolio as of December 31, 2006 was approximately $1,565.9 million (this amount includes $3.8 million of automobile contracts securitized by SeaWest, on which we earn only servicing fees and have no credit risk).  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES           We believe that our accounting policies related to (a) Allowance for Finance Credit Losses, (b) Residual Interest in Securitizations and Gain on Sale of Automobile Contracts and (c) Income Taxes are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Such policies are described below.  ALLOWANCE FOR FINANCE CREDIT LOSSES           In order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses to be incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as "static pooling," which stratifies our finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on the period of origination. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of automobile contracts. Provision for losses is charged to our consolidated statement of operations. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, prospective liquidation values of the underlying collateral and general economic and market conditions. As circumstances change, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change as well.  RESIDUAL INTEREST IN SECURITIZATIONS AND GAIN ON SALE OF AUTOMOBILE CONTRACTS           In transactions prior to the third quarter of 2003, we recognized gain on sale on the disposition of automobile contracts either outright, in securitization transactions, and in certain of our warehouse credit facilities. In those securitization transactions and in the warehousing transactions that were treated as sales for financial accounting purposes, we, or one of our wholly-owned, consolidated subsidiaries, retain a residual interest in the automobile contracts that were sold to a wholly-owned, unconsolidated special purpose subsidiary.           The line item "residual interest in securitizations" on our consolidated balance sheet represents the residual interests in securitizations completed prior to the third quarter of 2003. This line represents the discounted sum of expected future cash flows from these securitization trusts. Accordingly, the valuation of the residual interest is heavily dependent on estimates of future performance of the automobile contracts included in the securitizations.           We structured all subsequent securitizations and warehouse credit facilities as secured financings. The warehouse credit facilities are accordingly reflected in the line items "Finance receivables" and "Warehouse lines of credit" on our consolidated balance sheet, and the securitizations are reflected in the line items "Finance receivables" and "Securitization trust debt."                                         26            The key economic assumptions used in measuring all residual interests as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 are included in the table below. We have used an effective pre-tax discount rate of 14% per annum except for certain collections from charged off receivables related to our securitizations executed from 2001 through the second quarter of 2003. With respect to collections from such charged off receivables, we have used a discount rate of 25% per annum.                                                12/31/2006       12/31/2005 - ----------------------------------------    --------------   -------------- Prepayment Speed (Cumulative)...........     22.7% - 32.5%    22.2% - 35.8% Net Credit Losses (Cumulative)..........     11.8% - 15.4%    11.9% - 20.2%           Key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of residual cash flows to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those assumptions as of December 2006 are as follows:                                                                                  DECEMBER 31,                                                                          ---------------------                                                                                  2006                                                                          (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)    Carrying amount/fair value of residual interest in securitizations...    $          13,795 Weighted average life in years.......................................                1.49  Prepayment Speed Assumption (Cumulative).............................           22.7% - 32.5% Estimated Fair value assuming 10% adverse change.....................    $          13,774 Estimated Fair value assuming 20% adverse change.....................               13,754  Expected Net Credit Losses (Cumulative)..............................           11.8% - 15.4% Estimated Fair value assuming 10% adverse change.....................    $          13,661 Estimated Fair value assuming 20% adverse change.....................               13,539  Residual Cash Flows Discount Rate (Annual)...........................           14.0% - 25.0% Estimated Fair value assuming 10% adverse change.....................    $          13,648 Estimated Fair value assuming 20% adverse change.....................               13,505            These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on 10% and 20% variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption; in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses), which could magnify or counteract the sensitivities.           Our residual interest is attributable to receivables originated and securitized prior to the third quarter of 2003. Consequently, these receivables are nearing the end of their contractual terms and, we believe, have already incurred a substantial portion of the losses that they will likely incur in total. Moreover, the terms of the securitizations provide us the option to repurchase the underlying receivables from the trust and retire the related bonds. Such repurchases are referred to as "clean-ups". When a clean-up takes place, we purchase the underlying receivables and record them on our balance sheet and remove that portion of the residual interest that is attributable to the trust that is terminated when the related bonds are retired. We often conduct such clean-ups as the terms of the securitizations permit including two each in 2005 and 2006, and one since December 31, 2006. A portion of our residual interest represents future cash flows from recoveries on charges offs from clean-up securitizations and will remain on our balance sheet for some time even after the clean-up of the final transaction until those particular cash flows are realized.           Our term securitization structure has generally been as follows:           We sell automobile contracts we acquire to a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling our automobile contracts. The special-purpose subsidiary then transfers the same automobile contracts to another entity, typically a statutory trust. The trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities, in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal balance of the automobile contracts. We typically sell these automobile contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse, except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to us are provided by us to the trust. One or more investors purchase the asset-backed securities issued by the trust; the proceeds from the sale of the asset-backed securities are then used to purchase the automobile contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated                                          27   asset-backed securities issued by the trust or by a related entity. We purchase external credit enhancement in the form of a financial guaranty insurance policy, guaranteeing timely payment of interest and ultimate payment of principal on the senior asset-backed securities, from an insurance company. In addition, we structure our securitizations to include internal credit enhancement for the benefit of the insurance company and the investors (i) in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account ("spread account") held by the trust, (ii) in the form of overcollateralization of the senior asset-backed securities, where the principal balance of the senior asset-backed securities issued is less than the principal balance of the automobile contracts, (iii) in the form of subordinated asset-backed securities, or (iv) some combination of such internal credit enhancements. The agreements governing the securitization transactions require that the initial level of internal credit enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the automobile contracts until the level of internal credit enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related automobile contracts. The specified levels at which the internal credit enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of automobile contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among us, our special purpose subsidiary, the insurance company and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied from one transaction to another. The agreements governing the securitizations generally grant us the option to repurchase the sold automobile contracts from the trust when the aggregate outstanding balance of the automobile contracts has amortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance.           The prior securitizations that were treated as sales for financial accounting purposes differ from those treated as secured financings in that the trust to which our special-purpose subsidiaries sold the automobile contracts met the definition of a "qualified special-purpose entity" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 ("SFAS 140"). As a result, assets and liabilities of those trusts are not consolidated into our consolidated balance sheet.           Our warehouse credit facility structures are similar to the above, except that (i) our special-purpose subsidiaries that purchase the automobile contracts pledge the automobile contracts to secure promissory notes that they issue, (ii) no increase in the required amount of internal credit enhancement is contemplated, and (iii) we do not purchase financial guaranty insurance. During 2006 the maximum advance under our warehouse lines increased from 80% to 83% of the aggregate principal balance of eligible automobile contracts. In January 2007, one of our warehouse lines was further amended to provide for an advance of up to 93% of the aggregate principal balance of eligible automobile contracts. The other warehouse line was similarly amended in February 2007.           Upon each sale of automobile contracts in a transaction structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes, whether a term securitization or a warehouse financing, we retain on our consolidated balance sheet the related automobile contracts as assets and record the asset-backed notes issued in the transaction as indebtedness.           Under the prior securitizations and warehouse credit facilities structured as sales for financial accounting purposes, we removed from our consolidated balance sheet the automobile contracts sold and added to our consolidated balance sheet (i) the cash received, if any, and (ii) the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that we retained in the automobile contracts sold in the transaction. That retained or residual interest consisted of (a) the cash held in the spread account, if any, (b) overcollateralization, if any, (c) subordinated asset-backed securities retained, if any, and (d) receivables from the trust, which include the net interest receivables. Net interest receivables represent the estimated discounted cash flows to be received from the trust in the future, net of principal and interest payable with respect to the asset-backed notes, the premium paid to the insurance company, and certain other expenses. The excess of the cash received and the assets we retained over the carrying value of the automobile contracts sold, less transaction costs, equaled the net gain on sale of automobile contracts we recorded. Until the maturity of these transactions, our consolidated balance sheet will reflect both securitization transactions structured as sales and others structured as secured financings.           With respect to transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes, we allocate our basis in the automobile contracts between the asset-backed securities sold and the residual interests retained based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of the sale. We recognize gains or losses attributable to the change in the fair value of the residual interests, which are recorded at estimated fair value. We are not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of interests such as the residual interests; accordingly, we determine the estimated fair value of the residual interests by discounting the amount of anticipated cash flows that we estimate will be released to us in the future (the cash out method), using a discount rate that we believe is appropriate for the risks involved. The anticipated cash flows include collections from both current and charged off receivables. We have used an effective pre-tax discount rate of 14% per annum, except for certain collections from charged off receivables related to our securitizations executed from 2001 through the second quarter of 2003. With respect to collections from such charged off receivables, we have used a discount rate of 25% per annum.                                         28            We receive periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the automobile contracts. (Under our current securitization structure, such servicing fees are included in interest income from the automobile contracts). In addition, we are entitled to the cash flows from the trusts that represent collections on the automobile contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the asset-backed securities, base servicing fees, and certain other fees and expenses (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of such notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related automobile contracts (excluding those automobile contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related securitization agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the asset-backed securities is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create overcollateralization of the asset-backed notes.           If the amount of cash required for payment of fees, expenses, interest and principal exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is withdrawn from the spread account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations, and there is no shortfall in the related spread account or the required overcollateralization level, the excess is released to us. If the spread account and overcollateralization is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the trust until the specified level is achieved. Although spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of our special-purpose subsidiaries as the owner of the residual interests (in the case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes) or the trusts (in the case of securitization transactions structured as secured financings for financial accounting purposes), we are restricted in use of the cash in the spread accounts. Cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the securitization agreements. The interest rate payable on the automobile contracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the asset-backed notes. As a result, the residual interests described above historically have been a significant asset of ours. In determining the value of the residual interests, we must estimate the future rates of prepayments, delinquencies, defaults, default loss severity, and recovery rates, as all of these factors affect the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows. We estimate prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable automobile contracts. We estimate recovery rates of previously charged off receivables using available historical recovery data. We estimate defaults and default loss severity using available historical loss data for comparable automobile contracts and the specific characteristics of the automobile contracts we purchased. In valuing the residuals as of December 31, 2006, we estimate that charge-offs as a percentage of the original principal balance will approximate 15.5% to 19.4% cumulatively over the lives of the related automobile contracts, with recovery rates approximating 3.6% to 4.2% of the original principal balance and prepayment estimates of approximately 22.7% to 32.5% cumulatively over the lives of the related automobile contracts.           For securitizations that were structured as a sale for financial accounting purposes, we recognize interest income on the balance of the residual interests. In addition, we would recognize as gain additional revenue from the residual interests if the actual performance of the automobile contracts were better than our estimate of the value of the residual interest. If the actual performance of the automobile contracts were worse than our estimate, then a downward adjustment to the carrying value of the residuals and a related impairment charge would be required. In a securitization structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes, interest income is recognized when accrued under the terms of the related automobile contracts and, therefore, presents less potential for fluctuations in performance when compared to the approach used in a transaction structured as a sale for financial accounting purposes.           In all of our term securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, whether treated as secured financings or as sales, we have sold the automobile contracts (through a subsidiary) to the securitization entity. The difference between the two structures is that in securitizations that are treated as secured financings we report the assets and liabilities of the securitization trust on our consolidated balance sheet. Under both structures, recourse to us by holders of the asset-backed securities and by the trust, for failure of the automobile contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis, is limited to the automobile contracts included in the securitizations or warehouse credit facilities, the spread accounts and our retained interests in the respective trusts.                                         29   INCOME TAXES           We and our subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and combined or stand-alone state franchise tax returns for certain states. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.           As part of the both the MFN Merger and the TFC Merger, we acquired certain net operating losses and built-in loss assets. During each period since the MFN Merger through the third quarter of 2006, we have identified the types and amounts of temporary differences and the nature and amount of each type of operating loss and tax credit carryforward as well as the length of the carryforward period. Moreover, we considered various positive and negative evidence to ascertain, based on the weight of that evidence, if a valuation allowance against the certain components of deferred tax assets was appropriate. Through the third quarter of 2006, based on our analysis of both positive and negative evidence pertaining to the realization of deferred tax assets, we had determined that it was not more than likely that a significant amount of the deferred tax assets would be realized in the future. As a result, we maintained a significant valuation allowance against those available deferred tax assets.           However, as of December 31, 2006 our review of both positive and negative evidence pertaining to the realization of deferred tax assets suggests to us that it is now more than likely that we will realize a substantial portion of deferred tax assets. A significant portion of the deferred tax assets is attributable to the mergers and is limited as to the annual amount and the number of future periods that it can be realized. Consequently, we considered our history of cumulative taxable income since our inception in the evaluation of positive and negative evidence. Other significant components of our deferred tax asset are not limited as to their annual amount and timeframe for realization as they have resulted from our recent history of taxable income substantially in excess of our net income. As a result, we have released that portion of the valuation allowance that represents the portion of deferred tax assets that we believe are more likely than not to be realized. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax asset whose utilization in future periods is not more than likely.           In determining the possible realization of deferred tax assets, we consider future taxable income from future operations exclusive of reversing temporary differences and tax planning strategies that, if necessary, would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into periods in which net operating losses might otherwise expire.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  EFFECTS OF CHANGE IN SECURITIZATION STRUCTURE           Our decision in the third quarter of 2003 to structure securitization transactions as secured financings for financial accounting purposes, rather than as sales, has affected and will affect the way in which the transactions are reported. The major effects are these: (i) the automobile contracts are shown as assets on our balance sheet; (ii) the debt issued in the transactions is shown as indebtedness; (iii) cash deposited in the spread accounts to enhance the credit of the securitization transactions is shown as "Restricted cash" on our balance sheet; (iv) cash collected from automobile purchasers and other sources related to the automobile contracts prior to making the required payments under the securitization agreements is also shown as "Restricted cash" on our balance sheet; (v) the servicing fee that we receive in connection with such contracts is recorded as a portion of the interest earned on such contracts in our statements of operations; (vi) we have initially and periodically recorded as expense a provision for estimated credit losses on the contracts in our statements of operations; and (vii) portions of scheduled payments on the contracts and on the debt issued in the transactions representing interest are recorded as interest income and expense, respectively, in our statements of operations.           These changes collectively represent a deferral of revenue and acceleration of expenses, and thus a more conservative approach to accounting for our operations compared to the previous securitization transactions, which were accounted for as sales at the consummation of the transaction. As a result of the changes, we initially reported lower earnings than we would have reported if we had continued to structure our transactions to require recognition of gain on sale. It should also be noted that growth in our portfolio of receivables resulted in an increase in expenses in the form of provision for credit losses, and initially had a negative effect on net earnings. Our cash availability and cash requirements should be unaffected by the change in structure.                                         30            Since the third quarter of 2003, we have conducted 18 term securitizations. Of these 18, 14 were quarterly securitizations of automobile contracts that we purchased from automobile dealers under our regular programs. In addition, in March 2004 and November 2005, we completed securitizations of our retained interests in other securitizations that we and our affiliates previously sponsored. The debt from the March 2004 transaction was repaid in August 2005. Also, in June 2004, we completed a securitization of automobile contracts purchased in the SeaWest asset acquisition and under our TFC programs. Further, in December 2005, we completed a securitization that included automobile contracts purchased under the TFC programs, automobile contracts purchased under the CPS programs and automobile contracts we repurchased upon termination of prior securitizations of our MFN and TFC subsidiaries. All such securitizations since the third quarter of 2003 have been structured as secured financings.  COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005           REVENUES. During the year ended December 31, 2006, revenues were $278.9 million, an increase of $85.2 million, or 44.0%, from the prior year revenue of $193.7 million. The primary reason for the increase in revenues is an increase in interest income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $91.7 million, or 53.4%, to $263.6 million from $171.8 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the increase in interest income is the increase in finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries (resulting in an increase of $102.4 million in interest income). This increase was partially offset by the decline in the balance of the portfolios of automobile contracts we acquired in the MFN, TFC and SeaWest transactions (in the aggregate, resulting in a decrease of $10.9 million in interest income). In addition, interest income on our residual asset increased by $318,000.           Servicing fees totaling $2.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased $3.8 million, or 56.5%, from $6.6 million in the prior year. The decrease in servicing fees is the result of the change in securitization structure and the consequent decline in our managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries. As a result of the decision to structure future securitizations as secured financings, our managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries will continue to decline in future periods, and servicing fee revenue is anticipated to decline proportionately. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, our managed portfolio owned by consolidated vs. non-consolidated subsidiaries and other third parties was as follows:                                                     December 31, 2006     December 31, 2005                                                 -------------------   -------------------                                                   Amount       %        Amount        %                                                 ----------   ------   ----------   ------ Total Managed Portfolio                                      ($ in millions)          Owned by Consolidated Subsidiaries ..........   $  1,527.3    97.5%   $  1,000.6    89.2% Owned by Non-Consolidated Subsidiaries ......         34.8     2.2%        103.1     9.2% SeaWest Third Party Portfolio ...............          3.8     0.2%         18.0     1.6%                                                 ----------   ------   ----------   ------  Total .......................................   $  1,565.9   100.0%   $  1,121.7   100.0%                                                 ==========   ======   ==========   ======           At December 31, 2006, we were generating income and fees on a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance of $1,565.9 million (this amount includes $3.8 million of automobile contracts securitized by SeaWest, on which we earn only servicing fees), compared to a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance of $1,121.7 million as of December 31, 2005. As the portfolios of automobile contracts acquired in the MFN Merger, TFC Merger, and SeaWest transaction decrease, the portfolio of automobile contracts that we purchased directly from automobile dealers continues to expand. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the managed portfolio composition was as follows:                                                    December 31, 2006     December 31, 2005                                                 -------------------   -------------------                                                   Amount       %        Amount        %                                                 ----------   ------   ----------   ------ Originating Entity                                           ($ in millions) CPS .........................................   $  1,496.5    95.6%   $  1,017.3    90.7% TFC .........................................         60.9     3.9%         68.6     6.1% MFN .........................................          0.2     0.0%          2.5     0.2% SeaWest .....................................          4.5     0.3%         15.3     1.4% SeaWest Third Party Portfolio ...............          3.8     0.2%         18.0     1.6%                                                 ----------   ------   ----------   ------  Total .......................................   $  1,565.9   100.0%   $  1,121.7   100.0%                                                 ==========   ======   ==========   ======                                          31            Other income decreased $2.8 million, or 18.5%, to $12.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $15.2 million during the prior year. The year over year decrease is the result of a variety of factors. Current year other income includes $1.2 million resulting from an increase in the carrying value of our residual interest in securitizations. The carrying value was increased primarily as a result of the underlying receivables having incurred fewer losses than we had previously estimated. The prior year period included proceeds of $2.4 million from the sale of certain charged off receivables acquired in the MFN, TFC and SeaWest acquisitions. In addition, we experienced decreases in recoveries on MFN and certain other automobile contracts (a decrease of $638,000) compared to the same prior year and decreased revenue on our direct mail services (a decrease of $752,000). These direct mail services are provided to our dealers and consist of customized solicitations targeted to prospective vehicle purchasers, in proximity to the dealer, who appear to meet our credit criteria. We also experienced increases in convenience fees charged to obligors for certain transaction types (an increase of $690,000).           EXPENSES. Our operating expenses consist primarily of provisions for credit losses, interest expense, employee costs and general and administrative expenses. Provisions for credit losses and interest expense are significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during a period and by the outstanding balance of finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and the unemployment level.           Employee costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding warrants and stock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced.           Other operating expenses consist primarily of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, marketing and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization.           Total operating expenses were $265.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $190.3 million for the prior year, an increase of $75.3 million, or 39.6%. The increase is primarily due to increases in provision for credit losses and interest expense, which increased by $33.1 million and $41.4 million, or 56.1% and 80.2%, respectively. Both interest expense and provision for credit losses are directly affected by the growth in our portfolio of automobile contracts held by consolidated affiliates.           Employee costs decreased slightly to $38.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, representing 14.5% of total operating expenses, from $40.4 million for the prior year, or 21.2% of total operating expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we deferred $2.9 million of direct employee costs associated with the purchase of automobile contracts in the period, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 91, Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases (SFAS 91). Prior to 2006, we have not deferred and amortized such costs as our analyses indicated that the effect of such deferral and amortization would not have been material. However, due to continued increases in volumes of automobile contract purchases and refinements in our methodology to measure direct costs associated with automobile contract purchases, our estimate of direct costs has increased, resulting in the need to defer such costs and amortize them over the lives of the related automobile contracts as an adjustment to the yield in accordance with SFAS 91. The decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher total of operating expenses, primarily a result of the increased provision for credit losses and interest expense.           General and administrative expenses increased slightly to $23.2 million and represented 8.7% of total operating expenses in the year ending December 31, 2006, as compared to the prior year when general and administrative expenses represented 12.1% of total operating expenses. The decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher operating expenses primarily a result of the provision for credit losses and interest expense.           Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $41.4 million, or 80.2%, to $93.1 million, compared to $51.7 million in the previous year. The increase is primarily the result of changes in the amount and composition of securitization trust debt carried on our consolidated balance sheet. Interest on securitization trust debt increased by $40.5 million in 2006 compared to the prior year. We also experienced increases in warehouse interest expense and residual interest financing interest expenses of $2.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively. A portion of the increase in interest expense can also be attributed to a gradual increase in market interest rates during 2006. Increases in interest expense for securitization trust debt, warehouse and residual interest financing were somewhat offset by a decrease of $4.5 million in interest expense for subordinated debt.                                         32            Marketing expenses consist primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee marketing representatives and increased by $2.0 million, or 16.9%, to $14.0 million, compared to $12.0 million in the previous year and represented 5.3% of total operating expenses. The increase is primarily due to the increase in automobile contracts we purchased during the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we purchased 66,504 automobile contracts aggregating $1,019.0 million, compared to 46,666 automobile contracts aggregating $691.3 million in the prior year.           Occupancy expenses increased by $583,000 or 17.1%, to $4.0 million compared to $3.4 million in the previous year and represented 1.5% of total operating expenses.           Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $10,000, or 1.3%, to $800,000 from $790,000 in the previous year.           During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded an income tax benefit of $41.8 million related to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, offset by current income tax paid or currently payable of $20.2 million, less $4.8 million in deferred tax benefit. As of December 31, 2006, we had remaining deferred tax assets of $64.1 million, partially offset by a valuation allowance of $9.4 million related to federal and state net operating losses and other timing differences, leaving a net deferred tax asset of $54.7 million.  COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 WITH THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004           REVENUES. During the year ended December 31, 2005, revenues were $193.7 million, an increase of $61.0 million, or 46.0%, from the prior year revenue of $132.7 million. The primary reason for the increase in revenues is an increase in interest income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $66.0 million, or 62.4%, to $171.8 million in 2005 from $105.8 million in 2004. The primary reason for the increase in interest income is the growth of the finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries on our balance sheet. During 2005, we purchased $691.3 million of automobile contracts and increased our balance of receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries to $1,000.6 million at December 31, 2005 from $619.8 million at December 31, 2004, an increase of 61.4%. Offsetting the increase in interest income were decreases in the balance of receivables acquired in the MFN, TFC and SeaWest transactions, which resulted in decreases in interest income of $1.8 million, $2.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively.           Servicing fees totaling $6.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased $5.8 million, or 46.7%, from $12.5 million in the same period a year earlier. The decrease in servicing fees is the result of the change in securitization structure and the consequent decline in our managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries, and the decrease in the balance of automobile contracts originated by SeaWest for which we receive only servicing fees. As a result of the decision to structure future securitizations as secured financings, our managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries will continue to decline in future periods, and servicing fee revenue is anticipated to decline proportionately. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, our managed portfolio owned by consolidated vs. non-consolidated subsidiaries and other third parties was as follows:                                                     December 31, 2005  December 31, 2004                                                 ------------------  ----------------                                                  Amount        %     Amount      %                                                 --------     -----  --------   ----- Total Managed Portfolio                                      ($ in millions)          Owned by Consolidated Subsidiaries ..........   $  1,000.6    89.2% $  619.8    68.3% Owned by Non-Consolidated Subsidiaries ......        103.1     9.2%    233.6    25.8% SeaWest Third Party Portfolio ...............         18.0     1.6%     53.5     5.9%                                                 ----------   -----  --------   -----  Total .......................................   $  1,121.7   100.0% $  906.9   100.0%                                                 ==========   =====  ========   =====                                         33            At December 31, 2005, we were generating income and fees on a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance of $1,121.7 million (this amount includes $18.0 million of automobile contracts securitized by SeaWest, on which we earn only servicing fees), compared to a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance of $906.9 million as of December 31, 2004. As the portfolios of automobile contracts acquired in the MFN, TFC and SeaWest transactions decrease, the portfolio of automobile contracts that we purchased directly from automobile dealers continues to expand. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the managed portfolio composition was as follows:                                                   December 31, 2005  December 31, 2004                                                 ------------------  ----------------                                                  Amount        %     Amount      %                                                 ----------   -----  --------   ----- Originating Entity                                           ($ in millions) CPS .........................................   $  1,017.3    90.7% $  706.8    77.9% TFC .........................................         68.6     6.1%     89.4     9.9% MFN .........................................          2.5     0.2%     17.8     2.0% SeaWest .....................................         15.3     1.4%     39.4     4.3% SeaWest Third Party Portfolio ...............         18.0     1.6%     53.5     5.9%                                                 ----------   -----  --------   -----  Total .......................................   $  1,121.7   100.0% $  906.9   100.0%                                                 ==========   =====  ========   =====             Other income increased $822,000, or 5.7%, to $15.2 million during 2005 from $14.4 million in 2004. During 2005, other income included $2.4 million from the sale of charged off receivables acquired in the MFN, TFC, and SeaWest transactions, compared to no such proceeds in 2004. Recoveries on MFN receivables decreased by $3.1 million to $4.9 million in 2005, compared to $8.0 million in 2004. Other income associated with direct mail services increased by $765,000 to $4.5 million in 2005, compared to $3.8 million in 2004. These direct mail services are provided to our dealers and represent direct mail products which consist of customized solicitations targeted to prospective vehicle purchasers, in proximity to the dealer, who are likely to meet our credit criteria.           EXPENSES. Total operating expenses were $190.3 million for 2005, compared to $148.6 million for 2004. The increase is primarily due to a $26.4 million increase, or 81.1% in the provision for credit losses to $59.0 million during the 2005 period as compared to $32.6 million in the 2004 period. Interest expense increased by $19.5 million to $51.7 million from $32.1 million in 2004, an increase of 60.7%. The increase is primarily the result of the amount of securitization trust debt carried on our consolidated balance sheet, which increased along with the growth of our portfolio of finance receivables. The increase was somewhat offset by the decrease in securitization trust debt acquired in the MFN and TFC transactions. For 2005, the provision for credit losses and interest expense represented 31.0% and 27.1%, respectively, of total operating expenses, compared to 21.9% and 21.6% in 2004.           Employee costs increased to $40.4 million, or 5.8% during 2005, representing 21.2% of total operating expenses, from $38.2 million for 2004, or 25.7% of total operating expenses. The decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher total of operating expenses, primarily a result of the increased provision for credit losses and interest expense.           General and administrative expenses increased slightly to $23.1 million, or 12.1% of total operating expenses, in 2005, as compared to $21.3 million, or 14.3% of total operating expenses, in 2004. The decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher operating expenses primarily a result of the increased provision for credit losses and interest expense. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized what we believe will be a one-time, non-cash impairment charge of $1.9 million against certain assets other than finance receivables.           In December 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved accelerated vesting of all the outstanding stock options we issued. Options to purchase 2,113,998 shares of our common stock, which would otherwise have vested from time to time through 2010, became immediately exercisable as a result of the acceleration of vesting. The decision to accelerate the vesting of the options was made primarily to reduce non-cash compensation expenses that would have been recorded in our income statement in future periods upon the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, in January 2006. We estimate that approximately $3.5 million of future non-cash compensation expense was eliminated as a result of the acceleration of vesting.           At the time of the acceleration of vesting, we accounted for our stock options in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Consequently, the acceleration of vesting resulted in non-cash compensation charge of $427,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005.                                         34            For 2005, we recognized no impairment loss on our residual interest in securitizations compared to $11.8 million in 2004. In 2004, such impairment loss related to our analysis and estimate of the expected ultimate performance of our previously securitized pools that are held by non-consolidated subsidiaries and the residual interest in securitizations. The impairment loss was a result of the actual net loss and prepayment rates exceeding our previous estimates for the automobile contracts held by non-consolidated subsidiaries.           Marketing expenses increased by $3.7 million, or 43.9%, to $12.0 million, compared to $8.3 million in the same period of the previous year and represented 6.3% of total operating expenses. The increase is primarily due to the increase in automobile contracts we purchased during the year ended December 31, 2005.           Occupancy expenses decreased by $120,000, or 3.4%, to $3.4 million, compared to $3.5 million in the same period of the previous year and represented 1.8% of total operating expenses. The decrease is primarily due to the closure and sub-leasing during 2005 of certain facilities acquired in the MFN and TFC transactions.           Depreciation and amortization expenses remained essentially unchanged at $790,000 for 2005, compared to $785,000 for 2004, and represented 0.4% of total operating expenses.           We would have recorded income tax expense of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, but the income tax expense was offset primarily by a $1.4 million decrease in the valuation allowance that we had established to offset our deferred tax assets.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  LIQUIDITY           Our business requires substantial cash to support purchases of automobile contracts and other operating activities. Our primary sources of cash have been cash flows from operating activities, including proceeds from sales of automobile contracts, amounts borrowed under our warehouse credit facilities, servicing fees on portfolios of automobile contracts previously sold in securitization transactions or serviced for third parties, customer payments of principal and interest on finance receivables, fees for origination of automobile contracts, and releases of cash from securitized portfolios of automobile contracts in which we have retained a residual ownership interest and from the spread accounts associated with such pools. Our primary uses of cash have been the purchases of automobile contracts, repayment of amounts borrowed under warehouse credit facilities and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses, the establishment of spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, and the increase of credit enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions, and income taxes. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet our cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from those portfolios and their related spread accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in our managed portfolio, and the terms upon which we are able to purchase, sell, and borrow against automobile contracts.           Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $57.1 million, $36.7 million and $10.0 million, respectively. Cash from operating activities is generally provided by net income from our operations. The increase in 2006 vs. 2005, and 2005 vs. 2004, is due in part to our increased net earnings before the significant increase in the provision for credit losses.           Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, was $568.4 million, $411.7 million, and $314.1 million, respectively. Cash used in investing activities generally relates to purchases of automobile contracts. Purchases of finance receivables held for investment were $1,019.0 million, $691.3 million and $506.0 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.           Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $507.7 million compared with $378.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $285.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Cash used or provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to the issuance or repayment of debt. We issued $1,003.6 million of securitization trust debt in 2006 as compared to $662.4 million in 2005 and $474.7 million in 2004.           We purchase automobile contracts from dealers for a cash price approximating their principal amount, adjusted for an acquisition fee which may either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price. Those automobile contracts generate cash flow, however, over a period of years. As a result, we have been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase automobile contracts, and on the availability of cash from outside sources in order to finance our continuing operations, as well as to fund the portion of                                          35   automobile contract purchase prices not financed under revolving warehouse credit facilities. As of December 31, 2006, we had $400 million in warehouse credit capacity, in the form of two $200 million facilities. One $200 million facility provides funding for automobile contracts purchased under the TFC Programs while both warehouse facilities provide funding for automobile contracts purchased under the CPS Programs. On June 29, 2005, we terminated a third facility in the amount of $125 million, which we had utilized to fund automobile contracts under the CPS and TFC Programs.           The first of two warehouse facilities mentioned above is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by our consolidated subsidiary Page Three Funding, LLC. This facility was established on November 15, 2005, and expires on November 14, 2007, although it is renewable with the mutual agreement of the parties. On November 8, 2006 the facility was increased from $150 million to $200 million and the advance was increased to 83% from 80% of eligible contracts, subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants. Notes under this facility accrue interest at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum. At December 31, 2006, $45.2 million was outstanding under this facility.           The second of two warehouse facilities is similarly structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by our consolidated subsidiary Page Funding LLC. This facility was entered into on June 30, 2004. On June 29, 2005 the facility was increased from $100 million to $125 million and further amended to provide for funding for automobile contracts purchased under the TFC programs, in addition to our CPS programs. The available credit under the facility was increased again to $200 million on August 31, 2005. In April 2006, the terms of this facility were amended to allow advances to us of up to 80% of the principal balance of automobile contracts that we purchase under our CPS programs, and of up to 70% of the principal balance of automobile contracts that we purchase under our TFC programs, in all events subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants. On June 30, 2006, the terms of this facility were amended to allow advances to us of up to 83% of the principal balance of automobile contracts that we purchase under our CPS programs, in all events subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants. Notes under this facility accrue interest at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum. The lender has annual termination options at its sole discretion on each June 30 through 2007, at which time the agreement expires. At December 31, 2006, $27.8 million was outstanding under this facility.           The balance outstanding under these warehouse facilities generally will increase as we purchase additional automobile contracts, until we effect a securitization utilizing automobile contracts warehoused in the facilities, at which time the balance outstanding will decrease.           We securitized $957.7 million of automobile contracts in four private placement transactions during the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $674.4 million of automobile contracts in five private placement transactions during the year ended December 31, 2005. All of these transactions were structured as secured financings and, therefore, resulted in no gain on sale. In March 2004, one of our wholly-owned bankruptcy remote consolidated subsidiaries issued $44.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by its retained interest in eight term securitization transactions. The notes had an interest rate of 10.0% per annum and a final maturity in October 2009 and were required to be repaid from the distributions on the underlying retained interests. In connection with the issuance of the notes, we incurred and capitalized issuance costs of $1.3 million. We repaid the notes in full in August 2005. In November 2005, we completed a similar securitization whereby a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote consolidated subsidiary of ours issued $45.8 million of asset-backed notes secured by its retained interest in 10 term securitization transactions. These notes, which bear interest at a blended interest rate of 8.70% per annum and have a final maturity in July 2011, are required to be repaid from the distributions on the underlying residual interests. In connection with the issuance of the notes, we incurred and capitalized issuance costs of $915,000.           In December 2006 we entered into a $35 million residual credit facility that is secured by our retained interests in more recent term securitizations. This facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 6.125%, allows for new borrowings over a two-year period and then amortizes over a five-year period. At December 31, 2006, there was $12.2 million outstanding under this facility and was secured by our retained interests in six term securitization transactions.           Cash released from trusts and their related spread accounts to us related to the portfolio owned by consolidated subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $16.5 million, $23.1 million and $21.4 million, respectively. Changes in the amount of credit enhancement required for term securitization transactions and releases from trusts and their related spread accounts are affected by the structure of the credit enhancement and the relative size, seasoning and performance of the various pools of automobile contracts securitized that make up our managed portfolio to which the respective spread accounts are related. The trend in our recent securitizations has been towards credit enhancements that require a lower proportion of spread account cash and a greater proportion of over-collateralization. This trend has led to somewhat lower levels of restricted cash and releases from trusts relative to the size of our managed portfolio.                                         36            The acquisition of automobile contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established trusts and their related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. We may be limited in our ability to purchase automobile contracts due to limits on our capital. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrestricted cash on hand of $14.2 million and available capacity from our warehouse credit facilities of $327.0 million. Warehouse capacity is subject to the availability of suitable automobile contracts to serve as collateral and of sufficient cash to fund the portion of such automobile contracts purchase price not advanced under the warehouse facilities. Our plans to manage the need for liquidity include the completion of additional securitizations that would provide additional credit availability from the warehouse credit facilities, and matching our levels of automobile contract purchases to our availability of cash. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete securitizations on favorable economic terms or that we will be able to complete securitizations at all. If we are unable to complete such securitizations, we may be unable to purchase automobile contracts and interest income and other portfolio related income would decrease.           Our primary means of ensuring that our cash demands do not exceed our cash resources is to match our levels of automobile contract purchases to our availability of cash. Our ability to adjust the quantity of automobile contracts that we purchase and securitize will be subject to general competitive conditions and the continued availability of warehouse credit facilities. There can be no assurance that the desired level of automobile contract purchases can be maintained or increased. While the specific terms and mechanics of each spread account vary among transactions, our securitization agreements generally provide that we will receive excess cash flows only if the amount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and/or the delinquency, defaults or net losses related to the automobile contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies, defaults or net losses on the automobile contracts exceed such levels, the terms of the securitization: (i) may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulated for the particular pool; (ii) may restrict the distribution to us of excess cash flows associated with other pools; or (iii) in certain circumstances, may permit the insurers to require the transfer of servicing on some or all of the automobile contracts to another servicer. There can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will continue to generate sufficient cash.           Certain of our securitization transactions and the warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels and maximum financial losses. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility.           The agreements under which we receive periodic fees for servicing automobile contracts in securitizations are terminable by the respective insurance companies upon defined events of default, and, in some cases, at the will of the insurance company. Were an insurance company in the future to exercise its option to terminate such agreements, such a termination could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations, depending on the number and value of the terminated agreements. Our note insurers continue to extend our term as servicer on a monthly and/or quarterly basis, pursuant to the servicing agreements. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS           The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands):                                              PAYMENT DUE BY PERIOD (1)                                 ------------------------------------------------                                           LESS THAN   1 TO 3    3 TO 5  MORE THAN                                  TOTAL    1 YEAR     YEARS     YEARS    5 YEARS                                 -------   -------   -------   -------   ------- Long Term Debt (2) ...........  $38,619   $30,887   $ 6,309   $ 1,318   $   105 Operating Leases .............  $ 7,066   $ 3,892   $ 2,970   $   204   $    --    (1)  SECURITIZATION TRUST DEBT, IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1,443.0 MILLION AS      OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, IS OMITTED FROM THIS TABLE BECAUSE IT BECOMES DUE AS      AND WHEN THE RELATED RECEIVABLES BALANCE IS REDUCED. EXPECTED PAYMENTS,      WHICH WILL DEPEND ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH RECEIVABLES, AS TO WHICH THERE      CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, ARE $472.3 MILLION IN 2007, $342.2 MILLION IN 2008,      $261.3 MILLION IN 2009, $191.4 MILLION IN 2010, $128.3 MILLION IN 2011, AND                                          37        $47.5 MILLION IN 2012. RESIDUAL INTEREST FINANCING, OF $31.4 MILLION AS OF      DECEMBER 31, 2006, IS ALSO OMITTED FROM THIS TABLE BECAUSE IT BECOMES DUE      AS AND WHEN THE RELATED RESIDUAL INTEREST AND SPREAD ACCOUNT BALANCES ARE      REDUCED. EXPECTED PAYMENTS, WHICH WILL DEPEND ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE      RELATED RECEIVABLES, AS TO WHICH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, ARE $11.0      MILLION IN 2007, $7.6 MILLION IN 2008 AND $12.8MILLION IN 2009. (2)  LONG-TERM DEBT INCLUDES SENIOR SECURED DEBT, SUBORDINATED DEBT,      SUBORDINATED RENEWABLE NOTES AND NOTES PAYABLE.  WAREHOUSE CREDIT FACILITIES           The terms on which credit has been available to us for purchase of automobile contracts have varied over the three years 2004-2006 and through December 31, 2006, as shown in the following summary of our warehouse credit facilities:           FACILITY IN USE FROM NOVEMBER 2000 TO FEBRUARY 2004. In November 2000, we (through our subsidiary CPS Funding LLC) entered into a floating rate variable note purchase facility under which up to $75.8 million of notes could be outstanding at any time subject to collateral tests and other conditions. We used funds derived from this facility to purchase automobile contracts under the CPS programs, which were pledged to secure the notes. The collateral tests and other conditions generally allowed us to borrow up to approximately 72.5% of the principal balance of the automobile contracts. Notes issued under this facility bore interest at one-month LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum, plus a premium to an insurance company. This facility expired on February 21, 2004.           FACILITY IN USE FROM MARCH 2002 TO JUNE 2005. In March 2002, we (through our subsidiary CPS Warehouse Trust) entered into a second floating rate variable note purchase facility, under which up to $125.0 million of notes could be outstanding at any time, subject to collateral tests and other conditions. We used funds derived from this facility to purchase automobile contracts under the CPS programs and the TFC programs, which were pledged to secure the notes. The collateral tests and other conditions generally allowed us to borrow up to approximately 73% of the principal balance of the automobile contracts purchased under the CPS programs. Notes issued under this facility bore interest at commercial paper plus 1.18% per annum, plus a premium to a financial guarantor. During November 2004, this facility was amended to allow us to borrow up to approximately 70% of the principal balance of automobile contracts purchased under the TFC programs. This facility was due to expire on April 11, 2006, but we elected to terminate it on June 29, 2005.           FACILITY IN USE FROM MAY 2003 TO JUNE 2004. In connection with the TFC merger in May 2003, we (through our subsidiary TFC Warehouse I LLC) entered into a third floating rate variable note purchase facility, under which up to $25.0 million of notes could be outstanding at any time, subject to collateral tests and other conditions. We used funds derived from this facility to purchase automobile contracts under the TFC programs, which were pledged to secure the notes. The collateral tests and other conditions generally allowed us to borrow up to approximately 71% of the principal balance of the automobile contracts. Notes issued under this facility bore interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum, plus a premium to a financial guarantor. This facility expired on June 24, 2004.           FACILITY IN USE FROM JUNE 2004 TO PRESENT. In June 2004, we (through our subsidiary Page Funding LLC) entered into a floating rate variable note purchase facility. Up to $200.0 million of notes may be outstanding under this facility at any time subject to certain collateral tests and other conditions. We use funds derived from this facility to purchase automobile contracts under the CPS programs and TFC programs, which are pledged to secure the notes. The collateral tests and other conditions generally allow us to borrow up to approximately 93% of the principal balance of automobile contracts that we purchase under our CPS programs, and of up to 70% of the principal balance of automobile contracts that we purchase under our TFC programs. Notes issued under this facility bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum. The balance of notes outstanding related to this facility at December 31, 2006 was $27.8 million.           FACILITY IN USE FROM NOVEMBER 2005 TO PRESENT. In November 2005, we (through our subsidiary Page Three Funding LLC) entered into a floating rate variable note purchase facility. Up to $200 million of notes may be outstanding under this facility at any time subject to certain collateral tests and other conditions. We use funds derived from this facility to purchase automobile contracts under the CPS programs, which are pledged to secure the notes. The collateral tests and other conditions generally allow us to borrow up to approximately 93.0% of the principal balance of the automobile contracts. Notes issued under this facility bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum. The balance of notes outstanding related to this facility at December 31, 2006 was $45.2 million.                                         38   CAPITAL RESOURCES           Approximately $25.0 million of long-term debt matures in May 2007. We plan to repay our long-term debt from a combination of the following: (i) additional proceeds from the offering of subordinated renewable notes; (ii) a possible transaction similar to the financings that we undertook in March 2004 and November 2005, where we issued notes secured by our residual interests in securitizations; and (iii) possible senior secured financing similar to our existing outstanding senior secured financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete these transactions. Securitization trust debt is repaid from collections on the related receivables, and becomes due in accordance with its terms as the principal amount of the related receivables is reduced. Although the securitization trust debt also has alternative maximum maturity dates, those dates are significantly later than the dates at which repayment of the related receivables is anticipated, and at no time in our history have any of our sponsored asset-backed securities reached those alternative maximum maturities.           The acquisition of automobile contracts for subsequent transfer in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the trusts and related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. We plan to adjust our levels of automobile contract purchases so as to match anticipated releases of cash from the trusts and related spread accounts with our capital requirements.  CAPITALIZATION           Over the period from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2006 we have managed our capitalization by issuing and restructuring debt as summarized in the following table:                                         39                                                   YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                       -----------------------------------------                                          2006            2005           2004                                       -----------    -----------    -----------                                                 (Dollars in thousands) RESIDUAL INTEREST FINANCING: Beginning balance .................   $    43,745    $    22,204    $        --      Issuances ....................        13,667         45,800         44,000      Payments .....................

In March 2004, one of our wholly-owned bankruptcy remote consolidated subsidiaries issued $44.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by our retained interests in eight term securitization transactions. We repaid the notes in full in August 2005. In November 2005, we completed a similar securitization in which a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote consolidated subsidiary of ours issued $45.8 million of asset-backed notes secured by our retained interests in 10 term securitization transactions. These notes have a final maturity in July 2011, and are required to be repaid from the distributions on the underlying retained interests. In December 2006, we entered into a $35 million residual credit facility that is secured by our retained interests in more recent term securitizations. This facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 6.125%, allows for new borrowings over a two-year period and then amortizes over a five-year period.           SECURITIZATION TRUST DEBT. Since the third quarter of 2003, we have for financial accounting purposes, treated securitizations of automobile contracts as secured financings, and the asset-backed securities issued in such securitizations remain on our balance sheet as securitization trust debt.           SENIOR SECURED DEBT. Since 1998, we have entered into a series of financing transactions with Levine Leichtman.           SUBORDINATED DEBT. In April 1997, we issued $20.0 million in subordinated participating equity notes due April 2004, which we retired in the second quarter of 2004. In 1995, we issued $20.0 million of Rising Interest Subordinated Redeemable Securities, or RISRS, due 2006. The RISRS included a                                         40   sinking fund in their terms, and we repaid in the first quarter of 2006 the $14.0 million that remained outstanding. In May 2003, in connection with the acquisition of TFC, we assumed $6.3 million in principal amount of subordinated debt that TFC had outstanding. We amortized this debt monthly and repaid it in full in June 2005.           SUBORDINATED RENEWABLE NOTES DEBT. In June 2005, we began issuing registered subordinated renewable notes in an ongoing offering to the public. Upon maturity, the notes are automatically renewed for the same term as the maturing notes, unless we elect not to have the notes renewed or unless the investor notifies us within 15 days after the maturity date for his notes that he wants his notes repaid. Renewed notes bear interest at the rate we are offering at that time to other investors with similar aggregate note portfolios. Based on the terms of the individual notes, interest payments may be required monthly, quarterly, annually or upon maturity.           RELATED PARTY DEBT. In June 1997 we borrowed $15.0 million from Stanwich Financial Services Corp., or Stanwich, which was an affiliated corporation at that time. This debt was due in 2004 and we repaid it in the second quarter of 2004. During 1999 we borrowed another $1.5 million from Stanwich, which we also repaid in the second quarter of 2004. During 1998 we borrowed $1.0 million from one of our directors. In the second quarter of 2004, our indebtedness to that director was converted, in accordance with its terms, into common stock at the rate of $3.00 per share.           We must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. As a result of waivers and amendments to covenants related to securitization and non-securitization related debt throughout 2004 and 2005, we were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2006. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare default if a default occurred under a different facility.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS           This report on Form 10-K includes certain "forward-looking statements," including, without limitation, the statements or implications to the effect that prepayments as a percentage of original balances will approximate 22.7% to 32.5% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts, that charge-offs as a percentage of original balances will approximate 15.5% to 19.4% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts, with recovery rates approximating 3.6% to 4.2% of original principal balances. Other forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "estimates," or words of like meaning. As to the specifically identified forward-looking statements, factors that could affect charge-offs and recovery rates include changes in the general economic climate, which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of Contracts, changes in laws respecting consumer finance, which could affect the ability of the Company to enforce rights under Contracts, and changes in the market for used vehicles, which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles. Factors that could affect the Company's revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools of Contracts, which would affect the Company's ability to purchase Contracts, the terms on which the Company is able to finance such purchases, the willingness of Dealers to sell Contracts to the Company on the terms that it offers, and the terms on which the Company is able to complete term securitizations once Contracts are acquired. Factors that could affect the Company's expenses in the current year include competitive conditions in the market for qualified personnel, and interest rates (which affect the rates that the Company pays on Notes issued in its securitizations). The statements concerning the Company structuring future securitization transactions as secured financings and the effects of such structures on financial items and on the Company's future profitability also are forward-looking statements. Any change to the structure of the Company's securitization transaction could cause such forward-looking statements not to be accurate. Both the amount of the effect of the change in structure on the Company's profitability and the duration of the period in which the Company's profitability would be affected by the change in securitization structure are estimates. The accuracy of such estimates will be affected by the rate at which the Company purchases and sells Contracts, any changes in that rate, the credit performance of such Contracts, the financial terms of future securitizations, any changes in such terms over time, and other factors that generally affect the Company's profitability.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS           In February 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments". This statement amends the guidance in FASB Statements No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", and No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities". Statement 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole (eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host) if the holder                                          41   elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. The Statement also amends Statement 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. Statement 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after January 1, 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on the Company's financial position or operations.           In March 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 156, "Accounting for the Servicing of Financial Assets an Amendment to FASB Statement No. 140" (FAS 156). With respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities, this statement: (1) requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a specific types of servicing contracts identified in the statement, (2) requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities be initially measured at fair value, if practicable, (3) permits an entity to choose subsequent measurement methods for each class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities, (4) permits a one-time reclassification of available-for-sale securities to trading securities by entities with recognized servicing rights at the initial adoption of this statement, and (5) requires a separate presentation of servicing assets and servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value in the statement of financial position and additional disclosures for all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. FAS 156 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2007. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effects of this Standard, but does not believe it will have a significant effect on its financial position or results of operations.           In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS No. 157"). SFAS No. 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. SFAS 157 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2008. The Company is in the process of evaluating SFAS No. 157 but does not believe it will have a significant effect on its financial position or results of operations.           In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES-INCLUDING AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 115. SFAS 159 permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Most of the provisions of SFAS 159 are elective, however, the amendment to SFAS 115, ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, applies to all entities with available for sale or trading securities. SFAS 159 is elective as of the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. SFAS 159 was recently issued and we are currently assessing the financial impact the Statement will have on our financial statements.           In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies when tax benefits should be recorded in financial statements, requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters and indicates how any tax reserves should be classified in a balance sheet. FIN 48 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2007. The Company is currently analyzing the effects of the adoption of FIN 48 but currently does not anticipate that the adoption will have a significant impact on its financial condition or results of operations.           OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Prior to July 2003, the Company structured its securitization transactions to meet the accounting criteria for sales of finance receivables. In this structure the notes issued by the Company's special purpose subsidiary do not appear as debt on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. See Critical Accounting Policies for a detailed discussion of the Company's securitization structure.   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  INTEREST RATE RISK           The Company is subject to interest rate risk during the period between when Contracts are purchased from Dealers and when such Contracts become part of a term securitization. Specifically, the interest rates on the warehouse facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the Contracts are fixed. Historically, the Company's term securitization facilities have had fixed rates of interest. To mitigate some of this risk, the Company has in the past, and intends to continue to, structure certain of its securitization transactions to                                          42   include pre-funding structures, whereby the amount of Notes issued exceeds the amount of Contracts initially sold to the Trusts. In pre-funding, the proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until the Company sells the additional Contracts to the Trust in amounts up to the balance of the pre-funded escrow account. In pre-funded securitizations, the Company locks in the borrowing costs with respect to the Contracts it subsequently delivers to the Trust. However, the Company incurs an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of Contracts and the interest rate paid on the Notes outstanding, the amount as to which there can be no assurance.           The following table provides information on the Company's interest rate-sensitive financial instruments by expected maturity date as of December 31, 2006:                                              2007         2008         2009          2010          2011      THEREAFTER   FAIR VALUE                                       -----------   ----------   ----------   -----------   -----------   ----------   ----------                                                                              (In thousands) Assets:                Finance receivables(1) ............   $   482,482   $  373,299   $  283,485   $   210,631   $   142,636   $   34,752   $1,527,285    Weighted average fixed     effective interest rate .......         18.45%       18.46%       18.42%        18.40%        18.40%       18.53%  LIABILITIES: Warehouse lines    of credit ......................        72,950           --           --            --            --           --       72,950    Weighted average variable ......     effective interest rate .......          7.35%          --           --            --            --           --           -- Residual interest    financing ......................        10,947        7,649       12,782            --            --           --       31,378    Weighted average fixed     effective interest rate .......          8.70%          --           --            --            --           --           -- Securitization trust debt .........       472,287      342,185      261,307       191,413       128,308       47,498    1,441,881    Weighted average fixed     effective interest rate .......          5.18%        5.29%        5.43%         5.60%        5.75%         5.91% Senior secured debt ...............        25,000           --           --            --            --           --       25,000     Fixed interest rate ...........         11.75%          --           --            --            --           --           -- Subordinated renewable notes ......         5,843        2,937        3,371           467           851          105       13,574    Weighted average fixed     effective interest rate .......          8.38%        9.86%       11.06%        10.23%        11.17%        9.71%     (1) BASED ON SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND EXCLUDING SUCH COMPONENTS AS DEFERRED ORIGINATIONS COSTS AND DEFERRED ACQUISITION FEES.           Much of the information used to determine fair value is highly subjective. When applicable, readily available market information has been utilized. However, for a significant portion of the Company's financial instruments, active markets do not exist. Therefore, considerable judgments were required in estimating fair value for certain items. The subjective factors include, among other things, the estimated timing and amount of cash flows, risk characteristics, credit quality and interest rates, all of which are subject to change. Since the fair value is estimated as of the dates shown in the table, the amounts that will actually be realized or paid at settlement or maturity of the instruments could be significantly different.
