Item 7.  Management’s Discussion And AnalysisOf Financial Condition And Results Of Operations     The following discussionand analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information includedor incorporated by reference herein.     Overview     We are a specialtyfinance company. Our business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobiledealers and, to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, lighttrucks and passenger vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealerswho have limited credit histories, low incomes or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as analternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financingfrom traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobilemanufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we have also (i) acquired installmentpurchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions, (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loansfrom non-affiliated lenders, and (iii) directly originated an immaterial amount of vehicle purchase money loans by lending moneydirectly to consumers. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as "automobile contracts."     We were incorporatedand began our operations in March 1991. From inception through December 31, 2012, we have purchased a total of approximately $9.6billion of automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contractsin mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and, most recently in September 2011. The September 2011 acquisition consistedof approximately $217.8 million of finance receivables that we purchased from Fireside Bank of Pleasanton, California. In 2004and 2009, we were appointed as a third-party servicer for certain portfolios of automobile receivables originated and owned bynon-affiliated entities. From 2008 through 2010, our managed portfolio decreased each year due to our strategy of limiting contractpurchases to conserve our liquidity during the financial crisis and resulting recession, as discussed further below. However, sinceOctober 2009, we have gradually increased contract purchase which, in turn, has resulted in recent increases in our managed portfolio.Recent contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels are shown in the table below:            $ in thousands   Year    Contracts Purchased in Period    Managed Portfolio at Period End   2008    $ 296,817      $ 1,664,122     2009      8,599        1,194,722     2010      113,023        756,203     2011      284,236        794,649     2012      551,743        897,575        We are headquarteredin Irvine, California, where most operational and administrative functions are centralized. Most credit and underwriting functionsare performed in our California headquarters with some credit functions performed in our Florida office. We service our automobilecontracts from our California headquarters and from three servicing branches in Virginia, Florida and Illinois.     We purchase contractsin our own name (“CPS”) and, until July 2008, also in the name of our wholly-owned subsidiary, TFC. Programs marketedunder the CPS name are intended to serve a wide range of sub-prime customers, primarily through franchised new car dealers. OurTFC program served vehicle purchasers enlisted in the U.S. Armed Forces, primarily through independent used car dealers. In July2008, we ended our TFC program.     We purchase automobilecontracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions inwhich we sell a specified pool of contracts to one of our special purpose subsidiaries, which in turn issues asset-backed securitiesto fund its purchase of the pool of contracts. Depending on the structure of the securitization, the transaction may be treated,for financial accounting purposes, as a sale of the contracts or as a secured financing.      32         Securitization and Warehouse Credit Facilities     Throughout the periodsfor which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing themon a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financingshave involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to oneof our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to fund the transactions. Depending on the structure,these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts oras secured financings.     When structured tobe treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobilecontracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically:(i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction,and (iii) record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts. From July 2003 through April 2008, all of our securitizationswere structured in this manner. In September 2008, we securitized automobile contracts in a transaction that was in substance asale, that was treated as a sale for accounting purposes, and in which we retained a residual interest in the automobile contracts.The remaining receivables from that September 2008 securitization were re-securitized in September 2010 in a structure that maintainedsale treatment for accounting purposes. In 2011, we completed three securitizations of approximately $335.6 million in newly originatedcontracts. During 2012 we completed four securitizations of approximately $603.5 million in contracts, including $58.2 millionin contracts that were repurchased from 2006 and 2007 securitizations in 2012. The 2011 and 2012 securitizations were allstructured as secured financings and none utilized financial guarantees.     When structured tobe treated as a sale for accounting purposes, the assets and liabilities of the special-purpose subsidiary are not consolidatedwith us. Accordingly, the transaction removes the sold automobile contracts from our consolidated balance sheet, the related debtdoes not appear as our debt, and our consolidated balance sheet shows, as an asset, a retained residual interest in the sold automobilecontracts. The residual interest represents the discounted value of what we expect will be the excess of future collections onthe automobile contracts over principal and interest due on the asset-backed securities. That residual interest appears on ourconsolidated balance sheet as  " residual interest in securitizations, " and the determination of its value is dependent on our estimates of the future performance of the sold automobile contracts. Ofour managed portfolio outstanding at December 31, 2012, only our September 2010 securitization was structured to be treated asa sale for accounting purposes.     Credit Risk Retained     Whether a sale of automobilecontracts in connection with a securitization or warehouse credit facility is treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financialaccounting purposes, the related special-purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performanceof the related automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of thecash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of such automobile contracts could thereforehave a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and our results of operations, regardless of whether such automobile contractsare treated for financial accounting purposes as having been sold or as having been financed. For estimation of the magnitude ofsuch risk, it may be appropriate to look to the size of our  " managedportfolio, "  which represents both financed and sold automobilecontracts as to which such credit risk is retained. Our managed portfolio as of December 31, 2012 was approximately $897.6 million,which includes a third party servicing portfolio of $11.6 million on which we earn only servicing fees and have no credit risk.     Critical Accounting Policies     We believe that ouraccounting policies related to (a) Allowance for Finance Credit Losses, (b) Amortization of Deferred Originations Costs and AcquisitionFees, (c) Term Securitizations, (d) Finance Receivables and Related Debt Measured at Fair Value and (e) Income Taxes are the mostcritical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Such policies are described below.     Allowance for Finance CreditLosses     In order to estimatean appropriate allowance for losses incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as " static pooling, " which stratifies our finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on the period of origination. Using analyticaland formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable incurredcredit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of automobile contracts. For each monthly pool of contracts thatwe purchase, we begin establishing the allowance in the month of acquisition and increase it over the subsequent 11 months, througha provision for credit losses charged to our consolidated statement of operations. Net losses incurred on finance receivables arecharged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics ofthe portfolio, prospective liquidation values of the underlying collateral and general economic and market conditions. As circumstanceschange, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change as well.      33         Broad economic factorssuch as recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does theweighted average age of the receivables at any given time. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivableshave lower levels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and lossesgradually increasing to a peak between 36 and 42 months, after which they gradually decrease. The historical weighted average seasoningof our total owned portfolio excluding Fireside, is summarized in the table below:       December 31,     Weighted Average Age in Months of Owned Portfolio   2009     33   2010     37   2011     27   2012     18      The credit performanceof our portfolio is also significantly influenced by our underwriting guidelines and credit criteria we use when evaluating contractsfor purchase from dealers. We regularly evaluate our portfolio credit performance and modify our purchase criteria to maximizethe credit performance of our portfolio, while maintaining competitive programs and levels of service for our dealers. As a resultof such modifications, for receivables originated beginning with the third quarter of 2008, we have found the early credit performanceof those static portfolios to be significantly better than most earlier portfolios at similar vintage time frames.     Amortization of DeferredOriginations Costs and Acquisition Fees     Upon purchase of acontract from a dealer, we generally either charge or advance the dealer an acquisition fee. In addition, we incur certain directcosts associated with originations of our contracts. All such acquisition fees and direct costs are applied to the carrying valueof finance receivables and are accreted into earnings as an adjustment to the yield over the estimated life of the contract usingthe interest method.     Term Securitizations     Our term securitizationstructure has generally been as follows:     We sell automobilecontracts we acquire to a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, which has been established for the limited purpose of buyingand reselling our automobile contracts. The special-purpose subsidiary then transfers the same automobile contracts to anotherentity, typically a statutory trust. The trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities, in a principal amount equal toor less than the aggregate principal balance of the automobile contracts. We typically sell these automobile contracts to the trustat face value and without recourse, except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to us areprovided by us to the trust. One or more investors purchase the asset-backed securities issued by the trust; the proceeds fromthe sale of the asset-backed securities are then used to purchase the automobile contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinatedasset-backed securities issued by the trust or by a related entity. Through 2008, we generally purchased external credit enhancementfor most of our term securitizations in the form of a financial guaranty insurance policy, guaranteeing timely payment of interestand ultimate payment of principal on the senior asset-backed securities, from an insurance company. However, in our eight mostrecent securitizations since 2010, we have not purchased financial guaranty insurance policies and do not expect to do so in thenear future.     We structure our securitizationsto include internal credit enhancement for the benefit the investors (i) in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account( " spread account " )held by the trust, (ii) in the form of overcollateralization of the senior asset-backed securities, where the principal balanceof the senior asset-backed securities issued is less than the principal balance of the automobile contracts, (iii) in the formof subordinated asset-backed securities, or (iv) some combination of such internal credit enhancements. The agreements governingthe securitization transactions require that the initial level of internal credit enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collectionsfrom the automobile contracts until the level of internal credit enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained.The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related automobilecontracts. The specified levels at which the internal credit enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performanceof the portfolios of automobile contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement amongus, our special purpose subsidiary, the insurance company and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time totime based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied from one transaction to another. The agreements governingthe securitizations generally grant us the option to repurchase the sold automobile contracts from the trust when the aggregateoutstanding balance of the automobile contracts has amortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance.      34            Our September 2008securitization and the subsequent re-securitization of the remaining receivables from such transaction in September 2010 were eachin substance sales of the underlying receivables, and have been treated as sales for financial accounting purposes. They differfrom those treated as secured financings in that the trust to which our special-purpose subsidiaries sold the automobile contractsmet the definition of a "qualified special-purpose entity" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140(ASC 860 10 65-2). As a result, assets and liabilities of those trusts are not consolidated into our consolidated balance sheet.     Historically, our warehousecredit facility structures were similar to the above, except that (i) our special-purpose subsidiaries that purchased the automobilecontracts pledged the automobile contracts to secure promissory notes that they issued, (ii) no increase in the required amountof internal credit enhancement was contemplated, and (iii) we did not purchase financial guaranty insurance. Since October 2009,we have established new funding facilities and gradually increased our contract purchases. More recently, we increased our short-termcontract financing resources by $200 million by entering into agreements for a $100 million credit facility in December 2010 andfor another $100 million credit facility in February 2011.    In May 2012 we entered into another$100 million credit facility with a new lender and in December we extended the December 2010 credit facility to February 2013.Our current maximum revolving warehouse financing capacity is $200 million.        Upon each transferof automobile contracts in a transaction structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes, whether a term securitizationor a warehouse financing, we retain on our consolidated balance sheet the related automobile contracts as assets and record theasset-backed notes or loans issued in the transaction as indebtedness.     Under the September2008 and September 2010 securitizations, and other term securitizations completed prior to July 2003 that were structured as salesfor financial accounting purposes, we removed from our consolidated balance sheet the automobile contracts sold and added to ourconsolidated balance sheet (i) the cash received, if any, and (ii) the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that we retainedin the automobile contracts sold in the transaction. That retained or residual interest consisted of (a) the cash held in the spreadaccount, if any, (b) overcollateralization, if any, (c) asset-backed securities retained, if any, and (d) receivables from thetrust, which include the net interest receivables. Net interest receivables represent the estimated discounted cash flows to bereceived from the trust in the future, net of principal and interest payable with respect to the asset-backed notes, the premiumpaid to the insurance company, if any, and certain other expenses. The excess of the cash received and the assets we retained overthe carrying value of the automobile contracts sold, less transaction costs, equaled the net gain on sale of automobile contractswe recorded.     We receive periodicbase servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the automobile contracts. Under our securitization structures treated assecured financings for financial accounting purposes, such servicing fees are included in interest income from the automobile contracts.In addition, we are entitled to the cash flows from the trusts that represent collections on the automobile contracts in excessof the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the asset-backed securities, base servicing fees, and certain other feesand expenses (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the asset-backed notes are generally definedas the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of such notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the relatedautomobile contracts (excluding those automobile contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of suchbalance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related securitization agreements require accelerated payment of principaluntil the principal balance of the asset-backed securities is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal paymentis said to create overcollateralization of the asset-backed notes.     If the amount of cashrequired for payment of fees, expenses, interest and principal on the senior asset-backed notes exceeds the amount collected duringthe collection period, the shortfall is withdrawn from the spread account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceedsthe amount necessary for the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated asset-backed notes, and thereis no shortfall in the related spread account or the required overcollateralization level, the excess is released to us. If thespread account and overcollateralization is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the trustuntil the specified level is achieved. Although spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of our special-purposesubsidiaries as the owner of the residual interests (in the case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financialaccounting purposes) or the trusts (in the case of securitization transactions structured as secured financings for financial accountingpurposes), we are restricted in use of the cash in the spread accounts. Cash held in the various spread accounts is invested inhigh quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the securitization agreements. The interest rate payable on the automobilecontracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the asset-backed notes. As a result, the residual interests describedabove historically have been a significant asset of ours.      35         In all of our termsecuritizations and warehouse credit facilities, whether treated as secured financings or as sales, we have sold the automobilecontracts (through a subsidiary) to the securitization entity. The difference between the two structures is that in securitizationsthat are treated as secured financings we report the assets and liabilities of the securitization trust on our consolidated balancesheet. Under both structures, recourse to us by holders of the asset-backed securities and by the trust, for failure of the automobilecontract obligors to make payments on a timely basis, is limited to the automobile contracts included in the securitizations orwarehouse credit facilities, the spread accounts and our retained interests in the respective trusts.     Since the third quarterof 2003, we have conducted 32 term securitizations. Of these 32, 26 were periodic (generally quarterly) securitizations of automobilecontracts that we purchased from automobile dealers under our regular programs. In addition, in March 2004 and November 2005, wecompleted securitizations of our retained interests in other securitizations that we and our affiliates previously sponsored. Thedebt from the March 2004 transaction was repaid in August 2005, and the debt from the November 2005 transaction was repaid in May2007. Also, in June 2004, we completed a securitization of automobile contracts purchased under our TFC program and acquired ina bulk purchase. Further, in December 2005 and May 2007 we completed securitizations that included automobile contracts purchasedunder the TFC programs, automobile contracts purchased under the CPS programs and automobile contracts we repurchased upon terminationof prior securitizations. Since July 2003 all such securitizations have been structured as secured financings, except that ourSeptember 2008 and September 2010 securitizations were in substance sales of the underlying receivables, and were treated as salesfor financial accounting purposes.     Our December 2012 securitizationincluded a pre-funding feature in which a portion of the receivables to be pledged to the securitization trust were not scheduledto be delivered to the trust until after the initial closing. As a result, our restricted cash balance at December 31, 2012 included$45.0 million from the proceeds of the sale of the securitization notes that were held by the trustee pending delivery of the remainingreceivables. In January 2013, the requisite additional receivables were delivered to the trust and we received the related restrictedcash, a significant portion of which was used to repay amounts owed under our warehouse credit facilities.     Finance Receivables and RelatedDebt Measured at Fair Value     In September 2011 wepurchased finance receivables from Fireside Bank. These receivables are secured by debt that was structured specifically for theacquisition of this portfolio. Since the Fireside receivables were originated by another entity with its own underwriting guidelinesand procedures, we have elected to account for the Fireside receivables and the related debt secured by those receivables at theirestimated fair values so that changes in fair value will be reflected in our results of operations as they occur.  There are limited observable inputs available to us for measurement of such receivables, or for the related debt. We useour own assumptions about the factors that we believe market participants would use in pricing similar receivables and debt, andare based on the best information available in the circumstances. The valuation method used to estimate fair value may producea fair value measurement that may not be indicative of ultimate realizable value. Furthermore, while we believe our valuation methodsare appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different methods or assumptions to estimatethe fair value of certain financial instruments could result in different estimates of fair value. Those estimated values may differsignificantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market for such receivables or debt existed, orhad such receivables or debt been liquidated, and those differences could be material to the financial statements.     Income Taxes  We account for incometaxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expectedfuture tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets andliabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities usingenacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rateson deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.      36           Deferred tax assetsare recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognizedfor a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of thedeferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such judgements, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectivelyverified. As a result of the unprecedented adverse changes in the market for securitizations, the recession and the resultinghigh levels of unemployment that occurred in 2008 and 2009, we incurred substantial operating losses from 2009 through 2011 whichled us to establish a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets. However, since the fourthquarter of 2011, we have reported five consecutive quarters of increasing profitability, observed improvement in credit metrics,and produced reliable internal financial projections. Furthermore, we have demonstrated an ability to increase our volumes ofcontract purchases, grow our managed portfolio and obtain cost effective short- and long-term financing for our finance receivables.The tables below summarize key areas of recent improvements in our business:        Trend in Quarterly Pre-Tax Earnings    dollars in thousands      For the quarter ended      December 31,  2012    September 30,  2012    June 30,  2012    March 31,  2012    December 31,  2011     Pre tax income  $ 4,607    $ 2,728    $ 1,340    $ 512    $ 235          Trend in Annualized Net Charge Offs as % of Average Owned Portfolio      For the year ended        2012    2011    2010    2009                                     Annualized net charge offs as % of average owned portfolio  3.6%    4.8%    9.0%    11.0%                                  Trend in Annual Contract Purchases and Managed Portfolio      dollars in thousands        2012    2011    2010    2009                                     Contract purchases during the year  $ 551,743    $ 284,236    $ 113,023    $ 8,599                                     Outstanding managed portfolio at the end of the year  $ 897,575    $ 794,649    $ 756,203    $ 1,194,722          Trend in Weighted Average Securitization Blended Cost of Funds                 Date of Securitization  Dec-12    Sep-12    Jun-12    Mar-12    Dec-11     Name of Securitization  2012-D    2012-C    2012-B    2012-A    2011-C                                            Weighted average effective coupon    2.06%      2.45%      3.15%      3.47%      4.93%           As a result of theseand other factors, we determined at December 31, 2012 that, based on the weight of the available objective evidence, it was morelikely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax assets. Accordingly, wereversed the related valuation allowance of $62.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.     Although realizationis not assured, we believe that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset of $75.6 million as of December 31, 2012is more likely than not based on forecasted future net earnings. Our net deferred tax asset of $75.6 million consists of approximately$62.4 million of net U.S. federal deferred tax assets and $13.2 million of net state deferred tax assets. The major componentsof the deferred tax asset are $62.5 million in net operating loss carryforwards and built in losses and $13.1 million in net deductionswhich have not yet been taken on a tax return. We estimate that we would need to generate approximately $189 million of taxableincome during the applicable carryforward periods to realize fully our federal and state net deferred tax assets.     As of December 31,2012, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $109.9 million and $186.8 million, respectively.The federal net operating losses begin to expire in 2022. The state net operating losses begin to expire in 2013.     In determining thepossible future realization of deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversalof taxable temporary differences; and (b) forecasted future net earnings from operations. Based upon those considerations, we haveconcluded that it is more likely than not that the U.S. and state net operating loss carryforward periods provide enough time toutilize the deferred tax assets pertaining to the existing net operating loss carryforwards and any net operating loss that wouldbe created by the reversal of the future net deductions which have not yet been taken on a tax return. Our estimates of taxableincome are forward-looking statements, and there can be no assurance that our estimates of such taxable income will be correct.Factors discussed under "Risk Factors," and in particular under the subheading "Risk Factors -- Forward-LookingStatements" may affect whether such projections prove to be correct.     We recognize interestand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statementsof operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.      37            Uncertainty of Capital Markets and General Economic Conditions     We depend upon the availabilityof warehouse credit facilities and access to long-term financing through the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralizedby our automobile contracts. Since 1994, we have completed 57 term securitizations of approximately $7.7 billion in contracts.We conducted four term securitizations in 2006, four in 2007, two 2008, one in 2010, three in 2011 and four in 2012. From July2003 through April 2008 all of our securitizations were structured as secured financings. The second of our two securitizationtransactions in 2008 (completed in September 2008) and our securitization in September 2010 (a re-securitization of the remainingreceivables from the September 2008 transaction) were each in substance a sale of the related contracts, and have been treatedas sales for financial accounting purposes. In 2011, we completed three securitizations of approximately $335.6 million in newlyoriginated contracts. During 2012 we completed four securitizations of approximately $603.5 million in contracts, including $58.2million in contracts that were repurchased from 2006 and 2007 securitizations in 2012. The 2011 and 2012 securitizations were all structured as secured financings and none utilized financial guarantees.     From the fourth quarterof 2007 through the end of 2009, we observed unprecedented adverse changes in the market for securitized pools of automobile contracts.These changes included reduced liquidity, and reduced demand for asset-backed securities, particularly for securities carryinga financial guaranty and for securities backed by sub-prime automobile receivables. Moreover, during that period many of the firmsthat previously provided financial guarantees, which were an integral part of our securitizations, suspended offering such guarantees.The adverse changes that took place in the market from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the end of 2009 caused us to conserveliquidity by significantly reducing our purchases of automobile contracts. However, since October 2009, we have established newfunding facilities and gradually increased our contract purchases. In September 2010 we took advantage of improvement in the marketfor asset-backed securities by re-securitizing the remaining underlying receivables from our unrated September 2008 securitization.This transaction was our first rated term securitization since 1993 that did not utilize a financial guaranty. More recently, weincreased our short-term funding capacity by $200 million with the establishment of a new $100 million credit facility in December2010 and an additional $100 million credit facility in February 2011. We entered into a new $100 million credit facility in May2012 and in December 2012, extended the December 2010 facility to February 2013. Our current maximum revolving warehouse financingcapacity is $200 million.        Financial Covenants      Certain of our securitizationtransactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratiosand results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels.In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certaincreditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2012 we were in compliancewith all such financial covenants.     Results of Operations     Comparison of Operating Resultsfor the Year Ended December 31, 2012 with the Year Ended December 31, 2011     Revenues .  Duringthe year ended December 31, 2012, revenues were $187.2 million, an increase of $44.1 million, or 30.8%, from the prior year revenueof $143.1 million. The primary reason for the increase in revenues is an increase in interest income. Interest income for the yearended December 31, 2012 increased $47.5 million, or 37.1%, to $175.3 million from $127.9 million in the prior year. The primaryreason for the increase in interest income is an increase on interest earned on finance receivables of $47.9 million, which isdue primarily to the increase in the balance of finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries. At December 31, 2012 theaggregate outstanding balance of finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries was $868.7 million compared to $718.2 millionat December 31, 2011. Also contributing to the increase in interest income was an increase in the weighted average interest rateon finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate on finance receivables held by consolidatedsubsidiaries increased to 19.6% at December 31, 2012, compared to 18.5% at December 31, 2011. The reason for the increase is thatcontracts we purchased in 2012 had a higher weighted average interest rate than the weighted average interest rate of aggregatefinance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries at December 31, 2011.     Offsetting the increasein interest income on finance receivables held by subsidiaries, was a decrease in interest income on our residual interest in securitizationsof $356,000, and a decrease in interest earned on cash deposits (including restricted cash deposits) of $87,000.     Servicing fees totaling$2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased $2.0 million, or 47.0%, from $4.3 million in the prior year. The decreasein servicing fees is the result of the continuing amortization of our third-party servicing portfolio (owned by a subsidiary ofCompuCredit Corporation) and of our owned non-consolidated portfolio. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, our managed portfolio ownedby consolidated vs. non-consolidated subsidiaries and by third parties was as follows:      38                 December 31, 2012    December 31, 2011        Amount    % (1)    Amount    % (1)   Total Managed Portfolio    ($ in millions)   Owned by Consolidated Subsidiaries                                       CPS Originated Receivables    $ 807.9        90.0%      $ 546.0        68.7%     Fireside      60.8        6.8%        172.2        21.7%     Owned by Non-Consolidated Subsidiaries    17.3        1.9%        42.9        5.4%     Third-Party Servicing Portfolios    11.6        1.3%        33.5        4.2%     Total    $ 897.6        100.0%      $ 794.6        100.0%         (1) Percentagesmay not add up to 100% due to rounding     At December 31, 2012,we were generating income and fees on a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance of $897.6 million compared to amanaged portfolio with an outstanding principal balance of $794.6 million as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2012 and 2011,the managed portfolio composition was as follows:         December 31, 2012    December 31, 2011     Amount    % (1)    Amount    % (1)   Originating Entity    ($ in millions)   CPS    $ 825.0        91.9%      $ 586.9        73.9%     Fireside    60.8        6.8%        172.2        21.7%     TFC    0.2        0.0%        2.0        0.3%     Third-Party Servicing Portfolios    11.6        1.3%        33.5        4.2%     Total    $ 897.6        100.0%      $ 794.6        100.0%        (1) Percentagesmay not add up to 100% due to rounding     Other income decreased$1.3 million, or 11.9%, to $9.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 from $10.9 million during the prior year. Theyear-over-year decrease is the result of a variety of factors including $479,000 in negative fair value adjustments to the portfolioand related debt of the Fireside portfolio in 2012, compared to $626,000 in positive adjustments in the prior year. In additionwe experienced aggregate decreases of $452,000 in recoveries on the receivables from the 2002 acquisition and sales tax refunds.Decreases in other income were partially offset by increases $541,000 from direct mail and related products and services that weoffer to our dealers, and increases of $38,000 in remittances from third-party providers of convenience fees paid by our customersfor web based and other electronic payments.     Expenses .  Ouroperating expenses consist primarily of provisions for credit losses, interest expense, employee costs and general and administrativeexpenses. Provisions for credit losses and interest expense are significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts wepurchased during a period and by the outstanding balance of finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries. Employee costsand general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced.Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomicfactors such as interest rates and the unemployment level.     Employee costs includebase salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of stock options,and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuatewith the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced.      39         Other operating expensesconsist primarily of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, marketingand advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization.     Total operating expenseswere $178.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $157.6 million for the prior year, an increase of $20.4 million,or 13.0%. The increase is primarily due to increases in provision for credit losses and employee costs, which increased by $18.0million and $3.3 million, or 116.0% and 10.2%, respectively.     Employee costs increasedby 10.2% to $35.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2012, representing 20.0% of total operating expenses, from $32.3 millionfor the prior year when they represented 20.5% of total operating expenses. During 2012, we added employees in our Originationsand Marketing departments to accommodate the increase in contract purchases in 2012 compared to 2011. These additions have offsetreductions in our Servicing department staff that have resulted from decreases in the number of accounts in our managed portfolioduring 2012. The table below summarizes our employees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolioas of, and for the years, ended December 31, 2011 and 2012:            December 31, 2012    December 31, 2011        Amount    Amount        ($ in millions)   Contracts purchased (dollars)    $ 551.7      $ 284.2     Contracts purchased (units)    36,030        18,110     Managed portfolio outstanding (dollars)    $ 897.6      $ 794.7     Managed portfolio outstanding (units)      91,549        107,928                           Number of Originations staff      146        91     Number of Marketing staff      89        58     Number of Servicing staff      279        323     Number of other staff      60        58     Total number of employees      574        530        Note that althoughthe dollar balance of our managed portfolio increased by $102.9 million, or 13.0%, from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012,the number of accounts in our managed portfolio actually decreased by 16,379 units, or 15.2%, over the same period. The disparityin the changes of the principal amount versus the units of our managed portfolio is the result of the combination of the 2012 contractoriginations with an average original amount financed of $15,313 and the ongoing maturities, prepayments and charge-offs of olderaccounts with smaller average balances.     General and administrativeexpenses increased by 5.8% to $15.4 million and represented 8.7% of total operating expenses in the year ending December 31, 2012,as compared to the prior year when such expenses represented 9.3% of total operating expenses. General and administrative expensesinclude telecommunications costs, postage and delivery costs and other costs associated with servicing our managed portfolio.     Provision for creditlosses was $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $18.0 million, or 116.0%, compared to the prior yearand represented 18.8% of total operating expenses. The provision for credit losses maintains the allowance for finance credit lossesat levels that we feel are adequate for the probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated. The increase in provisionexpense compared to the prior year was a result of increased contract purchases in 2012 and the related increase in the size ofour portfolio of finance receivables.      40         Interest expense forthe year ended December 31, 2012 decreased $3.6 million, or 4.4%, to $79.4 million, compared to $83.1 million in the previous year.The decrease is due primarily to significantly lower interest rates on the securitization transactions we entered into during 2012compared to the amortizing balances of securitization debt incurred prior to 2012. Those decreases were partially offset by anincrease in interest expense for the Fireside portfolio, which was acquired late in September 2011. As a result, interest expenseon the Fireside portfolio was incurred for only a partial year in 2011 compared to a full year for 2012.     Interest on securitizationtrust debt decreased by $7.3 million in 2012 compared to the prior year. This was caused by lower overall blended interest rateson securitizations completed during 2012 compared to securitizations that existed at December 31, 2011. Interest expense on ourresidual interest financing decreased by $1.8 million as the balance outstanding decreased from $21.9 million at the end of 2011to $13.8 million at the end of 2012.     In September 2011 weestablished a credit facility exclusively for the acquisition of the Fireside portfolio. For the full year 2012 we incurred $15.7million in related interest expense compared to $9.3 million for 2011, which only encompassed the period from the date of the acquisitionthrough December 2011.     Interest expense onwarehouse debt decreased by $2.8 million in 2012 compared to the prior year. Although we significantly increased our contract purchasesto $551.7 million in 2012 compared to $284.2 in 2011, our strategy of utilizing pre-funding features in our securitizations during2012 allowed us to reduce warehouse facility borrowings.     Interest expenseon senior secured  and subordinated debt increased by $339,000 in 2012 compared to the prior year. During 2012, werepaid $11.2 million in senior secured related party debt, although because  there were additions to such debt during2011, the monthly weighted average balance of senior secured related party debt was $59.3 million and $57.6 million in 2011and 2012, respectively. We also issued a net additional $2.5 million in subordinated renewable notes during 2012.     Marketing expensesconsist primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee marketing representatives. These expenses increased by$2.2 million, or 25.9%, to $10.7 million, compared to $8.5 million in the previous year and represented 6.0% of total operatingexpenses. We purchased 36,030 contracts in 2012 compared to 18,110 in 2011.     Occupancy expensesdecreased by $112,000 or 3.7%, to $2.9 million compared to $3.0 million in the previous year, and represented 1.6% of total operatingexpenses.     Depreciation and amortizationexpenses decreased by $129,000, or 19.1%, to $543,000 from $672,000 in the previous year.     For the year endedDecember 31, 2012, we recorded $2.6  million of net tax expense and reduced our valuation allowance for our deferredtax assets by $62.8 million, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $60.2 million. Since the fourth quarter of 2011, wehave reported five consecutive quarters of increasing profitability, observed improvement in credit metrics, and producedreliable internal financial projections. Furthermore, we have demonstrated an ability to increase our new contract purchases,grow our managed portfolio and obtain cost effective short- and long-term financing for our finance receivables. As a resultof these and other factors, we determined at December 31, 2012 that, based on the weight of the available objective evidence,it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our deferred tax assets.Accordingly, we reversed the related valuation allowance. However, if future events change our expected realization of ourdeferred tax assets, we may be required to reestablish the related valuation allowance in the future.     Liquidity and Capital Resources     Liquidity     Our business requiressubstantial cash to support purchases of automobile contracts and other operating activities. Our primary sources of cash havebeen cash flow from operating activities, including proceeds from term securitization transactions and other sales of automobilecontracts, amounts borrowed under warehouse credit facilities, servicing fees on portfolios of automobile contracts previouslysold in securitization transactions or serviced for third parties, customer payments of principal and interest on finance receivables,fees for origination of automobile contracts, and releases of cash from securitized portfolios of automobile contracts in whichwe have retained a residual ownership interest and the related spread accounts. Our primary uses of cash have been the purchasesof automobile contracts, repayment of amounts borrowed under warehouse credit facilities and otherwise, operating expenses suchas employee, interest, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses, the establishment of spread accounts andinitial overcollateralization, if any, and the increase of credit enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions,and income taxes. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet our cash demands. The sufficiencyof internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from thoseportfolios and their related spread accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in our managed portfolio, and the terms uponwhich we are able to purchase, sell, and borrow against automobile contracts.      41         Net cash provided byoperating activities for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $35.0 million and $10.8 million, respectively. Net cashfrom operating activities is generally provided by net income from operations adjusted for significant non-cash items such as ourprovision for credit losses, accretion of deferred acquisition fees, and, in 2012, the net change in our deferred tax assets of$62.8 million.     Net cash used in investingactivities for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $91.5 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $155.0 millionin 2011. Cash provided by investing activities primarily results from principal payments and other proceeds received on financereceivables held for investment. Cash used in investing activities generally relates to purchases of finance receivables. Purchasesof finance receivables held for investment were $551.7 million and $284.2 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.     Net cash provided byfinancing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $59.4 million compared with net cash provided by financing activitiesof $138.0 million in 2011. Cash used or provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to the issuance or repaymentof debt, and in particular, securitization trust debt and portfolio acquisition financing. We issued $558.5 million in new securitizationtrust debt in 2012 compared to $339.5 million of new securitization trust debt in 2011. In 2011 we also issued $197.3 million innew debt in conjunction with the acquisition of the Fireside portfolio. Repayments of securitization debt were $351.0 million and$330.0 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.     We purchase automobilecontracts from dealers for a cash price approximating their principal amount, adjusted for an acquisition fee which may eitherincrease or decrease the automobile contract purchase price. Those automobile contracts generate cash flow, however, over a periodof years. As a result, we have been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase automobile contracts, and on the availabilityof cash from outside sources in order to finance our continuing operations, as well as to fund the portion of automobile contractpurchase prices not financed under revolving warehouse credit facilities.     The acquisition ofautomobile contracts for subsequent financing in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initialovercollateralization, if any, and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuingneed for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, therequired level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established trusts andtheir related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. Ofthose, the factor most subject to our control is the rate at which we purchase automobile contracts.     We are and may in thefuture be limited in our ability to purchase automobile contracts due to limits on our capital. As of December 31, 2012, we hadunrestricted cash of $13.0 million. We had $82.6 million available under one warehouse credit facility and $95.7 million availableunder our second warehouse credit facility (in both facilities advances are subject to available eligible collateral). During 2012we completed four securitizations aggregating $603.5 million of receivables, and we intend to continue completing securitizationsregularly during 2013, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to so. Our plans to manage our liquidity includemaintaining our rate of automobile contract purchases at a level that matches our available capital, and, as appropriate, minimizingour operating costs. If we are unable to complete such securitizations, we may be unable to increase our rate of automobile contractpurchases, in which case our interest income and other portfolio related income would decrease.     Our liquidity willalso be affected by releases of cash from the trusts established with our securitizations. While the specific terms and mechanicsof each spread account vary among transactions, our securitization agreements generally provide that we will receive excess cashflows, if any, only if the amount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and the delinquency, defaults or net lossesrelated to the automobile contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies, defaults ornet losses on the automobile contracts exceed such levels, the terms of the securitization: (i) may require increased credit enhancementto be accumulated for the particular pool; or (ii) in certain circumstances, may permit the transfer of servicing on some orall of the automobile contracts to another servicer. There can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will continueto generate sufficient cash. Moreover, some of our spread account balances are pledged as collateral to our residual interest financingand, under certain circumstances, releases from our spread account balances could be diverted to repay such residual interest financing.     One of our securitizationtransactions, our warehouse credit facilities, our residual interest financing and our financing for the Fireside portfolio containvarious financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimumlevels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, some agreements contain cross-defaultprovisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December31, 2012, we were in compliance with all such covenants.      42         We have and will continueto have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2012, we had approximately $958.5 million of debt outstanding. Suchdebt consisted primarily of $792.5 million of securitization trust debt, and also included $57.1 million in debt for the acquisitionof the Fireside portfolio, $21.7 million of warehouse lines of credit, $13.8 million of residual interest financing, $50.1 millionof senior secured related party debt and $23.3 million in subordinated renewable notes. We are also currently offering the subordinatednotes to the public on a continuous basis, and such notes have maturities that range from three months to 10 years.     Our recentoperating results include pre-tax earnings of $9.2 million in 2012, preceded by pre-tax losses of $14.5 million and $16.2million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. We believe that our 2011 and 2010 results were materially and adversely affected bythe disruption in the capital markets that began in the fourth quarter of 2007, by the recession that began in December 2007,and by related high levels of unemployment.     Although we believewe are able to service and repay our debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If our plans for future operationsdo not generate sufficient cash flows and earnings, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. Failureto pay our indebtedness when due could have a material adverse effect and may require us to issue additional debt or equity securities.     Contractual Obligations     The following tablesummarizes our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands):             Payment Due by Period (1)        Total    Less than  1 Year    1 to 3  Years    4 to 5  Years    More than 5 Years   Long Term Debt (2)    $ 87,189      $ 76,027      $ 9,815      $ 185      $ 1,162     Operating Leases    $ 10,672      $ 2,712      $ 5,020      $ 2,657      $ 283          (1) Securitization trust debt, in the aggregate amount of $792.5 million as of December 31, 2012, isomitted from this table because it becomes due as and when the related receivables balance is reduced by payments and charge-offs.Expected payments, which will depend on the performance of such receivables, as to which there can be no assurance, are $314.8million in 2013, $220.8 million in 2014, $143.8 million in 2015, $83.9 million in 2016, and $29.2 millionin 2017. Similarly, the $57.1 million in debt associated with the Fireside receivables acquisition measured at fair value is estimatedto be repaid in 2013.      (2) Long-term debt includes residual interest debt, senior secured debt and subordinated renewablenotes.      Fordebt that is due in 2013, we anticipate repaying it with a combination of cash flows from operations and issuances of new debt.       Warehouse Credit Facilities     The terms on whichcredit has been available to us for purchase of automobile contracts have varied in recent years, as shown in the following summaryof our warehouse credit facilities:     Facility Establishedin September 2009.  On September 25, 2009 we established a $50 million secured revolving credit facility with Fortress CreditCorp., which matured on September 25, 2011. The facility was structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price ofautomobile contracts by borrowing against a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Four Funding LLC. The facilityprovided for advances up to 75% of eligible finance receivables and the loans under it accrued interest at a rate of one-monthLIBOR plus 12.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 14.00% per annum. As part of the consideration given to Fortress for committingto make loans under this facility, we issued a 10-year warrant to purchase up to 1,158,087 of our common shares, at an exerciseprice of $0.879 per share (we refer to this as the Fortress Warrant). Issuance of the Fortress Warrant required an adjustment tothe terms of an existing outstanding warrant regarding 1,564,324 shares, reducing the exercise price of that other warrant from$1.44 per share to $1.40702 per share and increasing the number of shares available for purchase to 1,600,991.      43         Facility Establishedin December 2010.  In December 2010 we entered into a $100 million two-year warehouse credit line with affiliates of Goldman,Sachs & Co. and Fortress Investment Group. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price ofautomobile contracts by borrowing against a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Six Funding LLC. The facility providesfor advances up to 82% of eligible finance receivables and the loans under it accrue interest at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus5.73% per annum, with a minimum rate of 7.23% per annum. In December 2012 we amended the terms of this facility to extend the maturitydate from December 2012 to February 2013. There was $4.3 million outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2012.     Facility Establishedin February 2011.  On February 24, 2011, we entered into an additional $100 million two-year warehouse credit line with UBSReal Estate Securities, Inc. The facility revolved during the first year and amortizes during the second year. The facility wasstructured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by drawing against a floating rate variablefunding note issued by our consolidated subsidiary Page Seven Funding, LLC. The facility provided for advances up to 76.5% of eligiblefinance receivables and the notes under it accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 6.00% per annum. In February 2012, we amendedthis facility to extend the revolving period from February 2012 to May 2012 and reduced the maximum advance from $100 million to$35 million. There was $21,000 outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2012.     Facility Establishedin May 2012.  On May 11, 2012, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A.The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a creditfacility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Eight Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.4% of eligiblefinance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 6.00% per annum, with a minimum rateof 6.75% per annum. At December 30, 2012 there was $17.4 million outstanding under this facility.     Capital Resources     Securitization trustdebt is repaid from collections on the related receivables, and becomes due in accordance with its terms as the principal amountof the related receivables is reduced. Although the securitization trust debt also has alternative final maturity dates, thosedates are significantly later than the dates at which repayment of the related receivables is anticipated, and at no time in ourhistory have any of our sponsored asset-backed securities reached those alternative final maturities.     The acquisition ofautomobile contracts for subsequent transfer in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization,if any, when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavilydependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations,and the extent to which the trusts and related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitizedautomobile contracts. We plan to adjust our levels of automobile contract purchases and the related capital requirements to matchanticipated releases of cash from the trusts and related spread accounts.     Capitalization     Over the period fromJanuary 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012 we have managed our capitalization by issuing and refinancing debt as summarized in thefollowing table:      44                 Year Ended December 31,          2012      2011          (Dollars in thousands)     RESIDUAL INTEREST FINANCING:                     Beginning balance    $ 21,884      $ 39,440     Issuances      –        –     Payments      (8,111 )      (17,556 )   Ending balance    $ 13,773      $ 21,884                           SECURITIZATION TRUST DEBT:                     Beginning balance    $ 583,065      $ 567,722     Issuances      558,500        339,524     Payments      (349,068 )      (324,181 )   Ending balance    $ 792,497      $ 583,065                           SENIOR SECURED DEBT, RELATED PARTY:                     Beginning balance    $ 58,344      $ 44,873     Issuances      –        12,800     Payments      (11,200 )      (1,600 )   Debt discount net of amortization      2,991        2,271     Ending balance    $ 50,135      $ 58,344                           SUBORDINATED RENEWABLE NOTES:                     Beginning balance    $ 20,750      $ 20,337     Issuances      4,957        3,646     Payments      (2,426 )      (3,233 )   Ending balance    $ 23,281      $ 20,750                           DEBT SECURED BY RECEIVABLES MEASURED                     AT FAIR VALUE:                     Beginning balance    $ 166,828      $ –     Issuances      –        197,263     Payments      (121,413 )      (35,240 )   Accretion of premium      4,579        5,606     Mark to fair value      7,113        (801 )   Ending balance    $ 57,107      $ 166,828         Residual InterestFinancing.       In July 2007, we establisheda combination term and revolving residual credit facility and have used eligible residual interests in securitizations as collateralfor floating rate borrowings. The amount that we were able to borrow was computed using an agreed valuation methodology of theresiduals, subject to an overall maximum principal amount of $120 million, represented by (i) a $60 million Class A-1 variablefunding note (the “revolving note”), and (ii) a $60 million Class A-2 term note (the “term note”). Theterm note was fully drawn in July 2007 and was originally due in July 2009. As of July 2008, we had drawn $26.8 million on therevolving note. The facility’s revolving feature expired in July 2008. On July 10, 2008 we amended the terms of the combinationterm and revolving residual credit facility, (i) eliminating the revolving feature and increasing the interest rate, (ii) consolidatingthe amounts then owing on the Class A-1 note with the Class A-2 note, (iii) establishing an amortization schedule for principalreductions on the Class A-2 note, and (iv) providing for an extension, at our option if certain conditions were met, of the ClassA-2 note maturity from June 2009 to June 2010. In June 2009 we met all such conditions and extended the maturity. In conjunctionwith the amendment, we reduced the principal amount outstanding to $70 million by delivering to the lender (i) warrants valuedas being equivalent to 2,500,000 common shares, or $4,071,429, and (ii) cash of $12,765,244. The warrants represent the right topurchase 2,500,000 CPS common shares at a nominal exercise price, at any time prior to July 10, 2018. In May 2010, we extendedthe maturity date from June 2010 to May 2011. In May 2011, we extended the maturity date of the facility from May 2011 to May 2012.In February 2012, we exchanged certain previously pledged residual interests with new, previously unpledged, residual interestsand extended the maturity date to February 2013. In September 2012, the maturity date was again extended to September 2013 andthe requirement for monthly principal repayments was eliminated if certain pool performance measures are met. As of December 31,2012 the aggregate indebtedness under this facility was $13.8 million.      45         Securitization TrustDebt.   From July 2003 through April 2008, we have, for financial accounting purposes, treated securitizations ofautomobile contracts as secured financings, and the asset-backed securities issued in such securitizations remain on our balancesheet as securitization trust debt. Our September 2008 and the re-securitization of the remaining receivables from such transactionin September 2010 were each structured as a sale for financial accounting purposes and the asset-backed securities issued in thosetransactions have not been and are not on our balance sheet. Our four 2012 and three 2011 securitizations are all treated as securedfinancings.     In March 2010, we enteredinto a $50 million term funding facility with a syndicate of note purchasers including affiliates of Angelo, Gordon & Co.,L.P. and an affiliate of Cohen & Company Securities. Under the term funding facility, the note purchasers agreed to purchaseup to $50 million in asset-backed notes through December 31, 2010, subject to collateral eligibility and other terms and conditions,through the end of 2010. Amounts outstanding originally accrued interest at a fixed rate of 11.00%. In June 2011, we restructuredthe facility to get the senior notes rated investment grade and issued an additional $9.8 million in three tranches of new subordinatednotes. The interest rate on the senior notes was reduced to 9.25% as a result of getting an investment grade rating. Principalpayments on the notes are due as the underlying receivables are paid or charged off, and the final maturity is July 17, 2017. Inconnection with the establishment of this term funding facility, we paid a closing fee of $750,000 and issued to certain of thenote purchasers or their designees warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.41 per share(we refer to this as the Page Five Warrant). Issuance of the Page Five Warrant required adjustments to the terms of two existingoutstanding warrants. The first warrant related to 1,600,991 shares, on which the exercise price was decreased from $1.407 pershare to $1.398 per share and the number of shares available for purchase was increased to 1,611,114. The second affected warrantrelated to 283,985 shares, which was increased to 285,781 shares. As of December 31, 2012, there was $21.3 million outstandingunder the facility and no additional advances are expected to be made.     Senior Secured Debt.   From1998 to 2005, we entered into a series of financing transactions with Levine Leichtman Capital Partners II, L.P. In July 2007 werepaid the final amounts due under these financing transactions. On June 30, 2008, we entered into a series of agreements pursuantto which an affiliate of Levine Leichtman Capital Partners purchased a $10 million five-year, fixed rate, senior secured note fromus. The indebtedness is secured by substantially all of our assets, though not by the assets of our special-purpose financing subsidiaries.In July 2008, in conjunction with the amendment of the residual interest financing as discussed above, the lender purchased anadditional $15 million note with substantially the same terms as the $10 million note. Pursuant to the June 30, 2008 securitiespurchase agreement, we issued to the lender 1,225,000 shares of common stock. In addition, we issued the lender two warrants: (i)warrants that we refer to as the FMV Warrants, which are exercisable for 1,611,114 shares of our common stock, at an exercise priceof $1.39818 per share, and (ii) warrants that we refer to as the N Warrants, which are exercisable for 285,781 shares of our commonstock, at a nominal exercise price. Both the FMV Warrants and the N Warrants are exercisable in whole or in part and at any timeup to and including June 30, 2018. We valued the warrants using the Black-Scholes valuation model and recorded their value as aliability on our balance sheet because the terms of the warrants also included a provision whereby the lender could require usto purchase the warrants for cash. That provision was eliminated by mutual agreement in September 2008. The FMV Warrants were initiallyexercisable to purchase 1,500,000 shares for $2.573 per share, were adjusted in connection with the July 2008 issuance of otherwarrants to become exercisable to purchase 1,564,324 shares at $2.4672 per share, and were further adjusted in connection witha July 2009 amendment of our option plan to become exercisable at $1.44 per share. Upon issuance in September 2009 of the FortressWarrant, the FMV Warrant was further adjusted to become exercisable to purchase 1,600,991 shares at an exercise price of $1.407per share. Upon issuance in March 2010 of the Page Five Warrant, the FMV Warrant was further adjusted to become exercisable topurchase 1,611,114 shares at an exercise price of $1.39818 per share.            46         In November 2009 weentered into an additional agreement with this lender whereby they purchased an additional $5 million note. The note accrued interestat 15.0% and was repaid in December 2010 at which time the lender purchased a new $27.8 million note under substantially the sameterms as the $10 million and $15 million notes already outstanding. The $27.8 million note accrues interest at 16.0% and maturesin December 2013. Concurrent with the issuance of the $27.8 million note, the term $10 and $15 million notes were amended to changetheir maturity dates to December 2013. In conjunction with the issuance of the $27.8 million note, we issued to the lender 880,000shares of common stock and 1,870 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock. Each share of the Series B convertible preferredstock was exchanged for 1,000 shares of our common stock on June 15, 2011, upon shareholder approval of such exchange. At the timeof issuance, the value of the common stock and Series B preferred stock was $753,000 and $1.6 million, respectively. On March 31,2011, we sold an additional $5 million note due February 29, 2012 to LLCP. In April 2011 we purchased from LLCP a portion of anoutstanding subordinated note issued by our CPS Cayman Residual Trust 2008-A, and financed that purchase by issuing to LLCP a new$3 million note which was fully repaid in June 2012. In November 2011, we sold an additional $5 million note which was fully repaidin October 2012. In February 2012, we extended the maturity of the $5 million note that was originally due in February 2012 toMarch 2012 when it was repaid in full. Each of these last three notes discussed accrued interest at 14% per annum.     Subordinated RenewableNotes Debt.    In June 2005, we began issuing registered subordinated renewable notes in an ongoing offering to thepublic. Upon maturity, the notes are automatically renewed for the same term as the maturing notes, unless we elect not to havethe notes renewed or unless the investor notifies us within 15 days after the maturity date for his notes that he wants his notesrepaid. Renewed notes bear interest at the rate we are offering at that time to other investors with similar note maturities. Basedon the terms of the individual notes, interest payments may be required monthly, quarterly, annually or upon maturity.     We must comply withcertain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certainfinancial ratios related to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividendrestrictions. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that wouldallow certain creditors to declare default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2012, we were incompliance with all such covenants.     Forward-looking Statements     This report on Form10-K includes certain  " forward-looking statements ". Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as  " anticipates, "  " expects, "  " plans, "  " estimates, " or words of like meaning. As to the specifically identified forward-looking statements, factors that could affect charge-offs andrecovery rates include changes in the general economic climate, which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to paypursuant to the terms of contracts, changes in laws respecting consumer finance, which could affect our ability to enforce rightsunder contracts, and changes in the market for used vehicles, which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessedvehicles. Factors that could affect our revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools ofcontracts, which would affect our ability to purchase contracts, the terms on which we are able to finance such purchases, thewillingness of dealers to sell contracts to us on the terms that it offers, and the terms on which we are able to complete termsecuritizations once contracts are acquired. Factors that could affect our expenses in the current year include competitive conditionsin the market for qualified personnel, investor demand for asset-backed securities and interest rates (which affect the rates thatwe pay on asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations).   Thestatements concerning structuring securitization transactions as secured financings and the effects of such structures on financialitems and on future profitability also are forward-looking statements. Any change to the structure of our securitization transactioncould cause such forward-looking statements not to be accurate. Both the amount of the effect of the change in structure on ourprofitability and the duration of the period in which our profitability would be affected by the change in securitization structureare estimates. The accuracy of such estimates will be affected by the rate at which we purchase and sell contracts, any changesin that rate, the credit performance of such contracts, the financial terms of future securitizations, any changes in such termsover time, and other factors that generally affect our profitability.      47         New Accounting Pronouncements         Effective January2012, the Company adopted ASU No. 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements inU.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU 2011-04). ASU 2011-04 represents the converged guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) on fair value measurement. A variety of measures are included in the updateintended to either clarify existing fair value measurement requirements, change particular principles requirements for measuringfair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements. For many of the requirements, the FASB does not intendto change the application of existing requirements under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements.ASU 2011-04 was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this update did nothave a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.      Effective January 2012,the Company adopted ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011-05). ASU 2011-05 is intended to increase theprominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and to facilitate convergence of accounting guidance in this area withthat of the IASB. The amendments require that all nonowner changes in shareholders’ equity be presented in a single continuousstatement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12,Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of ItemsOut of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05 (ASU 2011-12). ASU 2011-12 defers theprovisions of ASU 2011-05 that require the presentation of reclassification adjustments on the face of both the statement of incomeand statement of other comprehensive income. Amendments under ASU 2011-05 that were not deferred under ASU 2011-12 will be appliedretrospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of thisupdate did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.     In December 2011, theFASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities (ASU 2011-11). Theamendments in ASU 2011-11 require the disclosure of information on offsetting and related arrangements for financial and derivativeinstruments to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.Amendments under ASU 2011-11 will be applied retrospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginningafter January 1, 2013. The Company is evaluating the effect, if any, adoption of ASU 2011-11 will have on its consolidated financialstatements.      In February 2013,the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive (ASU 2013-02). Thisguidance is the culmination of the FASB’s deliberation on reporting reclassification adjustments from accumulated othercomprehensive income (AOCI). The amendments in ASU 2013-02 do not change the current requirements for reporting net income orother comprehensive income. However, the amendments require disclosure of amounts reclassified out of AOCI in its entirety, bycomponent, on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes thereto. Amounts that are not required to be reclassifiedin their entirety to net income must be crossreferenced to other disclosures that provide additional detail. This standard iseffective prospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The Company is evaluatingthe effect, if any, the adoption of ASU 2013-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     From July 2003 throughApril 2008 all of our securitizations were structured as secured financings for financial accounting purposes. In September 2008,we securitized $198.7 million of our automobile contracts in a structure that is treated as a sale of the receivables for financialaccounting purposes. The terms of the September 2008 securitization provide for us (1) to continue servicing the sold portfolio,(2) to retain a 5.0% interest in the bonds issued by the trust to which we sold the automobile contracts and (3) to earn additionalcompensation contingent upon (a) the return to the holders of the senior bonds issued by the trust reaching certain targets or(b) “lifetime” cumulative net charge-offs on the automobile contracts being below a pre-determined level. In September2010 we re-securitized the remaining receivables from the September 2008 transaction in a similar "off balance sheet"structure. The September 2010 transaction is treated as a sale of the receivables for financial accounting purposes. See "CriticalAccounting Policies" for a detailed discussion of our securitization structure.     Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures AboutMarket Risk     Interest Rate Risk     We are subject to interestrate risk during the period between when contracts are purchased from dealers and when such contracts become part of a term securitization.Specifically, the interest rate due on our warehouse credit facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the contractsare fixed. Historically, our term securitizations have had fixed rates of interest. To mitigate some of this risk, we have in thepast, and generally intend to continue to structure our term securitization transactions to include pre-funding structures, wherebythe amount of notes issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts. In pre-funding, the proceeds from thepre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until we sell the additional contracts to the trust. In pre-funded securitizations,we lock in the borrowing costs with respect to the contracts we subsequently deliver to the trust. However, we incur an expensein pre-funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow priorto subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the notes outstanding, the amount as to which there can be noassurance.      48         Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
