ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The following analysis of the financial condition of the Company should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report. The Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003 include the results of operations of TFC Enterprises, Inc. for the period subsequent to May 20, 2003, the TFC Merger date, through December 31, 2003. The Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002 include the results of operations of MFN Financial Corporation for the period subsequent to March 8, 2002, the MFN Merger date, through December 31, 2002. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   OVERVIEW   Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") specialize in purchasing, selling and servicing retail automobile installment sale contracts ("Contracts") originated by automobile dealers ("Dealers") located throughout the United States. Through its purchase of Contracts, the Company provides indirect financing to Dealer customers with limited credit histories, low incomes or past credit problems, who generally would not be expected to qualify for financing provided by banks or by automobile manufacturers' captive finance companies.   On March 8, 2002, the Company acquired MFN Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries in a merger (the "MFN Merger"). On May 20, 2003, the Company acquired TFC Enterprises, Inc. and its subsidiaries in a second merger (the "TFC Merger"). Each merger was accounted for as a purchase. MFN Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries ("MFN") and TFC Enterprises, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("TFC") were engaged in businesses similar to that of the Company: buying Contracts from Dealers, repackaging those Contracts in securitization transactions, and servicing those Contracts. MFN ceased acquiring Contracts in May 2002; TFC continues to acquire Contracts under its "TFC Programs," which provide financing for vehicle purchases exclusively by members of the United States armed forces.   The Company historically has generated revenue primarily from the gains recognized on the sale or securitization of Contracts, servicing fees earned on Contracts sold, interest earned on Residuals, as defined below, and interest on finance receivables. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company sold some Contracts on a servicing released basis, as part of a program (the "flow purchase program") in which the Company sold Contracts to unaffiliated third parties immediately after purchasing such Contracts from Dealers. The flow purchase program ended in May 2002. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company's gain on sale of Contracts included, $5.7 million and $16.6 million, respectively, representing mark-up on Contracts sold in the flow purchase program.   SECURITIZATION   GENERALLY   Throughout the periods for which information is presented in this report, the Company has purchased Contracts with the intention of repackaging them in securitizations. All such securitizations have involved identification of specific Contracts, sale of those Contracts (and associated rights) to a special purpose subsidiary of the Company, and issuance of asset-backed securities to fund the transactions. Depending on the structure of the securitization, the transaction may properly be accounted for as a sale of the Contracts, or as a secured financing.   When structured to be treated as a secured financing, the subsidiary is consolidated with the Company. Accordingly, the sold Contracts and the related securitization trust debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, of the                                          19   Company on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company then recognizes interest and fee income on the receivables and interest expense on the securities issued in the securitization, and records as expense a provision for probable credit losses on the receivables and other expenses.   When structured to be treated as a sale, the subsidiary is not consolidated with the Company. Accordingly, the securitization removes the sold Contracts from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet, the asset-backed securities (debt of the non-consolidated subsidiary) do not appear as debt of the Company, and the Company shows, as an asset, a retained residual interest in the sold Contracts. The residual interest represents the discounted value of what the Company expects will be the excess of future collections on the Contracts over principal and interest due on the asset backed securities. That residual interest appears on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as "Residual interest in securitizations," and its value is dependent on estimates of the future performance of the sold Contracts.   CHANGE IN POLICY   During August 2003 the Company announced that it would structure its future securitization transactions to be reflected as secured financings for financial accounting purposes. The first two term securitizations so structured occurred in September and December 2003. The Company had structured all of its prior term securitization transactions to be treated as sales for financial accounting purposes. In the MFN Merger and in the TFC Merger the Company acquired finance receivables that had been previously securitized in term securitization transactions that were reflected as secured financings. As of December 31, 2003, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet included net finance receivables of approximately $119.6 million and securitization trust debt of $95.9 million related to finance receivables acquired in the two mergers, out of totals of net finance receivables of approximately $266.2 million and securitization trust debt of approximately $245.1 million.   CREDIT RISK RETAINED   Whether a securitization is treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to the Company if the credit performance of the securitized Contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that the Company uses to fund its operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized Contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both the Company's liquidity and its results of operations, regardless of whether such Contracts are treated as having been sold or as having been financed. For estimation of the magnitude of such risk, it may be appropriate to look to the size of the Company's managed portfolio, which represents both financed and sold Contracts as to which such credit risk is retained. The Company's managed portfolio as of December 31, 2003 was approximately $741.1 million.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   The Company believes that its accounting policies related to (a) Allowance for Finance Credit Losses, (b) Residual Interest in Securitizations and Gain on Sale of Contracts and (c) Income Taxes could be considered critical. Such policies are described below.   (a) ALLOWANCE FOR FINANCE CREDIT LOSSES   In order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses to be incurred on finance receivables, the Company uses a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as "static pooling," which stratifies its finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, the Company estimates an allowance for finance credit losses, which management believes is adequate for known and inherent losses in its portfolio of finance receivable Contracts. Provision for loss is charged to the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance                                          20   by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio and the value of the underlying collateral. As conditions change, the Company's level of provisioning and/or allowance may change as well.   (b) TREATMENT OF SECURITIZATIONS   Gain on sale may be recognized on the disposition of Contracts either outright or in securitization transactions. In those securitization transactions that were treated as sales for financial accounting purposes, the Company, or a wholly-owned, consolidated subsidiary of the Company, retains a residual interest in the Contracts that were sold to a wholly-owned, unconsolidated special purpose subsidiary. The Company's securitization transactions include "term" securitizations (the purchaser holds the Contracts for substantially their entire term) and "continuous" or "warehouse" securitizations (which finance the acquisition of the Contracts for future sale into term securitizations).   As of December 31, 2002 the line item "Residual interest in securitizations" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet includes residual interests in both term and warehouse securitizations. As of December 31, 2003 the line item "Residual interest in securitizations" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the residual interests in certain term securitizations but no residual interest in warehouse securitizations, because the Company's warehouse securitizations were restructured in July 2003 as secured financings. Subsequent term securitizations in September 2003 and December 2003 were also structured as secured financings. The warehouse securitizations are accordingly reflected in the line items "Finance receivables" and "Warehouse lines of credit" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the term securitizations are reflected in the line items "Finance receivables" and "Securitization trust debt." The "Residual interest in securitizations" represents the discounted sum of expected future releases from securitization trusts. Accordingly, the valuation of the residual is heavily dependent on estimates of future performance.   The key economic assumptions used in measuring all residual interests in securitizations as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 are included in the table below. The pre-tax discount rate remained constant at 14%.                                                          2003            2002                                                     -------------  -------------             Prepayment speed (Cumulative).........  18.1% - 22.1%  19.8% - 22.9%             Credit losses (Cumulative)............  11.8% - 18.0%  10.0% - 15.4%  Key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those assumptions are as follows:                                                                                          DECEMBER 31, 2003                                                                                       -----------------                                                                                          (DOLLARS IN                                                                                           THOUSANDS)             Carrying amount/fair value of residual interest in securitizations.............  $      111,702       Weighted average life in years.................................................            3.74        Prepayment Speed Assumption (Cumulative).......................................   18.1% - 22.1%       Estimated fair value assuming 10% adverse change...............................  $      110,938       Estimated fair value assuming 20% adverse change...............................         110,916        Expected Credit Losses (Cumulative)............................................   11.8% - 18.0%       Estimated fair value assuming 10% adverse change...............................  $      100,907       Estimated fair value assuming 20% adverse change...............................          90,312        Residual Cash Flows Pre-tax Discount Rate (Annual).............................           14.0%       Estimated fair value assuming 10% adverse change...............................  $      109,594       Estimated fair value assuming 20% adverse change...............................         107,477   These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on 10% and 20% percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in                                          21   this table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption; in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses), which could magnify or counteract the sensitivities.   The Company's securitization structure has generally been as follows:   The Company sells Contracts it acquires to a wholly-owned Special Purpose Subsidiary ("SPS"), which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the Company's Contracts. The SPS then transfers the same Contracts to another entity, typically a statutory trust ("Trust"). The Trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities (the "Notes"); generally in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal balance of the Contracts. The Company typically sells these Contracts to the Trust at face value and without recourse, except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the Dealer to the Company are provided by the Company to the Trust. One or more investors purchase the Notes issued by the Trust; the proceeds from the sale of the Notes are then used to purchase the Contracts from the Company. The Company may retain subordinated Notes issued by the Trust. The Company purchases a financial guaranty insurance policy, guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest on the senior Notes, from an insurance company (a "Note Insurer"). In addition, the Company provides "Credit Enhancement" for the benefit of the Note Insurer and the investors in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account ("Spread Account") held by the Trust, in the form of overcollateralization of the Notes, where the principal balance of the Notes issued is less than the principal balance of the Contracts, in the form of subordinated Notes, or some combination of such Credit Enhancements. The agreements governing the securitization transactions (collectively referred to as the "Securitization Agreements") require that the initial level of Credit Enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the Contracts until the level of Credit Enhancement reaches specified levels, and then maintained at those levels. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related Contracts. The specified levels at which the Credit Enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the pools of Contracts held by the Trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among the Company, the SPS, the Note Insurers and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various pools, and have also varied by Securitization Agreement. The Securitization Agreements generally grant the Company the option to repurchase the sold Contracts from the Trust when the aggregate outstanding balance of the Contracts has amortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance.   The prior securitizations that are treated as sales for financial accounting purposes differ from secured financings in that the Trust to which the SPS sells the Contracts meets the definition of a "qualified special purpose entity" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 ("SFAS 140"). As a result, assets and liabilities of the Trust are not consolidated into the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.   The Company's warehouse securitization structures were similar to the above, except that (i) the SPS that purchases the Contracts pledges the Contracts to secure promissory notes which it issues, (ii) the promissory notes are in an aggregate principal amount of not more than 71% to 73% of the aggregate principal balance of the Contracts (that is, at least 27% overcollateralization), and (iii) no increase in the required amount of Credit Enhancement is contemplated unless certain portfolio performance tests are breached. During the quarter ended September 30, 2003 the warehouse securitizations related to the CPS programs were amended to cause the transactions to be treated as secured financings for financial accounting purposes. The Contracts held by the warehouse SPSs and the promissory notes that they issue are therefore included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2003 as assets and liabilities, respectively.   Upon each sale of Contracts in a securitization structured as a secured financing, whether a term securitization or a warehouse securitization, the Company retains on its Consolidated Balance Sheet the Contracts securitized as assets and records the Notes issued in the transaction as indebtedness of the Company.                                         22   Under the prior securitizations structured as sales for financial accounting purposes, the Company removed from its Consolidated Balance Sheet the Contracts sold and added to its Consolidated Balance Sheet (i) the cash received, if any, and (ii) the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that the Company retains in Contracts sold in the securitization. That retained or residual interest (the "Residual") consists of (a) the cash held in the Spread Account, if any, (b) overcollateralization, if any, (c) subordinated Notes retained, if any, and (d) receivables from Trust, which include the net interest receivables ("NIRs"). NIRs represent the estimated discounted cash flows to be received from the Trust in the future, net of principal and interest payable with respect to the Notes, and certain expenses. The excess of the cash received and the assets retained by the Company over the carrying value of the Contracts sold, less transaction costs, equals the net gain on sale of Contracts recorded by the Company. Until the maturity of these transactions, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet will reflect both securitization transactions structured as sales and others structured as secured financings.   With respect to securitizations structured as sales for financial accounting purposes, the Company allocates its basis in the Contracts between the Notes sold and the Residuals retained based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of the sale. The Company recognizes gains or losses attributable to the change in the fair value of the Residuals, which are recorded at estimated fair value. The Company is not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of interests such as the Residuals; accordingly, the Company determines the estimated fair value of the Residuals by discounting the amount and timing of anticipated cash flows that it estimates will be released to the Company in the future (the cash out method), using a discount rate that the Company believes is appropriate for the risks involved. The anticipated cash flows include collections from both current and charged off receivables. The Company has used an effective pre-tax discount rate of approximately 14% per annum.   The Company receives periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the Contracts. In addition, the Company is entitled to the cash flows from the Trusts that represent collections on the Contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the Notes, the base servicing fees, and certain other fees (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of the Notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related Contracts (excluding those Contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related Securitization Agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the Notes is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create overcollateralization of the Notes.   If the amount of cash required for payment of fees, interest and principal exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is withdrawn from the Spread Account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations, and there is no shortfall in the related Spread Account or other form of Credit Enhancement, the excess is released to the Company, or in certain cases is transferred to other Spread Accounts that may be below their required levels. If the total Credit Enhancement amount is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the Trust until the specified level is achieved. Although Spread Account balances are held by the Trusts on behalf of the Company's SPS as the owner of the Residuals (in the case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes) or the Trusts (in the case of securitization transactions structured as secured financings for financial accounting purposes), the cash in the Spread Accounts is restricted from use by the Company. Cash held in the various Spread Accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the Securitization Agreements. The interest rate payable on the Contracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the Notes. As a result, the Residuals described above are a significant asset of the Company. In determining the value of the Residuals, the Company must estimate the future rates of prepayments, delinquencies, defaults and default loss severity, and recovery rates, as all of these factors affect the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows. The Company estimates prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable Contracts. The Company has used prepayment estimates of approximately 18.1% to 22.1% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts. The Company estimates defaults and default loss severity using available historical loss data for comparable Contracts and the specific characteristics of the Contracts                                          23   purchased by the Company. The Company estimates recovery rates of previously charged off receivables using available historical recovery data and projected future recovery levels. In valuing the Residuals, the Company estimates that charge-offs as a percentage of the original principal balance will approximate 15.9% to 23.1% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts, with recovery rates approximating 2.2% to 5.3% of the original principal balance.   Following a securitization that is structured as a sale for financial accounting purposes, interest income is recognized on the balance of the Residuals at the same rate as used for calculating the present value of the NIRs, which is 14% per annum. In addition, the Company will recognize additional revenue from the Residuals if the actual performance of the Contracts is better than the original estimate. If the actual performance of the Contracts were worse than the original estimate, then a downward adjustment to the carrying value of the Residuals and a related expense would be required. In a securitization that is structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes, interest income is recognized when accrued under the terms of the related Contracts and, therefore, presents less potential for fluctuations in performance when compared to the approach used in a transaction structured as a sale for financial accounting purposes.   In all the Company's term securitizations, whether treated as secured financings or as sales, the Company has sold the receivables (through a subsidiary) to the securitization Trust. The difference between the two structures is that in securitizations that are treated as secured financings the Company reports the assets and liabilities of the securitization Trust on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under both structures the Noteholders and the related securitization Trusts have no recourse to the Company for failure of the Contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis. The Company's Residuals, however, are subordinate to the Notes until the Noteholders are fully paid, and the Company is therefore at risk to that extent.   (c) INCOME TAXES   The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income and combined state franchise tax returns. The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company has estimated a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax asset whose utilization in future periods is more likely than not.   In determining the possible realization of deferred tax assets, future taxable income from the following sources are considered: (a) the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (b) future operations exclusive of reversing temporary differences, and (c) tax planning strategies that, if necessary, would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into periods in which net operating losses might otherwise expire.   See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   ACQUISITIONS   The Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 include the results of operations of MFN Financial Corporation for the period subsequent to March 8, 2002, the date on which the Company acquired that corporation and its subsidiaries in the MFN Merger. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisition of MFN Financial Corporation.                                         24   The Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003 include the results of operations of TFC Enterprises, Inc. for the period subsequent to May 20, 2003, the date on which the Company acquired that corporation and its subsidiaries in the TFC Merger. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisition of TFC Enterprises, Inc.   EFFECTS OF CHANGE IN SECURITIZATION STRUCTURE   The Company's July 2003 decision to structure future securitization transactions as borrowings secured by receivables for financial accounting purposes, rather than as sales of receivables, has affected and will affect the way in which the transactions are reported. The major effects are these: (i) the finance receivables are shown as assets of the Company on its balance sheet; (ii) the debt issued in the transactions is shown as indebtedness of the Company; (iii) cash posted to enhance the credit of the securitization transactions ("Spread Accounts") is shown as "Restricted cash" on the Company's balance sheet; (iv) the servicing fee that the Company receives in connection with such receivables is recorded as a portion of the interest earned on such receivables; (v) the Company has initially and will periodically record as expense a provision for estimated credit losses on the receivables; and (vi) the portion of scheduled payments on the receivables representing interest is recorded as revenue as accrued.   These changes collectively represent a deferral of revenue and acceleration of expenses, and thus a more conservative approach to accounting for the Company's operations. The changes initially have resulted in the Company's reporting lower earnings than it would have reported if it had continued to structure its securitizations to require recognition of gain on sale. As a result, reported earnings have been less than they would have been had the Company continued to structure its securitizations to record a gain on sale and, accordingly, reported net earnings may be negative or nominally positive for approximately the next year. Growth in the Company's portfolio of receivables in excess of current expectations would further delay achievement of positive net earnings. The Company's cash availability and cash requirements should be unaffected by the change in structure.   The Company's first two term securitizations structured as secured financings closed in September and December 2003. The Company's MFN and TFC subsidiaries completed term securitizations structured as secured financings prior to becoming subsidiaries of the Company. The structures of the Company's two warehouse securitization transactions that relate to the CPS programs were amended in July 2003 to be treated as secured financings for financial accounting purposes. The Company's third warehouse securitization credit facility, which relates to the TFC programs, has been structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes since the date of the TFC Merger.   THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002   REVENUES. During the year ended December 31, 2003, revenues were $100.9 million, an increase of $7.6 million, or 8.2%, from the prior year revenue of $93.3 million. With the change in securitization structure and consequent end to recording gain on sale revenue in the third quarter of 2003, net gain on sale of Contracts decreased $10.1 million, or 61.3%, to $6.4 million in 2003, compared to $16.4 million in 2002. The 2003 gain on sale amount is net of a negative fair value adjustment of $4.1 million related to the Company's analysis and estimate of the expected ultimate performance of the Company's previously securitized pools which are held by non-consolidated subsidiaries. The decrease in gain on sale from 2002 to 2003 was partially offset by a negative fair value adjustment of approximately $2.5 million recorded during the first quarter of 2002 related to the Company's residual interest in securitizations. Also in the first quarter of 2002, the Company recognized a charge of approximately $500,000 related to a loss realized upon the sale of a subordinated certificate ("B Piece") from the Company's 2002-A securitization.   Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $9.5 million, or 19.6%, to $58.2 million in 2003 from $48.6 million in 2002. The primary reasons for the increase in interest income are the change in securitization structure,                                          25   the interest income earned on the portfolio of Contracts acquired in the TFC Merger and an increase in residual interest income. This increase was partially offset by the decline in the balance of the portfolio of Contracts acquired in the MFN Merger.   Servicing fees totaling $17.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $2.4 million, or 16.7%, from $14.6 million in the same period a year earlier. The increase in servicing fees can be attributed to the growth of the Company's managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries related to the CPS programs. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company's managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries had an average outstanding principal balance approximating $489.9 million, compared to $347.3 for the year ended December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2003, the Company's managed portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries had an outstanding principal balance approximating $315.6 million, compared to $117.1 million as of December 31, 2002. As a result of the decision to structure future securitizations as secured financings, the Company's managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries will decline in future periods, and servicing fee revenue is anticipated to decline proportionately.   At December 31, 2003, the Company was generating income and fees on a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance approximating $741.1 million, compared to a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance approximating $595.2 million as of December 31, 2002. As the portfolio of Contracts acquired in the MFN Merger amortizes, the portfolio of Contracts originated under the CPS and TFC programs continues to expand. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the managed portfolio composition was as follows:                                      DECEMBER 31, 2003          DECEMBER 31, 2002                                  --------------------       --------------------                                    AMOUNT        %           AMOUNT         %                                  ---------    -------       ---------    -------     ORIGINATING ENTITY                            ($ IN MILLIONS)     CPS ..................       $  543.8       73.4%       $  394.3       66.2%     TFC ..................          123.6       16.7              --         --     MFN ..................           73.7        9.9           200.9       33.8                                  ---------    -------       ---------    -------     Total ................       $  741.1      100.0%       $  595.2      100.0%                                  =========    =======       =========    =======  Other income increased 42% to $19.3 million in 2003 from $13.6 million in 2002. The period over period increase can be attributed in part to the receipt of state sales tax refunds of $3.2 million during third quarter of 2003 and recoveries on previously charged off MFN Contracts totaling $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $10.5 million for the comparable period in 2002.   EXPENSES. The Company's operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and other operating expenses, which are incurred as applications and Contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and the unemployment level, and mix of business between Contracts purchased on a flow basis and Contracts purchased on an other than flow basis. The Company ceased to purchase Contracts on a flow basis in May 2002.   Personnel costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options, and are one of the Company's most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with the level of applications and Contracts processed and serviced.   Other operating expenses consist primarily of interest expense, provisions for credit losses, facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services (including personnel costs associated with information technology support), professional services, marketing and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization.   Total operating expenses were $104.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $93.3 million for the same period in 2002. Total operating                                          26   expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 would have been significantly lower except for the $11.4 million provision for credit loss expense recorded during the third and fourth quarters of 2003. Such provision for credit loss is a result of the decision to structure securitizations as financings, rather than as sales. Provisions for credit loss expense should be anticipated to increase in future periods.   Personnel costs decreased to $37.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, representing 35.7% of total operating expenses, compared to $37.8 million for the 2002 period, or 40.5% of total operating expenses. The decrease is primarily the result of staff reductions since the MFN Merger in 2002 related to the integration and consolidation of certain service and administrative activities and the decline in the balance of the portfolio of Contracts acquired in the MFN Merger. This decrease was partially offset by staff additions related to the TFC Merger in May 2003.   In connection with the termination of MFN origination activities and the integration and consolidation of certain activities (see above) related to the MFN Merger and the TFC Merger, the Company has recognized certain liabilities related to the costs to exit these activities and terminate the affected employees of MFN and TFC. These activities include service departments such as accounting, finance, human resources, information technology, administration, payroll and executive management. Such exit and termination costs have been charged against these liabilities and are not reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations.   General and administrative expenses increased to $21.3 million, or 20.5% of total operating expenses, in the year ended December 31, 2003, from $20.1 million, or 21.6% of total operating expenses, in the same period of 2002. The decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses is a result primarily of the change in securitization structure during the third quarter of 2003 which increased total expenses, and of continued general cost cutting during the period, offset in part by an increase in legal and other corporate expenses.   Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2003, decreased $64,000, or 0.3%, to $23.9 million in 2003. The slight decrease is the result of changes in the amount and composition of securitization trust debt carried on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet: such debt related to the MFN Merger declined as it was paid down, partially offset by the addition of securitization trust debt associated with the TFC Merger and with the securitizations subsequent to the Company's change in securitization structure. As the Company continues to structure future securitization transactions as secured financings, the balances of securitization trust debt and the related interest expense are expected to increase.   Marketing expenses decreased by $873,000, or 14.0%, and represented 5.2% of total operating expenses. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in Contracts purchased by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2003.   Occupancy expenses decreased by $97,000, or 2.4%, and represented 3.8% of total operating expenses. The decrease is primarily due to the closure during 2003 of certain facilities acquired in the MFN Merger. The decrease was partially offset by the addition of facilities acquired in the TFC Merger.   Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $138,000, or 12.1%, to $1.0 million from $1.1 million.   Income tax benefit of $3.4 million and $2.9 million was recorded in the 2003 and 2002 periods, respectively. The 2003 benefit is primarily the result of the resolution of certain Internal Revenue Service examinations of previously filed MFN tax returns, resulting in a tax benefit of $4.9 million, and other state tax matters which have been included in the current period tax provision. The 2002 benefit is due to tax legislation passed in early 2002, which enabled the Company to reverse a previously recorded valuation allowance of approximately $3.2 million, as well as to record benefit during the same 2002 period. The Company does not expect any comparable income tax benefit in future periods.                                         27    EXTRAORDINARY ITEM. The year ended December 31, 2002 included $17.4 million of unallocated negative goodwill, which represented the difference between the net assets acquired and the purchase price paid by the Company in connection with the MFN Merger.   THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001   REVENUE. During the year ended December 31, 2002, revenues increased $30.7 million, or 49.1%, to $93.3 million compared to $62.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Net gain on sale of Contracts decreased by $16.3 million, from $32.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The primary reason for the decrease in the gain on sale component of revenue is the decrease in Contract purchases to $463.2 million in 2002 from $672.3 million in 2001. This reduction was primarily a result of the termination of the flow purchase program in May 2002. The Company securitized $281.2 million of Contracts during the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $141.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2001. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company sold $181.1 million of Contracts on a flow basis compared to $537.9 million of Contracts in the year ended December 31, 2001.   Gain on sale of Contracts also includes the effect of fluctuations in the Company's estimate of the required provision for losses on certain CPS Contracts and recovery of losses on such Contracts. During 2001, recoveries exceeded the provision for losses; in 2002 the provision for losses was greater than recoveries. During 2002, the amount of Contracts for which the Company recorded a provision for credit losses increased, requiring the Company to provide for losses on such Contracts in an amount exceeding related recoveries. For the year ended December 31, 2002 the Company recorded a $2.6 million provision for credit losses, compared to a reduction of the provision for Contract losses of $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Also during 2002, as a result of revised Company estimates resulting from analyses of the current and historical performance of certain of the Company's securitized pools; the Company recorded a pre-tax charge to gain on sale of approximately $2.5 million.   Interest income increased $31.4 million to $48.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2002, from $17.2 million in the prior year. The increase in interest income is primarily due to the expansion of the Company's managed portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries, primarily as a result of the MFN Merger, as well as the addition of Contracts to the CPS portfolio and the related increase in the Company's residual interest in securitizations as a result of the increased level of securitizations. As of December 31, 2002, the managed portfolio, net of unearned income on pre-computed Contracts, was $595.2 million ($200.9 million represented Contracts acquired in the MFN Merger), compared to $285.5 million as of December 31, 2001.   Servicing fees increased by $4.0 million, or 37.1%, to $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, from $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Servicing fees consist of base fees, which are payable at the rate of 2.5% per annum on the principal balance of the outstanding CPS Contracts (5.0% on MFN Contracts) in the related Trusts, plus any other fees collected by the Company, such as late fees and returned check fees. The increase in servicing fees is primarily due to the increase in the Company's managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries. At December 31, 2002, the Company's managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries had an outstanding principal balance approximating $478.1 million, compared to $281.5 million as of December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2002, the Company's managed portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries had an outstanding principal balance approximating $117.1 million, compared to $4.0 million as of December 31, 2001. Although the Company is paid a servicing fee on receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries, such servicing fee is not recorded separately as revenue, but is included in the interest accrued on such receivables.   Other income increased to $13.6 million in 2002 from $1.9 million in 2001. The period over period increase can be attributed primarily to the recoveries on previously charged off MFN Contracts totaling $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.   EXPENSES. During the year ended December 31, 2002, operating expenses increased by $31.0 million, or 49.8%, to $93.3 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2001 operating expenses of $62.3 million. The Company's operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and other operating expenses, which are incurred as applications and Contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the                                          28   automobile and automobile finance market environments, macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, and mix of business between Contracts purchased on a flow basis and Contracts purchased on an other than flow basis. The overall increase in expenses is primarily attributable to the MFN Merger. Personnel costs increased $13.8 million, or 57.4%, to $37.8 million in 2002 from $24.0 million in 2001. Personnel costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding warrants and stock options, and are the Company's most significant operating expenses, representing approximately 40.5% of 2002 operating expenses. These costs generally fluctuate with the level of applications and Contracts processed and serviced, with the mix of revenue and with overall portfolio performance. Other material operating expenses include facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services (including personnel costs associated with information technology support), professional services, marketing and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization.   In connection with the termination of MFN origination activities and the integration and consolidation of certain activities related to the MFN Merger (see above), the Company has recognized certain liabilities related to the costs to exit these activities and terminate the affected employees of MFN. These activities include service departments such as accounting, finance, human resources, information technology, administration, payroll and executive management. Such exit and termination costs have been charged against these liabilities and are not reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations.   General and administrative expenses increased by $7.5 million, or 59.2%, and represented 21.6% of total operating expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the MFN Merger and an increase in costs associated with servicing the Company's expanded portfolio. Also included in 2002 general and administrative expenses is $669,000 related to the write off a related party receivable from CARSUSA, Inc. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Interest expense increased by $9.6 million, or 66.9%, and represented 25.7% of total operating expenses. The increase is due to the interest expense resulting from the MFN acquisition, including interest expense related to acquisition debt and the interest expense related to its managed portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources."   Marketing expenses decreased by $843,000, or 11.9%, and represented 6.7% of total operating expenses. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in Contracts purchased during the year ended December 31, 2002.   Occupancy expenses increased by $860,000, or 27.2%, and represented 4.3% of total operating expenses. The increase is primarily due to the addition of facilities acquired in the MFN Merger.   Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $119,000, or 11.7%, to $1.1 million from $1.0 million.   The results for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, include net income of $116,732 and $161,710, respectively, from the Company's subsidiary CPS Leasing, Inc.   Income tax benefit of $2.9 million, including the elimination of the valuation allowance of $3.2 million, was recorded in the 2002 period pursuant to relevant tax statutes and regulations. The Company's provision for income taxes was zero for the year ended December 31, 2001.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   LIQUIDITY   The Company's business requires substantial cash to support its purchases of Contracts and other operating activities. The Company's primary sources of cash have been cash flows from operating activities, including proceeds from sales of Contracts, amounts borrowed under various revolving credit facilities (also sometimes known as warehouse credit facilities), servicing fees on portfolios of                                          29   Contracts previously sold in securitization transactions, customer payments of principal and interest on finance receivables, fees for origination of Contracts, and releases of cash from securitized pools of Contracts in which the Company has retained a residual ownership interest, and from the Spread Accounts associated with such pools. The Company's primary uses of cash have been the purchases of Contracts, repayment of amounts borrowed under lines of credit and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses, the establishment of Spread Accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, and the increase of Credit Enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions, and income taxes. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from those pools and their related Spread Accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in the Company's managed portfolio, and the terms upon which the Company is able to acquire, sell, and borrow against Contracts.   Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $99.8 million, $146.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively. Cash from operating activities is generally provided by the net releases from the Company's securitization Trusts and from the amortization and liquidation of Contracts offset by the purchase of finance receivables. The decrease in 2003 vs. 2002 is primarily a result of lower cash releases from the MFN Trusts as the principal balance of the Contracts in those two pools has decreased significantly year-over-year. The increase in net cash from operating activities in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily a result of the decrease in purchases of contracts held for sale from $672.3 million in 2001 to $463.3 in 2002.   On May 20, 2003, the Company completed the TFC Merger (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The acquisition cost was approximately $23.7 million, and was substantially funded by existing cash. Cash flows from the underlying purchased assets are expected to provide adequate liquidity to repay the assumed liabilities and generate positive cash flows from which to fund the Company's operating activities. On March 8, 2002, the Company completed the MFN Merger (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The acquisition cost was approximately $123.2 million, and was substantially funded by existing cash and borrowings. Cash flows from the underlying purchased assets are expected to provide adequate liquidity to repay the acquisition borrowings, as well as generate positive cash flows from which to fund the Company's operating activities.   Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, was $179.8 million, $29.8 million and $536,000, respectively. With the change in the securitization structure implemented in the third quarter of 2003, $175.3 million of Contracts were purchased for investment in 2003 as compared to none in 2002 and 2001. Cash used in the TFC Merger, net of the cash acquired in the transaction, totaled $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Cash used in the acquisition of MFN Financial Corporation, net of the cash acquired in the transaction, totaled $29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.   Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003, was $80.3 million compared with net cash used in financing activities of $86.8 million and $21.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cash used or provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to the repayment or issuance of debt. In connection with the TFC Merger the Company assumed securitization trust debt related to three securitization transactions held by consolidated subsidiaries (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and assumed additional subordinated debt (see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In connection with the MFN Merger the Company assumed securitization trust debt related to one securitization transaction held by a consolidated subsidiary and one securitization transaction held by a non-consolidated subsidiary (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and incurred additional senior secured debt (see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Cash used in financing activities is primarily attributable to the repayment of outstanding debt. With the change in the securitization structure implemented in the third quarter of 2003, $154.4 million of securitization trust debt was issued in 2003 as compared to none in 2002 and 2001. In connection with the MFN Merger the amount of outstanding debt, securitization trust debt and senior secured debt, and the required repayment thereof, increased compared to prior years.                                          30   The Company believes that cash flows generated as a result of the TFC Merger and the MFN Merger will be sufficient to meet the obligations assumed or incurred as a result of such mergers. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet such cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of the securitized pools. At the time of the TFC Merger, TFC had outstanding $6.3 million in principal amount of subordinated debt, which the Company assumed as part of the TFC Merger. Such debt bears interest at the rate of 13.25% per annum payable monthly in arrears, requires monthly amortization and is due in June 2005. At the time of the MFN Merger, MFN had outstanding $22.5 million in principal amount of senior subordinated debt, which was due and repaid in full on March 23, 2002. Such debt bore interest at the rate of 11.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears.   Contracts are purchased from Dealers for a cash price approximating their principal amount, and generate cash flow over a period of years. As a result, the Company has been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase Contracts, and on the availability of cash from outside sources in order to finance its continuing operations, as well as to fund the portion of Contract purchase prices not financed under revolving warehouse credit facilities. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had $225 million in warehouse credit capacity, in the form of a $125 million facility, a $75 million facility and a $25 million facility. The first two warehouse facilities provide funding for Contracts purchased under CPS' programs while the third facility provides funding for Contracts purchased under TFC's programs. On February 21, 2004, the $75 million facility expired and, as a result, the Company's current warehouse credit capacity is $150 million.   Through May 2002, the Company's Contract purchasing program consisted of both (i) flow purchases for immediate resale to non-affiliates and (ii) purchases for the Company's own account made on other than a flow basis, funded primarily by advances under a revolving warehouse credit facility. Flow purchases allowed the Company to purchase Contracts with minimal demands on liquidity. The Company's revenues from the resale of flow purchase Contracts, however, were materially less than those that may be received by holding Contracts to maturity or by selling Contracts in securitization transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2003 the Company purchased $357.3 million of Contracts for its own account, compared to $282.2 million for its own account and $181.1 million of Contracts on a flow basis in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company purchased $134.4 million of Contracts for its own account and $537.9 million on a flow basis. The Company's flow purchase program ended in May 2002.   The $125 million warehouse facility is structured to allow CPS to fund a portion of the purchase price of Contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by CPS Warehouse Trust. This facility was established on March 7, 2002, in the maximum amount of $100 million. Such maximum amount was increased to $125 million in November 2002. Approximately 73% of the principal balance of Contracts may be advanced to the Company under this facility, subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants. Notes under this facility accrue interest at a rate of one-month commercial paper plus 1.18% per annum. This facility expires on April 4, 2004. The Company is currently in discussions with the related parties to renew such facility.   The $75 million warehouse facility was similarly structured to allow CPS to fund a portion of the purchase price of Contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by CPS Funding LLC. Approximately 72.5% of the principal balance of Contracts could be advanced to the Company under this facility, subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants. Notes under this facility accrued interest at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum. This facility expired on February 21, 2004. The Company is currently in discussions with several parties regarding a replacement facility.   The $25 million warehouse facility is similarly structured to allow TFC to fund a portion of the purchase price of Contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by TFC Warehouse I LLC. Approximately 71% of the principal balance of Contracts may be advanced to TFC under this facility, subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants. Notes under this facility accrue interest at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum. This facility was entered into as part of the TFC Merger on May 20, 2003 and has a 364-day term. The Company is currently in discussions with the related parties to renew such facility.                                          31   These facilities are independent of each other. Two different financial institutions purchase the notes issued by these facilities, and three different insurers insure the notes. Up through June 30, 2003, sales of Contracts to the special purpose subsidiaries ("SPS") related to the first two facilities had been treated as sales for financial accounting purposes. The Company, therefore, removed these securitized Contracts and related debt from its Consolidated Balance Sheet and recognized a gain on sale in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. Indebtedness related to Contracts funded by the third facility, however, was retained on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet and no gain on sale has ever been recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. During July 2003, each of the first two facilities was amended, with the effect that subsequent use of such facilities is treated for financial accounting purposes as borrowing secured by such receivables, rather than as a sale of receivables. The effects of that amendment are similar to those discussed above with respect to the change in securitization structure.   The Company securitized $416.9 million of Contracts in four private placement transactions during the year ended December 31, 2003. The first two such transactions were structured as sales for financial accounting purposes, resulting in a gain on sale of $6.4 million (net of a negative fair value adjustment of $4.1 million related to the performance of previously securitized pools). The final two transactions of 2003 were structured as secured financings and, therefore, resulted in no gain on sale. The Company securitized $281.2 million of Contracts in three private placement transactions during the year ended December 31, 2002. All of these transactions were structured as sales for financial accounting purposes, resulting in a gain on sale of $16.9 million (net of a pre-tax charge of $2.5 million related to the performance of previously securitized pools). $141.7 million of Contracts were securitized in one private placement transaction during the year ended December 31, 2001, resulting in a gain on sale of $9.2 million. In March 2004 a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote consolidated subsidiary of the Company issued $44 million of asset-backed notes secured by its retained interest in eight term securitization transactions. The notes, which have an interest rate of 10% per annum and a final maturity in October 2009, are required to be repaid from the distributions on the underlying retained interests. In connection with the issuance of the notes, the Company incurred and capitalized issuance costs of $1.2 million.   Prior to June 2002, the Company also purchased Contracts on a flow basis, which, as compared with purchases of Contracts for the Company's own account, involved a materially reduced demand on the Company's cash. The Company's plan for meeting its liquidity needs is to match its levels of Contract purchases to its availability of cash.   Cash used to increase Credit Enhancement amounts to required levels for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $20.9 million, $24.2 million and $24.6 million, respectively. Cash released from Trusts and their related Spread Accounts to the Company for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, was $25.9 million, $60.4 million and $43.7 million, respectively. Changes in the amount of Credit Enhancement required for term securitization transactions and releases from Trusts and their related Spread Accounts are affected by the relative size, seasoning and performance of the various pools of Contracts securitized that make up the Company's managed portfolio to which the respective Spread Accounts are related. During the year ended December 31, 2003 the Company made initial deposits to Spread Accounts and funded initial overcollateralization of $18.7 million related to its term securitization transactions, compared to $16.7 million in the 2002 period and $2.5 million in the 2001 period. The acquisition of Contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions, and the need to fund Spread Accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, and increase Credit Enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the Company's Contract purchases (other than flow purchases), the required level of initial Credit Enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously                                          32   established Trusts and their related Spread Accounts either release cash to the Company or capture cash from collections on securitized Contracts. The Company is currently limited in its ability to purchase Contracts due to certain liquidity constraints. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had cash on hand of $33.2 million and available Contract purchase commitments from its warehouse credit facilities of $200.7 million. The Company's plans to manage the need for liquidity include the completion of additional term securitizations that would provide additional credit availability from the warehouse credit facilities, and matching its levels of Contract purchases to its availability of cash. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete term securitizations on favorable economic terms or that the Company will be able to complete term securitizations at all. If the Company is unable to complete such securitizations, interest income and other portfolio related income would decrease.   The Company's primary means of ensuring that its cash demands do not exceed its cash resources is to match its levels of Contract purchases to its availability of cash. The Company's ability to adjust the quantity of Contracts that it purchases and securitizes will be subject to general competitive conditions and the continued availability of warehouse credit facilities. There can be no assurance that the desired level of Contract acquisition can be maintained or increased. Obtaining releases of cash from the Trusts and their related Spread Accounts is dependent on collections from the related Trusts generating sufficient cash to maintain the Spread Accounts and other Credit Enhancement in excess of their respective requisite levels. There can be no assurance that collections from the related Trusts will continue to generate sufficient cash.   Certain of the Company's securitization transactions and the warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. The Company was in violation of four of these covenants as of December 31, 2003, including maximum leverage, minimum equity, maximum financial loss and interest coverage. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had received a waiver of such non-compliance from the controlling party. In March 2004, each of these financial covenants was amended with the controlling party such that all breaches have been cured.   The Servicing Agreements of the Company's securitization transactions and warehouse credit facilities are terminable by the insurers of certain of the Trust's obligations ("Note Insurers") in the event of certain defaults by the Company and under certain other circumstances. Were a Note Insurer in the future to exercise its option to terminate the Servicing Agreements, such a termination would have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and results of operations. The Company continues to receive Servicer extensions on a monthly and/or quarterly basis, pursuant to the Servicing Agreements.   CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS   The following table summarizes the Companys's material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003 (dollars in thousands):                                                            PAYMENT DUE BY PERIOD                                               ------------------------------------------                                               LESS THAN    1 TO 3     3 TO 5   MORE THAN                                               ---------  ---------  ---------  ---------                                       TOTAL    1 YEAR      YEARS      YEARS     5 YEARS                                     --------- ---------  ---------  ---------  ---------                    Long Term Debt ............   $102,465  $ 83,328   $ 14,000   $  5,137   $     --       Operating Leases ..........   $ 16,948  $  4,511   $  7,894   $  4,543   $     --  Long term debt includes Senior secured, subordinated and related party debt.   CREDIT FACILITIES   The terms on which credit has been available to the Company for purchase of Contracts have varied over the three-year period ended December 31, 2003, as shown in the following recapitulation:   In November 2000, the Company (through its subsidiary CPS Funding LLC) entered into a floating rate variable note purchase facility under which up to $75 million of notes may be outstanding at any time subject to collateral tests and other conditions. The Company uses funds derived from this facility to purchase Contracts under the CPS programs, which are pledged to secure the notes. The collateral tests and other conditions generally allow the Company to borrow up to approximately 72.5% of the price paid for such Contracts. Notes issued under this facility bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum. The balance of notes outstanding related to this facility at December 31, 2003 was zero. This facility expired on February 21, 2004. The Company is currently in discussions with several parties regarding a replacement facility.                                          33   Additionally, in March 2002, the Company (through its subsidiary CPS Warehouse Trust) entered into a second floating rate variable note purchase facility, under which up to $125.0 million of notes may be outstanding at any time, subject to collateral tests and other conditions. The Company uses funds derived from this facility to purchase Contracts under the CPS programs, which are pledged to secure the notes. The collateral tests and other conditions generally allow the Company to borrow up to approximately 73% of the price paid for such Contracts. Notes issued under this facility bear interest at commercial paper plus 1.18% per annum. The balance of notes outstanding related to this facility at December 31, 2003 was $13.2 million. This facility expires on April 4, 2004. The Company is currently in discussions with the related parties to renew such facility.   One of the covenants within this warehouse credit facility and four of the six term securitizations insured by this Note Insurer requires that the Company maintain additional warehouse facilities with minimum borrowing capacity of $75.0 million. With the expiration of the CPS Funding LLC facility described above, the Company is in breach of such covenant. The Company has until June 20, 2004 to cure such breach prior to it becoming an event of default under this warehouse facility and four term securitizations. While the Company is currently in discussions with several parties about a replacement facility and believes that it will be successful in replacing the facility within the required time frame, there can be no assurances that it will do so. If the Company is unsuccessful in these efforts, the Note Insurer will have the right to declare an event of default. Remedies available to the Note Insurer in such event include, among other things, transferring the servicing rights to the portfolio that it insures to another servicer and trapping excess cash releases to the Company from its warehouse facility and four term securitizations that it insures. To the extent that the Note Insurer was to follow either of these remedies, it would have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and the operations of the Company.   In connection with the TFC Merger in May 2003, the Company (through its subsidiary TFC Warehouse I LLC) entered in to a third floating rate variable note purchase facility, under which up to $25.0 million of notes may be outstanding at any time, subject to collateral tests and other conditions. The Company uses funds derived from this facility to purchase Contracts under the TFC programs, which are pledged to secure the notes. The collateral tests and other conditions generally allow the Company to borrow up to approximately 71% of the price paid for such Contracts. Notes issued under this facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum. The balance of notes outstanding related to this facility at December 31, 2002 was $20.5 million. This facility expires on May 19, 2004. The Company is currently in discussions with the related parties to renew such facility.   CAPITAL RESOURCES   Prior to 1999, and again in 2001, 2002 and 2003, the Company has funded increases in its managed portfolio through securitization transactions, as discussed above, and funded its other capital needs with cash from operations and with the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and/or equity.   The acquisition of Contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions, and the need to fund Spread Accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the Company's Contract purchases (other than purchases made on a flow basis), the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the Trusts and related Spread Accounts either release cash to the Company or capture cash from collections on secruritized Contracts. The Company plans to adjust its levels of Contract purchases so as to match anticipated releases of cash from the Trusts and related Spread Accounts with its capital requirements.                                         34    CAPITALIZATION   Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2003, the Company has managed its capitalization by issuing and restructuring debt and issuing/purchasing common stock and equivalents, as summarized in the following table:                                                                          YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                                                 ------------------------------------                                                                    2003         2002         2001                                                                 ----------   ----------   ----------                                                                            (IN THOUSANDS)                Securitization trust debt:       Beginning balance .....................................   $  71,630    $      --    $      --        Assumption in connection with MFN & TFC Merger .......     115,597      156,923           --          Issuances ..........................................     154,375           --           --         Payments ............................................

The assumption of debt related to the MFN Merger is included in the 2002 activity in the table above.   During the first quarter of 2001, the Company purchased a total of $8,000,000 of outstanding indebtedness held by Levine Leichtman Capital Partners II, L.P. ("LLCP") and Stanwich Financial Services Corp. ("SFSC"). The Company purchased and retired $4,000,000 of subordinated debt held by SFSC in exchange for payment of $3,920,000, and purchased and retired $4,000,000 of senior secured debt held by LLCP in exchange for payment of $4,200,000. The LLCP debt by its terms called for a prepayment penalty of 3% (or $120,000); the additional 2% (or $80,000) paid in connection with its February 2001 prepayment was absorbed by SFSC.   In March 2002, the Company and LLCP entered into an additional series of agreements under which LLCP provided additional funding to enable the Company to acquire MFN Financial Corporation. Under the March 2002 agreements, the Company borrowed $35 million from LLCP as a Bridge Note (Bridge Note) and approximately $8.5 million ("Term C") on a deemed principal amount of approximately $11.2 million. The Bridge Note requires principal payments of $2.0 million a month, which began in June 2002, with a final balloon payment in the amount of $17.0 million, which was made pursuant to the terms of the Bridge Note in February 2003. The Term C Note repayment schedule is based on the performance of a certain securitized pool. As the subordinated Note of the pool is repaid from the Trust, principal payments are due on the Term C Note. The maturity date of the Term C Note is March 2008. Interest is due monthly on the Bridge Note at a rate of 13.5% per annum and on the Term C Note at a rate of 12.0% per annum. In connection with the March 2002 agreements and the acquisition of MFN, the Company paid LLCP a structuring fee of $1.75 million and an investment banking fee of $1.0 million, and paid LLCP's out-of-pocket expenses of approximately                                          35   $315,000. In addition, the Company paid LLCP certain other fees and interest amounting to $426,181. Approximately $1.4 million of the fees and other amounts paid to LLCP were deferred as financing costs and are being amortized over the life of the related debt. The remaining fees and other costs were included in the purchase price of MFN. At December 31, 2003, there was $5.1 million principal outstanding on the Term C.   At the time of the MFN Merger, MFN had outstanding $22.5 million in principal amount of senior subordinated debt, which was due and repaid in full on March 23, 2002. Such debt bore interest at the rate of 11.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. At the time of the TFC Merger, TFC had outstanding $6.3 million in principal amount of subordinated debt, which the Company assumed as part of the TFC Merger. Such debt bears interest at the rate of 13.25% per annum payable monthly in arrears, requires monthly amortization and is due in June 2005.   On February 3, 2003, the Company borrowed $25.0 million from LLCP, net of fees and expenses of $1.05 million. The indebtedness, represented by the "Term D Note," was originally due in April 2003, with Company options to extend the maturity to May 2003 and January 2004, upon payment of successive extension fees of $125,000. The Company has paid the fees to extend the maturity to January 2004. Interest on the Term D Note is payable monthly at rates that averaged 4.79% per annum through June 30, 2003, and 12.0% per annum thereafter. In a separate transaction, the Bridge Note issued to LLCP in connection with the acquisition of MFN, in an original principal amount of $35.0 million, was due on February 28, 2003. The outstanding principal balance of $17.0 million was paid in February 2003. In addition, the maturity of the Term B Note was extended in October 2003 from November 2003 to January 2004. As of December 31, 2003, the outstanding principal balances of the Term B Note and the Term C Note were $19.8 million and $5.3 million, respectively. The Company repaid in full the Term C Note on January 29, 2004 and repaid $10.0 million of the Term D Note on January 15, 2004. In addition, on January 29, 2004 the maturities of the Term B Note and the Term D Note were extended to December 15, 2005 and the coupons on both notes were decreased to 11.75% per annum. The Company paid LLCP fees equal to $921,000 for these amendments, which will be amortized over the remaining life of the notes.   LLCP holds approximately 22.1% of the Company's outstanding common shares. SFSC is an affiliate of Charles E. Bradley, Sr., the Company's former Chairman and Father of the Company's current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and SFSC and Mr. Bradley, Sr. together hold in excess of 5.0% of the Company's outstanding common shares.   The Company must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that the Company maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. The Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants with respect to non-securitization related debt as of December 31, 2003. The Company was in violation of four covenants related to securitization debt as of December 31, 2003, including maximum leverage, minimum equity, maximum financial loss and interest coverage. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had received a waiver of such non-compliance from the controlling party. In March 2004, each of these financial covenants was amended with the controlling party such that all breaches have been cured.   In July 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $5,000,000 of outstanding debt and equity securities of the Company, inclusive of the mandatory annual purchase or redemption of $1,000,000 of the Company's outstanding "RISRS" subordinated debt securities, due 2006. In October 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional $5,000,000 of outstanding debt or equity securities. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had purchased $4.0 million in principal amount of the RISRS, and $3.9 million of its common stock, representing 2,141,037 shares.                                          36   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   This report on Form 10-K includes certain "forward-looking statements," including, without limitation, the statements or implications to the effect that prepayments as a percentage of original balances will approximate 18.1% to 22.1% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts, that charge-offs as a percentage of original balances will approximate 15.9% to 23.1% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts, with recovery rates approximating 2.2% to 5.3% of original principal balances. Other forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "estimates," or words of like meaning. As to the specifically identified forward-looking statements, factors that could affect charge-offs and recovery rates include changes in the general economic climate, which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of Contracts, changes in laws respecting consumer finance, which could affect the ability of the Company to enforce rights under Contracts, and changes in the market for used vehicles, which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles. Factors that could affect the Company's revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools of Contracts, which would affect the Company's ability to purchase Contracts, the terms on which the Company is able to finance such purchases, the willingness of Dealers to sell Contracts to the Company on the terms that it offers, and the terms on which the Company is able to complete term securitizations once Contracts are acquired. Factors that could affect the Company's expenses in the current year include competitive conditions in the market for qualified personnel, and interest rates (which affect the rates that the Company pays on Notes issued in its securitizations). The statements concerning the Company structuring future securitization transactions as secured financings and the effects of such structures on financial items and on the Company's future profitability also are forward-looking statements. Any change to the structure of the Company's securitization transaction could cause such forward-looking statements not to be accurate. Both the amount of the effect of the change in structure on the Company's profitability and the duration of the period in which the Company's profitability would be affected by the change in securitization structure are estimates. The accuracy of such estimates will be affected by the rate at which the Company purchases and sells Contracts, any changes in that rate, the credit performance of such Contracts, the financial terms of future securitizations, any changes in such terms over time, and other factors that generally affect the Company's profitability.   Additional risk factors, any of which could have a material effect on the Company's performance, are set forth below:   DEPENDENCE ON WAREHOUSE FINANCING. The Company's primary source of day-to-day liquidity is continuous securitization of Contracts, under which it sells or pledges Contracts, as often as once a week, to one special-purpose affiliated entity in the case of CPS, or a different special-purpose affiliated entity in the case of TFC. Such transactions function as a "warehouse," in which Contracts are held. The Company expects to continue to effect similar transactions (or to obtain replacement or additional financing) as current arrangements expire or become fully utilized; however, there can be no assurance that such financing will be obtainable on favorable terms. To the extent that the Company is unable to maintain its existing structure or is unable to arrange new warehouse facilities, the Company may have to curtail Contract purchasing activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company is currently in breach of a covenant under one of its warehouse facilities to maintain $75 million in additional minimum warehouse borrowing capacity. The Company has until June 20, 2004 to cure such breach prior to it becoming an event of default under one warehouse facility and four term securitizations. While the Company is currently in discussions with several parties about a replacement facility and believes that it will be successful in replacing the facility within the required time frame, there can be no assurances that it will do so. If the Company is unsuccessful in these efforts, the Note Insurer will have the right to declare an event of default. Remedies available to the Note Insurer in such event include, among other things, transferring the servicing rights to the portfolio that it insures to another servicer and trapping excess cash releases to the Company from its warehouse facility and four term securitizations that it insures. To the extent that the Note Insurer were to pursue either of these remedies, it would have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and operations of the Company.                                          37   DEPENDENCE ON SECURITIZATION PROGRAM. The Company is dependent upon its ability to continue to finance pools of Contracts in term securitizations in order to generate cash proceeds for new purchases. Adverse changes in the market for securitized Contract pools, or a substantial lengthening of the warehousing period, would burden the Company's financing capabilities, could require the Company to curtail its purchase of Contracts, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, as a means of reducing the percentage of cash collateral that the Company would otherwise be required to deposit and maintain in Spread Accounts and overcollateralization, all of the Company's securitizations since June 1994 have utilized credit enhancement in the form of financial guaranty insurance policies issued by monoline financial guaranty insurers. The Company believes that financial guaranty insurance policies reduce the costs of securitizations relative to alternative forms of credit enhancements available to the Company. No insurer is required to insure Company-sponsored securitizations and there can be no assurance that any will continue to do so. Similarly, there can be no assurance that any securitization transaction will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. The timing of any securitization transaction is affected by a number of factors beyond the Company's control, any of which could cause substantial delays, including, without limitation, market conditions and the approval by all parties of the terms of the securitization.   RISK OF GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. The Company's business is directly related to sales of new and used automobiles, which are affected by employment rates, prevailing interest rates and other domestic economic conditions. Delinquencies, repossessions and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Because of the Company's focus on Sub-Prime Customers, the actual rates of delinquencies, repossessions and losses on such Contracts could be higher under adverse economic conditions than those experienced in the automobile finance industry in general. Any sustained period of economic slowdown or recession could adversely affect the Company's ability to sell or securitize pools of Contracts. The timing of any economic changes is uncertain, and sluggish sales of automobiles and weakness in the economy could have an adverse effect on the Company's business and that of the Dealers from which it purchases Contracts.   DEPENDENCE ON PERFORMANCE OF SECURITIZED CONTRACTS. Under the financial structures the Company has used to date in its term securitizations, certain excess cash flows generated by the Contracts sold in the term securitizations are used to increase overcollateralization or retained in a Spread Account within the securitization trusts to provide liquidity and credit enhancement. While the specific terms and mechanics of each Spread Account vary among transactions, the Company's Securitization Agreements generally provide that the Company will receive excess cash flows only if the amount of Credit Enhancement has reached specified levels and/or the delinquency, defaults or net losses related to the Contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies, defaults or net losses on the Contracts exceed such levels, the terms of the securitization: (i) may require increased Credit Enhancement to be accumulated for the particular pool; (ii) may restrict the distribution to the Company of excess cash flows associated with other pools; or (iii) in certain circumstances, may permit the insurers to require the transfer of servicing on some or all of the Contracts to another servicer. Any of these conditions could materially adversely affect the Company's liquidity and financial condition.   CREDITWORTHINESS OF CONSUMERS. The Company specializes in the purchase, sale and servicing of Contracts to finance automobile purchases by Sub-Prime Customers, which entail a higher risk of non-performance, higher delinquencies and higher losses than Contracts with more creditworthy customers. While the Company believes that the underwriting criteria and collection methods it employs enable it to control the higher risks inherent in Contracts with Sub-Prime Customers, no assurance can be given that such criteria and methods will afford adequate protection against such risks. The Company has experienced fluctuations in the delinquency and charge-off performance of its Contracts. In the event that portfolios of Contracts securitized and serviced by the Company experience greater defaults, higher delinquencies or higher net losses than anticipated, the Company's income could be negatively affected. A larger number of defaults than anticipated could also result in adverse changes in the structure of the Company's future securitization transactions, such as a requirement of increased cash collateral or other Credit Enhancement in such transactions.   PROBABLE INCREASE IN COST OF FUNDS. The Company's profitability is determined by, among other things, the difference between the rate of interest charged on the Contracts purchased by the Company and the rate of interest payable to purchasers of Notes issued in securitizations. The Contracts purchased by the Company generally bear finance charges close to or at the maximum permitted by applicable state law. The interest rates payable on such Notes are fixed, based on interest rates prevailing in the market at the time of sale. Consequently, increases in market interest rates tend to reduce the "spread" or margin between                                          38   Contract finance charges and the interest rates required by investors and, thus, the potential operating profits to the Company from the purchase, securitization and servicing of Contracts. Operating profits expected to be earned by the Company on portfolios of Contracts previously securitized are insulated from the adverse effects of increasing interest rates because the interest rates on the related Notes were fixed at the time the Contracts were sold. With interest rates near historical lows as of the date of this report, it is probable that interest rates will increase in the near to intermediate term. Any future increases in interest rates would likely increase the interest rates on Notes issued in future term securitizations and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.   PREPAYMENTS AND CREDIT LOSSES. Gains from the sale of Contracts in the Company's past securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes have constituted a significant portion of the revenue of the Company. A portion of the gains is based in part on management's estimates of future prepayments and credit losses and other considerations in light of then-current conditions. If actual prepayments with respect to Contracts occur more quickly than was projected at the time such Contracts were sold, as can occur when interest rates decline, or if credit losses are greater than projected at the time such Contracts were sold, a charge to income may be required and would be taken in the period of adjustment. If actual prepayments occur more slowly or if net losses are lower than estimated with respect to Contracts sold, total revenue would exceed previously estimated amounts. Provisions for credit losses are recorded in connection with the origination and throughout the life of Contracts that are held on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Such provisions are based on management's estimates of future credit losses in light of then-current conditions. If actual credit losses in a given period exceed the allowance for credit losses, a bad debt expense during the period would be required.   COMPETITION. The automobile financing business is highly competitive. The Company competes with a number of national, local and regional finance companies. In addition, competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as commercial banks, savings and loan associations, leasing companies, credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers such as General Motors Acceptance Corporation and Ford Motor Credit Corporation. Many of the Company's competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, marketing, technical, personnel and other resources than the Company. Moreover, the Company's future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of its capital relative to that of its competitors. The Company's competitors and potential competitors include far larger, more established companies that have access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade rated debt instruments, and to other funding sources which may be unavailable to the Company. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with Dealers and may provide other financing to Dealers, including floor plan financing for the Dealers' purchases of automobiles from manufacturers, which is not offered by the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to compete successfully.   LITIGATION. Because of the consumer-oriented nature of the industry in which the Company operates and the application of certain laws and regulations, industry participants are regularly named as defendants in class-action litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations and consumer law torts, including fraud. Many of these actions involve alleged violations of consumer protection laws. Although the Company is not involved in any such material consumer protection litigation, a significant judgment against the Company or within the industry in connection with any such litigation, or an adverse outcome in the litigation identified under the caption "Legal Proceedings" in this report could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.   DEPENDENCE ON DEALERS. The Company is dependent upon establishing and maintaining relationships with unaffiliated Dealers to supply it with Contracts. During the year ended December 31, 2003, no Dealer accounted for more than 1.0% of the Contracts purchased by the Company. The Dealer Agreements do not require Dealers to submit a minimum number of Contracts for purchase by the Company. The failure of Dealers to submit Contracts that meet the Company's underwriting criteria would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.                                          39   GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. The Company's business is subject to numerous federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, which, among other things: (i) require the Company to obtain and maintain certain licenses and qualifications; (ii) limit the interest rates, fees and other charges the Company is allowed to charge; (iii) limit or prescribe certain other terms of its Contracts; (iv) require the Company to provide specified disclosures; and (v) regulate certain servicing and collection practices and define its rights to repossess and sell collateral. An adverse change in existing laws or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof, the promulgation of any additional laws or regulations, or the failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   The Company will adopt in future periods new accounting pronouncements. For information on how adoption has affected and will affect the Financial Statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   INTEREST RATE RISK   The Company is subject to interest rate risk during the period between when Contracts are purchased from Dealers and when such Contracts become part of a term securitization. Specifically, the interest rates on the warehouse facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the Contracts are fixed. Historically, the Company's term securitization facilities have had fixed rates of interest. To mitigate some of this risk, the Company has in the past, and intends to continue to, structure certain of its securitization transactions to include pre-funding structures, whereby the amount of Notes issued exceeds the amount of Contracts initially sold to the Trusts. In pre-funding, the proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until the Company sells the additional Contracts to the Trust in amounts up to the balance of the pre-funded escrow account. In pre-funded securitizations, the Company locks in the borrowing costs with respect to the Contracts it subsequently delivers to the Trust. However, the Company incurs an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of Contracts and the interest rate paid on the Notes outstanding, the amount as to which there can be no assurance.   The Company is subject to market risks due to fluctuations in interest rates primarily through its outstanding indebtedness and to a lesser extent its outstanding interest earning assets, and commitments to enter into new Contracts. The table below outlines the carrying values and estimated fair values of such financial instruments:                                                        DECEMBER 31,                                       ------------------------------------------                                               2003                  2002                                       --------------------  --------------------                                       CARRYING     FAIR     CARRYING     FAIR         FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT            VALUE      VALUE      VALUE      VALUE         --------------------          ---------  ---------  ---------  ---------                                                     (IN THOUSANDS)         Finance receivables, net ...  $266,189   $266,189   $ 84,592   $ 84,592         Notes payable ..............     3,330      3,330        673        673         Securitization trust debt ..   245,118    245,118     71,630     71,630         Senior secured debt ........    49,965     49,965     50,072     50,072         Subordinated debt ..........    35,000     35,506     36,000     32,800         Related party debt .........    17,500     17,763     17,500     15,400  Much of the information used to determine fair value is highly subjective. When applicable, readily available market information has been utilized. However, for a significant portion of the Company's financial instruments, active markets do not exist. Therefore, considerable judgments were required in estimating fair value for certain items. The subjective factors include, among other things, the                                          40   estimated timing and amount of cash flows, risk characteristics, credit quality and interest rates, all of which are subject to change. Since the fair value is estimated as of the dates shown in the table, the amounts that will actually be realized or paid at settlement or maturity of the instruments could be significantly different.
