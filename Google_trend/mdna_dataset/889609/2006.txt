ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following analysis of the financial condition of the Company should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report.   OVERVIEW  Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. ("CPS," and together with its subsidiaries, the "Company") is a consumer finance company which specializes in purchasing, selling and servicing retail automobile installment purchase contracts ("Contracts") originated by licensed motor vehicle dealers ("Dealers") in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans. Through its purchases, the Company provides indirect financing to Dealer customers for borrowers with limited credit histories, low incomes or past credit problems ("Sub-Prime Customers"). The Company serves as an alternative source of financing for Dealers, allowing sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing. The Company does not lend money directly to consumers. Rather, it purchases installment Contracts from Dealers based on its financing programs (the "CPS Programs").  On March 8, 2002, the Company acquired MFN Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries in a merger (the "MFN Merger"). On May 20, 2003, the Company acquired TFC Enterprises, Inc. and its subsidiaries in a second merger (the "TFC Merger"). Each merger was accounted for as a purchase. MFN Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries ("MFN") and TFC Enterprises, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("TFC") were engaged in businesses similar to that of the Company: buying Contracts from Dealers, financing those Contracts through securitization transactions, and servicing those Contracts. MFN ceased acquiring Contracts in May 2002; TFC continues to acquire Contracts under its "TFC Programs," which provide financing for vehicle purchases exclusively by members of the United States Armed Forces.  On April 2, 2004, the Company purchased (in the "SeaWest Asset Acquisition") a portfolio of Contracts and certain other assets from SeaWest Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, "SeaWest"). In addition, the Company was named the successor servicer of three term securitization transactions originally sponsored by SeaWest (the "SeaWest Third Party Portfolio"). The Company does not intend to offer financing programs similar to those previously offered by SeaWest.  From inception through June 2003, the Company generated revenue primarily from the gains recognized on the sale or securitization of Contracts, servicing fees earned on Contracts sold, interest earned on Residuals, as defined below, and interest on finance receivables. Since July 2003, the Company has not recognized any gains from the sale of Contracts. Instead, since July 2003 its revenues have been derived from servicing fees and interest earned on Residuals (for contracts sold prior to July 2003) and interest on finance receivables (for Contracts purchased since July 2003).   SECURITIZATION  GENERALLY   Throughout the periods for which information is presented in this report, the Company has purchased Contracts with the intention of repackaging them in securitizations. All such securitizations have involved identification of specific Contracts, sale of those Contracts (and associated rights) to a special purpose subsidiary of the Company, and issuance of asset-backed securities to fund the transactions. Depending on the structure of the securitization, the transaction may properly be accounted for as a sale of the Contracts, or as a secured financing.                                         29   When structured to be treated as a secured financing, the subsidiary is consolidated with the Company. Accordingly, the sold Contracts and the related securitization trust debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, of the Company on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company then periodically (i) recognizes interest and fee income on the receivables (ii) recognizes interest expense on the securities issued in the securitization and (iii) records as expense a provision for credit losses on the receivables.  When structured to be treated as a sale, the subsidiary is not consolidated with the Company. Accordingly, the securitization removes the sold Contracts from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet, the asset-backed securities (debt of the non-consolidated subsidiary) do not appear as debt of the Company, and the Company shows, as an asset, a retained residual interest in the sold Contracts. The residual interest represents the discounted value of what the Company expects will be the excess of future collections on the Contracts over principal and interest due on the asset-backed securities. That residual interest appears on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as "Residual interest in securitizations," and the determination of its value is dependent on estimates of the future performance of the sold Contracts.   CHANGE IN POLICY  Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, the Company began to structure its term securitization transactions so that they would be treated for financial accounting purposes as borrowings secured by receivables, rather than as sales of receivables. All subsequent term securitizations of such finance receivables have been so structured. Prior to August 2003, the Company had structured its term securitization transactions related to the CPS Programs to be treated as sales for financial accounting purposes. In the MFN Merger and in the TFC Merger the Company acquired finance receivables that had been previously securitized in term securitization transactions that were reflected as secured financings. As of December 31, 2005, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet included net finance receivables of approximately $13.9 million and securitization trust debt of $6.6 million related to finance receivables acquired in the two mergers, out of totals of net finance receivables of approximately $913.6 million and securitization trust debt of approximately $924.0 million.   CREDIT RISK RETAINED  Whether a securitization is treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to the Company if the credit performance of the securitized Contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that the Company uses to fund its operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized Contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both the Company's liquidity and its results of operations, regardless of whether such Contracts are treated as having been sold or as having been financed. For estimation of the magnitude of such risk, it may be appropriate to look to the size of the Company's "managed portfolio," which represents both financed and sold Contracts as to which such credit risk is retained. The Company's managed portfolio as of December 31, 2005 was approximately $1.1 billion (this amount includes $18.0 million related to the SeaWest Third Party Portfolio on which the Company earns only servicing fees and has no credit risk).   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The Company believes that its accounting policies related to (a) Allowance for Finance Credit Losses, (b) Residual Interest in Securitizations and Gain on Sale of Contracts and (c) Income Taxes are considered to be the most critical to understanding and evaluating the Company's reported financial results. Such policies are described below.                                         30    (a) ALLOWANCE FOR FINANCE CREDIT LOSSES  In order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses to be incurred on finance receivables, the Company uses a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as "static pooling," which stratifies its finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, the Company estimates an allowance for finance credit losses, which management believes is adequate for probable credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in its portfolio of finance receivable Contracts. Provision for loss is charged to the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio and the value of the underlying collateral. As conditions change, the Company's level of provisioning and/or allowance may change as well.   (b) RESIDUAL INTEREST IN SECURITIZATIONS AND GAIN ON SALE OF CONTRACTS  Gain on sale was recognized on the disposition of Contracts either outright or in securitization transactions. In those securitization transactions that were treated as sales for financial accounting purposes, the Company, or a wholly-owned, consolidated subsidiary of the Company, retains a residual interest in the Contracts that were sold to a wholly-owned, unconsolidated special purpose subsidiary. The Company's securitization transactions include "term" securitizations (the purchaser holds the Contracts for substantially their entire term) and "continuous" or "warehouse" securitizations (which finance the acquisition of the Contracts for future sale into term securitizations).  The line item "Residual interest in securitizations" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the residual interests in term securitizations completed prior to July 2003. This line represents the discounted sum of expected future cash flows from these securitization trusts. Accordingly, the valuation of the residual is heavily dependent on estimates of future performance of the Contracts included in the term securitizations.  All subsequent securitizations were structured as secured financings. The warehouse securitizations are accordingly reflected in the line items "Finance receivables" and "Warehouse lines of credit" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the term securitizations are reflected in the line items "Finance receivables" and "Securitization trust debt."  The key economic assumptions used in measuring all residual interests in securitizations as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 are included in the table below. The Company has used an effective pre-tax discount rate of 14% per annum except for certain collections from charged off receivables related to the Company's securitizations in 2001 and later, where the Company has used a discount rate of 25% per annum.                                                        2005              2004                                                  -------------     ------------- Prepayment speed (Cumulative).................   22.2% - 35.8%     20.0% - 30.5% Net credit losses (Cumulative)................   11.9% - 20.2%     13.0% - 20.5%   Key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those assumptions are as follows:                                         31                                                                                  DECEMBER 31,                                                                        ----------------------                                                                                 2005                                                                        ----------------------                                                                        (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)     Carrying amount/fair value of residual interest in securitizations ..... $      25,220 Weighted average life in years .........................................         2.24  Prepayment Speed Assumption (Cumulative) ...............................    22.2% - 35.8% Estimated fair value assuming 10% adverse change ....................... $      25,168 Estimated fair value assuming 20% adverse change .......................        25,119  Expected Net Credit Losses (Cumulative) ................................    11.9% - 20.2% Estimated fair value assuming 10% adverse change ....................... $      23,937 Estimated fair value assuming 20% adverse change .......................        22,656  Residual Cash Flows Discount Rate (Annual) .............................    14.0% - 25.0% Estimated fair value assuming 10% adverse change ....................... $      24,636 Estimated fair value assuming 20% adverse change .......................        24,071    These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on 10% and 20% percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption; in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses), which could magnify or counteract the sensitivities.  The Company's securitization structure has generally been as follows:  The Company sells Contracts it acquires to a wholly-owned Special Purpose Subsidiary ("SPS"), which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the Company's Contracts. The SPS then transfers the same Contracts to another entity, typically a statutory trust ("Trust"). The Trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities ("Notes"), in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal balance of the Contracts. The Company typically sells these Contracts to the Trust at face value and without recourse, except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the Dealer to the Company are provided by the Company to the Trust. One or more investors purchase the Notes issued by the Trust; the proceeds from the sale of the Notes are then used to purchase the Contracts from the Company. The Company may retain or sell subordinated Notes issued by the Trust or by a related entity. The Company purchases a financial guaranty insurance policy, guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest on the senior Notes, from an insurance company (a "Note Insurer"). In addition, the Company provides "Credit Enhancement" for the benefit of the Note Insurer and the investors in the form of an initial cash deposit to a bank account ("Spread Account") held by the Trust, in the form of overcollateralization of the Notes, where the principal balance of the Notes issued is less than the principal balance of the Contracts, in the form of subordinated Notes, or some combination of such Credit Enhancements. The agreements governing the securitization transactions (collectively referred to as the "Securitization Agreements") require that the initial level of Credit Enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the Contracts until the level of Credit Enhancement reaches specified levels which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related Contracts. The specified levels at which the Credit Enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of Contracts held by the Trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among the Company, the SPS, the Note Insurers and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied by Securitization Agreement. The Securitization Agreements generally grant the Company the option to repurchase the sold Contracts from the Trust when the aggregate outstanding balance of the Contracts has amortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance.                                         32   The prior securitizations that were treated as sales for financial accounting purposes differ from secured financings in that the Trust to which the SPS sold the Contracts met the definition of a "qualified special purpose entity" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 ("SFAS 140"). As a result, assets and liabilities of the Trust are not consolidated into the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The Company's warehouse securitization structures were similar to the above, except that (i) the SPS that purchases the Contracts pledges the Contracts to secure promissory notes which it issues, (ii) the promissory notes are in an aggregate principal amount of not more than 80.0% of the aggregate principal balance of the Contracts (that is, at least 20.0% overcollateralization), and (iii) no increase in the required amount of Credit Enhancement is contemplated unless certain portfolio performance tests are breached. During the quarter ended September 30, 2003 the warehouse securitizations related to the CPS Programs were amended to cause the transactions to be treated as secured financings for financial accounting purposes. The Contracts held by the warehouse SPSs and the promissory notes that they issue are therefore included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 as assets and liabilities, respectively.   Upon each sale of Contracts in a securitization structured as a secured financing, whether a term securitization or a warehouse securitization, the Company retains on its Consolidated Balance Sheet the Contracts securitized as assets and records the Notes issued in the transaction as indebtedness of the Company.  Under the prior securitizations structured as sales for financial accounting purposes, the Company removed from its Consolidated Balance Sheet the Contracts sold and added to its Consolidated Balance Sheet (i) the cash received, if any, and (ii) the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that the Company retains in Contracts sold in the securitization. That retained or residual interest (the "Residual") consists of (a) the cash held in the Spread Account, if any, (b) overcollateralization, if any, (c) subordinated Notes retained, if any, and (d) receivables from Trust, which include the net interest receivables ("NIRs"). NIRs represent the estimated discounted cash flows to be received from the Trust in the future, net of principal and interest payable with respect to the Notes, and certain expenses. The excess of the cash received and the assets retained by the Company over the carrying value of the Contracts sold, less transaction costs, equals the net gain on sale of Contracts recorded by the Company. Until the maturity of these transactions, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet will reflect both securitization transactions structured as sales and others structured as secured financings.  With respect to securitizations structured as sales for financial accounting purposes, the Company allocates its basis in the Contracts between the Notes sold and the Residuals retained based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of the sale. The Company recognizes gains or losses attributable to the change in the fair value of the Residuals, which are recorded at estimated fair value. The Company is not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of interests such as the Residuals; accordingly, the Company determines the estimated fair value of the Residuals by discounting the amount of anticipated cash flows that it estimates will be released to the Company in the future (the cash out method), using a discount rate that the Company believes is appropriate for the risks involved. The anticipated cash flows include collections from both current and charged off receivables. The Company has used an effective pre-tax discount rate of 14% per annum except for certain collections from charged off receivables related to the Company's securitizations in 2001 and later where the Company has used a discount rate of 25% per annum.  The Company receives periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the Contracts. In addition, the Company is entitled to the cash flows from the Trusts that represent collections on the Contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the Notes, the base servicing fees, and certain other fees (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of the Notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related Contracts (excluding those Contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related Securitization Agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the Notes is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create overcollateralization of the Notes.                                         33   If the amount of cash required for payment of fees, interest and principal exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is withdrawn from the Spread Account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations, and there is no shortfall in the related Spread Account or other form of Credit Enhancement, the excess is released to the Company, or in certain cases is transferred to other Spread Accounts related to transactions insured by the same Note Insurer that may be below their required levels. If the total Credit Enhancement amount is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the Trust until the specified level is achieved. Although Spread Account balances are held by the Trusts on behalf of the Company's SPS as the owner of the Residuals (in the case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes) or the Trusts (in the case of securitization transactions structured as secured financings for financial accounting purposes), the cash in the Spread Accounts is restricted from use by the Company. Cash held in the various Spread Accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the Securitization Agreements. The interest rate payable on the Contracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the Notes. As a result, the Residuals described above are a significant asset of the Company. In determining the value of the Residuals, the Company must estimate the future rates of prepayments, delinquencies, defaults, default loss severity, and recovery rates, as all of these factors affect the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows. The Company estimates prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable Contracts. As of December 31, 2005, the Company used prepayment estimates of approximately 22.2% to 35.8% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts. The Company estimates defaults and default loss severity using available historical loss data for comparable Contracts and the specific characteristics of the Contracts purchased by the Company. The Company estimates recovery rates of previously charged off receivables using available historical recovery data. In valuing the Residuals as of December 31, 2005, the Company estimates that charge-offs as a percentage of the original principal balance will approximate 15.9% to 26.1% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts, with recovery rates approximating 4.0% to 5.9% of the original principal balance.  Following a securitization that is structured as a sale for financial accounting purposes, interest income is recognized on the balance of the Residuals. In addition, the Company will recognize as a gain additional revenue from the Residuals if the actual performance of the Contracts is better than the Company's estimate of the value of the residual. If the actual performance of the Contracts were worse than the Company's estimate, then a downward adjustment to the carrying value of the Residuals and a related impairment charge would be required. In a securitization structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes, interest income is recognized when accrued under the terms of the related Contracts and, therefore, presents less potential for fluctuations in performance when compared to the approach used in a transaction structured as a sale for financial accounting purposes.  In all the Company's term securitizations, whether treated as secured financings or as sales, the Company has sold the receivables (through a subsidiary) to the securitization Trust. The difference between the two structures is that in securitizations that are treated as secured financings the Company reports the assets and liabilities of the securitization Trust on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under both structures the Noteholders' and the related securitization Trusts' recourse to the Company for failure of the Contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis is limited to the Company's Finance receivables, Spread Accounts and Residuals.   (c) INCOME TAXES  The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and combined or stand-alone state franchise tax returns for certain states. The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company has estimated a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax asset whose utilization in future periods is not more than likely.                                         34    In determining the possible realization of deferred tax assets, future taxable income from the following sources are considered: (a) the reversal of taxable temporary differences; (b) future operations exclusive of reversing temporary differences; and (c) tax planning strategies that, if necessary, would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into periods in which net operating losses might otherwise expire.  See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  EFFECTS OF CHANGE IN SECURITIZATION STRUCTURE  The Company's decision in the third quarter of 2003 to structure securitization transactions as borrowings secured by receivables for financial accounting purposes, rather than as sales of receivables, has affected and will affect the way in which the transactions are reported. The major effects are these: (i) the finance receivables are shown as assets of the Company on its balance sheet; (ii) the debt issued in the transactions is shown as indebtedness of the Company; (iii) cash deposited to enhance the credit of the securitization transactions ("Spread Accounts") is shown as "Restricted cash" on the Company's balance sheet; (iv) cash collected from borrowers and other sources related to the receivables prior to making the required payments under the Securitization Agreements is also shown as "Restricted cash" on the Company's balance sheet; (v) the servicing fee that the Company receives in connection with such receivables is recorded as a portion of the interest earned on such receivables in the Company's statements of operations; (vi) the Company has initially and periodically recorded as expense a provision for estimated credit losses on the receivables in the Company's statements of operations; and (vii) of scheduled payments on the receivables and on the debt issued in the transactions, the portion representing interest is recorded as interest income and expense, respectively, in the Company's statements of operations.  These changes collectively represent a deferral of revenue and acceleration of expenses, and thus a more conservative approach to accounting for the Company's operations compared to the previous term securitization transactions, which were accounted for as sales at the consummation of the transaction. The changes have resulted in the Company's initially reporting lower earnings than it would have reported if it had continued to structure its securitizations to require recognition of gain on sale. It should also be noted that growth in the Company's portfolio of receivables would result in an increase in expenses in the form of provision for credit losses, and would initially have a negative effect on net earnings. The Company's cash availability and cash requirements should be unaffected by the change in structure.  Since July 2003, the Company has conducted 10 term securitizations of Contracts originated under the CPS Programs structured as secured financings, generally on a quarterly basis. In March 2004 and November 2005, the Company completed securitizations of its retained interests in other securitizations previously sponsored by the Company and its affiliates. The debt from the March 2004 transaction was repaid in August 2005. In June 2004, the Company completed a term securitization of Contracts purchased in the SeaWest Asset Acquisition and under the TFC Programs. In December 2005, the Company completed a securitization that included Contracts purchased under the TFC Programs, the CPS Programs and Contracts re-acquired by the Company as a result of clean-ups of prior securitizations of its MFN and TFC subsidiaries. Since July 2003, all of the Company's securitizations have been structured as secured financings.                                         35   THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004  REVENUES. During the year ended December 31, 2005, revenues were $193.7 million, an increase of $61.0 million, or 46.0%, from the prior year revenue of $132.7 million. The primary reason for the increase in revenues is an increase in interest income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $66.0 million, or 62.4%, to $171.8 million in 2005 from $105.8 million in 2004. The primary reason for the increase in interest income is the growth of the finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries on the Company's balance sheet. During 2005, the Company purchased $691.3 million of Contracts and increased its balance of receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2005 from $619.8 million at December 31, 2004, an increase of 61.4%. Offsetting the increase in interest income were decreases in the balance of receivables from the SeaWest Acquisitions and the TFC and MFN subsidiaries, which resulted in decreases in interest income of $1.8 million, $2.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively.  Servicing fees totaling $6.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased $5.8 million, or 46.7%, from $12.5 million in the same period a year earlier. The decrease in servicing fees is the result of the change in securitization structure and the consequent decline in the Company's managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries, and the decrease in the SeaWest Third Party Portfolio. As a result of the decision to structure future securitizations as secured financings, the Company's managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries will continue to decline in future periods, and servicing fee revenue is anticipated to decline proportionately. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company's managed portfolio owned by consolidated vs. non-consolidated subsidiaries and other third parties was as follows:                                                    December 31, 2005    December 31, 2004                                              --------------------  ------------------                                                Amount        %      Amount       %                                              ----------   -------  --------   -------          Total Managed Portfolio                                (Dollars in millions) Owned by Consolidated Subsidiaries .......   $  1,000.6    89.2%   $  619.8    68.3% Owned by Non-Consolidated Subdiaries .....        103.1     9.2%      233.6    25.8% SeaWest Third Party Portfolio ............         18.0     1.6%       53.5     5.9%                                              ----------   -------  --------   ------- Total ....................................   $  1,121.7   100.0%   $  906.9   100.0%                                              ==========   =======  ========   =======   At December 31, 2005, the Company was generating income and fees on a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance approximating $1.1 billion (this amount includes $18.0 million related to the SeaWest Third Party Portfolio on which the Company earns only servicing fees), compared to a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance approximating $906.9 million as of December 31, 2004. As the portfolios of Contracts acquired in the MFN Merger and the TFC Merger decrease, the portfolio of Contracts originated under the CPS Programs continues to expand. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the managed portfolio composition was as follows:                                                 December 31, 2005    December 31, 2004                                              --------------------  ------------------                                                Amount        %      Amount       %                                              ----------   -------  --------   ------- Originating Entity                                     (Dollars in millions) CPS ......................................   $  1,017.3    90.7%   $  706.8    77.9% TFC ......................................         68.6     6.1%       89.4     9.9% MFN ......................................          2.5     0.1%       17.8     2.0% SeaWest ..................................         15.3     1.4%       39.4     4.3% SeaWest Third Party Portfolio ............         18.0     1.6%       53.5     5.9%                                              ----------   -------  --------   ------- Total ....................................   $  1,121.7   100.0%   $  906.9   100.0%                                              ==========   =======  ========   =======    Other income increased $822,000, or 5.7%, to $15.2 million during 2005 from $14.4 million in 2004. During 2005, other income included $2.4 million from the sale of charged off receivables acquired in the MFN Merger, the TFC Merger and the SeaWest Asset Acquisition, compared to no such proceeds in 2004. Recoveries on MFN receivables decreased by $3.1 million to $4.9 million in 2005, compared to $8.0 million in 2004. Other income associated with direct mail services                                          36   increased by $765,000 to $4.5 million compared to $3.8 million in 2004. These direct mail services are provided to the Company's Dealers and represent direct mail products which consist of customized solicitations targeted to prospective vehicle purchasers, in proximity to the Dealer, who are likely to meet the Company's credit criteria.  EXPENSES. The Company's operating expenses consist primarily of employee costs and other operating expenses, which are incurred as applications and Contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and the unemployment level.  Employee costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding warrants and stock options, and are one of the Company's most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with the level of applications and Contracts processed and serviced.  Other operating expenses consist primarily of interest expense, provisions for credit losses, facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services (including employee costs associated with information technology support), professional services, marketing and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization.  Total operating expenses were $190.3 million for 2005, compared to $148.6 million for 2004. The increase is primarily due to a $26.4 million increase, or 81.0% in the provision for credit losses to $59.0 million during the 2005 period as compared to $32.6 million in the 2004 period. Interest expense increased by $19.5 million to $51.7 million from $32.1 million in 2004, an increase of 60.7%. The increase is primarily the result of the amount of securitization trust debt carried on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet which increased along with the growth of the Company's portfolio of finance receivables. The increase was somewhat offset by the decrease in securitization trust debt acquired in the MFN Merger and the TFC Merger. For 2005, the provision for credit losses and interest expense represented 31.0% and 27.1%, respectively, of total operating expenses, compared to 21.9% and 21.6% in 2004.  Employee costs increased to $40.4 million, or 5.8% during 2005, representing 21.2% of total operating expenses, from $38.2 million for 2004, or 25.7% of total operating expenses. The decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher total of operating expenses, primarily a result of the increased provision for credit losses and interest expense.  General and administrative expenses increased slightly to $23.1 million, or 12.1% of total operating expenses, in 2005, as compared to $21.3 million, or 14.3% of total operating expenses, in 2004. The decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher operating expenses primarily a result of the increased provision for credit losses and interest expense. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized what management believes will be a one-time, non-cash impairment charge of $1.9 million against certain non Finance receivables related assets.  In December 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved accelerated vesting of all the outstanding stock options issued by the Company. Options to purchase 2,113,998 shares of the Company's common stock, which would otherwise have vested from time to time through 2010, became immediately exercisable as a result of the acceleration of vesting. The decision to accelerate the vesting of the options was made primarily to reduce non-cash compensation expenses that would have been recorded in the Company's income statement in future periods upon the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123R in January 2006. The Company estimates that approximately $3.5 million of future non-cash compensation expense will be eliminated as a result of the acceleration of vesting.                                         37   At the time of the acceleration of vesting, the Company accounted for its stock options in accordance with Accounting Principals Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Consequently, the acceleration of vesting resulted in non-cash compensation charge of $427,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005.  For 2005, the Company recognized no impairment loss on its residual interest in securitizations compared to $11.8 million in 2004. In 2004, such impairment loss related to the Company's analysis and estimate of the expected ultimate performance of the Company's previously securitized pools that are held by non-consolidated subsidiaries and the residual interest in securitizations. The impairment loss was a result of the actual net loss and prepayment rates exceeding the Company's previous estimates for the Contracts held by non-consolidated subsidiaries.  Marketing expenses increased by $3.7 million, or 43.9%, and represented 6.3% of total operating expenses. The increase is primarily due to the increase in Contracts purchased by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2004.  Occupancy expenses decreased by $120,000, or 3.4%, and represented 1.8% of total operating expenses. The decrease is primarily due to the closure and sub-leasing during 2005 of certain facilities acquired in the MFN Merger and the TFC Merger.  Depreciation and amortization expenses remained essentially unchanged at $790,000 for 2005 and represented 0.4% of total operating expenses.  The Company would have recorded income tax expense of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, but the income tax expense was offset primarily by a $1.4 million decrease in the valuation allowance that has been established to offset the Company's deferred tax assets.   THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003  REVENUES. During the year ended December 31, 2004, revenues were $132.7 million, an increase of $27.7 million, or 26.4%, from the prior year revenue of $105.0 million. The primary reason for the increase in revenues is an increase in interest income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $47.7 million, or 81.9%, to $105.8 million in 2004 from $58.2 million in 2003. The primary reasons for the increase in interest income are the change in securitization structure implemented during the third quarter of 2003 as described above (an increase of $56.0 million) and the interest income earned on the portfolios of Contracts acquired in the TFC Merger (an increase of $7.2 million) and the SeaWest Asset Acquisition (an increase of $6.1 million). This increase was partially offset by the decline in the balance of the portfolio of Contracts acquired in the MFN Merger (resulting in a decrease of $10.1 million in interest income) and a decrease in residual interest income (a decrease of $11.6 million).  The increase in interest income is offset in part by the elimination of net gain on sale of Contracts revenue and a decrease in servicing fees. As a result of the change in securitization structure, zero net gain on sale of Contracts was recorded in 2004, compared to $10.4 million net gain on sale in the year earlier period.  Servicing fees totaling $12.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased $4.6 million, or 26.8%, from $17.1 million in the same period a year earlier. The decrease in servicing fees is the result of the change in securitization structure and the consequent decline in the Company's managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries. The decrease was partially offset by the servicing fees earned on the SeaWest Third Party Portfolio, which totaled $2.0 million. As a result of the decision to structure future securitizations as secured financings, the Company's managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries will continue to decline in future periods, and servicing fee revenue is anticipated to decline proportionately. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company's managed portfolio owned by consolidated vs. non-consolidated subsidiaries and other third parties was as follows:                                         38                                                     December 31, 2004   December 31, 2003                                                ------------------  ------------------                                                 Amount       %      Amount       %                                                --------   -------  --------   -------          Total Managed Portfolio                                (Dollars in Millions) Owned by Consolidated Subsidiaries .........   $  619.8    68.3%   $  315.6    42.6% Owned by Non-Consolidated Subsidiaries .....      233.6    25.8%      425.5    57.4% SeaWest Third Party Portfolio ..............       53.5     5.9%       --       0.0%                                                --------   -------  --------   ------- Total ......................................   $  906.9   100.0%   $  741.1   100.0%                                                ========   =======  ========   =======    At December 31, 2004, the Company was generating income and fees on a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance approximating $906.9 million (this amount includes $53.5 million related to the SeaWest Third Party Portfolio on which the Company earns only servicing fees), compared to a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance approximating $741.1 million as of December 31, 2003. As the portfolios of Contracts acquired in the MFN Merger and the TFC Merger decrease, the portfolio of Contracts originated under the CPS Programs continues to expand. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the managed portfolio composition was as follows:                                            December 31, 2004   December 31, 2003                                          ------------------  ------------------                                           Amount       %      Amount       %                                          --------   -------  --------   ------- ORIGINATING ENTITY                                 (Dollars in Millions) CPS ..................................   $  706.8    77.9% $    543.8    73.4% TFC ..................................       89.4     9.9%      123.6    16.7% MFN ..................................       17.8     2.0%       73.7     9.9% SeaWest ..............................       39.4     4.3%       --       0.0% SeaWest Third Party Portfolio ........       53.5     5.9%       --       0.0%                                          --------   -------  --------   ------- Total ................................   $  906.9   100.0%   $  741.1   100.0%                                          ========   =======  ========   =======   Other income decreased $4.9 million, or 25.6%, to $14.4 million during 2004 from $19.3 million during 2003. The period over period decrease resulted primarily from a sales tax refund of $3.0 received in 2003 and decreased recoveries on previously charged off MFN Contracts, which were $8.0 million during 2004, compared to $12.2 million for 2003.  EXPENSES. The Company's operating expenses consist primarily of employee costs and other operating expenses, which are incurred as applications and Contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and the unemployment level.  Employee costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding warrants and stock options, and are one of the Company's most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with the level of applications and Contracts processed and serviced.  Other operating expenses consist primarily of interest expense, provisions for credit losses, facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services (including employee costs associated with information technology support), professional services, marketing and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization.  Total operating expenses were $148.6 million for 2004, compared to $108.0 million for 2003. The increase is primarily due to a $21.2 million increase in the provision for credit losses to $32.6 million during the 2004 period as compared to $11.4 million in the 2003 period. Increased interest expense was also significant.                                         39   Employee costs increased to $38.2 million during 2004, representing 25.7% of total operating expenses, from $37.1 million for 2003, or 34.4% of total operating expenses. The slight increase is primarily the result of staff additions related to increased Contract purchases in 2004 (an increase of $3.9 million). This increase was partially offset by staff reductions since the MFN Merger in 2002 related to the integration and consolidation of certain service and administrative activities and the decline in the balance of the portfolio of Contracts acquired in the MFN Merger (a decrease of $3.2 million). The decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher total of operating expenses, primarily a result of the increased provision for credit losses and interest expense.  General and administrative expenses remained essentially unchanged at $21.3 million, or 14.3% of total operating expenses, in 2004, as compared to $21.3 million, or 19.7% of total operating expenses, in 2003. The decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher operating expenses primarily a result of the provision for credit losses and interest expense.  Interest expense for 2004 increased $8.3 million, or 34.7%, to $32.1 million, compared to $23.9 million in 2003. The increase is primarily the result of changes in the amount and composition of securitization trust debt carried on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Such debt increased as a result of the change in securitization structure implemented beginning in July 2003, the TFC Merger in May 2003 and the SeaWest Asset Acquisition in April 2004 (a combined increase of approximately $10.3 million), partially offset by the decrease in the balance of the securitization trust debt acquired in the MFN Merger (resulting in a decrease of approximately $2.0 million in interest expense).  Impairment loss increased by $7.7 million, or 190.0%, to $11.8 million in 2004 as compared to $4.1 million in 2003. Such impairment loss relates to the Company's analysis and estimate of the expected ultimate performance of the Company's previously securitized pools that are held by non-consolidated subsidiaries and the residual interest in securitizations. The impairment loss is a result of the actual net loss and prepayment rates exceeding the Company's previous estimates for the Contracts held by non-consolidated subsidiaries.  Marketing expenses increased by $3.0 million, or 55.0%, and represented 5.6% of total operating expenses. The increase is primarily due to the increase in Contracts purchased by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2004.  Occupancy expenses decreased by $410,000, or 10.4%, and represented 2.4% of total operating expenses. The decrease is primarily due to the closure and sub-leasing during 2004 of certain facilities acquired in the MFN Merger and the TFC Merger.  Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $215,000, or 21.5%, to $785,000 from $1.0 million.  No income tax benefit was recorded in 2004 as compared to $3.4 million recorded in 2003 periods. The 2003 benefit is primarily the result of the resolution of certain Internal Revenue Service examinations of previously filed MFN tax returns, resulting in a tax benefit of $4.9 million, and other state tax matters resulting in a tax provision of $1.5 million. The Company does not expect any comparable income tax benefit in future periods.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  LIQUIDITY  The Company's business requires substantial cash to support its purchases of Contracts and other operating activities. The Company's primary sources of cash have been cash flows from operating activities, including proceeds from sales of Contracts, amounts borrowed under various revolving credit facilities (also sometimes known as warehouse credit facilities), servicing fees on portfolios of Contracts previously sold in securitization transactions or serviced for third                                          40   parties, customer payments of principal and interest on finance receivables, fees for origination of Contracts, and releases of cash from securitized portfolios of Contracts in which the Company has retained a residual ownership interest and from the Spread Accounts associated with such pools. The Company's primary uses of cash have been the purchases of Contracts, repayment of amounts borrowed under lines of credit and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses, the establishment of Spread Accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, and the increase of Credit Enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions, and income taxes. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from those portfolios and their related Spread Accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in the Company's managed portfolio, and the terms upon which the Company is able to acquire, sell, and borrow against Contracts.  Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $36.7 million, $9.9 million and $98.9 million, respectively. Cash from operating activities is generally provided by the net releases from the Company's securitization Trusts. The increase in 2005 vs. 2004 is due in part to the Company's increased net earnings before the significant increase in the provision for credit losses. The decrease in 2004 vs. 2003 is primarily the result of the Company's decision, in July 2003, to treat all of its future securitizations as secured financings. As a result, 2005 and 2004 include no activity related to Contracts held for sale.  Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, was $411.7 million, $314.0 million, and $178.9 million, respectively. Cash used in investing activities has generally related to purchases of Contracts, the cost of the SeaWest Asset Acquisition and the acquisition of TFC. Purchase of finance receivables held for investment were $691.3, $506.0 and $175.3 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash used in the TFC Merger, net of the cash acquired in the transaction, totaled $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.  Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005, was $378.4 million compared with $285.3 million in 2004 and $80.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Cash used or provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to the issuance or repayment of debt. In connection with the TFC Merger the Company assumed securitization trust debt related to three securitization transactions held by consolidated subsidiaries and assumed additional subordinated debt. With the change in the securitization structure implemented in the third quarter of 2003, $662.4 million of securitization trust debt was issued in 2005 as compared to $474.7 million in 2004 and $154.4 million in 2003.  Contracts are purchased from Dealers for a cash price approximating their principal amount, adjusted for an acquisition fee which may either increase or decrease the Contract purchase price, and generate cash flow over a period of years. As a result, the Company has been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase Contracts, and on the availability of cash from outside sources in order to finance its continuing operations, as well as to fund the portion of Contract purchase prices not financed under revolving warehouse credit facilities. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had $350 million in warehouse credit capacity, in the form of a $200 million facility and a $150 million facility. The first facility provides funding for Contracts purchased under the TFC Programs while both warehouse facilities provide funding for Contracts purchased under the CPS Programs. A third facility in the amount of $125 million, which the Company utilized to fund Contracts under the CPS and TFC Programs, was terminated by the Company on June 29, 2005.  The $150 million warehouse facility is structured to allow CPS to fund a portion of the purchase price of Contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by its consolidated subsidiary Page Three Funding, LLC. This facility was established on November 15, 2005, and expires on November 14, 2006, although it is renewable with the mutual agreement of the parties. Up to 80% of the principal balance of Contracts may be advanced to the Company under this facility, subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants. Notes under this facility accrue interest at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum. At December 31, 2005, $34.5 million was outstanding under this facility.                                         41   The $200 million warehouse facility is similarly structured to allow CPS to fund a portion of the purchase price of Contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by its consolidated subsidiary Page Funding LLC. This facility was entered into on June 30, 2004. On June 29, 2005 the facility was increased from $100 million to $125 million and further amended to provide for funding for Contracts purchased under the TFC Programs. It was increased again to $200 million on August 31, 2005. Approximately 77.0% of the principal balance of Contracts may be advanced to the Company under this facility, subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants. Notes under this facility accrue interest at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus 1.50% per annum. The lender has annual termination options at its sole discretion on each June 30 through 2007, at which time the agreement expires. At December 31, 2005, $836,000 was outstanding under this facility, compared to zero at December 31, 2004.  The $125 million warehouse facility was structured to allow the Company to fund a portion of the purchase price of Contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by its consolidated subsidiary CPS Warehouse Trust. This facility was established on March 7, 2002, and the maximum amount was increased to $125 million in November 2002. Up to 73.0% of the principal balance of Contracts could have been advanced to the Company under this facility bore interest at a rate of one-month commercial paper plus 1.50% per annum. This facility was due to expire on April 11, 2006, but the Company elected to terminate it on it June 29, 2005. At December 31, 2004, $34.3 million was outstanding under this facility.  The Company securitized $674.4 million of Contracts in five private placement transactions during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $463.9 million in five private placements during 2004. All of these transactions were structured as secured financings and, therefore, resulted in no gain on sale. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company securitized $416.9 million of Contracts in four private placement transactions. The first two such transactions of 2003 were structured as sales for financial accounting purposes, resulting in a gain on sale of $6.4 million (net of a negative fair value adjustment of $4.1 million related to the performance of previously securitized pools). The final two transactions of 2003 were structured as secured financings and, therefore, resulted in no gain on sale. In March 2004, a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote consolidated subsidiary of the Company issued $44 million of asset-backed notes secured by its retained interest in eight term securitization transactions. The notes had an interest rate of 10% per annum and a final maturity in October 2009 and were required to be repaid from the distributions on the underlying retained interests. In connection with the issuance of the notes, the Company incurred and capitalized issuance costs of $1.3 million. The Company repaid the notes in full in August 2005. In November 2005, the Company completed a similar securitization whereby a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote consolidated subsidiary of the Company issued $45.8 million of asset-backed notes secured by its retained interest in 10 term securitization transactions. These notes, which bear interest at a blended interest rate of 8.36% per annum and have a final maturity in July 2011, are required to be repaid from the distributions on the underlying retained interests. In connection with the issuance of the notes, the Company incurred and capitalized issuance costs of $915,000.  For the portfolio owned by non-consolidated subsidiaries, cash used to increase Credit Enhancement amounts to required levels for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was zero, $2.9 million, $20.9 million, respectively. Cash released from Trusts and their related Spread Accounts to the Company related to the portfolio owned by consolidated subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $23.1 million, $21.4 million and $25.9 million, respectively. Changes in the amount of Credit Enhancement required for term securitization transactions and releases from Trusts and their related Spread Accounts are affected by the relative size, seasoning and performance of the various pools of Contracts securitized that make up the Company's managed portfolio to which the respective Spread Accounts are related. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 the Company made no initial deposits to Spread Accounts and funded no initial overcollateralization related to its term securitization transactions owned by non-consolidated subsidiaries, compared to $18.7 million in 2003. The acquisition of Contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions, and the need to fund Spread Accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, and increase Credit Enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the Company's Contract purchases, the required level of initial Credit Enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established Trusts and their related Spread Accounts either release cash to the Company or capture cash from collections on securitized Contracts. The Company is currently limited in its ability to                                          42   purchase Contracts due to certain liquidity constraints. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had cash on hand of $17.8 million and available Contract purchase commitments from its warehouse credit facilities of $314.6 million. The Company's plans to manage the need for liquidity include the completion of additional term securitizations that would provide additional credit availability from the warehouse credit facilities, and matching its levels of Contract purchases to its availability of cash. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete term securitizations on favorable economic terms or that the Company will be able to complete term securitizations at all. If the Company is unable to complete such securitizations, interest income and other portfolio related income would decrease.  The Company's primary means of ensuring that its cash demands do not exceed its cash resources is to match its levels of Contract purchases to its availability of cash. The Company's ability to adjust the quantity of Contracts that it purchases and securitizes will be subject to general competitive conditions and the continued availability of warehouse credit facilities. There can be no assurance that the desired level of Contract acquisition can be maintained or increased. While the specific terms and mechanics of each Spread Account vary among transactions, the Company's Securitization Agreements generally provide that the Company will receive excess cash flows only if the amount of Credit Enhancement has reached specified levels and/or the delinquency, defaults or net losses related to the Contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies, defaults or net losses on the Contracts exceed such levels, the terms of the securitization: (i) may require increased Credit Enhancement to be accumulated for the particular pool; (ii) may restrict the distribution to the Company of excess cash flows associated with other pools; or (iii) in certain circumstances, may permit the insurers to require the transfer of servicing on some or all of the Contracts to another servicer. There can be no assurance that collections from the related Trusts will continue to generate sufficient cash.  Certain of the Company's securitization transactions and the warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels and maximum financial losses. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility.  The Servicing Agreements of the Company's securitization transactions are terminable by the Note Insurers in the event of certain defaults by the Company and under certain other circumstances. Were a Note Insurer in the future to exercise its option to terminate the Servicing Agreements, such a termination would have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and results of operations. The Company continues to receive Servicer extensions on a monthly and/or quarterly basis, pursuant to the Servicing Agreements.   CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  The following table summarizes the Company's material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands):                                                PAYMENT DUE BY PERIOD(1)                          --------------------------------------------------------------                                       LESS THAN      1 TO 3       3 TO 5     MORE THAN                             TOTAL       1 YEAR       YEARS        YEARS       5 YEARS                          ----------   ----------   ----------   ----------   ----------            Long Term Debt .......   $   58,866   $   55,854   $    2,642   $      279   $       91 Operating Leases .....   $   11,085   $    4,353   $    6,188   $      545   $       --   - ------------------- (1)SECURITIZATION TRUST DEBT, IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $924.0 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, IS OMITTED FROM THIS TABLE BECAUSE IT BECOMES DUE AS AND WHEN THE RELATED RECEIVABLES BALANCE IS REDUCED.

EXPECTED PAYMENTS, WHICH WILL DEPEND ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RELATED RECEIVABLES, AS TO WHICH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, ARE $18.0 MILLION IN 2006, $14.4 MILLION IN 2007, $7.6 MILLION IN 2008 AND $3.7 MILLION IN 2009.                                         43   Long term debt includes senior secured, subordinated debt and notes payable.   CREDIT FACILITIES  The terms on which credit has been available to the Company for purchase of Contracts have varied over the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, as shown in the following recapitulation:  In November 2000, the Company (through its subsidiary CPS Funding LLC) entered into a floating rate variable note purchase facility under which up to $75 million of notes could be outstanding at any time subject to collateral tests and other conditions. The Company used funds derived from this facility to purchase Contracts under the CPS Programs, which were pledged to secure the notes. The collateral tests and other conditions generally allowed the Company to borrow up to approximately 72.5% of the price paid for such Contracts. Notes issued under this facility bore interest at one-month LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum. This facility expired on February 21, 2004.  Additionally, in March 2002, the Company (through its subsidiary CPS Warehouse Trust) entered into a second floating rate variable note purchase facility, under which up to $125.0 million of notes could be outstanding at any time, subject to collateral tests and other conditions. The Company used funds derived from this facility to purchase Contracts under the CPS Programs and the TFC Programs, which were pledged to secure the notes. The collateral tests and other conditions generally allowed the Company to borrow up to approximately 73% of the price paid for such Contracts for Contracts purchased under the CPS Programs. Notes issued under this facility bore interest at commercial paper plus 1.18% per annum. During November 2004, this facility was amended to allow the Company to borrow up to approximately 70% for Contracts purchased under the TFC Programs. This facility was due to expire on April 11, 2006, but the Company elected to terminate it on June 29, 2005.  In connection with the TFC Merger in May 2003, the Company (through its subsidiary TFC Warehouse I LLC) entered into a third floating rate variable note purchase facility, under which up to $25.0 million of notes could be outstanding at any time, subject to collateral tests and other conditions. The Company used funds derived from this facility to purchase Contracts under the TFC Programs, which were pledged to secure the notes. The collateral tests and other conditions generally allowed the Company to borrow up to approximately 71% of the price paid for such Contracts. Notes issued under this facility bore interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum. This facility expired on June 24, 2004.  In June 2004, the Company (through its subsidiary Page Funding LLC) entered into a floating rate variable note purchase facility. Up to $200 million of notes may be outstanding under this facility at any time subject to certain collateral tests and other conditions. The Company uses funds derived from this facility to purchase Contracts under the CPS Programs, which are pledged to secure the notes. The collateral tests and other conditions generally allow the Company to borrow up to approximately 77.0% of the price paid for such Contracts. Notes issued under this facility bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus 1.50% per annum. The balance of notes outstanding related to this facility at December 31, 2005 was $836,000.  In November 2005, the Company (through its subsidiary Page Three Funding LLC) entered into a floating rate variable note purchase facility. Up to $150 million of notes may be outstanding under this facility at any time subject to certain collateral tests and other conditions. The Company uses funds derived from this facility to purchase Contracts under the CPS Programs, which are pledged to secure the notes. The collateral tests and other conditions generally allow the Company to borrow up to approximately 80.0% of the price paid for such Contracts. Notes issued under this facility bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.00 % per annum. The balance of notes outstanding related to this facility at December 31, 2005 was $34.5 million.                                         44   CAPITAL RESOURCES  As noted above, $55.8 million of long-term debt matures prior to December 15, 2006, although the Company repaid $14.0 million of such debt in January 2006. The Company plans to repay its long-term debt from a combination of the following: (i) additional proceeds from the offering of renewable notes; (ii) a possible transaction similar to the financing that it undertook in March 2004 and November 2005 where the Company issued notes secured by its residual interests in securitizations; and (iii) possible senior secured financing similar to its existing outstanding senior secured financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete these transactions. Securitization trust debt is repaid from collections on the related receivables, and becomes due in accordance with its terms as the principal amount of the related receivables is reduced. Although the securitization trust debt also has alternative maximum maturity dates, those dates are significantly later than the dates at which repayment of the related receivables is anticipated, and at no time in the Company's history have any of its sponsored asset-backed securities reached those alternative maximum maturities.  The acquisition of Contracts for subsequent transfer in securitization transactions, and the need to fund Spread Accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the Company's Contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the Trusts and related Spread Accounts either release cash to the Company or capture cash from collections on securitized Contracts. The Company plans to adjust its levels of Contract purchases so as to match anticipated releases of cash from the Trusts and related Spread Accounts with its capital requirements.                                         45   CAPITALIZATION  Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2005 the Company has managed its capitalization by issuing and restructuring debt as summarized in the following table:                                                             YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                                   -----------------------------------                                                     2005         2004          2003                                                   ---------    ---------    ---------                                                              (IN THOUSANDS) RESIDUAL INTEREST FINANCING:        Beginning balance .............................   $  22,204    $      --    $      --    Issuances ..................................      45,800       44,000           --    Payments ...................................

("LLCP") and Stanwich Financial Services Corp. ("SFSC"). The Company purchased and retired $4,000,000 of subordinated debt held by SFSC in exchange for payment of $3,920,000, and purchased and retired $4,000,000 of senior secured debt held by LLCP in exchange for payment of $4,200,000. The LLCP debt by its terms called for a prepayment penalty of 3% (or $120,000); the additional 2% (or $80,000) paid in connection with its February 2001 prepayment was absorbed by SFSC.  In March 2002, the Company and LLCP entered into an additional series of agreements under which LLCP provided additional funding to enable the Company to acquire MFN Financial Corporation. Under the March 2002 agreements, the Company borrowed $35 million from LLCP as a bridge note (the "Bridge Note") and approximately $8.5 million (the "Term C Note") on a deemed principal amount of                                          46   approximately $11.2 million. The Bridge Note requires principal payments of $2.0 million a month, which began in June 2002, with a final balloon payment in the amount of $17.0 million, which was made pursuant to the terms of the Bridge Note in February 2003. The Term C Note repayment schedule is based on the performance of a certain securitized pool. As the subordinated Note of the pool is repaid from the Trust, principal payments are due on the Term C Note. The maturity date of the Term C Note was March 2008. Interest was due monthly on the Bridge Note at a rate of 13.5% per annum and on the Term C Note at a rate of 12.0% per annum. In connection with the March 2002 agreements and the acquisition of MFN, the Company paid LLCP a structuring fee of $1.75 million and an investment banking fee of $1.0 million, and paid LLCP's out-of-pocket expenses of approximately $315,000. In addition, the Company paid LLCP certain other fees and interest amounting to $426,181. Approximately $1.4 million of the fees and other amounts paid to LLCP were deferred as financing costs and are being amortized over the life of the related debt. The remaining fees and other costs were included in the purchase price of MFN.  At the time of the MFN Merger, MFN had outstanding $22.5 million in principal amount of senior subordinated debt, which was due and repaid in full on March 23, 2002. Such debt bore interest at the rate of 11.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. At the time of the TFC Merger, TFC had outstanding $6.3 million in principal amount of subordinated debt, which the Company assumed as part of the TFC Merger. The debt bore interest at the rate of 13.25% per annum payable monthly in arrears, required monthly amortization and was repaid in full in June 2005.  On February 3, 2003, the Company borrowed $25.0 million from LLCP, net of fees and expenses of $1.05 million. The indebtedness, represented by the "Term D Note," was originally due in April 2003, with Company options to extend the maturity to May 2003 and January 2004, upon payment of successive extension fees of $125,000. The Company has paid the fees to extend the maturity to January 2004. Interest on the Term D Note is payable monthly at rates that averaged 4.79% per annum through June 30, 2003, and 12.0% per annum thereafter. In a separate transaction, the Bridge Note issued to LLCP in connection with the acquisition of MFN, in an original principal amount of $35.0 million, was due on February 28, 2003. The outstanding principal balance of $17.0 million was paid in February 2003. In addition, the maturity of the Term B Note was extended in October 2003 from November 2003 to January 2004. The Company repaid in full the Term C Note on January 29, 2004 and repaid $10.0 million of the Term D Note on January 15, 2004. In addition, on January 29, 2004 the maturities of the Term B and the Term D Note were extended to December 15, 2005 and the coupons on both notes were decreased to 11.75% per annum from 14.50% and 12.00%, respectively. The Company paid LLCP fees equal to $921,000 for these amendments, which will be amortized over the remaining life of the notes. The Company repaid the remaining $19.8 million on the Term B Note in December 2005. On December 13, 2005 the maturity of the Term D Note was extended to December 18, 2006. The Company paid LLCP fees equal to $150,000 for this amendment, which will be amortized over the remaining life of the note. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding principal balance of the Term D Note was $15.0 million.  On May 28, 2004 and June 25, 2004, the Company borrowed $15 million and $10 million, respectively, from LLCP. The indebtedness, represented by the "Term E Note," and the "Term F Note," respectively, bears interest at 11.75% per annum. Both the Term E Note and the Term F Note mature two years from their respective funding dates. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding principal balances of the Term E Note and the Term F Note were $15.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively.  In the second quarter of 2004, the Company retired an aggregate of $37.5 million of long-term indebtedness, comprising (i) $20.0 million of partially convertible debt ("Participating Equity Notes" or "PENs") issued in an April 1997 public offering and bearing interest at 10.50% per annum, (ii) $15.0 million of debt issued in June 1997 to SFSC on terms similar to those of the PENs, but bearing interest at 9.00% per annum, (iii) $1.0 million of convertible debt issued in 1998 to a director of the Company, bearing interest at 12.50% per annum, and (iv) $1.5 million of debt issued in 1999 to SFSC, bearing interest at 14.50% per annum. The indebtedness to the director was converted, in accordance with its terms, into common stock at the rate of $3.00 per share; the remainder of such indebtedness was repaid.                                         47    The Company must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that the Company maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. As a result of waivers and amendments to covenants related to securitization and non-securitization related debt throughout 2004 and 2005, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2005. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare default if a default occurred under a different facility.  In July 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $5,000,000 of outstanding debt and equity securities of the Company, inclusive of the mandatory annual purchase or redemption of $1,000,000 of the Company's outstanding "RISRS" subordinated debt securities, due 2006. In October 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional $5,000,000 of outstanding debt or equity securities. In October 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional $5,000,000 of outstanding debt or equity securities. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had purchased $5.0 million in principal amount of the RISRS, and $5.0 million of its common stock, representing 2,365,695 shares.   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This report on Form 10-K includes certain "forward-looking statements," including, without limitation, the statements or implications to the effect that prepayments as a percentage of original balances will approximate 22.2% to 35.8% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts, that charge-offs as a percentage of original balances will approximate 15.9% to 26.1% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts, with recovery rates approximating 4.0% to 5.9% of original principal balances. Other forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "estimates," or words of like meaning. As to the specifically identified forward-looking statements, factors that could affect charge-offs and recovery rates include changes in the general economic climate, which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of Contracts, changes in laws respecting consumer finance, which could affect the ability of the Company to enforce rights under Contracts, and changes in the market for used vehicles, which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles. Factors that could affect the Company's revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools of Contracts, which would affect the Company's ability to purchase Contracts, the terms on which the Company is able to finance such purchases, the willingness of Dealers to sell Contracts to the Company on the terms that it offers, and the terms on which the Company is able to complete term securitizations once Contracts are acquired. Factors that could affect the Company's expenses in the current year include competitive conditions in the market for qualified personnel, and interest rates (which affect the rates that the Company pays on Notes issued in its securitizations). The statements concerning the Company structuring future securitization transactions as secured financings and the effects of such structures on financial items and on the Company's future profitability also are forward-looking statements. Any change to the structure of the Company's securitization transaction could cause such forward-looking statements not to be accurate. Both the amount of the effect of the change in structure on the Company's profitability and the duration of the period in which the Company's profitability would be affected by the change in securitization structure are estimates. The accuracy of such estimates will be affected by the rate at which the Company purchases and sells Contracts, any changes in that rate, the credit performance of such Contracts, the financial terms of future securitizations, any changes in such terms over time, and other factors that generally affect the Company's profitability.                                         48   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Statement No. 123(R) (as amended), "Share-Based Payment" ("FAS 123(R)" or the "Statement"). FAS 123 (R) and related interpretations require that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. FAS 123(R) permits entities to use any option-pricing model that meets the fair value objective in the Statement. (Modifications of share-based payments will be treated as replacement awards with the cost of the incremental value recorded in the financial statements.)  The Statement is effective at the beginning of 2006 and will therefore be effective for the Company's first quarter of 2006. As of the effective date, the Company will apply the Statement using a modified version of prospective application. Under that transition method, compensation cost is recognized for (1) all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified, cancelled, or repurchased after that date and (2) the portion of prior awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered, based on the grant-date fair value of those awards calculated for pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123. As a result of the acceleration of vesting on all options outstanding in December 2005 (see Note 9) there will be no effect on the Company's adoption of the statement in 2006 relating to such options currently outstanding.  In February 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments". This statement amends the guidance in FASB Statements No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", and No. 140, ""Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities".  Statement 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole (eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host) if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. The Statement also amends Statement 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument.  Statement 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after January 1, 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on the Company's financial position or operations.   OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  Prior to July 2003, the Company structured its securitization transactions to meet the accounting criteria for sales of finance receivables. In this structure the notes issued by the Company's special purpose subsidiary do not appear as debt on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. See Critical Accounting Policies for a detailed discussion of the Company's securitization structure.   ITEM 7a. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  INTEREST RATE RISK  The Company is subject to interest rate risk during the period between when Contracts are purchased from Dealers and when such Contracts become part of a term securitization. Specifically, the interest rates on the warehouse facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the Contracts are fixed. Historically, the Company's term securitization facilities have had fixed rates of interest. To mitigate some of this risk, the Company has in the past, and intends to continue to, structure certain of its securitization transactions to include pre-funding structures, whereby the amount of Notes issued exceeds the amount of Contracts initially sold to the Trusts. In pre-funding, the proceeds                                          49   from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until the Company sells the additional Contracts to the Trust in amounts up to the balance of the pre-funded escrow account. In pre-funded securitizations, the Company locks in the borrowing costs with respect to the Contracts it subsequently delivers to the Trust. However, the Company incurs an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of Contracts and the interest rate paid on the Notes outstanding, the amount as to which there can be no assurance.   The following table provides information on the Company's interest rate-sensitive financial instruments by expected maturity date as of December 31, 2005:                                         2006           2007            2008          2009           2010       THEREAFTER    FAIR VALUE                                   -----------    -----------    -----------    -----------    ----------    ----------    ----------                                                                              (In thousands)                Assets: Finance receivables(1) ........   $   346,881    $   265,019   $    190,962    $   138,300   $    90,723    $   26,741    $1,058,626    Weighted average fixed     effective interest rate ...         18.29%         18.56%         18.56%         18.49%        18.44%        18.37%  LIABILITIES: Warehouse lines    of credit ..................        35,350             --             --             --            --            --        35,350    Weighted average variable     effective interest rate....          6.36% Residual interest    financing ..................        17,986         14,435          7,644          3,680            --            --        43,745     Fixed interest rate .......          8.36%          8.36%          8.36%          8.36% Securitization    trust debt .................       328,007        224,651        160,530        113,996        75,101        21,741       914,901    Weighted average fixed     effective interest rate ...          3.95%          4.09%          4.13%          4.28%         4.36%         4.73% Senior secured debt ...........        40,000             --             --             --            --            --        40,000     Fixed interest rate .......         11.75% Subordinated renewable notes ..         1,643            909          1,562            171           279            91         4,655    Weighted average fixed     effective interest rate ...          6.75%          8.42%          9.61%          9.10%        10.10%         9.53% Subordinated debt .............        14,000             --             --             --            --            --        14,000     Fixed interest rate .......         12.50%   - ------------------- (1) INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY $58.0 MILLION IN UNFUNDED CONTRACTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN RESTRICTED CASH AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AS A RESULT OF A PREFUNDING STRUCTURE.  Much of the information used to determine fair value is highly subjective. When applicable, readily available market information has been utilized. However, for a significant portion of the Company's financial instruments, active markets do not exist. Therefore, considerable judgments were required in estimating fair value for certain items. The subjective factors include, among other things, the estimated timing and amount of cash flows, risk characteristics, credit quality and interest rates, all of which are subject to change. Since the fair value is estimated as of the dates shown in the table, the amounts that will actually be realized or paid at settlement or maturity of the instruments could be significantly different.
