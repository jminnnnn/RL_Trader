ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  The following analysis of the financial condition of the Company should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report.  OVERVIEW  Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") primarily engage in the business of purchasing, selling and servicing retail automobile installment sale contracts ("Contracts") originated by automobile dealers ("Dealers") located throughout the United States. In the past, the Company has purchased contracts in as many as 44 different states. At various times in 1999, the Company suspended its solicitation of Contract purchases in as many as 20 states, and as of the date of this report is active in 34 states. There can be no assurance as to resumption of Contract purchasing activities in other states. Through its purchase of Contracts, the Company provides indirect financing to Dealer customers with limited credit histories, low incomes or past credit problems, who generally would not be expected to qualify for financing provided by banks or by automobile manufacturers' captive finance companies.  The Company historically has generated revenue primarily from the gains recognized on the sale or securitization of its Contracts, servicing fees earned on Contracts sold, and interest earned on Residuals (as defined below) and on Contracts held for sale. Beginning with the year ended December 31, 1999, and through the date of this report, the Company did not sell any Contracts in securitization transactions, and therefore recognized no gains on sale. All sales of Contracts during 1999 were on a servicing released basis either in the form of bulk sales of Contracts being held by the Company for sale, or as part of a pass through agreement with a third party for which the Company earned fees on a per Contract basis. During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company entered into a second third party pass through agreement and proceeded to sell nearly all of the Contracts purchased during the year to one or the other third party, for a mark-up above what the Company pays the Dealer. There were no bulk sales during 2000. As a result of the Company's pass through sales during the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company recognized a $16.2 million gain on sale of Contracts, compared to a net loss on sale of Contracts for the year ended December 31, 1999, of $14.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company recognized a net gain on sale of $58.3 million. Revenues from interest and servicing fees for the year ended December 31, 2000, were $3.5 million and $15.8 million, respectively. Such revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999, were $3.0 million and $27.8 million, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 1998, such revenues were $41.8 million and $25.2 million, respectively. The Company's income is affected by losses incurred on Contracts, whether such Contracts are held for sale or have been sold in securitizations. The Company's cash requirements have been significant in the past and will continue to be significant in the future. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, was approximately $38.7 million, compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately $180,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999, and net cash used in operating activities of approximately $71.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources."  The Company has purchased Contracts with the primary intention of reselling them in securitization transactions as asset-backed securities. From late May 1999 to the present, the Company has purchased Contracts on a flow basis for third parties; that is, the Company purchases a Contract from a Dealer, and sells the Contract the next day to the third party for a mark-up above what the Company pays the Dealer. The Company retains no interest in such Contracts, and neither services such Contracts nor earns a servicing fee.                                          17    18  Although the Company has not been able to sell Contracts in a securitization transaction since December 1998, it does plan to securitize in the future, as to which there can be no assurance. The Company's securitization structure has been as follows:  First, the Company sells a portfolio of Contracts to a wholly owned subsidiary ("SPS"), which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the Company's Contracts. The SPS then transfers the same Contracts to either a grantor trust or an owner trust (the "Trust"). The Trust in turn issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities (the "Certificates"), generally in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal balance of the Contracts. The Company typically sells these Contracts to the Trust at face value and without recourse, except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the Dealer to the Company are provided by the Company to the Trust. One or more investors purchase the Certificates issued by the Trust; the proceeds from the sale of the Certificates are then used to purchase the Contracts from the Company. The Company purchases a financial guaranty insurance policy, guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest on the senior Certificates, from an insurance company (the "Certificate Insurer"). In addition, the Company provides a credit enhancement for the benefit of the Certificate Insurer and the investors in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account ("Spread Account") held by the Trust. The agreements governing the securitization transactions (collectively referred to as the "Servicing Agreements") require that the initial deposits to the Spread Accounts be supplemented by a portion of collections from the Contracts until the Spread Accounts reach specified levels, and then maintained at those levels. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related Certificates. The specified levels at which the Spread Accounts are to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of Contracts held by the Trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among the Company, the SPS, the Certificate Insurer and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the portfolios, and have also been varied by agreement. The specified levels applicable to the Company's sold pools increased materially in 1998. Effective November 3, 1999, as applied to monthly measurement dates from September 1999 onward, the specified levels have decreased, as is discussed under the heading "Liquidity and Capital Resources."  At the closing of each securitization, the Company removes from its consolidated balance sheet the Contracts held for sale and adds to its consolidated balance sheet (i) the cash received and (ii) the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that the Company retains in the Contracts sold in the securitization. That retained interest (the "Residual") consists of (a) the cash held in the Spread Account and (b) the net interest receivables ("NIRs"). NIRs represent the estimated discounted cash flows to be received by the Trust in the future, net of principal and interest payable with respect to the Certificates, and certain expenses. The excess of the cash received and the assets retained by the Company over the carrying value of the Contracts sold, less transaction costs, equals the net gain on sale of Contracts recorded by the Company.  The Company allocates its basis in the Contracts between the Certificates and the Residuals retained based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of the sale. The Company recognizes gains or losses attributable to the change in the fair value of the Residuals, which are recorded at estimated fair value and accounted for as "held-for-trading" securities. The Company is not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of interests such as the Residuals; accordingly, the Company determines the estimated fair value of the Residuals by discounting the amount and timing of anticipated cash flows released from the Spread Account (the cash out method), using a discount rate that the Company believes is appropriate for the risks involved. For that valuation, the Company has used an effective discount rate of approximately 14% per annum.  The Company receives periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the Contracts. In addition, the Company is entitled to the cash flows from the Residuals that represent collections on the Contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the Certificates, the base servicing fees, and certain other fees (such as trustee and custodial fees). At the end of each collection period, the aggregate cash collections from the Contracts are allocated first to the base servicing fees and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees for the period, then to the Certificateholders for                                          18    19  interest at the pass-through rate on the Certificates plus principal as defined in the Servicing Agreements. If the amount of cash required for the above allocations exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is drawn from the Spread Account. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations, and there is no shortfall in the related Spread Account, the excess is released to the Company, or in certain cases is transferred to other Spread Accounts that may be below their specified levels. Pursuant to certain Servicing Agreements, excess cash collected during the period is used to make accelerated principal paydowns on certain Certificates to create over-collateralization, that is, to reduce the aggregate principal balance of outstanding Certificates below the aggregate principal amount of the related automotive receivables. If the Spread Account balance is not at the required credit enhancement level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the Spread Account until the specified level is achieved. The cash in the Spread Accounts is restricted from use by the Company. Cash held in the various Spread Accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the Servicing Agreements. Spread Account balances are held by the Trusts on behalf of the Company as the owner of the Residuals.  The annual percentage rate payable on the Contracts is significantly greater than the rates payable on the Certificates. Accordingly, the Residuals described above are a significant asset of the Company. In determining the value of the Residuals described above, the Company must estimate the future rates of prepayments, delinquencies, defaults and default loss severity, as they affect the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows. The Company estimates prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable Contracts. The Company has used a constant prepayment estimate of approximately 4% per annum. The Company estimates defaults and default loss severity using available historical loss data for comparable Contracts and the specific characteristics of the Contracts purchased by the Company. In valuing the Residuals, the Company estimates that losses as a percentage of the original principal balance will range from 14% to 17.0% cumulatively over the lives of the related Contracts.  In future periods, the Company could recognize additional revenue from the Residuals if the actual performance of the Contracts were to be better than originally estimated, or the Company could increase the estimated fair value of the Residuals. If the actual performance of the Contracts were to be worse than the original estimate, then a downward adjustment to the carrying value of the Residuals would be required. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the future performance of the underlying Contracts, the Company has established a provision for future losses on the Residuals.  From March 1999 to the present, the Company has been unable to complete a securitization transaction, due to unavailability of sufficient capital. The above description is included because the Residuals created in past securitizations continue to represent the Company's largest asset, and because the Company plans again to sell Contracts in securitization transactions, when necessary pre-conditions (including availability of capital) are fulfilled.  During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company has altered its basic system of doing business. Previously, the Company would acquire Contracts for its own account, borrowing from 88% to 97% of the principal balance of such Contracts under "warehouse" lines of credit. Periodically (approximately once every quarter) the Company would then sell most or all of the recently acquired Contracts in a securitization transaction as described above. In such a sale, the Company would retain (1) a residual ownership interest in the Contracts sold, (2) the obligation to service the Contracts sold, and (3) the right to receive servicing fees. At the end of March 1999, the Company learned that it would be unable to sell Contracts in securitization transactions for an indeterminate period. Accordingly, the Company commenced purchasing Contracts for immediate re-sale to a third party, which third party purchases the Contracts in turn on a daily basis for a mark-up above what the Company pays the Dealer. In this arrangement, the Company retains no residual interest in the Contracts, has no servicing obligation, and receives no servicing fee.                                          19    20 In November 2000, the Company entered into a one year revolving note purchase facility under which up to $75 million of notes may be outstanding at any time subject to a collateral test and other conditions. The Company uses funds derived from this facility to purchase Contracts, which are pledged to secure the Notes. Such Contracts are held for sale in anticipated future securitization transactions, as to which there can be no assurance. The collateral test generally allows the Company to borrow up to approximately 75% of the price paid for such Contracts. Notes issued under this facility bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus 0.30% per annum.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999  Revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2000, revenues increased $21.1 million, or 142.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 1999. Net gain on sale of Contracts increased by $31.1 million, from a $14.8 million loss on sale for the year ended December 31, 1999, to a $16.2 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2000. The primary reason for the increase is that the prior year included sales of some $318.0 million of Contracts for less than their acquisition costs, resulting in a loss on sale of $15.2 million. Net gain on sale also increased due to an increase in the number of Contracts sold on a flow basis, and an increase in the average fee paid to the Company per Contract sold. During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company sold $600.4 million of Contracts on a flow basis compared to $241.2 million of Contracts in the year ended December 31, 1999. For the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, $1.8 million and $5.3 million, respectively, of provision for losses on Contracts held for sale was charged against gain on sale.  Interest income increased by $448,000, or 14.8%, representing 9.7% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000. Prior to the second quarter of the year 2000, the Company recognized residual interest income as the excess cash flows generated by the Trusts over the related obligations of the Trusts. This method of residual interest income recognition approximated a level yield rate of residual interest income, net of the amortization of the NIRs, primarily due to the continued addition of new securitizations. As a result of the Company's not having securitized any Contracts since December 1998, the Company's existing method of amortizing the Residuals would not reflect the appropriate level yield. Therefore, the Company refined its methodology to accrete residual interest income on a level yield basis, using an accretion rate that approximates the discount rate used to value the residual interest in securitizations. That rate is 14% per annum.  Servicing fees decreased by $11.9 million, or 42.9%, and represented 44.1% of total revenue. Servicing fees are composed of base fees, which are payable at the rate of 2% per annum on the principal balance of the outstanding Contracts in the related trusts, plus any other fees collected by the Company, such as late fees and returned check fees. The decrease in servicing fees is primarily due to the decrease in the Company's servicing portfolio. As of December 31, 2000, the servicing portfolio was $411.9 million compared to $821.0 million as of December 31, 1999.  Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2000, operating expenses decreased by $18.6 million, or 21.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 1999. Employee costs decreased by $5.2 million, or 17.4%, and represented 36.0% of total operating expenses. The decrease is due to the reductions of staff in accordance with the decrease in the Company's servicing portfolio. The decrease was offset by an increase in employee costs of $778,000 related to the valuation of certain stock options in accordance with recently issued accounting principles. General and administrative expenses decreased by $3.8 million, or 19.6% and represented 23.1% of total operating expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the decrease in costs associated with servicing the Company's portfolio. Such costs include telephone, postage, and lockbox processing fees.                                          20    21  Interest expense decreased by $10.2 million, or 37.1%, and represented 25.2% of total operating expenses. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the reductions in warehouse and non-warehouse indebtedness from the prior year. (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources").  Marketing expenses increased by $703,000 or 13.0%, and represented 9.0% of total expenses. The increase is primarily due to the increase in Contracts purchased during the year ended December 31, 2000. Fees paid to marketing representatives for their role in the submission of Contracts ultimately purchased by the Company are included as a component in gain on sale of Contracts, net.  Occupancy expenses increased by $615,000 or 22.0%, and represented 5.0% of total expenses. The increase is primarily due to additional property taxes paid during 2000. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $434,000 or 27.2%, and represented 1.7% of total expenses. In November 1998, the Company moved its headquarters to a new 115,000 square foot facility. The Company is leasing the new headquarters facility for a ten-year term, with base rent of $1.9 million for the first five years, and $2.1 million for years six through ten. In addition to base rent, the Company pays property taxes, maintenance, and other expenses of the property.  The results for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, include net losses of $19,816 and net earnings of $35,131 respectively, from the Company's subsidiary CPS Leasing, Inc.  The results for the year ended December 31, 2000, include a net operating loss of $755,000 from the Company's investment in 38% of NAB Asset Corp. The results for the year ended December 31, 1999, include $2.5 million in net earnings from the Company's investment in NAB Asset Corp.  The Company's effective tax rate was 31.7% and 38.3%, for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decline in the effective tax rate in 2000 reflects the full utilization of net operating loss carryback availability, and the recording of a $3.7 million valuation allowance on a portion of the Company's net deferred tax assets.  THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998  Revenue. During the year ended December 31, 1999, revenue decreased $111.5 million, or 88.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 1998. Gain on sale of Contracts, net, decreased by $73.2 million, or 125.5%, from a $58.3 million gain on sale for the year ended December 31, 1998, to a $14.8 million loss for the year ended December 31, 1999. The change in gain on sale from positive to negative is due to the Company selling Contracts only on a servicing released basis and thus not recording any NIR gains during the year, as well as to selling Contracts at a loss. During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company sold $318.0 million of Contracts on a servicing released basis, that is, with no residual interest retained, with no servicing obligation, and with no right to receive a servicing fee. Those sales resulted in a net loss of approximately $15.2 million. Expenses of approximately $1.1 million were incurred related to previous securitization transactions, including the amortization of a warrant issued to the Certificate Insurer in November 1998. In addition, the Company sold $241.2 million of Contracts on a flow through basis and received $6.2 million of fees, which have been included as a component of gain on sale of Contracts, net. For the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, $5.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively, of provision for losses on Contracts held for sale were charged against gain on sale. The increase in the provision for losses on Contracts held for sale is primarily due to the Company's inability to securitize Contracts during 1999. As a result, Contracts were held for sale for longer periods of time prior to being sold on a servicing released basis, thus requiring additional loss reserves.  Interest income decreased by $38.8 million, or 92.8%, representing 20.5% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999. The decrease is primarily due to decreases in Contracts held for sale and NIRs during 1999. Beginning in May 1999, the Company began to purchase Contracts on a flow through basis and thus did not hold any additional Contracts for sale since that time. Additionally, the Company                                          21    22  completed the final sale of Contracts on a servicing released basis, other than those sold on a flow through basis, on September 1, 1999, leaving approximately $4.6 million of Contracts held for sale at the end of September and decreasing to $2.4 million by year end.  Servicing fees increased by $2.6 million, or 10.4%, and represented 187.5% of total revenue. Servicing fees are composed of base fees, which are payable at the rate of 2% per annum on the principal balance of the outstanding Contracts in the related trusts, plus any other fees collected by the Company, such as late fees and returned check fees. The increase in servicing fees is primarily due to an increase in the fees other than base fees collected during 1999. During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company collected $4.9 million of other servicing fees, an increase of 39.7% over other servicing fees collected in the prior year.  Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 1999, operating expenses increased $5.0 million, or 6.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 1998. Employee costs increased by $1.0 million, or 3.5%, and represented 34.3% of total operating expenses. The increase is due to increases in salaries and wage rates. General and administrative expenses decreased by $1.0 million, or 4.9% and represented 22.5% of total operating expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the decrease in costs associated with purchasing Contracts such as credit reports. During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company purchased $424.7 million of Contracts, compared to $1,076.5 million of Contracts purchased in the prior year.  Interest expense increased $5.4 million, or 24.5%, and represented 31.5% of total operating expenses. The increase is due in part to the interest paid on $25.0 million in subordinated debt securities issued by the Company in November 1998, and $6.5 million of additional subordinated debt securities issued during the year ended December 31, 1999. In addition, the interest rate on the $25.0 million of subordinated debt issued in November 1998, was increased from 13.5% in 1998 to 14.5% in April of 1999. Interest expense was also affected by the volume of Contracts held for sale, as well as by the Company's cost of borrowed funds. (See "Liquidity and Captial Resources").  Marketing expenses decreased by $1.5 million or 21.3%, and represented 6.2% of total expenses. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in Contracts purchased during the year ended December 31, 1999. Fees paid to marketing representatives for their role in the submission of Contracts ultimately purchased by the Company are included as a component in gain on sale of Contracts, net.  Occupancy expenses increased by $526,000 or 23.2%, and represented 3.2% of total expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $340,000 or 27.1%, and represented 1.8% of total expenses. In November 1998, the Company moved its headquarters to a new 115,000 square foot facility. The Company is leasing the new headquarters facility for a ten-year term, with base rent of $1.9 million for the first five years, and $2.1 million for years six through ten. In addition to base rent, the Company pays property taxes, maintenance, and other expenses of the property.  The results for the years ended December 31, 1999, and 1998, include a net operating loss of approximately $150,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, from the Company's subsidiary Samco. Samco terminated all of its operations during the first quarter of 1999.  The results for the year ended December 31, 1999, include a net operating loss of $830,380 from the Company's subsidiary LINC. For the year ended December 31, 1998, LINC had net operating losses of $565,333. During the second quarter of 1999, LINC ceased all operations.  The results for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, include net earnings of $35,131 and $298,000, respectively, from the Company's subsidiary CPS Leasing, Inc.  The results for the year ended December 31, 1999, include a net operating loss of $2.5 million from the Company's investment in 38% of NAB Asset Corp. The results for the year ended December                                          22    23 31, 1998, include $52,000 in net earnings from the Company's investment in NAB Asset Corp.  The Company's effective tax rate was 38.3% and 42.0%, for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  LIQUIDITY  The Company's business requires substantial cash to support its purchases of Contracts and other operating activities. The Company's primary sources of cash from operating activities have been proceeds from sales of Contracts, amounts borrowed under lines of credit, servicing fees on portfolios of Contracts previously sold, customer payments of principal and interest on Contracts held for sale, fees received from its flow purchase programs for origination of Contracts, and releases of cash from Spread Accounts. The Company's primary uses of cash have been the purchases of Contracts, repayment of amounts borrowed under lines of credit and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest, and occupancy expenses, the establishment of and further contributions to Spread Accounts, and income taxes. Internally generated cash may or may not be sufficient to meet the Company's cash demands, depending on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from Spread Accounts), on the rate of growth or decline in the Company's servicing portfolio, and on the terms on which the Company is able to buy, borrow against and sell Contracts.  Contracts are purchased from Dealers for a cash price close to their principal amount, and return cash over a period of years. As a result, the Company has been dependent on lines of credit to purchase Contracts, and on the availability of cash from outside sources in order to finance its continued operations, and to fund the portion of Contract purchase prices not borrowed under lines of credit. For much of the three-year period ended December 31, 2000, the Company was not party to any line of credit that would facilitate purchase of Contracts. Furthermore, the Company did not receive any material releases of cash from Spread Accounts from June 1998 through October 1999. The inability to borrow and the lack of cash releases resulted in a liquidity deficiency, which has since been alleviated.  The Company's Contract purchasing program currently comprises both (i) purchases for the Company's own account, funded primarily by advances under a revolving credit facility, and (ii) flow purchases for the account of non-affiliates. Flow purchases allow the Company to purchase Contracts with minimal demands on liquidity. The Company's revenues from flow purchase of Contracts, however, are materially less than may be received by holding Contracts to maturity or by selling Contracts in securitization transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company purchased $600.4 million of Contracts on a flow basis, and $31.1 million for its own account, compared to $424.7 million of Contracts purchased, $241.2 million of which was purchased on a flow basis, in the prior year.  Net cash provided by operating activities was $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $180,000 for the same period in the prior year. During the years ended December 31, 2000, and 1999, the Company did not complete a securitization transaction, and therefore, did not use any cash for initial deposits to Spread Accounts. Cash used for subsequent deposits to Spread Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $15.0 million, a decrease of $8.1 million, or 34.9%, from cash used for subsequent deposits to Spread Accounts for the prior year. Cash released from Spread Accounts to the Company for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $80.6 million, as compared with $28.0 million for the prior year. Changes in deposits to and releases from Spread Accounts are affected by the relative size, seasoning and performance of the various pools of sold Contracts that make up the Company's Servicing Portfolio. In particular, in the prior year most of the cash generated by Contracts held by the Trusts was directed, pursuant to the Securitization                                          23    24  Agreements, to building Spread Accounts to their respective specified levels. Those levels having been reached in November 1999, cash subsequently generated has been available for release to the Company.  From June 1998 to November 1999, the Company's liquidity was adversely affected by the absence of releases from Spread Accounts. Such releases did not occur because a number of the Trusts had incurred cumulative net losses as a percentage of the original Contract balance or average delinquency ratios in excess of the predetermined levels specified in the respective Securitization Agreements. Accordingly, pursuant to the Securitization Agreements, the specified levels applicable to the Company's Spread Accounts were increased, in most cases to an unlimited amount. Due to cross collateralization provisions of the Securitization Agreements, the specified levels were increased on all but the two most recent of the Company's Trusts. Increased specified levels for the Spread Accounts have been in effect from time to time in the past. As a result of the increased Spread Account specified levels and cross collateralization provisions, excess cash flows that would otherwise have been released to the Company instead were retained in the Spread Accounts to bring the balance of those Spread Accounts up to higher levels. In addition to requiring higher Spread Account levels, the Securitization Agreements provide the Certificate Insurer with certain other rights and remedies, some of which have been waived on a recurring basis by the Certificate Insurer with respect to all of the Trusts. Until the November 1999 effectiveness of an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Securitization Agreements, no material releases from any of the Spread Accounts were available to the Company. Upon effectiveness of the Amendment, the requisite Spread Account levels in general have been set at 21% of the outstanding principal balance of the Certificates issued by the related Trusts. The 21% level is subject to adjustment to reflect over collateralization. Older Trusts may require more than 21% of credit enhancement if the Certificate balance has amortized to such a level that "floor" or minimum levels of credit enhancement are applicable.  In the event of certain defaults by the Company, the specified level applicable to such credit enhancement could increase to an unlimited amount, but such defaults are narrowly defined, and the Company does not anticipate suffering such defaults. The Amendment has been effective since November 1999, and the Company has received releases of cash from the securitized portfolio on a monthly basis thereafter. The releases of cash are expected to continue and to vary in amount from month to month. There can be no assurance that such releases of cash will continue in the future.  Since November 2000, the Company has been able to purchase Contracts for its own account using proceeds from a $75 million revolving note purchase facility. Approximately 75% of the acquisition cost of Contracts may be advanced to the Company under that facility (see "Credit Facilities"). The Company also purchases Contracts on a flow basis, which, as compared with purchase of Contracts for the Company's own account, involves a materially reduced demand on the Company's cash. Cash requirements are reduced because the Company need only fund such purchases for the period of several days that elapse between payment to the Dealer and receipt of funds from the flow purchasers. The Company's plan for meeting its liquidity needs is to adjust its levels of Contract purchases to match its availability of cash.  The Company's ability to adjust the quantity of Contracts that it purchases and sells will be subject to general competitive conditions and other factors. There can be no assurance that the current level of Contract acquisition can be maintained or increased. Obtaining releases of cash from the Spread Accounts is dependent on collections from the related Trusts generating sufficient cash in excess of the amended specified levels. There can be no assurance that collections from the related Trusts will generate cash in excess of the amended specified levels.                                          24    25  CREDIT FACILITIES  The terms on which credit has been available to the Company for purchase of Contracts have varied over the three-year period ended December 31, 2000, as shown in the following recapitulation:  In November 1998, the Company entered into a warehouse line of credit agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation (the "GECC Line"). The GECC Line provided for warehouse facility advances up to a maximum of $100 million at a variable interest rate of LIBOR + 3.75% . The GECC Line by its terms was to expire November 30, 1999. During 1999, the Company defaulted on the GECC Line agreements and was required to repay all balances owed. During August 1999, all amounts owed under the GECC Line were repaid and the agreement was terminated.  In November 1997, the Company entered into a warehouse line of credit agreement with First Union Capital Markets ("First Union Line"). The First Union Line provided for a maximum of $150.0 million of advances to the Company, with interest at a variable rate indexed to prevailing commercial paper rates. In July 1998, the advance amount was increased to $200.0 million. In conjunction with the increase in maximum advance amount under the agreement, the expiration date was changed to July 31, 1999, renewable for one year with the mutual consent of the Company and First Union Capital Markets. During 1999, the Company defaulted on the First Union Line agreement and was required to repay the balance outstanding in its entirety. In June 1999, the balance of the First Union Line was repaid in its entirety and the related agreement was terminated.  In December 1996, the Company entered into an overdraft financing facility, with a bank, that provided for maximum borrowings of $2.0 million. Interest was charged on the outstanding balance at the bank's reference rate plus 1.75%. During 1997, the overdraft facility was increased to $4.0 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 1998. During 1999, the Company defaulted under the overdraft facility and was required to repay the outstanding balance in its entirety. In November 1999, the remaining balance outstanding under the overdraft facility was repaid in its entirety and the related agreement was terminated.  In November 2000, the Company entered into a revolving note purchase facility under which up to $75 million of notes may be outstanding at any time subject to a collateral test and other conditions. The Company uses funds derived from this facility to purchase Contracts, which are pledged to secure the Notes. The collateral test generally allows the Company to borrow up to approximately 75% of the price paid for such Contracts. Notes issued under this facility bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus 0.30% per annum. The balance of notes outstanding at December 31, 2000, was $2.0 million.                                          25    26  CAPITAL RESOURCES  In the past, the Company funded the increase in its servicing portfolio through off balance sheet securitization transactions, as discussed above, and funded its other capital needs with cash from operations and with the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and/or equity.   The acquisition of Contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions, and the need to fund Spread Accounts when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the Company's Contract purchases (other than flow purchases), the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the Spread Accounts either release cash to the Company or capture cash from collections on sold Contracts. The Company plans to adjust its levels of Contract purchases so as to match anticipated releases of cash from Spread Accounts with capital requirements for securitization of Contracts that are purchased for the Company's own account.                                          26    27  CAPITALIZATION  Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2000, the Company has increased its capitalization by issuing and restructuring debt and issuing/repurchasing common stock and equivalents which is summarized in the following table:                                 For the Years Ended December 31,                              ---------------------------------                                2000         1999        1998                              --------     --------     -------                                        (in thousands)         Senior secured debt: Beginning balance .......    $ 23,161     $ 33,000     $    --   Issuances .............      16,000           --      33,000   Payments ..............

In April 1998, the Company borrowed $33.0 million as a senior secured loan, which commenced amortization in May 1999. This loan bore interest at a rate equal to 4% of per annum over LIBOR. CPS borrowed $5.0 million from related parties in August and September 1998, the terms of which were renegotiated in November 1998, in connection with the issuance of $25.0 million of subordinated notes to Levine Leichtman Capital Partners II, L.P. ("LLCP"). The $25.0 million of subordinated notes issued in November 1998 accrued interest at 13.50% per annum, are due November 2003, and were issued together with warrants that allowed the investor to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,450,000 shares of the Company's common stock at $3.00 per share. As renegotiated, the $5.0 million of related party loans are subordinated both to the Company's general and secured creditors and also to the LLCP subordinated notes, accrue interest at 12.50% per annum, are due June 2004, and are convertible into an aggregate of 1,666,667 shares of the Company's common stock at $3.00 per share. A related party also purchased $5.0 million of Company's common stock in July 1998, at $11.275 per share.  The cost of capital increased further in 1999. To meet a portion of its capital requirements, the Company on April 15, 1999, issued $5.0 million in subordinated notes to LLCP (the "New LLCP Notes"). The notes bear interest at 14.5% per annum and include warrants to purchase 1,335,000 shares of the                                          27    28  Company's common stock at $0.01 per share. As part of the agreement to issue the New LLCP Notes, the Company was required to restructure the terms of the $25.0 million subordinated promissory notes discussed above. Such restructuring included an increase in the interest rate from 13.5% to 14.5%, a reduction in the number of warrants issued to purchase the Company's common stock from 3,450,000 to 3,115,000, a waiver by LLCP of certain defaults under the notes sold to LLCP in November 1998, and a reduction in the exercise price of the warrants from $3.00 per share to $0.01 per share. Among the agreements entered into in connection with the issuance of the New LLCP Notes were agreements by Stanwich Financial Services Corp. ("SFSC"), an affiliate of the chairman of the Company's board of directors, to purchase an additional $15.0 million of notes and of the Company to sell such notes. The terms of such notes were to be not less favorable to the Company then (i) those that would be available in a transaction with a non-affiliate, and (ii) those applicable to the New LLCP Notes.  In August and September 1999, the Company issued $1.5 million of such notes, bearing interest at 14.5% per annum, to SFSC. As part of that transaction, the Company also agreed to issue to SFSC warrants to purchase up to 207,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $0.01 per share.  In March 2000, the Company and LLCP restructured the outstanding indebtedness of the Company in favor of LLCP, which had been in default. In the restructuring (i) all existing defaults were waived or cured, (ii) LLCP lent an additional $16 million ("Tranche A") to the Company, (iii) the proceeds of that loan (net of fees and expenses) were used to repay all of the Company's outstanding senior secured indebtedness, (iv) the outstanding $30 million of subordinated indebtedness in favor of LLCP was exchanged for senior indebtedness ("Tranche B"), (v) the Company granted a blanket security interest in favor of LLCP, to secure both Tranche A and Tranche B, and (vi) LLCP released SFSC and its affiliates (including Mr. Bradley, Sr., Mr. Bradley, Jr., and Mr. Poole, directors of the Company) of any liability for failure to invest $15 million in the Company. Tranche A is due June 2001, and bears interest at 12.50% per annum; Tranche B is due November 2003, and bears interest at 14.50% per annum. In each case the interest rate is subject to increase by 2.0% in the event of a default by the Company. In the restructuring, the Company paid a fee of $325,000, paid accrued default interest of $300,000, issued 103,500 shares of common stock to LLCP, and paid out-of-pocket expenses of approximately $214,000. The shares of common stock issued were valued at approximately $155,000, which is included in deferred interest expense to be amortized over the remaining life of the related debt. The terms of the transaction were determined by negotiation between the Company and LLCP. Also in March 2000, the Company's board of directors authorized the issuance of 103,500 shares of the Company's common stock to SFSC in conjunction with a $1.5 million promissory note issued by the Company to SFSC in August 1999. The shares of common stock issued were valued at approximately $155,000, which is included in deferred interest expense to be amortized over the remaining life of the related debt.  In July 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5,000,000 of outstanding debt and equity securities of the Company, inclusive of the mandatory annual repurchase or redemption of $1,000,000 of the Company's outstanding "RISRS" subordinated debt securities, due 2006. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had repurchased $1.3 million in principal amount of the RISRS, and $1.3 million of its common stock (representing 720,752 shares). During the first quarter of 2001, the Company repurchased a total of $8,000,000 of outstanding indebtedness held by LLCP and SFSC. The Company purchased and retired $4,000,000 of subordinated debt held by SFSC in exchange for payment of $3,920,000, and purchased and retired $4,000,000 of senior secured debt held by LLCP in exchange for payment of $4,200,000. The LLCP debt by its terms called for a prepayment penalty of 3% (or $120,000); the additional 2% (or $80,000) paid in connection with its February 2001 prepayment was absorbed by SFSC. LLCP holds approximately 22.6% of the Company's outstanding common shares. SFSC is an affiliate of the Company's chairman, Charles E. Bradley, Sr., and SFSC and Mr. Bradley together hold approximately 30.6% of the Company's outstanding common shares.                                          28    29  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  The descriptions of the Company's business and activities set forth in this report and in other past and future reports and announcements by the Company may contain forward-looking statements and assumptions regarding the future activities and results of operations of the Company. Actual results may be adversely affected by various factors including the following: increases in unemployment or other changes in domestic economic conditions which adversely affect the sales of new and used automobiles and may result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures and losses on Contracts; adverse economic conditions in geographic areas in which the Company's business is concentrated; changes in interest rates, adverse changes in the market for securitized receivables pools, or a substantial lengthening of the Company's warehousing period, each of which could restrict the Company's ability to obtain cash for new Contract originations and purchases; increases in the amounts required to be set aside in Spread Accounts or to be expended for other forms of credit enhancement to support future securitizations; the reduction or unavailability of warehouse lines of credit which the Company uses to accumulate Contracts for securitization transactions; increased competition from other automobile finance sources; reduction in the number and amount of acceptable Contracts submitted to the Company by its automobile Dealer network; changes in government regulations affecting consumer credit; and other economic, financial and regulatory factors beyond the Company's control.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  The Company will adopt in future periods new accounting pronouncements. For information on how adoption has affected and will affect the Financial Statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  INTEREST RATE RISK  There have been no significant changes in interest rate risk since December 31, 1999. The Company is not currently issuing interest bearing asset-backed securities nor is it holding any material amount of Contracts for sale. All Contracts purchased are primarily sold on a flow basis, for a mark-up above what the Company pays the Dealer. Therefore, any strategies the Company has used in the past to minimize interest rate risk do not apply currently. Described below are strategies the Company has used in the past to minimize interest rate risk.  The strategies the Company has used in the past to minimize interest rate risk include offering only fixed rate contracts to obligors, regular sales of Contracts to the Trusts, and pre-funding securitizations, whereby the amount of asset-backed securities issued exceeds the amount of Contracts initially sold to the Trusts. In pre-funding, the proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until the Company sells the additional Contracts to the Trust in amounts up to the balance of the pre-funded escrow account. In pre-funded securitizations, the Company locks in the borrowing costs with respect to the Contracts it subsequently delivers to the Trust. However, the Company incurs an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of Contracts and the interest rate paid on the asset-backed securities outstanding.  The Company is subject to market risks due to fluctuations in interest rates primarily through its outstanding indebtedness and to a lesser extent its outstanding interest earning assets, and commitments to enter into new Contracts. The interest rate and maturity profile of the Company's indebtedness is outlined above (see "Capitalization") and included in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. The table below outlines the carrying values and estimated fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2000 and 1999.                                                     December 31,                                  --------------------------------------------                                          2000                    1999                                  --------------------     -------------------                                  Carrying      Fair       Carrying     Fair Financial Instrument              Value        Value       Value       Value - --------------------             --------     -------     --------    -------                                                 (in thousands)           Warehouse lines of credit.....   $ 2,003      $ 2,003     $    --     $    -- Notes payable.................     2,414        2,414       4,006       4,006 Senior secured debt...........    38,000       38,000      23,161      23,161 Subordinated debt.............    37,699       27,709      69,000      45,678 Related party debt............    21,500       15,803      21,500      14,233   Much of the information used to determine fair value is highly subjective. When applicable, readily available market information has been utilized. However, for a significant portion of the Company's financial instruments, active markets do not exist. Therefore, considerable judgments were required in estimating fair value for certain items. The subjective factors include, among other things, the estimated timing and amount of cash flows, risk characteristics, credit quality and interest rates, all of which are subject to change. Since the fair value is estimated as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the amounts that will actually be realized or paid at settlement or maturity of the instruments could be significantly different.                                         29    30  ITEM 8.
