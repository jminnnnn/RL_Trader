ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS           Management's Overview and Summary             The Company is involved in the acquisition, ownership, development, redevelopment, management and leasing of regional and community shopping centers located throughout the United States. The Company is the sole general partner of, and owns a majority of the ownership interests in, the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2009, the Operating Partnership owned or had an ownership interest in 72 regional shopping centers and 14 community shopping centers totaling approximately 75 million square feet of GLA. These 86 regional and community shopping centers are referred to hereinafter as the "Centers," unless the context otherwise requires. The Company is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and conducts all of its operations through the Operating Partnership and the Company's Management Companies.             The following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. It compares the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2009 to the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008. Also included is a comparison of the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008 to the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2007. This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.       Acquisitions and Dispositions:               The financial statements reflect the following acquisitions, dispositions and changes in ownership subsequent to the occurrence of each transaction.            On September 5, 2007, the Company purchased the remaining 50% outside ownership interest in Hilton Village, a 96,985 square foot specialty center in Scottsdale, Arizona. The total purchase price of $13.5 million was funded by cash, borrowings under the Company's line of credit and the assumption of a mortgage note payable. The Center was previously accounted for under the equity method as an investment in unconsolidated joint ventures.            On December 17, 2007, the Company purchased a portfolio of ground leasehold interest and/or fee interests in 39 freestanding Mervyn's stores located in the Southwest United States. The purchase price of $400.2 million was funded by cash and borrowings under the Company's line of credit.            On January 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, at the election of the holders, redeemed its 3.4 million Class A participating convertible preferred units ("PCPUs"). As a result of the redemption, the Company received the 16.32% noncontrolling interest in the portion of the Wilmorite portfolio acquired on April 25, 2005 that included Danbury Fair Mall, Freehold Raceway Mall, Great Northern Mall, Rotterdam Square, Shoppingtown Mall, Towne Mall, Tysons Corner Center and Wilton Mall, collectively, referred to as the "Non-Rochester Properties," for total consideration of $224.4 million, in exchange for the Company's ownership interest in the portion of the Wilmorite portfolio that consisted of Eastview Mall, Eastview Commons, Greece Ridge Center, Marketplace Mall and Pittsford Plaza, collectively referred to as the "Rochester Properties." Included in the redemption consideration was the assumption of the remaining 16.32% noncontrolling interest in the indebtedness of the Non-Rochester Properties, which had an estimated fair value of $106.0 million. In addition, the Company also received additional consideration of $11.8 million, in the form of a note, for certain working capital adjustments, extraordinary capital expenditures, leasing commissions, tenant allowances, and decreases in indebtedness during the Company's period of ownership of the Rochester Properties. The Company recognized a gain of $99.1 million on the exchange. This exchange is referred to herein as the "Rochester Redemption."    42                   On January 10, 2008, the Company, in a 50/50 joint venture, acquired The Shops at North Bridge, a 680,933 square foot urban shopping center in Chicago, Illinois, for a total purchase price of $515.0 million. The Company's share of the purchase price was funded by the assumption of a pro rata share of the $205.0 million fixed rate mortgage on the Center and by borrowings under the Company's line of credit.            On January 31, 2008, the Company purchased a ground leasehold interest in a freestanding Mervyn's store located in Hayward, California. The purchase price of $13.2 million was funded by cash and borrowings under the Company's line of credit.            On February 29, 2008, the Company purchased a fee simple interest in a freestanding Mervyn's store located in Monrovia, California. The purchase price of $19.3 million was funded by cash and borrowings under the Company's line of credit.            On May 20, 2008, the Company purchased a fee simple interest in a 161,350 square foot Boscov's department store at Deptford Mall in Deptford, New Jersey. The total purchase price of $23.5 million was funded by the assumption of the existing $15.2 million mortgage note on the property and by borrowings under the Company's line of credit. This transaction is referred to herein as the "2008 Acquisition Property."            On June 11, 2008, the Company became a 50% owner in a joint venture that acquired One Scottsdale, which plans to develop a mixed-use property in Scottsdale, Arizona. The Company's share of the purchase price was $52.5 million, which was funded by borrowings under the Company's line of credit.             On December 19, 2008, the Company sold a fee and/or ground leasehold interest in three freestanding Mervyn's department stores to Pacific Premier Retail Trust, one of the Company's joint ventures, for $43.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of assets of $1.5 million. The proceeds were used to pay down the Company's line of credit.            In June 2009, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.0 million, related to the anticipated loss on the sale of Village Center, a 170,801 square foot urban village property, in July 2009. The Company subsequently sold the property on July 14, 2009 for $11.9 million in total proceeds, resulting in a gain of $0.1 million related to a change in estimate in transaction costs. The Company used the proceeds from the sale to pay down the term loan and for general corporate purposes.            On July 30, 2009, the Company sold a 49% ownership interest in Queens Center to a third party for approximately $152.7 million, resulting in a gain on sale of assets of $154.2 million. The Company used the proceeds from the sale of the ownership interest in the property to pay down the Company's term loan and for general corporate purposes. As of the date of the sale, the Company has accounted for the operations of Queens Center under the equity method of accounting.            On September 3, 2009, the Company formed a joint venture with a third party whereby the Company sold a 75% interest in FlatIron Crossing. As part of this transaction, the Company issued three warrants for an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of common stock of the Company (See Note 15Stockholders' Equity in the Notes to Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.) The Company received $123.8 million in cash proceeds for the overall transaction, of which $8.1 million was attributed to the warrants. The proceeds attributable to the interest sold exceeded the Company's carrying value in the interest sold by $28.7 million. However, due to certain contractual rights afforded to the buyer of the interest in FlatIron Crossing, the Company has only recognized a gain on sale of $2.5 million. The Company used the proceeds from the sale of the ownership interest to pay down the term loan and for general corporate purposes. As of the date of the sale, the Company has accounted for the operations of FlatIron Crossing under the equity method of accounting.            Queens Center and FlatIron Crossing are referred to herein as the "Joint Venture Centers."    43                   On September 30, 2009, the Company formed a joint venture with a third party, whereby the third party acquired a 49.9% interest in Freehold Raceway Mall and Chandler Fashion Center. The Company received approximately $174.6 million in cash proceeds for the overall transaction. The Company used the proceeds from this transaction to pay down the Company's line of credit and for general corporate purposes. As part of this transaction, the Company issued a warrant for an aggregate of 935,358 shares of common stock of the Company. (See Note 15Stockholders' Equity in the Company's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The transaction has been accounted for as a profit-sharing arrangement, and accordingly the assets, liabilities and operations of the properties remain on the books of the Company and a co-venture obligation has been established for the amount of $168.2 million representing the net cash proceeds received from the third party less costs allocated to the warrant.             During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company sold five non-core community centers for $71.3 million, resulting in aggregate loss on sales of $16.9 million. The Company used the proceeds from these sales to pay down the Company's line of credit and for general corporate purposes.       Mervyn's:               In July 2008, Mervyn's filed for bankruptcy protection and announced in October its plans to liquidate all merchandise, auction its store leases and wind down its business. The Company had 45 former Mervyn's stores in its portfolio. The Company owned the ground leasehold and/or fee simple interest in 44 of those stores and the remaining store was owned by a third party but is located at one of the Centers.            In September 2008, the Company recorded a write-down of $5.2 million due to the anticipated rejection of six of the Company's leases by Mervyn's. In addition, the Company terminated its former plan to sell the 29 Mervyn's stores located at shopping centers not owned or managed by the Company. (See Note 17Discontinued Operations in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company's decision was based on current conditions in the credit market and the assumption that a better return could be obtained by holding and operating the assets. As a result of the change in plans to sell, the Company recorded a loss of $5.3 million in order to adjust the carrying value of these assets for depreciation expense that otherwise would have been recognized had these assets been continuously classified as held and used.            In December 2008, Kohl's and Forever 21 assumed a total of 23 of the Mervyn's leases and the remaining 22 leases were rejected by Mervyn's under the bankruptcy laws. As a result, the Company wrote off the unamortized intangible assets and liabilities related to the rejected and unassumed leases in December 2008. The Company wrote off $27.7 million of unamortized intangible assets related to lease in place values, leasing commissions and legal costs to depreciation and amortization. Unamortized intangible assets of $14.9 million relating to above market leases and unamortized intangible liabilities of $24.5 million relating to below market leases were written off to minimum rents.            On December 19, 2008, the Company sold a fee and/or ground leasehold interest in three former Mervyn's stores to Pacific Premier Retail Trust, one of its joint ventures, for $43.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of assets of $1.5 million. The Company's pro rata share of the proceeds was used to pay down the Company's line of credit.             In June 2009, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $26.0 million, as it relates to the fee and/or ground leasehold interests in five former Mervyn's stores due to the anticipated loss on the sale of these properties in July 2009. The Company subsequently sold the properties in July 2009 for $52.7 million in total proceeds, resulting in an additional $0.5 million loss related to transaction costs. The Company used the proceeds from the sales to pay down the Company's term loan and for general corporate purposes.    44                   On September 29, 2009, the Company sold a leasehold interest in a former Mervyn's store for $4.5 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $4.1 million. The Company used the proceeds from the sale to pay down the Company's line of credit and for general corporate purposes.             The Mervyn's stores acquired in 2007 and 2008 are referred to herein as the "Mervyn's Properties."       Redevelopment and Development Activity:               Northgate Mall, the Company's 712,771 square foot regional mall in Marin County, California, opened the first phase of its redevelopment on November 12, 2009. New anchor Kohl's was joined by retailers H&M, BJ's Restaurant, Children's Place, Chipotle, Gymboree, Hot Topic, PacSun, Panera Bread, See's Candies, Sunglass Hut, Tilly's and Vans. As of December 31, 2009, the Company incurred approximately $66.5 million of redevelopment costs for this Center and is estimating it will incur approximately $12.5 million of additional costs in 2010.            Santa Monica Place in Santa Monica, California, is scheduled to open in August 2010 with anchors Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom. The Company recently announced deals with Tony Burch, Ben Bridge Jewelers and Charles David. As of December 31, 2009, the Company incurred approximately $163.2 million of redevelopment costs for this Center and is estimating it will incur approximately $101.8 million of additional costs in 2010.       Inflation:               In the last three years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most of the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"). In addition, about 6%-13% of the leases expire each year, which enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. Additionally, historically the majority of the leases required the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses. In January 2005, the Company began entering into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any Center. This change shifts the burden of cost control to the Company.       Seasonality:               The shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels. In addition, shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter. As a result of the above, earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter.      Critical Accounting Policies             The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.            Some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition, estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals, provisions for uncollectible accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, and estimates for environmental matters. The Company's significant accounting policies are described    45             in more detail in Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the following policies are deemed to be critical.       Revenue Recognition:               Minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. The difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the "straight line rent adjustment." Currently, 57% of the mall and freestanding leases contain provisions for CPI rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease. The Company believes that using an annual multiple of CPI increases, rather than fixed contractual rent increases, results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases. Percentage rents are recognized when the tenants' specified sales targets have been met. Estimated recoveries from certain tenants for their pro rata share of real estate taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. Other tenants pay a fixed rate and these tenant recoveries' revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related leases.       Property:               The Company capitalizes costs incurred in redevelopment and development of properties. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized costs are allocated to the specific components of a project that are benefited. The Company considers a construction project as completed and held available for occupancy and ceases capitalization of costs when the areas under development have been substantially completed.            Maintenance and repair expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Costs for major replacements and betterments, which includes HVAC equipment, roofs, parking lots, etc., are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings.             Property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:                           Buildings and improvements     5-40 years      Tenant improvements     5-7 years      Equipment and furnishings     5-7 years             Accounting for Acquisitions:               The Company first determines the value of land and buildings utilizing an "as if vacant" methodology. The Company then assigns a fair value to any debt assumed at acquisition. The balance of the purchase price is allocated to tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities. Tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair market value basis at the acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms. The tenant improvements are classified as an asset under property and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases which come in three forms: (i) leasing commissions and legal costs, which represent the value associated with "cost avoidance" of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the Company's markets; (ii) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the "assumed vacant" property to the    46           occupancy level when purchased; and (iii) above or below market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. Leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms. The value of in-place leases are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus an estimate of renewal of the acquired leases. Above or below market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets or in other accrued liabilities, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market, and the asset or liability is amortized to minimum rents over the remaining terms of the leases.       Asset Impairment:               The Company assesses whether there has been impairment in the value of its long-lived assets by considering factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. Such factors include the tenant's ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases. The Company may recognize impairment losses if the cash flows are not sufficient to cover its investment. Such a loss would be determined as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a center.            The Company reviews its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for a series of operating losses and other factors that may indicate that a decrease in the value of its investments has occurred which is other-than-temporary. The investment in each unconsolidated joint venture is evaluated periodically, and as deemed necessary, for recoverability and valuation declines that are other than temporary.       Fair Value of Financial Instruments:               The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions.            Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.             The Company calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. When the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value, no additional disclosure is made.       Deferred Charges:               Costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight-line method. Costs relating to financing of shopping center properties are    47           deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. In-place lease values are amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of the renewal term. Leasing commissions and legal costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the individual remaining lease years. The ranges of the terms of the agreements are as follows:                         Deferred lease costs     1-15 years    Deferred financing costs     1-15 years    In-place lease values     Remaining lease term plus an estimate for renewal    Leasing commissions and legal costs     5-10 years           Results of Operations             Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred due to the transactions described above including the 2008 Acquisition Property, the Joint Venture Centers, the Mervyn's Properties and the Redevelopment Centers. For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2008, the "Same Centers" include all Consolidated Centers, excluding the 2008 Acquisition Property, the Mervyn's Properties, the Joint Venture Centers and the Redevelopment Centers as defined below. For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007, the "Same Centers" include all consolidated Centers, excluding the 2008 Acquisition Property, the Mervyn's Properties and the Redevelopment Centers.            For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2008, the "Redevelopment Centers" include The Oaks, Northgate Mall, Santa Monica Place and Shoppingtown Mall. For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007, the "Redevelopment Centers" include The Oaks, Northgate Mall, Santa Monica Place, Shoppingtown Mall, Westside Pavilion, The Marketplace at Flagstaff, SanTan Village Regional Center and Promenade at Casa Grande.             The U.S. economy, the real estate industry as a whole, and the local markets in which the Centers are located have in recent years experienced adverse economic conditions, resulting in an economic recession as well as disruptions in the capital and credit markets. These difficult economic conditions have adversely impacted consumer spending levels and the operating results of the Company's tenants. Regional Mall sales per square foot for 2009 declined by approximately 8% from 2008 to a level of $407 per square foot, continuing the downward trend that began in 2007. Regional Mall portfolio occupancy also has declined since 2007, with occupancy at December 31, 2009 at 91.3% compared to 92.3% at December 31, 2008. The Company's ability to lease space and negotiate rents at advantageous rates has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected in this type of economic environment, and more tenants may seek rent relief. The spread between rents on executed leases and expiring leases remains positive but decreased in 2009 compared to 2008. While the Company cannot predict how long these adverse conditions will continue, a further continuation could harm the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.     Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2009 and 2008        Revenues:               Minimum and percentage rents (collectively referred to as "rental revenue") decreased by $56.7 million, or 10.4%, from 2008 to 2009. The decrease in rental revenue is attributed to a decrease of $32.1 million from the Joint Venture Centers, $26.9 million from the Mervyn's Properties and $7.4 million from the Same Centers which is offset in part by an increase of $8.9 million from the Redevelopment Centers and $0.8 million from the 2008 Acquisition Property. The decrease in rental    48            revenue from the Mervyn's Properties is due to the rejection of 22 leases by Mervyn's under the bankruptcy laws in 2008, offset in part by the assumption of 23 of the Mervyn's leases by Kohls and Forever 21 as well as the sale of six of the Mervyn's stores in 2009. The Company is currently seeking replacement tenants for the remainder of the vacant Mervyn's spaces. If these spaces are not leased, this trend will continue throughout 2010. The decrease in Same Centers rental revenue is primarily attributed to a decrease in occupancy, a decrease in amortization of above and below market leases and a decrease in percentage rents due to a decrease in retail sales.            Rental revenue includes the amortization of above and below market leases, the amortization of straight-line rents and lease termination income. The amortization of above and below market leases decreased from $22.5 million in 2008 to $9.6 million in 2009. The amortization of straight-lined rents increased from $4.5 million in 2008 to $6.5 million in 2009. Lease termination income increased from $9.6 million in 2008 to $16.2 million in 2009. The decrease in the amortization of above and below market leases is primarily due to the early termination of Mervyn's leases in 2008 (See "Management's Overview and SummaryMervyn's.").             Tenant recoveries decreased $18.1 million, or 6.9%, from 2008 to 2009. The decrease in tenant recoveries is attributed to a decrease of $12.7 million from the Joint Venture Centers, $4.3 million from the Same Centers and $4.0 million from the Mervyn's Properties offset in part by an increase of $2.7 million from the Redevelopment Centers and $0.2 million from the 2008 Acquisition Property. The decrease in Same Centers is due to a decrease in recoverable operating expenses, utilities and property taxes.       Shopping Center and Operating Expenses:               Shopping center and operating expenses decreased $23.4 million, or 8.3%, from 2008 to 2009. The decrease in shopping center and operating expenses is attributed to a decrease of $15.1 million from the Joint Venture Centers and $10.1 million from the Same Centers offset in part by an increase of $1.5 million from the Redevelopment Centers and $0.3 million from the 2008 Acquisition Property. The decrease in Same Centers is due to a decrease in recoverable operating expenses, utilities and property taxes.       Management Companies' Operating Expenses:               Management Companies' operating expenses increased $2.2 million from 2008 to 2009 due to severance costs paid in connection with the implementation of the Company's workforce reduction plan in 2009.       REIT General and Administrative Expenses:               REIT general and administrative expenses increased by $9.4 million from 2008 to 2009. The increase is primarily due to $7.3 million in transaction and other related costs relating to the Chandler Fashion Center and Freehold Raceway Mall transaction (See "Management Overview and SummaryAcquisitions and Dispositions") and $1.5 million in other compensation costs incurred in 2009.       Depreciation and Amortization:               Depreciation and amortization decreased $7.9 million from 2008 to 2009. The decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily attributed to a decrease of $11.4 million from the Mervyn's Properties and $8.5 million from the Joint Venture Centers offset in part by an increase of $4.6 million from the Same Centers, $2.9 million from the Redevelopment Centers and $0.3 million from the 2008 Acquisition Property. Included in the decrease of depreciation and amortization of Mervyn's Properties is the write-off of intangible assets as a result of the early termination of Mervyn's leases in 2008 (See "Management's Overview and SummaryMervyn's.")    49        NAME="page_dq10801_1_50">                                                  Interest Expense:               Interest expense decreased $28.0 million from 2008 to 2009. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributed to a decrease of $12.1 million from the Senior Notes, $10.9 million from the Joint Venture Centers, $10.8 million from borrowings under the Company's line of credit and $9.0 million from the term loan offset in part by an increase of $8.5 million from the Redevelopment Centers, $5.7 million from the Same Centers and $0.6 million from the 2008 Acquisition Property.            The decrease in interest expense on the Senior Notes is due to a reduction of weighted average outstanding principal balance from 2008 to 2009. The decrease in interest expense on the Company's line of credit was due to a decrease in average outstanding borrowings during 2009, due in part, to the proceeds from sale of the 2009 joint venture transactions (See "Management's Overview and SummaryAcquisitions and Dispositions") and the equity offering in 2009. (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources".)             The above interest expense items are net of capitalized interest, which decreased from $33.3 million in 2008 to $21.3 million in 2009 due to a decrease in redevelopment activity in 2009 and a reduction in the cost of borrowing.       Gain on Early Extinguishment of Debt:               Gain on early extinguishment of debt decreased from $84.1 million in 2008 to $29.2 million in 2009. The reduction in gain reflects a decrease in the amount of Senior Notes repurchased in 2009 compared to 2008. (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources").       Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:               Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $25.7 million from 2008 to 2009. The decrease in equity in income from joint ventures is primarily attributed to $9.1 million of termination fee income received in 2008 and $7.6 million related to a write-down of assets at certain joint venture Centers in 2009.       Gain (loss) on Sale or Write-down of Assets:               The gain (loss) on sale or write-down of assets increased from a loss of $30.9 million in 2008 to a gain of $161.9 million in 2009. The gain is primarily attributed to the gain of $156.7 million related to the sale of ownership interests in the Joint Venture Centers (See "Management's Overview and SummaryAcquisitions and Dispositions"), the impairment charge of $19.2 million in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of land held for development and a $5.3 million adjustment in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of Mervyn's stores that the Company had previously classified as held for sale (See "Management's Overview and SummaryMervyn's").       Discontinued Operations:               The Company recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $35.6 million in 2009 compared to income of $108.4 million in 2008. The reduction in income is primarily attributed to the $99.1 million gain from the Rochester Redemption in 2008 (See "Management's Overview and SummaryAcquisitions and Dispositions") and the loss on sale or write-down of assets of $40.2 million in 2009.       Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests:               Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased from $29.0 million in 2008 to $18.5 million in 2009. The decrease in net income from noncontrolling interests is attributable to $16.3 million from the Rochester Redemption in 2008 and an increase in income from continuing operations.    50              Funds From Operations:               Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, FFOdiluted decreased 25.4% from $461.5 million in 2008 to $344.1 million in 2009. For disclosure of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the periods and a reconciliation of FFO and FFOdiluted to net income available to common stockholders, see "Funds from Operations."       Operating Activities:               Cash provided by operations decreased from $251.9 million in 2008 to $120.9 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities in 2008 compared to 2009, an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and the results at the Centers as discussed above.       Investing Activities:               Cash from investing activities increased from a deficit of $559.0 million in 2008 to a surplus of $302.4 million in 2009. The increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets of $370.3 million, a decrease in capital expenditures of $337.8 million, a decrease in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures of $110.7 million and an increase in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures of $27.4 million.            The increase in proceeds from the sale of assets is due to the sale of the ownership interests in the Joint Venture Centers. The decrease in capital expenditures is primarily due to the purchase of a ground leasehold and fee simple interest in two Mervyn's stores in 2008 and the decrease in development activity in 2009. The decrease in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily due to the Company's purchase of a pro rata share of The Shops at North Bridge for $155.0 million in 2008. See "Management's Overview and SummaryAcquisitions and Dispositions" for a discussion of the acquisition of The Shops at North Bridge, the Joint Venture Centers and Mervyn's.       Financing Activities:               Cash flows from financing activities decreased from a surplus of $288.3 million in 2008 to a deficit of $396.5 million in 2009. The decrease in cash from financing activities was primarily attributed to decreases in cash provided by mortgages, bank and other notes payable of $1.3 billion and cash payments on mortgages, bank and other notes payable of $177.8 million offset in part by the net proceeds from the common stock offering in 2009 of $343.5 million, the decrease in dividends and distributions (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources") of $179.0 million and the contribution from a co-venture partner of $168.2 million. (See "Management's Overview and SummaryAcquisitions and Dispositions.")     Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007        Revenues:               Rental revenue increased by $55.6 million, or 11.3%, from 2007 to 2008. The increase in rental revenue is attributed to an increase of $37.4 million from the Mervyn's Properties, $13.9 million from the Redevelopment Centers, $3.0 million from the Same Centers and $1.3 million from the 2008 Acquisition Property. The increase in the revenues from the Same Centers is primarily due to rent escalations and lease renewals at higher rents, which was offset by decreases in lease termination income, amortization of straight-line rents and amortization of above and below market leases. The increase in the revenues from the Same Centers was also offset by a decrease of $6.3 million in percentage rents due to a decrease in retail sales.            The amortization of above and below market leases increased from $10.3 million in 2007 to $22.5 million in 2008. The amortization of straight-lined rents decreased from $6.7 million in 2007 to    51             $4.5 million in 2008. Lease termination income decreased from $9.7 million in 2007 to $9.6 million in 2008. The increase in above and below market leases is primarily due to the early termination of Mervyn's leases in 2008 (See "Management's Overview and SummaryMervyn's").            Tenant recoveries increased $20.2 million, or 8.4%, from 2007 to 2008. The increase in tenant recoveries is attributed to an increase of $9.7 million from the Same Centers, $5.5 million from the Mervyn's Properties, $4.7 from the Redevelopment Centers and $0.3 million from the 2008 Acquisition Property.            Management Companies' revenues increased by $1.0 million from 2007 to 2008, primarily due to increased management fees received from the joint ventures, additional third party management contracts and increased development fees from joint ventures.       Shopping Center and Operating Expenses:               Shopping center and operating expenses increased $28.4 million, or 11.2%, from 2007 to 2008. The increase in shopping center and operating expenses is attributed to an increase of $13.1 million from the Same Centers, $10.0 million from the Mervyn's Properties, $5.0 million from the Redevelopment Centers and $0.3 million from the 2008 Acquisition Property. The increase in Same Centers is primarily due to an increase in recoverable utility expenses and property taxes and a $2.0 million increase in bad debt expense.       Management Companies' Operating Expenses:               Management Companies' operating expenses increased $3.3 million from 2007 to 2008, in part as a result of the additional costs of managing the joint ventures and third party managed properties.       REIT General and Administrative Expenses:               REIT general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.1 million from 2007 to 2008. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in share and unit-based compensation expense in 2008.       Depreciation and Amortization:               Depreciation and amortization increased $60.8 million from 2007 to 2008. The increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily attributed to an increase of $37.7 million from the Mervyn's Properties, $12.0 million from the Redevelopment Centers, $6.8 million from the Same Centers and $0.6 million from the 2008 Acquisition Property. Included in the increase of depreciation and amortization of Mervyn's Properties is the write-off of $32.9 million of intangible assets as a result of the early termination of Mervyn's leases. (See "Management's Overview and SummaryMervyn's".)       Interest Expense:               Interest expense increased $34.2 million from 2007 to 2008. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributed to an increase of $17.9 million from borrowings under the Company's line of credit, $7.8 million from the Senior Notes, $6.3 million from the Redevelopment Centers, and $5.5 million from the Same Centers. The increase in interest expense was offset in part by a decrease of $3.8 million from term loans.             The increase in interest expense on the Company's line of credit was due to an increase in average outstanding borrowings during 2008, in part, because of the purchase of The Shops at North Bridge, the Mervyn's Properties and the 2008 Acquisition Property and the repurchase and retirement of Senior Notes in 2008, which is offset in part by lower LIBOR rates and spreads. The increase in interest expense on the Senior Notes is due to a full year of interest expense in 2008 compared to    52             2007. The decrease in interest expense on term loans was due to the repayment of the $250 million loan in 2007.            The above interest expense items are net of capitalized interest, which increased from $32.0 million in 2007 to $33.3 million in 2008 due to an increase in redevelopment activity in 2008.       (Gain) Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt:               The Company recorded a gain of $84.1 million on the early extinguishment of $222.8 million of the Senior Notes in 2008. In 2007, the Company recorded a $0.9 million loss from the early extinguishment of the $250 million term loan (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources").       Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:               The equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures increased $12.4 million from 2007 to 2008. The increase in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures is due in part to commission income of $6.5 million earned in 2008 from a joint venture, $3.6 million relating to the acquisition of The Shops at North Bridge in 2008, and $2.0 million relating to a loss on the sale of assets in the SDG Macerich Properties, L.P. joint venture in 2007.       (Loss) Gain on Sale or Write-down of Assets:               The Company recorded a loss on sale or write down of assets of $30.9 million in 2008 relating to an $8.7 million write-off of development costs on projects the Company has determined not to pursue, a $19.2 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of land held for development and a $5.3 million adjustment to reduce the carrying value of Mervyn's stores that the Company had previously classified as held for sale (See "Management's Overview and SummaryMervyn's"). The gain on sale or write-down of assets in 2007 of $12.1 million is primarily related to gains on sales of land.       Discontinued Operations:               Income from discontinued operations increased $82.8 million from 2007 to 2008. The increase is primarily due to the $99.1 million gain from the Rochester Redemption in 2008. See "Management's Overview and SummaryAcquisitions and Dispositions." As a result of the Rochester Redemption, the Company classified the results of operations for these properties to discontinued operations for all periods presented.       Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests:               Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased from $29.8 million in 2007 to $29.0 million in 2008. The decrease in income from noncontrolling interests is attributable to $16.3 million from the Rochester Redemption and $0.6 million related to the consolidated joint ventures offset in part by an increase of $16.0 million from the Operating Partnership. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership is due to an increase in net income from $106.1 million in 2007 to $195.0 million in 2008 offset in part by a decrease in the weighted average interest of the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company from 15.0% in 2007 compared to 14.4% in 2008. The decrease in the weighted average interest in the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company is primarily attributed to the conversion of 3,067,131 preferred shares into common shares in 2008 (See Note 14Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and the repurchase of 807,000 shares in 2007 (See Note 15Stockholders EquityStock Repurchase Program in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).    53              Funds From Operations:               Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, FFOdiluted increased 16.4% from $396.6 million in 2007 to $461.5 million in 2008. For disclosure of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the periods and a reconciliation of FFO and FFOdiluted to net income available to common stockholders, see "Funds from Operations."       Operating Activities:               Cash flow from operations decreased from $326.1 million in 2007 to $251.9 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities in 2007 compared to 2008, an increase in distributions of income from unconsolidated joint ventures and the results at the Centers as discussed above.       Investing Activities:               Cash used in investing activities decreased from $865.3 million in 2007 to $559.0 million in 2008. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures of $507.7 million and acquisition deposits of $51.9 million offset by a decrease in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures of $132.5 million and an increase in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures. The decrease in capital expenditures is primarily due to the purchase of the Mervyn's portfolio for $400.2 million in 2007. The decrease in acquisition deposits and the increase in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily due to the Company's purchase of a pro rata share of The Shops at North Bridge for $155.0 million in 2008 (See "Management's Overview and SummaryAcquisitions and Dispositions".) The decrease in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures is due to the receipt of the Company's pro rata share of loan proceeds from the refinance transactions at various unconsolidated joint ventures in 2007.       Financing Activities:               Cash flow provided by financing activities decreased from $355.1 million in 2007 to $288.3 million in 2008. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributed to the issuance of $950 million of Senior Notes in 2007, the repurchase of $222.8 million of Senior Notes in 2008 (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources") and the purchase of the Capped Calls in connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes in 2007.     Liquidity and Capital Resources             The Company anticipates meeting its liquidity needs for its operating expenses and debt service and dividend requirements through cash generated from operations, working capital reserves and/or borrowings under its unsecured line of credit. Additional liquidity will be provided if the Company decides to continue to pay a portion of its dividends in stock throughout 2010. For example, the Company announced that payment of a portion of its next quarterly dividend will be in stock, which is payable on March 22, 2010. The form, timing and or amount of future dividends will be at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors. The completion of the Company's stock offering in October 2009, which raised net proceeds of approximately $383.4 million, as well as the closing of three joint venture transactions during the third quarter of 2009, which raised proceeds of approximately $434.0 million, provided the Company with additional liquidity in 2009. (See Item 1. BusinessRecent Developments"Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Financing Activity.") Furthermore, by reducing the Company's quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share and paying 90% of that dividend in equity in 2009, the Company reduced the cash amount of its dividends and distributions by $212.5 million and funded these dividends and distributions from cash flow provided by operations.    54                    The following tables summarize capital expenditures and lease acquisition costs incurred at the Centers for the years ended December 31:                                 (Dollars in thousands)          2009      2008      2007          Consolidated Centers:                                    Acquisitions of property and equipment     $  11,001     $  87,516     $  387,899         Development, redevelopment and expansion of Centers        216,615        446,119        545,926         Renovations of Centers        9,577        8,541        31,065         Tenant allowances        10,830        14,651        27,959         Deferred leasing charges        19,960        22,263        21,611                                       $  267,983     $  579,090     $  1,014,460                                    Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers (at Company's pro rata share):                             Acquisitions of property and equipment     $  5,443     $  294,416     $  24,828         Development, redevelopment and expansion of Centers        57,019        60,811        33,492         Renovations of Centers        4,165        3,080        10,495         Tenant allowances        5,092        13,759        15,066         Deferred leasing charges        3,852        4,997        4,181                                       $  75,571     $  377,063     $  88,062                                               Management expects levels to be incurred in future years for tenant allowances and deferred leasing charges to be comparable or less than 2009 and that capital for those expenditures will be available from working capital, cash flow from operations, borrowings on property specific debt or unsecured corporate borrowings. The Company expects to incur between $150 million and $200 million in 2010 for development, redevelopment, expansion and renovations. Capital for these major expenditures, developments and/or redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be, obtained from a combination of equity or debt financings, which include borrowings under the Company's line of credit and construction loans. In addition, the Company has generated additional liquidity in the past through joint venture transactions and the sale of non-core assets, and may continue to do so in the future, as evidenced by the non-core asset sales in 2009 and the recent sale of ownership interests in Queens Center, FlatIron Crossing, Freehold Raceway Mall and Chandler Fashion Center, to joint venture partners.            Recent turmoil in the capital and credit markets, however, has significantly limited access to debt and equity financing for many companies. As demonstrated by the Company's recent activity, including its October 2009 equity offering, the Company was able to access capital throughout 2009; however, there is no assurance the Company will be able to do so in future periods or on similar terms and conditions. Many factors impact the Company's ability to access capital, such as its overall debt level, interest rates, interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions. As a result of the current state of the capital and commercial lending markets, the Company may be required to finance more of its business activities with borrowings under its line of credit rather than with public and private unsecured debt and equity securities, fixed-rate mortgage financing and other traditional sources. In addition, in the event that the Company has significant tenant defaults as a result of the overall economy and general market conditions, the Company could have a decrease in cash flow from operations, which could create further borrowings under its line of credit. These events could result in an increase in the Company's proportion of variable-rate debt, which would cause it to be subject to interest rate fluctuations in the future. (See "Risk FactorsWe depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements" included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).    55                   The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness at December 31, 2009 was $6.8 billion (including $1.3 billion of unsecured debt and $2.3 billion of its pro rata share of joint venture debt). The majority of the Company's debt consists of fixed-rate conventional mortgages payable collateralized by individual properties. Approximately $247.2 million of the Company's indebtedness matures in 2010 (excluding loans with extensions and refinancing transactions that have recently closed). The Company expects that all 2010 debt maturities will be refinanced, extended and/or paid off from the Company's line of credit.            On March 16, 2007, the Company issued $950 million in Senior Notes that mature on March 15, 2012. The Senior Notes bear interest at 3.25%, payable semiannually, are senior to unsecured debt of the Company and are guaranteed by the Operating Partnership. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company repurchased and retired $89.1 million of the Senior Notes and as a result recorded a gain of $29.8 million on early extinguishment of debt. The repurchases were funded by additional borrowings on the Company's line of credit. The carrying value of the Senior Notes at December 31, 2009 was $614.2 million. See Note 11Bank and Other Notes Payable in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.            The Company has a $1.5 billion revolving line of credit that matures on April 25, 2010. The Company is in the process of exercising the available one-year extension option under this facility that will extend the maturity date through April 25, 2011. The interest rate on the line of credit fluctuates between LIBOR plus 0.75% to LIBOR plus 1.10% depending on the Company's overall leverage. The Company has an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate on $400.0 million of the outstanding balance of the line of credit at 6.08% until maturity. In addition, the Company has another interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate on $255.0 million of the line of credit at 6.13% until April 15, 2010. As of December 31, 2009, borrowings outstanding were $655.0 million at an average interest rate, of 6.10%. The Company has access to the remaining balance of its $1.5 billion line of credit.            On April 25, 2005, the Company obtained a five year, $450.0 million term loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%. The term loan was repaid during the year ended December 31, 2009 from the proceeds of the sales of interests in Queens Center and FlatIron Crossing (See "Management's Overview and SummaryAcquisitions and Dispositions,") and through additional borrowings under the Company's line of credit.            On October 27, 2009, the Company completed an offering of 12,000,000 newly issued shares of its common stock, as well as an additional 1,800,000 newly issued shares of common stock in connection with the underwriters' exercise of its over-allotment option. The net proceeds of the offering, after giving effect to the issuance and sale of all 13,800,000 shares of common stock at an initial price to the public of $29.00 per share, were approximately $383.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other transaction costs. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down the line of credit.            At December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all applicable loan covenants.            At December 31, 2009, the Company had cash and cash equivalents available of $93.3 million.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements               The Company has an ownership interest in a number of unconsolidated joint ventures as detailed in Note 4 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. The Company accounts for those investments that it does not have a controlling interest in or is not the primary beneficiary using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Company as "Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures." A pro rata share of the mortgage debt on these properties is shown in "Item 2. PropertiesMortgage Debt."    56                   In addition, certain joint ventures also have debt that could become recourse debt to the Company or its subsidiaries, in excess of the Company's pro rata share, should the joint ventures be unable to discharge the obligations of the related debt.

NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of depreciated operating properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. The Company also adjusts FFO for the noncontrolling interest due to redemption value on the Rochester Properties. (See Note 17Discontinued Operations in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)            FFO and FFO on a fully-diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. This is especially true since FFO excludes real estate depreciation and amortization as the Company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. In addition, consistent with the key objective of FFO as a measure of operating performance, the adjustment of FFO for the noncontrolling interest in redemption value provides a more meaningful measure of the Company's operating performance between periods without reference to the non-cash charge related to the adjustment in noncontrolling interest due to redemption value. The Company believes that such a presentation also provides investors with a more meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to the operating results of other REITS. Further, FFO on a fully diluted basis is one of the measures investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities.            FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by GAAP and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The Company also cautions that FFO, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts. The reconciliation of FFO and FFOdiluted to net income available to common stockholders is provided below.            Management compensates for the limitations of FFO by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of FFO and a reconciliation of FFO and FFO-diluted to net income available to common stockholders. Management believes that to further understand the Company's performance, FFO should be compared with the Company's reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.    58                    The following reconciles net income (loss) available to common stockholders to FFO and FFOdiluted (dollars and shares in thousands):                                              2009      2008      2007      2006      2005          Net income (loss)available to common stockholders     $  120,742     $  161,925     $  64,131     $  217,404     $  (93,614  )      Adjustments to reconcile net income to FFObasic:                                                         Noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership        17,517        27,230        11,238        40,827        (22,001  )         Gain on sale or write-down of consolidated assets(1)        (121,766  )     (68,714  )     (9,771  )     (241,732  )     (1,530  )         Adjustment for redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests                        2,046        17,062        183,620            Add: gain on undepreciated assetsconsolidated assets(1)        4,762        798        8,047        8,827        1,068            Add: noncontrolling interest share of gain on sale of consolidated joint ventures(1)        310        185        760        36,831        239            Less: write-down of consolidated assets(1)        (28,434  )     (27,445  )                                 Loss (gain) on sale of assets from unconsolidated joint ventures (pro rata)(2)        7,642        (3,432  )     (400  )     (725  )     (1,954  )         Add: (loss) gain on sale of undepreciated assetsfrom unconsolidated joint ventures (pro rata)(2)        (152  )     3,039        2,793        725        2,092            Add noncontrolling interest on sale of undepreciated consolidated joint ventures                487                                    Less write down of unconsolidated joint ventures (pro rata)(2)        (7,501  )     (94  )                                 Depreciation and amortization on consolidated assets        266,164        279,339        231,860        232,219        205,971            Less: depreciation and amortization attributable to noncontrolling interest on consolidated joint ventures        (7,871  )     (3,395  )     (4,769  )     (5,422  )     (5,873  )         Depreciation and amortization on unconsolidated joint ventures (pro rata)(2)        106,435        96,441        88,807        82,745        73,247            Less: depreciation on personal property        (13,740  )     (9,952  )     (8,244  )     (15,722  )     (14,724  )                                            FFObasic(3)        344,108        456,412        386,498        373,039        326,541         Additional adjustments to arrive at FFOdiluted:                                                         Impact of convertible preferred stock                4,124        10,058        10,083        9,649            Impact of non-participating convertible preferred units                979                        641                                               FFOdiluted     $  344,108     $  461,515     $  396,556     $  383,122     $  336,831                                               Weighted average number of FFO shares outstanding for:                                                      FFObasic(3)        93,010        86,794        84,467        84,138        73,250         Adjustments for the impact of dilutive securities in computing FFOdiluted:                                                         Convertible preferred stock                1,447        3,512        3,627        3,627            Non-participating convertible preferred units                205                        197            Share and unit-based compensation plans                        293        293        323                                               FFOdiluted(4)        93,010        88,446        88,272        88,058        77,397                                                         (1) The net total of these line items equal the loss (gain) on sales of depreciated assets.

(4) The computation of FFOdiluted shares outstanding includes the effect of share and unit-based compensation plans and the Senior Notes using the treasury stock method. It also assumes the conversion of MACWH, LP common and preferred units to the extent that they are dilutive to the FFO computation. On February 25, 1998, the Company sold $100 million of its Series A Preferred Stock. The holder of the Series A Preferred Stock converted 0.6 million, 0.7 million, 1.3 million and 1.0 million shares to common shares on October 18, 2007, May 6, 2008, May 8, 2008 and September 17, 2008, respectively. The preferred stock was convertible on a one-for-one basis for common stock. The then outstanding preferred shares were assumed converted for purposes of 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 FFOdiluted as they were dilutive to that calculation.        59                   NAME="ds10801_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02669">         ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK                 The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk.

In addition, the method of computing fair value for mortgage notes payable included a credit value adjustment based on the estimated value of the property that serves as collateral for the underlying debt (See Note 10Mortgage Notes Payable in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
