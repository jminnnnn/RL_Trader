Other Transactions and Events:             On July 15, 2010, a court appointed receiver assumed operational control of Valley View Center and responsibility for managingall aspects of the property. In March 2012, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $54.3 million to write down the carrying value of the long-lived assets to their estimatedfair value. On April 23, 2012, the property was sold by the receiver for $33.5 million, which resulted in a gain on the extinguishment of debt of $104.0 million.           OnApril 1, 2011, the Company's joint venture in SDG Macerich conveyed Granite Run Mall to the mortgage note lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Themortgage note was non-recourse. The Company's pro rata share of gain on the extinguishment of debt was $7.8 million.           OnMay 11, 2011, the non-recourse mortgage note payable on Shoppingtown Mall went into maturity default. As a result of the maturity default and the correspondingreduction of the estimated holding period, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $35.7 million to write-down the carrying value of the long-lived assets totheir estimated fair value. On September 14, 2011, the Company exercised its right and redeemed the outside ownership interests in the Center for a cash payment of $11.4 million. OnDecember 30, 2011, the Company conveyed the property to the mortgage note lender by a deed-in-lieu offoreclosure. As a result of the conveyance, the Company recognized an additional $3.9 million loss on the disposal of the property.           OnMay 31, 2012, the Company conveyed Prescott Gateway, a 584,000 square foot regional shopping center in Prescott, Arizona, to the mortgage note lender by adeed-in-lieu of foreclosure. The mortgage loan was non-recourse. As a result of the conveyance, the Company recognized a gain on the extinguishment of debt of$16.3 million.     Redevelopment and Development Activity:             In August 2011, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with a subsidiary of AWE/Talisman for the development of FashionOutlets of Chicago in the Village of Rosemont, Illinois. The Company owns 60% of the joint venture and AWE/Talisman owns 40%. The Center will be a fully enclosed two level, 526,000 square foot outletcenter. The site is located within a mile of O'Hare International Airport. The project broke ground in November 2011 and is expected to be completed in August 2013. The total estimated project cost isapproximately $200.0 million. As of December 31, 2012, the joint venture has incurred $91.8 million of development costs. On March 2, 2012, the joint venture obtained aconstruction loan on the property that allows for borrowings up to $140.0 million, bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% and matures March 5, 2017. As of December 31, 2012, the jointventure has borrowed $9.2 million under the loan.           TheCompany's joint venture in Tysons Corner, a 2,154,000 square foot regional shopping center in McLean, Virginia, is currently expanding the property to include a 524,000 square footoffice building, a 430 unit residential tower and a 300 room hotel. The joint venture started the expansion project in October 2011 and expects it to be completed in Fall 2014. The total cost of theproject is estimated at $600.0 million, of which $300.0 million is estimated to be the Company's pro rata share. The Company has funded $64.8 million of the total of$129.6 million cost incurred by the joint venture as of December 31, 2012.     Inflation:             In the last five years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most ofthe leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically   47        throughoutthe lease term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"). In addition, approximately 5% to13% of the leases expire each year, which enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing marketrate. The Company has generally entered into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses actually incurredat any Center, which places the burden of cost control on the Company. Additionally, certain leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses.     Seasonality:             The shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retaileroccupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels. In addition, shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season andthe majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter. As a result of the above, earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter.    Critical Accounting Policies            The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States ofAmerica requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of thefinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.           Someof these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition, estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals, provisions for uncollectibleaccounts, impairment of long-lived assets, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, and estimates for environmental matters. The Company's significantaccounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, thefollowing policies are deemed to be critical.     Revenue Recognition:             Minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. The difference betweenthe amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the "straight line rent adjustment." Currently, 63% of the Mall Store and Freestanding Store leases containprovisions for CPI rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease. The Company believes that using an annual multiple of CPI increases, rather than fixed contractual rent increases,results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases. Percentage rents arerecognized when the tenants' specified sales targets have been met. Estimated recoveries from certain tenants for their pro rata share of real estate taxes, insurance and other shopping centeroperating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. Other tenants pay a fixed rate and these tenant recoveries' revenues are recognized on astraight-line basis over the term of the related leases.     Property:             Maintenance and repair expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Costs for major replacements and betterments, which includesHVAC equipment, roofs, parking lots, etc., are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and arereflected in earnings.   48                Propertyis recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:                Buildings and improvements     5 - 40 years      Tenant improvements     5 - 7 years      Equipment and furnishings     5 - 7 years        Capitalization of Costs:             The Company capitalizes costs incurred in redevelopment, development, renovation and improvement of properties. The capitalized costsinclude pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and othercosts incurred during the period of development. These capitalized costs include direct and certain indirect costs clearly associated with the project. Indirect costs include real estate taxes,insurance and certain shared administrative costs. In assessing the amounts of direct and indirect costs to be capitalized, allocations are made to projects based on estimates of the actual amount oftime spent on each activity. Indirect costs not clearly associated with specific projects are expensed as period costs. Capitalized indirect costs are allocated to development and redevelopmentactivities based on the square footage of the portion of the building not held available for immediate occupancy. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then costcapitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized. For projects with extendedlease-up periods, the Company ends the capitalization when significant activities have ceased, which does not exceed the shorter of a one-year period after the completion ofthe building shell or when the construction is substantially complete.     Acquisitions:             The Company allocates the estimated fair values of acquisitions to land, building, tenant improvements and identified intangible assetsand liabilities, based on their estimated fair values. In addition, any assumed mortgage notes payable are recorded at their estimated fair values. The estimated fair value of the land and buildingsis determined utilizing an "as if vacant" methodology. Tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair value basis at the acquisition dateprorated over the remaining lease terms. The tenant improvements are classified as an asset under property and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. Identifiable intangible assets andliabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases which come in three forms: (i) leasing commissions and legal costs, which represent thevalue associated with "cost avoidance" of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the Company's markets; (ii) value ofin-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the "assumed vacant" property to the occupancy level when purchased;and (iii) above or below market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discountedfor tenant credit risks. Leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms. The value of in-placeleases are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus an estimate of renewal of the acquired leases. Above or below market leases are classified indeferred charges and other assets or in other accrued liabilities, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market, and the asset or liability is amortized to minimum rents overthe remaining terms of the leases. The remaining lease terms of below-market leases may include certain below-market fixed-rate renewal periods. In considering whether or not a lessee willexecute a below-market fixed-rate lease renewal option, the Company evaluates economic factors and certain qualitative factors   49        atthe time of acquisition such as tenant mix in the center, the Company's relationship with the tenant and the availability of competing tenant space.           TheCompany immediately expenses costs associated with business combinations as period costs.     Asset Impairment:             The Company assesses whether an indicator of impairment in the value of its properties exists by considering expected future operatingincome, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. Such factors include projected rental revenue, operating costs and capital expenditures as wellas estimated holding periods and capitalization rates. If an impairment indicator exists, the determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows,excluding interest expense. The amount of impairment loss, if any, is determined by comparing the fair value, as determined by a discounted cash flows analysis, with the carrying value of the relatedassets. The Company generally holds and operates its properties long-term, which decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable. Properties classified as held forsale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.           TheCompany reviews its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for a series of operating losses and other factors that may indicate that a decrease in the value of its investmentshas occurred which is other-than-temporary. The investment in each unconsolidated joint venture is evaluated periodically, and as deemed necessary, for recoverability andvaluation declines that are other than temporary.     Fair Value of Financial Instruments:             The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent ofthe reporting entity and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions.           Level 1inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other thanquoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets andliabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that areobservable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which is typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any,related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchywithin which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significanceof a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.           TheCompany calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is differentthan the carrying value of those financial instruments. When the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value, no additional disclosure is made.     Deferred Charges:             Costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using thestraight-line method. As these deferred leasing costs represent productive assets incurred in connection with the Company's provision of leasing arrangements at the Centers, the   50        relatedcash flows are classified as investing activities within the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows. Costs relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred andamortized over the life of the related loan using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The ranges of the terms of the agreements are as follows:                Deferred lease costs     1 - 15 years      Deferred financing costs     1 - 15 years       Results of Operations            Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred because of the transactions affecting the Company'sproperties described above, including those related to the Acquisition Properties and the Development Property as defined below.           Forpurposes of the discussion below, the Company defines "Same Centers" as those Centers that are substantially complete and in operation for the entirety of both periods of thecomparison. Non-Same Centers for comparison purposes include recently acquired properties ("Acquisition Properties") and those Centers or properties that are going through a substantialredevelopment often resulting in the closing of a portion of the Center ("Development Properties"). The Company moves a Center in and out of Same Centers based on whether the Center is substantiallycomplete and in operation for the entirety of both periods of the comparison. Accordingly, the Same Centers consist of all consolidated centers, excluding the Acquisition Properties and theDevelopment Properties, for the periods of comparison.           Forcomparison of the year ended December 31, 2012 to the year ended December 31, 2011, the Acquisition Properties include Desert Sky Mall, the Kohl's store at CapitolaMall, Superstition Springs Land, Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls USA, the SDG Acquisition Properties, 500 North Michigan Avenue, FlatIron Crossing, Arrowhead Towne Center and Kings PlazaShopping Center. For comparison of the year ended December 31, 2011 to the year ended December 31, 2010, the Acquisition Properties include Desert Sky Mall, the Kohl's store at CapitolaMall, Superstition Springs Land, Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls USA and the SDG Acquisition Properties. The increase in revenues and expenses of the Acquisition Properties from the year endedDecember 31, 2011 to the year ended December 31, 2012 is primarily due to the acquisition of the SDG Acquisition Properties (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overviewand Summary). The increase in revenues and expenses of the Acquisition Properties from the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily due to theacquisition of Desert Sky Mall in 2011 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary).           Forthe comparison of the year ended December 31, 2012 to the year ended December 31, 2011, the "Development Property" is the Fashion Outlets of Chicago. For the comparisonof the year ended December 31, 2011 to the year ended December 31, 2010, the "Development Property" is Santa Monica Place. The increase in revenue and expenses of the DevelopmentProperty from the year endedDecember 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily due to the opening of Santa Monica Place in August 2010.           Unconsolidatedjoint ventures are reflected using the equity method of accounting. The Company's pro rata share of the results from these Centers is reflected in the consolidatedstatements of operations as equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures.           TheCompany considers tenant annual sales per square foot (for tenants in place for a minimum of 12 months or longer and 10,000 square feet and under) for regional shoppingcenters, occupancy rates (excluding large retail stores or "Anchors") for the Centers and releasing spreads (i.e. a comparison of average base rent per square foot on leases executed during thetrailing twelve months   51        toaverage base rent per square foot on leases expiring during the year based on the spaces 10,000 square feet and under) to be key performance indicators of the Company's internal growth.           Tenantsales per square foot increased from $489 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 to $517 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012. Occupancy rateincreased from 92.7% at December 31, 2011 to 93.8% at December 31, 2012. Releasing spreads increased 15.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012. These calculationsexclude Centers under development or redevelopment.           TheCompany's recent trend of retail sales growth continued during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 with tenant sales per square foot and releasing spreads increasingcompared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2011. The Company expects that releasing spreads will continue to be positive in 2013 as it renews or relets leases that are scheduled to expireduring the year. The Company's occupancy rate as of December 31, 2012 also increased compared to December 31, 2011. Although certain aspects of the U.S. economy, the retail industry aswell as the Company's operating results have continued to improve, economic and political uncertainty remains in various parts of the world and the U.S. economy is still experiencing weakness. Anyfurther continuation or worsening of these adverse conditions could harm the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.    Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2012 and 2011      Revenues:             Minimum and percentage rents (collectively referred to as "rental revenue") increased by $72.9 million, or 16.3%, from 2011 to2012. The increase in rental revenue is attributed to an increase of $74.0 million from the Acquisition Properties offset in part by a decrease of $1.1 million from the Same Centers. Thedecrease at the Same Centers is primarily attributed to the decrease in above and below-market leases and lease termination income as noted below.           Rentalrevenue includes the amortization of above and below-market leases, the amortization of straight-line rents and lease termination income. The amortization of above andbelow-market leases decreased from $9.4 million in 2011 to $5.3 million in 2012. The amortization of straight-line rents increased from $4.8 million in 2011 to $6.1 millionin 2012. Lease termination income decreased from $5.7 million in 2011 to $4.7 million in 2012.           Tenantrecoveries increased $31.7 million, or 13.1%, from 2011 to 2012. The increase in tenant recoveries is attributed to increases of $32.3 million from the AcquisitionProperties offset in part by a decrease of $0.6 million from the Same Centers.           ManagementCompanies' revenue increased from $40.4 million in 2011 to $41.2 million in 2012 primarily due to an increase in development fees.     Shopping Center and Operating Expenses:             Shopping center and operating expenses increased $38.2 million, or 15.8%, from 2011 to 2012. The increase in shopping center andoperating expenses is attributed to an increase of $41.2 million from the Acquisition Properties offset in part by a decrease of $3.0 million from the Same Centers.     Management Companies' Operating Expenses:             Management Companies' operating expenses decreased $1.0 million from 2011 to 2012 due to a decrease in compensation costs.   52          REIT General and Administrative Expenses:             REIT general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.7 million from 2011 to 2012.     Depreciation and Amortization:             Depreciation and amortization increased $50.5 million from 2011 to 2012. The increase in depreciation and amortization isprimarily attributed to an increase of $45.8 million from the Acquisition Properties and $4.7 million from the Same Centers.     Interest Expense:             Interest expense decreased $2.9 million from 2011 to 2012. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributed todecreases of $25.3 million from the Senior Notes, which were paid off in full in March 2012 (See Liquidity and Capital Resources), $7.7 million from the Same Centers and$1.3 million from the Development Property. These decreases were offset in part by increases of $19.5 million from the Acquisition Properties, $8.9 million from the borrowingsunder theline of credit and $3.0 million from the term loan. The decrease from the Same Centers was primarily due to the maturity of a $400.0 million interest rate swap agreement in April 2011.           Theabove interest expense items are net of capitalized interest, which decreased from $11.9 million in 2011 to $10.7 million in 2012, primarily due to a decrease ininterest rates in 2012.     Loss (gain) on Early Extinguishment of Debt:             Loss (gain) on early extinguishment of debt decreased $10.6 million from 2011 to 2012. The decrease in loss on earlyextinguishment of debt is primarily attributed to a $9.1 million loss from the prepayment of the mortgage note payable on Chesterfield Towne Center in 2011 and a $1.4 million loss fromthe repurchase of the Senior Notes in 2011.     Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:             Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $215.4 million from 2011 to 2012. The decrease in equity in incomeof unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily attributed to the Company's pro rata share of the gain of $188.3 million in connection with the SDG Transaction (See "Acquisitions andDispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) in 2011. The remaining decrease in equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures is attributed to the Company's $12.5 million pro ratashare of the remeasurement gain on the acquisition of an underlying ownership interest in Kierland Commons in 2011 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary), and theCompany's $7.8 million pro rata share of the gain on early extinguishment of debt of its joint venture in Granite Run Mall in 2011 (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overviewand Summary).     Gain (loss) on Remeasurement, Sale or Write down of Assets, net:             Gain (loss) on remeasurement, sale or write down of assets, net increased $226.7 million from 2011 to 2012. The increase isprimarily attributed to the $115.7 million remeasurement gain on the purchase of Arrowhead Towne Center in 2012, the $84.2 million remeasurement gain on the purchase of FlatIron Crossingin 2012 and the $24.6 million gain on the buyout of the Company's ownership interest in NorthPark Center in 2012 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary).   53          Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations:             Income (loss) from discontinued operations increased $144.2 million from 2011 to 2012. The increase is primarily due to the$49.7 million gain on disposal of Valley View Center in 2012, the $16.3 million gain on disposal of Prescott Gateway in 2012, the $7.8 million gain on the sale of Carmel Plaza in2012, the loss on disposal of $39.7 million on Shoppingtown Mall in 2011 and the impairment charge of $19.7 million on The Borgata in 2011 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" inManagement's Overview and Summary).     Net Income:             Net income increased $197.3 million from 2011 to 2012. The increase in net income is primarily attributed to increases of$226.7 million from gains on remeasurement, sale or write down of assets, net, $144.2 million from discontinued operations and $44.4 million from the operating results of theconsolidated properties offset in part by a decrease of $215.4 million from equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures as discussed above.     Funds From Operations ("FFO"):             Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, FFOdiluted increased 44.6% from $399.6 million in 2011 to$577.9 million in 2012. For a reconciliation of FFO and FFOdiluted to net income available to common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see "FundsFrom Operations ("FFO") and Adjusted Funds From Operations ("AFFO")".     Operating Activities:             Cash provided by operating activities increased from $237.3 million in 2011 to $351.3 million in 2012. The increase wasprimarily due to changes in assets and liabilities and the results at the Centers as discussed above.     Investing Activities:             Cash used in investing activities increased from $212.1 million in 2011 to $963.4 million in 2012. The increase in cashused in investing activities was primarily due to increases of $936.7 million from acquisitions of properties and $83.3 million from the development, redevelopment and renovations ofproperties offset in part by an increase of $119.7 million in proceeds from the sale of assets, an increase of $106.6 million in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures and adecrease of $60.0 million in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in the acquisitions of properties is primarily due to the purchases of Kings Plaza Shopping Center,FlatIron Crossing and Arrowhead Towne Center in 2012 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary). The increase in proceeds from the sale of assets is primarily due tothe buyout of the Company's ownership interest in NorthPark Center and the sales of The Borgata, Carmel Plaza, Hilton Village and ownership interests in Chandler Festival, Chandler Village Center andChandler Gateway in 2012. The increase in distributions from the unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily due to the distribution of the Company's pro rata share of the excess refinancing proceedsof Queens Center in 2012.     Financing Activities:             Cash provided by financing activities increased from a deficit of $403.6 million in 2011 to a surplus of $610.6 millionin 2012. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from mortgages, bank and other notes payable of $2.4 billion, the repurchase ofSenior Notes of $180.3 million in 2011 and the net proceeds from the at-the-market program of $175.6 million (See Liquidity and Capital Resources) offset in part by an increase inpayments on mortgages, bank and other notes payable of $1.7 billion.   54                    Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010      Revenues:             Rental revenue increased by $37.1 million, or 9.0%, from 2010 to 2011. The increase in rental revenue is attributed to anincrease of $17.8 million from the Acquisition Properties, $11.6 million from the Development Property and $7.7 million from the Same Centers. The increase in Same Centers' rentalrevenue is primarily attributed to an increase in releasing spreads.           Theamortization of above and below market leases increased from $7.1 million in 2010 to $9.4 million in 2011. The amortization of straight-line rents increasedfrom $4.1 million in 2010 to$4.8 million in 2011. Lease termination income increased from $4.2 million in 2010 to $5.7 million in 2011.           Tenantrecoveries increased by $13.3 million from 2010 to 2011. The increase in tenant recoveries is primarily attributed to an increase of $7.4 million from theDevelopment Property and $6.1 million from the Acquisition Properties offset in part by a decrease of $0.2 million from the Same Centers.           ManagementCompanies' revenue decreased from $42.9 million in 2010 to $40.4 million in 2011 primarily due to a decrease in development fees.     Shopping Center and Operating Expenses:             Shopping center and operating expenses increased $18.5 million, or 8.3%, from 2010 to 2011. The increase in shopping center andoperating expenses is attributed to an increase of $10.1 million from the Acquisition Properties, $8.1 million from the Development Property and $0.3 million from the SameCenters.     Management Companies' Operating Expenses:             Management Companies' operating expenses decreased $3.8 million from 2010 to 2011 due to a decrease in compensation costs.     REIT General and Administrative Expenses:             REIT general and administrative expenses increased by $0.4 million from 2010 to 2011.     Depreciation and Amortization:             Depreciation and amortization increased $25.5 million from 2010 to 2011. The increase in depreciation and amortization isprimarily attributed to an increase of $10.1 million from the Development Property, $9.4 million from the Acquisition Properties and $6.0 million from the Same Centers.     Interest Expense:             Interest expense decreased $18.3 million from 2010 to 2011. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributed to adecrease of $19.4 million from interest rate swap agreements, $9.6 million from the Same Centers and $2.3 million from the Senior Notes offset in part by an increase of$6.7 million from the Development Property, $3.5 million from the Acquisition Properties, $2.6 million from the borrowings under the line of credit and $0.2 million fromthe term loans. The decrease resulting from the interest rate swap agreements is due to the maturity of a $450.0 million interest rate swap agreement in April 2010 and the maturity of a$400.0 million interest rate swap agreement in April 2011.           Theabove interest expense items are net of capitalized interest, which decreased from $25.7 million in 2010 to $11.9 million in 2011 due to a decrease in redevelopmentactivity in 2011.   55          Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt, net:             The loss on early extinguishment of debt, net increased $14.2 million from 2010 to 2011. The increase in loss on earlyextinguishment of debt is primarily attributed to a $9.1 million loss from the prepayment of the mortgage note payable on Chesterfield Towne Center in 2011, the $1.4 million loss fromthe repurchase of the Senior Notes in 2011 and the $4.2 million gain on the refinancing of two mortgage notes payable in 2010.     Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:             Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures increased $215.1 million from 2010 to 2011. The increase in equity in incomeof unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily attributed to the Company's pro rata share of the gain of $188.3 million in connection with the SDG Transaction (See "Acquisitions andDispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) in 2011. The remaining increase in equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures is attributed to the Company's $12.5 million pro ratashare of the remeasurement gain on the acquisition of an underlying ownership interest in Kierland Commons in 2011 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary), and theCompany's $7.8 million pro rata share of the gain on early extinguishment of debt of its joint venture in Granite Run Mall in 2011 (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overviewand Summary).     Loss on Remeasurement, Sale or Write down of Assets, net:             Loss on remeasurement, sale or write down of assets, net increased $22.5 million from 2010 to 2011. The increase in loss isprimarily attributed to the $25.2 million impairment charge in 2011 (See Note 6Property to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements).     Loss from Discontinued Operations:             Loss from discontinued operations increased from $10.4 million in 2010 to $74.9 million in 2011. The increase in lossfrom discontinued operations is primarily attributed to the $39.6 million loss on the disposal of Shoppingtown Mall in 2011 (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview andSummary) and the $19.7 million impairment charge on The Borgata in 2011 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary).     Net Income:             Net income increased $140.7 million from 2010 to 2011. The increase in net income is primarily attributed to the Company's prorata share of the $188.3 million gain on the SDG Transaction (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) offset in part by the loss on the disposal ofShoppingtown Mall of $39.6 million (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary).     Funds From Operations:             Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, FFOdiluted increased 13.7% from $351.3 million in 2010 to$399.6 million in 2011. For a reconciliation of FFO and FFOdiluted to net income available to common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see "FundsFrom Operations ("FFO") and Adjusted Funds From Operations ("AFFO")".     Operating Activities:             Cash provided by operating activities increased from $200.4 million in 2010 to $237.3 million in 2011. The increase wasprimarily due to changes in assets and liabilities and the results at the Centers as discussed above.   56          Investing Activities:             Cash used in investing activities increased from $142.2 million in 2010 to $212.1 million in 2011. The increase wasprimarily due to an increase of $138.7 million in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures offset in part by an increase of $98.3 million in distributions from unconsolidated jointventures. The increase in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily attributed to the Kierland Commons, The Shops at Atlas Park, Arrowhead Towne Center and Superstition Springstransactions (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary). The increase in distributions from the unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily due to the distribution ofthe Company's pro rata share of the excess refinancing proceeds of the loan on Arrowhead Towne Center in 2011.     Financing Activities:             Cash from financing activities decreased from a surplus of $294.1 million in 2010 to a deficit of $403.6 million in 2011.The increase in cash used was primarily due to the $1.2 billion stock offering in 2010, a decrease in proceeds from mortgages, bank and other notes payable of $170.5 million, an increasein the repurchase of the Senior Notes of $162.1 million and an increase in dividends and distributions of $71.0 million offset in part by a decrease in payments on mortgages, bank andother notes payable of $940.8 million.    Liquidity and Capital Resources            The Company anticipates meeting its liquidity needs for its operating expenses and debt service and dividend requirements for the nexttwelve months through cash generated from operations, working capital reserves and/or borrowings under its unsecured line of credit.           Thefollowing tables summarize capital expenditures and lease acquisition costs incurred at the Centers for the years ended December 31:                      (Dollars in thousands)     2012      2011      2010          Consolidated Centers:                                    Acquisitions of property and equipment     $  1,313,091     $  314,575     $  12,888         Development, redevelopment, expansion and renovation of Centers        158,474        88,842        214,796         Tenant allowances        18,116        19,418        21,993         Deferred leasing charges        23,551        29,280        24,528                                       $  1,513,232     $  452,115     $  274,205                                   Joint Venture Centers (at Company's pro rata share):                                    Acquisitions of property and equipment     $  5,080     $  143,390     $  6,095         Development, redevelopment, expansion and renovation of Centers        79,642        37,712        42,289         Tenant allowances        6,422        8,406        8,130         Deferred leasing charges        4,215        4,910        4,664                                       $  95,359     $  194,418     $  61,178                                           TheCompany expects amounts to be incurred during the next twelve months for tenant allowances and deferred leasing charges to be comparable or less than 2012 and that capital for thoseexpenditures will be available from working capital, cash flow from operations, borrowings on property specific debt or unsecured corporate borrowings. The Company expects to incur between$200 million and $300 million during the next twelve months for development, redevelopment, expansion and renovations. Capital for these major expenditures, developments and/orredevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be obtained from a combination of debt or equity financings, which are expected to include borrowings under the Company's line of credit andconstruction loans. The   57        Companyhas also generated liquidity in the past through equity offerings, property refinancings, joint venture transactions and the sale of non-core assets. The Company has announcedplans to sell certain non-core assets in 2013 depending upon market conditions which will generate additional liquidity. Furthermore, the Company has filed a shelf registration statement whichregistered anunspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, warrants, rights and units.           Thecapital and credit markets can fluctuate, and at times, limit access to debt and equity financing for companies. As demonstrated by the Company's recent activity, including its new$500 million ATM Program discussed below and its $1.5 billion line of credit, the Company has recently been able to access capital; however, there is no assurance the Company will beable to do so in future periods or on similar terms and conditions. Many factors impact the Company's ability to access capital, such as its overall debt level, interest rates, interest coverageratios and prevailing market conditions. In the event that the Company has significant tenant defaults as a result of the overall economy and general market conditions, the Company could have adecrease in cash flow from operations, which could result in borrowings under its line of credit. These events could result in an increase in the Company's proportion of floating rate debt, whichwould cause it to be subject to interest rate fluctuations in the future.           OnAugust 17, 2012, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement ("Distribution Agreement") with a number of sales agents to issue and sell, from time to time, sharesof common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $500 million (the "Shares"). Sales of the Shares, if any, may be made in privately negotiated transactions and/or any other methodpermitted by law, including sales deemed to be an "at the market" offering, which includes sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange or sales made to or through a market maker other than onan exchange. This offering is referred to herein as the "ATM Program". During the three months ended December 31, 2012, the Company did not sell any shares of common stock under the ATMProgram. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company sold 2,961,903 shares of common stock under the ATM Program in exchange for aggregate gross proceeds of $177.9 million andnet proceeds of $175.6 million, after commissions and other transaction costs. The proceeds from the sales were used to pay down the Company's line of credit. As of December 31, 2012,$322.1 million remained available to be sold under the ATM Program. Actual future sales will depend upon a variety of factors including but not limited to market conditions, the trading priceof the Company's common stock and our capital needs. The Company has no obligation to sell the remaining shares available for sale under the ATM Program.           TheCompany's total outstanding loan indebtedness at December 31, 2012 was $6.9 billion (including $800.0 million of unsecured debt and $1.6 billion of itspro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture debt). The majority of the Company's debt consists of fixed-rate conventional mortgage notes collateralized by individual properties. TheCompany expects that all of the maturities during the next twelve months will be refinanced, restructured, extended and/or paid off from the Company's line of credit or cash on hand. The Company'sloan obligations regarding Valley View Center and Prescott Gateway were discharged on April 23, 2012 and May 31, 2012, respectively (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management'sOverview and Summary).           OnMarch 15, 2012, the Company paid off in full the $439.3 million of Senior Notes that had matured. The repayment was funded by borrowings under the Company's line ofcredit.           TheCompany has a $1.5 billion revolving line of credit that bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread of 1.75% to 3.0% depending on the Company's overall leverage and matures onMay 2, 2015 with a one-year extension option. Based on the Company's current leverage levels, the borrowing rate on the facility is LIBOR plus 2.0%. The line of credit can beexpanded, depending on certain conditions, up to a total facility of $2.0 billion less the outstanding balance of the $125.0 million unsecured term loan, as discussed below. Allobligations under the line of credit are unconditionally guaranteed by the   58        Companyand certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries and are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by pledges of direct and indirect ownership interests in certain of the subsidiaryguarantors. At December 31, 2012, total borrowings under the line of credit were $675.0 million with an average effective interest rate of 2.76%.           TheCompany has a $125.0 million unsecured term loan under the Company's line of credit that bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread of 1.95% to 3.20% depending on the Company'soverall leverage and matures on December 8, 2018. Based on the Company's current leverage levels, the borrowing rate is LIBOR plus 2.20%. As of December 31, 2012, the total interest ratewas 2.57%.           AtDecember 31, 2012, the Company was in compliance with all applicable loan covenants under its agreements.           AtDecember 31, 2012, the Company had cash and cash equivalents available of $65.8 million.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:             The Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures that it does not have a controlling interest or is not the primarybeneficiary using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.           Inaddition, certain joint ventures have secured debt that could become recourse debt to the Company or its subsidiaries, in excess of the Company's pro rata share, should the jointventures be unable todischarge the obligations of the related debt. At December 31, 2012, the balance of the debt that could be recourse to the Company was $51.2 million offset in part by indemnityagreements from joint venture partners for $21.3 million. The maturities of the recourse debt, net of indemnification, are $4.1 million in 2013, $16.8 million in 2015 and$9.0 million in 2016.           Additionally,as of December 31, 2012, the Company is contingently liable for $3.8 million in letters of credit guaranteeing performance by the Company of certainobligations relating to the Centers. The Company does not believe that these letters of credit will result in a liability to the Company.     Contractual Obligations:             The following is a schedule of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 for the consolidated Centers over the periods inwhich they are expected to be paid (in thousands):                                  Payment Due by Period        Contractual Obligations      Total      Less than 1 year      1 - 3 years      3 - 5 years      More than five years          Long-term debt obligations (includes expected interest payments)     $  5,472,292     $  561,517     $  930,446     $  1,483,945     $  2,496,384         Operating lease obligations(1)        340,547        14,496        25,488        24,387        276,176         Purchase obligations(1)        41,107        41,107                                 Other long-term liabilities        301,067        259,271        2,982        3,299        35,515                                                   $  6,155,013     $  876,391     $  958,916     $  1,511,631     $  2,808,075                                                   (1) SeeNote 18Commitments and Contingencies in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    59         Funds From Operations ("FFO") and Adjusted Funds From Operations ("AFFO")            The Company uses FFO in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers FFO andFFO-diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") measures. The National Association of Real EstateInvestment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of depreciated operating properties,plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, impairment write-downs of real estate and write-downs of investments in an affiliate where the write-downs have been driven by a decrease in thevalue of real estate held by the affiliate and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.           AdjustedFFO ("AFFO") excludes the FFO impact of Shoppingtown Mall and Valley View Center for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. In December 2011, the Companyconveyed Shoppingtown Mall to the lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. In July 2010, a court-appointed receiver assumed operational control of Valley View Center andresponsibility for managing all aspects of the property. Valley View Center was sold by the receiver on April 23, 2012, and the related non-recourse mortgage loan obligation wasfully extinguished on that date, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of $104.0 million. On May 31, 2012, the Company conveyed Prescott Gateway to the lender by adeed-in-lieu of foreclosure and the debt was forgiven resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of $16.3 million. AFFO excludes the gain on extinguishment of debt onPrescott Gateway for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012.           FFOand FFO on a diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. This is especially true since FFO excludes real estate depreciationand amortization, as the Company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. The Companybelieves that such a presentation also provides investors with a more meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to the operating results of other REITs. The Company believes that AFFOand AFFO on a diluted basis provide useful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance as they show a more meaningful and consistent comparison of the Company's operating performanceand allow investors to more easily compare the Company's results without taking into account non-cash credits and charges on properties controlled by either a receiver or loan servicer.FFO and AFFO on a diluted basis are measures investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities.           FFOand AFFO do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by GAAP, and are not indicative of cashavailable to fund all cash flow needs. The Company also cautions that FFO and AFFO, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts.           Managementcompensates for the limitations of FFO and AFFO by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of FFO andAFFO and a reconciliation of FFO and AFFO and FFO and AFFO-diluted to net income available to common stockholders. Management believes that to further understand the Company's performance,FFO and AFFO should be compared with the Company's reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the Company's consolidated financialstatements.   60                           The following reconciles net income attributable to the Company to FFO and FFO-diluted for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009and 2008 and FFO and FFOdiluted to AFFO and AFFOdiluted for the same periods (dollars and shares in thousands):                                  2012      2011      2010      2009      2008          Net income attributable to the Company     $  337,426     $  156,866     $  25,190     $  120,742     $  161,925         Adjustments to reconcile net income attributable to the Company to FFObasic:                                                      Noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership                    27,359        13,529        2,497        17,517        27,230         (Gain) loss on remeasurement, sale or write down of consolidated assets, net        (159,575  )     76,338        (474  )     (121,766  )     (68,714  )      Add: (loss) gain on undepreciated assetsconsolidated assets        (390  )     2,277                4,762        798         Add: noncontrolling interests share of gain (loss) on sale of assetsconsolidated joint ventures        1,899        (1,441  )     2        310        185         (Gain) loss on remeasurement, sale or write down of assetsunconsolidated joint ventures(1)        (2,019  )     (200,828  )     (823  )     7,642        (3,432  )      Add: gain (loss) on sale of undepreciated assetsunconsolidated joint ventures(1)        1,163        51        613        (152  )     3,039         Add: noncontrolling interests on sale of undepreciated assetsconsolidated joint ventures                                        487         Depreciation and amortization on consolidated assets        307,193        269,286        246,812        266,164        279,339         Less: noncontrolling interests in depreciation and amortizationconsolidated joint ventures        (18,561  )     (18,022  )     (17,979  )     (7,871  )     (3,395  )      Depreciation and amortizationunconsolidated joint ventures(1)        96,228        115,431        109,906        106,435        96,441         Less: depreciation on personal property        (12,861  )     (13,928  )     (14,436  )     (13,740  )     (9,952  )                                            FFObasic        577,862        399,559        351,308        380,043        483,951         Additional adjustments to arrive at FFOdiluted:                                                      Impact of convertible preferred stock                                        4,124         Impact of non-participating convertible preferred units                                        979                                               FFOdiluted        577,862        399,559        351,308        380,043        489,054         Shoppingtown Mall        422        3,491                                 Valley View Center        (101,105  )     8,786                                 Prescott Gateway        (16,296  )                                                                            AFFO and AFFOdiluted     $  460,883     $  411,836     $  351,308     $  380,043     $  489,054                                               Weighted average number of FFO shares outstanding for:                                                      FFObasic(2)        144,937        142,986        132,283        93,010        86,794         Adjustments for the impact of dilutive securities in computing FFOdiluted:                                                      Convertible preferred stock                                        1,447         Non-participating convertible preferred units                                        205                                               FFOdiluted(3)        144,937        142,986        132,283        93,010        88,446                                                   (1) Unconsolidatedassets are presented at the Company's pro rata share.

ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK                The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company has managed and will continue to manage interest raterisk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rateexposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with appropriately matching maturities, (3) using treasury rate locks whereappropriate to fix rates on   61        anticipateddebt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity.           Thefollowing table sets forth information as of December 31, 2012 concerning the Company's long term debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity,weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value ("FV") (dollars in thousands):                                           For the years ended December 31,                                2013      2014      2015      2016      2017      Thereafter      Total      FV          CONSOLIDATED CENTERS:                                                                                 Long term debt:                                                                                 Fixed rate     $  288,256     $  62,660     $  517,487     $  518,262     $  59,711     $  2,277,042     $  3,723,418     $  3,839,329         Average interest rate        3.07  %     4.00  %     5.91  %     5.53  %     3.71  %     4.00  %     4.40  %               Floating rate        256,232        172,413        133,190        777,952        73,165        125,000        1,537,952        1,549,942         Average interest rate        3.19  %     4.04  %     3.50  %     2.79  %     3.08  %     2.56  %     3.05  %                                                                       Total debtConsolidated Centers     $  544,488     $  235,073     $  650,677     $  1,296,214     $  132,876     $  2,402,042     $  5,261,370     $  5,389,271                                                                 UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE CENTERS:                                                                                 Long term debt (at Company's pro rata share):                                                                                 Fixed rate     $  322,833     $  185,239     $  239,079     $  260,838     $  51,726     $  397,587     $  1,457,302     $  1,522,680         Average interest rate        5.66  %     5.37  %     5.55  %     6.75  %     4.67  %     3.85  %     5.27  %               Floating rate        69,198        294        13,599        70,294        24,897                178,282        180,258         Average interest rate        4.72  %     3.06  %     3.17  %     3.05  %     2.96  %             3.69  %                                                                       Total debtUnconsolidated Joint Venture Centers     $  392,031     $  185,533     $  252,678     $  331,132     $  76,623     $  397,587     $  1,635,584     $  1,702,938                                                                         The Consolidated Centers' total fixed rate debt at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $3.7 billion and $2.6 billion,respectively. The average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was 4.40% and 5.53%, respectively. The Consolidated Centers' total floating rate debt atDecember 31, 2012 and 2011 was $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. The average interest rate on floating rate debt at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was 3.05% and3.09%, respectively.           TheCompany's pro rata share of the Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers' fixed rate debt at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion,respectively. The average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was 5.27% and 5.92%, respectively. The Company's pro rata share of the Unconsolidated Joint VentureCenters' floating rate debt at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $178.3 million and $161.2 million, respectively. The average interest rate on such floating rate debt atDecember 31, 2012 and 2011 was 3.69% and 3.88%, respectively.           TheCompany uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value(See Note 5Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).           Interestrate cap agreements offer protection against floating rates on the notional amount from exceeding the rates noted in the above schedule, and interest rate swap agreementseffectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a fixed rate as noted above. As of December 31, 2012, the Company did not have any interest rate cap or swap agreements in place.           Inaddition, the Company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows byapproximately $17.2 million per year based on $1.7 billion of floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2012.           Thefair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated based on a present value model utilizing interest rates that reflect the risks associated withlong-term debt of similar risk and duration. In addition, the method of computing fair value for mortgage notes payable included a credit value   62        adjustmentbased on the estimated value of the property that serves as collateral for the underlying debt (See Note 10Mortgage Notes Payable and Note 11Bank andOther Notes Payable in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
