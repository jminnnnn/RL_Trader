ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         Management's Overview and Summary            The Company is involved in the acquisition, ownership, development, redevelopment, management and leasing of regional and communityshopping centers located throughout the United States. The Company is the sole general partner of, and owns a majority of the ownership interests in, the Operating Partnership. As ofDecember 31, 2011, the Operating Partnership owned or had an ownership interest in 65 regional shopping centers and 14 community shopping centers totaling approximately 66 million squarefeet of GLA. These 79 regional and community shopping centers are referred to hereinafter as the "Centers," unless the context otherwise requires.The Company is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and conducts all of its operations through the Operating Partnership and the Management Companies.           Thefollowing discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. It compares the resultsof operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2011 to the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2010. Also included is a comparison of theresults of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2010 to the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2009. This information should beread in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.     Acquisitions and Dispositions:             The financial statements reflect the following acquisitions, dispositions and changes in ownership subsequent to the occurrence of eachtransaction.           InJune 2009, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.0 million related to the anticipated loss on the sale of Village Center, a 170,801 square foot urban villageproperty, in July 2009. The Company subsequently sold the property on July 14, 2009 for $11.9 million in total proceeds, resulting in a gain of $0.1 million related to a change inestimate in transaction costs. The Company used the proceeds from the sale to pay down the term loan and for general corporate purposes.           OnJuly 30, 2009, the Company sold a 49% ownership interest in Queens Center to a third party for approximately $152.7 million, resulting in a gain on sale of assets of$154.2 million. The Company used the proceeds from the sale of the ownership interest in the property to pay down the Company's term loan and for general corporate purposes. As of the date ofthe sale, the Company has accounted for the operations of Queens Center under the equity method of accounting.           OnSeptember 3, 2009, the Company formed a joint venture with a third party whereby the Company sold a 75% interest in FlatIron Crossing. As part of this transaction, the Companyissued three warrants for an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of common stock of the Company (See Note 15Stockholders' Equity in the Notes to Company's Consolidated FinancialStatements.) The Company received $123.8 million in cash proceeds for the overall transaction, of which $8.1 million was attributed to the warrants. The proceeds attributable to theinterest sold exceeded the Company's carrying value in the interest sold by $28.7 million. However, due to certain contractual rights afforded to the buyer of the interest in FlatIron Crossing,the Company has only recognized a gain on sale of $2.5 million. The Company used the proceeds from the sale of the ownership interest to pay down the term loan and for general corporatepurposes. As of the date of the sale, the Company has accounted for the operations of FlatIron Crossing under the equity method of accounting.           QueensCenter and FlatIron Crossing are referred to herein as the "Joint Venture Centers."   44                Duringthe fourth quarter of 2009, the Company sold five non-core community centers for $71.3 million, resulting in an aggregate loss on sales of $16.9 million. TheCompany used the proceeds from these sales to pay down the Company's line of credit and for general corporate purposes.           OnFebruary 24, 2011, the Company increased its ownership interest in Kierland Commons, a 434,642 square foot community center in Scottsdale, Arizona, from 24.5% to 50%. TheCompany's share of the purchase price for this transaction was $34.2 million in cash and the assumption of $18.6 million of existing debt.           OnFebruary 28, 2011, the Company, in a 50/50 joint venture, acquired The Shops at Atlas Park, a 377,924 square foot community center in Queens, New York, for a total purchaseprice of $53.8 million. The Company's share of the purchase price was $26.9 million and was funded from the Company's cash on hand.           OnFebruary 28, 2011, the Company acquired the additional 50% ownership interest in Desert Sky Mall, an 893,863 square foot regional shopping center in Phoenix, Arizona, that itdid not own. The total purchase price was $27.6 million, which included the assumption of the third party's pro rata share of the mortgage note payable on the property of $25.7 million.Concurrent with the purchase of the partnership interest, the Company paid off the $51.5 million loan on the property.           OnApril 29, 2011, the Company purchased a fee interest in a freestanding Kohl's store at Capitola Mall in Capitola, California for $28.5 million. The purchase price waspaid from cash on hand.           OnJune 3, 2011, the Company acquired an additional 33.3% ownership interest in Arrowhead Towne Center, a 1,197,006 square foot regional shopping center in Glendale, Arizona, anadditional 33.3% ownership interest in Superstition Springs Center, a 1,204,540 square foot regional shopping center in Mesa, Arizona, and an additional 50% ownership interest in the land underSuperstition Springs Center in exchange for the Company's ownership interest in six anchor stores, including five former Mervyn's stores and a cash payment of $75.0 million. The cash purchaseprice was funded from borrowings under the Company's line of credit. This transaction is referred herein as the "GGP Exchange".           OnJuly 22, 2011, the Company acquired the Fashion Outlets of Niagara, a 529,059 square foot outlet center in Niagara Falls, New York. The initial purchase price of$200.0 million was funded by a cash payment of $78.6 million and the assumption of the mortgage note payable of $121.4 million. The cash purchase price was funded from borrowingsunder the Company's line of credit. The purchase and sale agreement includes contingent consideration based on the performance of the Fashion Outlets of Niagara from the acquisition date throughJuly 21, 2014 that could increase the purchase price from the initial $200.0 million up to a maximum of $218.7 million. The Company estimated the fair value of the contingentconsideration as of December 31, 2011 to be $14.8 million, which has been included in other accrued liabilities.           OnDecember 31, 2011, the Company and its joint venture partner reached agreement for the distribution and conveyance of interests in SDG Macerich that owned 11 regional malls ina 50/50 partnership. Six of the eleven assets were distributed to the Company on December 31, 2011. The Company received 100% ownership of Eastland Mall in Evansville, Indiana, Lake Square Mallin Leesburg, Florida, SouthPark Mall in Moline, Illinois, Southridge Mall in Des Moines, Iowa, NorthPark Mall in Davenport, Iowa and Valley Mall in Harrisonburg, Virginia (collectively referred toherein as the "SDG Acquisition Properties"). These wholly-owned assets were recorded at fair value at the date of transfer, which resulted in a gain of $188.3 million. The gain reflected thefair value of the net assets received in excess of the book value of the Company's interest in SDG Macerich. The distribution and conveyance of the properties from SDG Macerich to the Company isreferred to herein as the "SDG Transaction".   45                DesertSky Mall, the Kohl's store at Capitola Mall, the land under Superstition Springs Center and the Fashion Outlets of Niagara are referred to herein as the "Acquisition Properties".     Mervyn's:             In December 2007, the Company purchased a portfolio of ground leasehold interest and/or fee interests in 39 freestanding Mervyn'sstores located in the Southwest United States. In January 2008, the Company purchased a ground leasehold interest in a freestanding Mervyn's store located in Hayward, California and in February 2008,the Company purchased a fee simple interest in a freestanding Mervyn's store located in Monrovia, California. These former Mervyn's stores are referred to herein as the "Mervyn's Properties." Mervyn'sfiled for bankruptcy protection in July 2008 and rejected all of its leases during the remainder of the year.           InJune 2009, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $26.0 million, as it relates to the fee and/or ground leasehold interests in five former Mervyn's stores due to theanticipated loss on the sale of these properties in July 2009. The Company subsequently sold the properties in July 2009 for $52.7 million in total proceeds, resulting in an additional$0.5 million loss related to transaction costs. The Company used the proceeds from the sales to pay down the Company's term loan and for general corporate purposes.           OnSeptember 29, 2009, the Company sold a leasehold interest in a former Mervyn's store for $4.5 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $4.1 million. The Company used theproceeds from the sale to pay down the Company's line of credit and for general corporate purposes.           OnMarch 4, 2011, the Company sold a fee interest in a former Mervyn's store for $3.7 million, resulting in a loss on sale of $1.9 million. The Company used theproceeds from the sale for general corporate purposes.           OnJune 3, 2011, the Company disposed of five former Mervyn's stores in connection with the GGP Exchange (See "Acquisitions").           OnOctober 14, 2011, the Company sold a former Mervyn's store in Salt Lake City, Utah, for $8.1 million, resulting in a gain of $3.8 million. The proceeds from the salewere used for general corporate purposes.           OnNovember 30, 2011, the Company sold a former Mervyn's store in West Valley City, Utah, for $2.3 million, resulting in a loss of $0.2 million. The proceeds fromthe sale were used for general corporate purposes.           Asof December 31, 2011, five former Mervyn's stores in the Company's portfolio remain vacant. The Company is currently seeking replacement tenants for these spaces.     Other Transactions and Events:             On July 15, 2010, a court appointed receiver assumed operational control of Valley View Center and responsibility for managingall aspects of the property. The Company anticipates the disposition of the asset, which is under the control of the receiver, will be executed through foreclosure,deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or by some other means,and will be completed in the near future. Although the Company is no longer funding any cash shortfall, it continues to record the operations of Valley View Center until the title for the Center istransferred and its obligation for the loan is discharged. Once title to the Center is transferred, the Company will remove the net assets and liabilities from the Company's consolidated balancesheets. The mortgage note payable on Valley View Center is non-recourse to the Company.   46                OnApril 1, 2011, the Company's joint venture in SDG Macerich conveyed Granite Run Mall to the mortgage note lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Themortgage note was non-recourse. The Company's pro rata share of gain on early extinguishment of debt was $7.8 million.           OnMay 11, 2011, the non-recourse mortgage note payable on Shoppingtown Mall went into maturity default. As a result of the maturity default and the correspondingreduction of the estimated holding period, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $35.7 million to write-down the carrying value of the long-lived assets to itsestimated fair value. On September 14, 2011, the Company exercised its right and redeemed the outside ownership interests in Shoppingtown Mall for a cash payment of $11.4 million. OnDecember 30, 2011, the Company conveyed Shoppingtown Mall to the mortgage note lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. As a result of the conveyance, the Company recognized an additional$3.9 million loss on the disposal of the property.           Asof December 1, 2011, the Prescott Gateway non-recourse loan was in maturity default. The Company is negotiating with the lender and the outcome is uncertain at this time.     Redevelopment and Development Activity:             In August 2011, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with a subsidiary of AWE/Talisman for the development of theFashion Outlets of Chicago in the Village of Rosemont, Illinois. The Company will own 60% of the joint venture and AWE/Talisman will own 40%. The Center will be a fully enclosed two level, 528,000square foot outlet center. The site is located within a mile of O'Hare International Airport. The project broke ground in November, 2011 and is expected to be completed in Summer 2013. The totalestimated project cost is approximately $200.0 million.     Inflation:             In the last five years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most ofthe leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically throughout the lease term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in theConsumer Price Index ("CPI"). In addition, approximately 6% to 15% of the leases expire each year, which enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if therents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. The Company has generally entered into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generallyexcluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any Center, which places the burden of cost control on the Company. Additionally, certain leases require the tenants to paytheir pro rata share of operating expenses.     Seasonality:             The shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retaileroccupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels. In addition, shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season andthe majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter. As a result of the above, earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter.    Critical Accounting Policies            The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States ofAmerica requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of thefinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   47                Someof these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition, estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals, provisions for uncollectibleaccounts, impairment of long-lived assets, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, and estimates for environmental matters. The Company's significantaccounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, thefollowing policies are deemed to be critical.     Revenue Recognition:             Minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. The difference betweenthe amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the "straight line rent adjustment." Currently, 62% of the Mall Store and Freestanding Store leases containprovisions for CPI rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease. The Company believes that using an annual multiple of CPI increases, rather than fixed contractual rent increases,results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases. Percentage rents arerecognized when the tenants' specified sales targets have been met. Estimated recoveries from certain tenants for their pro rata share of real estate taxes, insurance and other shopping centeroperating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. Other tenants pay a fixed rate and these tenant recoveries' revenues are recognized on astraight-line basis over the term of the related leases.     Property:             The Company capitalizes costs incurred in redevelopment and development of properties. The costs of land and buildings underdevelopment include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, constructioncosts, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized costs are allocated to the specific components of a projectthat are benefited. The Company considers a construction project as completed and held available for occupancy and ceases capitalization of costs when the areas under development have beensubstantially completed.           Maintenanceand repair expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Costs for major replacements and betterments, which includes HVAC equipment, roofs, parking lots, etc., arecapitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings.           Propertyis recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:                Buildings and improvements     5 - 40 years      Tenant improvements     5 - 7 years      Equipment and furnishings     5 - 7 years        Accounting for Acquisitions:             The Company first determines the value of land and buildings utilizing an "as if vacant" methodology. The Company then assigns a fairvalue to any debt assumed at acquisition. The Company then allocates the purchase price based on fair value of the land, building, tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets received andliabilities assumed. Tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair value basis at the acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms.The tenant improvements are classified as an asset under   48        propertyand are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases which come in three forms:(i) leasing commissions and legal costs, which represent the value associated with "cost avoidance" ofacquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the Company's markets; (ii) value of in-place leases, which represents theestimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the "assumed vacant" property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (iii) above or below market value ofin-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. Leasing commissions andlegal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms. The value of in-place leases are recorded in deferred charges and otherassets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus an estimate of renewal of the acquired leases. Above or below market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets or in otheraccrued liabilities, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market, and the asset or liability is amortized to minimum rents over the remaining terms of the leases.           Theallocated values of above and below-market leases are amortized into minimum rents on a straight-line basis over the individual remaining lease terms. The remaining leaseterms of below-market leases may include certain below-market fixed-rate renewal periods. In considering whether or not a lessee will execute a below-market fixed-rate leaserenewal option, the Company evaluates economic factors and certain qualitative factors at the time of acquisition such as tenant mix in the center, the Company's relationship with the tenant and theavailability of competing tenant space.     Asset Impairment:             The Company assesses whether an indicator of impairment in the value of its properties exists by considering expected future operatingincome, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. Such factors include projected rental revenue, operating costs and capital expenditures as wellas estimated holding periods and capitalization rates. If an impairment indicator exists, the determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows,excluding interest expense. The amount of impairment loss, if any, is determined by comparing the fair value, as determined by a discounted cash flows analysis, with the carrying value of the relatedassets. The Company generally holds and operates its properties long-term, which decreases the likelihood of its carrying values not being recoverable. Properties classified as held forsale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.           TheCompany reviews its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for a series of operating losses and other factors that may indicate that a decrease in the value of its investmentshas occurred which is other-than-temporary. The investment in each unconsolidated joint venture is evaluated periodically, and as deemed necessary, for recoverability andvaluation declines that are other than temporary.     Fair Value of Financial Instruments:             The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent ofthe reporting entity and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions.           Level 1inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other thanquoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets andliabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that areobservable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are   49        unobservableinputs for the asset or liability, which is typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination ofthe fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based onthe lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in itsentirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.           TheCompany calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is differentthan the carrying value of those financial instruments. When the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value, no additional disclosure is made.     Deferred Charges:             Costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using thestraight-line method. As these deferred leasing costs represent productive assets incurred in connection with the Company's provision of leasing arrangements at the Centers, the relatedcash flows are classified as investing activities within theCompany's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Costs relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using thestraight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. In-place lease values are amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of the renewal term.Leasing commissions and legal costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the individual remaining lease years. The ranges of the terms of the agreements are as follows:                Deferred lease costs     1 - 15 years      Deferred financing costs     1 - 15 years      In-place lease values     Remaining lease term plus an estimate for renewal      Leasing commissions and legal costs     5 - 10 years       Results of Operations            Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred due to the foregoing transactions involving theAcquisition Properties, the Joint Venture Centers, the Mervyn's Properties and the Redevelopment Center(s), as defined below. For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2011 to the yearended December 31, 2010, the "Same Centers" include all Consolidated Centers, excluding the Mervyn's Properties, the Acquisition Properties and the Redevelopment Center as defined below. Forthe comparison of the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2009, the "Same Centers" include all Consolidated Centers, excluding the Mervyn's Properties, the JointVenture Centers and the Redevelopment Centers as defined below.           Forthe comparison of the year ended December 31, 2011 to the year ended December 31, 2010, the "Redevelopment Center" is Santa Monica Place. For the comparison of the yearended December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2009, the "Redevelopment Centers" include Northgate Mall and Santa Monica Place.           Oneof the principal reasons for the changes in the results of operations, discussed below, from the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31,2009 is because of the change in how the Company classified the Joint Venture Centers. The Joint Venture Centers were classified as Consolidated Centers until the sale of a partial ownership interestin Queens Center and FlatIron Crossing on July 30, 2009 and September 3, 2009, respectively. Therefore, the results of operations of Queens Center for the period of January 1,2009 to July 29, 2009 and FlatIron Crossing   50        forthe period of January 1, 2009 to September 2, 2009 are included in the Company's financial statements as Consolidated Centers. Results of operations subsequent to the sale of theownership interest in each Joint Venture Center are included in "Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures" (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary).           Theincrease in revenue and expenses of the Redevelopment Center during the year ended December 31, 2011 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2010 and during theyear ended December 31, 2010 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily due to the opening of Santa Monica Place in August 2010.           Unconsolidatedjoint ventures are reflected using the equity method of accounting. The Company's pro rata share of the results from these Centers is reflected in the ConsolidatedStatements of Operations as equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures.           TheCompany considers tenant annual sales per square foot (for tenants in place for 12 months or longer and under 10,000 square feet), occupancy rates (excluding Anchors) for theCenters and releasing spreads (i.e. a comparison of average base rent per square foot on leases executed during the trailing twelve months to average base rent per square foot on leasesexpiring during the year) to be key performance indicators of the Company's internal growth.           Tenantsales per square foot increased from $433 for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $489 for the year ended December 31, 2011. Occupancy rate decreased from 93.1% atDecember 31, 2010 to 92.7% at December 31, 2011. Releasing spreads increased 13.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011 from the year ended December 31, 2010. Thesecalculations exclude Valley View Center, Granite Run Mall, Shoppingtown Mall and Centers under development or redevelopment.           TheCompany's recent trend of retail sales growth continued this year with tenant sales per square foot increasing compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The releasingspreads also increased for the year ended December 31, 2011 and the Company expects that releasing spreads will continue to increase during 2012 as it renews or relets leases that are scheduledto expire during the year. The Company's occupancy rate as of December 31, 2011 decreased compared to December 31, 2010 primarily because of the liquidation of one tenant. Althoughcertain aspects of the U.S. economy, the retail industry as well as the Company's operating results improved during the year ended December 31, 2011, continued worldwide economic and politicaluncertainty remains. In addition, the U.S. economy is still experiencing weakness, high levels of unemployment have persisted and rental rates and valuations for retail space have not fully recoveredto pre-recession levels. Any further continuation ofthese adverse conditions could harm the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.    Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010      Revenues:             Minimum and percentage rents (collectively referred to as "rental revenue") increased by $34.9 million, or 8.1%, from 2010 to 2011. Theincrease in rental revenue is attributed to an increase of $17.8 million from the Acquisition Properties, $11.6 million from the Redevelopment Center, $3.9 million from the Mervyn's Propertiesand $1.6 million from the Same Centers. The increase in rental revenue at the Mervyns' Properties is due to the leasing of former vacant spaces.           Rentalrevenue includes the amortization of above and below-market leases, the amortization of straight-line rents and lease termination income. The amortization of above andbelow-market leases increased from $7.3 million in 2010 to $9.7 million in 2011. The amortization of straight-lined rents increased from $4.8 million in 2010 to$5.1 million in 2011. Lease termination income increased from $4.4 million in 2010 to $5.9 million in 2011.   51                Tenantrecoveries increased $11.8 million, or 5.0%, from 2010 to 2011. The increase in tenant recoveries is attributed to an increase of $7.4 million from the RedevelopmentCenter, $6.1 million from the Acquisition Properties and $0.3 million from the Mervyn's Properties offset in part by a decrease of $2.0 million from the Same Centers. The decreasein tenant recoveries from the Same Centers is primarily due to a decrease in recoverable expenses.           ManagementCompanies revenue decreased from $42.9 million in 2010 to $40.4 million in 2011 primarily due to a decrease in development fees.     Shopping Center and Operating Expenses:             Shopping center and operating expenses increased $18.6 million, or 7.9%, from 2010 to 2011. The increase in shopping center andoperating expenses is attributed to an increase of $10.1 million from the Acquisition Properties, $8.1 million from the Redevelopment Center and $1.2 million from the Mervyn's Propertiesoffset in part by a decrease of $0.8 million from the Same Centers.     Management Companies' Operating Expenses:             Management Companies' operating expenses decreased $3.8 million from 2010 to 2011 due to a decrease in compensation costs.     REIT General and Administrative Expenses:             REIT general and administrative expenses increased by $0.4 million from 2010 to 2011.     Depreciation and Amortization:             Depreciation and amortization increased $25.3 million from 2010 to 2011. The increase in depreciation and amortization isprimarily attributed to an increase of $10.1 million from the Redevelopment Center, $9.4 million from the Acquisition Properties and $5.8 million from the Same Centers.     Interest Expense:             Interest expense decreased $14.9 million from 2010 to 2011. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributed to adecrease of $19.4 million from interest rate swap agreements, $6.2 million from the Same Centers and $2.3 million from the Senior Notes offset in part by an increase of $6.7million from the Redevelopment Center, $3.5 million from the Acquisition Properties, $2.6 million from the borrowings under the line of credit and $0.2 million from the termloans. The decrease resulting from the interest rate swap agreements is due to the maturity of a $450.0 million interest rate swap agreement in April 2010 and the maturity of a$400.0 million interest rate swap agreement in April 2011.           Theabove interest expense items are net of capitalized interest, which decreased from $25.7 million in 2010 to $11.9 million in 2011, primarily due to a decrease in redevelopmentactivity.     Loss (Gain) on Early Extinguishment of Debt:             Loss on early extinguishment of debt increased $14.2 million from 2010 to 2011. The increase in loss on early extinguishment ofdebt is primarily attributed to a $9.1 million loss from the prepayment of the mortgage note payable on Chesterfield Towne Center in 2011 and a $1.4 million loss from the repurchase ofthe Senior Notes in 2011 offset in part by the $4.2 million gain on the refinancing of two mortgage notes payable in 2010.   52          Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:             Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures increased $215.1 million from 2010 to 2011. The increase in equity in incomeof unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily attributed to the Company's pro rata share of the gain of $188.3 million in connection with the SDG Transaction (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" inManagement's Overview and Summary) in 2011. The remaining increase in equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures is attributed to theCompany's $12.5 million pro rata share of the remeasurement gain on the acquisition of an underlying ownership interest in Kierland Commons in 2011 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management'sOverview and Summary), and the Company's $7.8 million pro rata share of the gain on early extinguishment of debt of its joint venture in Granite Run Mall. (See "Other Transactions and Events"in Management's Overview and Summary).     (Loss) Gain on Remeasurement, Sale or Write down of Assets:             Loss on remeasurement, sale or write down of assets increased $42.8 million from 2010 to 2011. The increase in loss is primarilyattributed to the $45.5 million impairment charge in 2011 (See Note 6Property to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements).     Loss from Discontinued Operations:             The loss from discontinued operations increased $37.0 million from 2010 to 2011. The increase in loss from discontinuedoperations is primarily attributed to the $39.6 million loss on the disposal of Shoppingtown Mall in 2011 (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary).     Net Income:             Net income increased $140.7 million from 2010 to 2011. The increase in net income is primarily attributed to the Company's prorata share of the $188.3 million gain on the SDG Transaction (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) offset in part by the loss on the disposal of Shoppingtown Mallof $39.6 million (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary).     Funds From Operations ("FFO"):             Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, FFOdiluted increased 13.7% from $351.3 million in 2010 to$399.6 million in 2011. For a reconciliation of FFO and FFOdiluted to net income available to common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see "FundsFrom Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations."     Operating Activities:             Cash provided by operating activities increased from $200.4 million in 2010 to $237.3 million in 2011. The increase wasprimarily due to changes in assets and liabilities and the results at the Centers as discussed above.     Investing Activities:             Cash used in investing activities increased from $142.2 million in 2010 to $212.1 million in 2011. The increase wasprimarily due to an increase of $138.7 million in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures offset in part by an increase of $102.5 million in distributions from unconsolidatedjoint ventures. The increase in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily attributed to the Kierland Commons, The Shops at Atlas Park, Arrowhead Towne Center and Superstition Springs   53        transactions(See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary). The increase in distributions from the unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily due to the distribution ofthe Company's pro rata share of the excess refinancing proceeds of the loan on Arrowhead Towne Center in 2011 (See "Item 1. BusinessRecent DevelopmentsFinancingActivity").     Financing Activities:             Cash from financing activities decreased from a surplus of $294.1 million in 2010 to a deficit of $403.6 million in 2011.The increase in cash used was primarily due to the $1.2 billion stock offering in 2010, a decrease in proceeds from mortgages, bank and other notes payable of $170.5 million, an increasein the repurchase of the Senior Notes of $162.1 million and an increase in dividends and distributions of $71.0 million offset in part by a decrease in payments on mortgages, bank andother notes payable of $940.8 million.    Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009      Revenues:             Rental revenue decreased by $51.0 million, or 10.6%, from 2009 to 2010. The decrease in rental revenue is attributed to adecrease of $48.6 million from the Joint Venture Centers and $14.2 million from the Same Centers which was offset in part by an increase of $11.5 million from the RedevelopmentCenters and $0.3 million from the Mervyn's Properties. The decrease in Same Centers rental revenue is primarily attributed to a decrease in lease termination income.           Theamortization of above and below market leases decreased from $9.4 million in 2009 to $7.3 million in 2010. The amortization of straight-line rents decreased from $5.1 million in 2009to $4.8 million in 2010. Lease termination income decreased from $16.1 million in 2009 to $4.4 million in 2010.           Tenantrecoveries decreased by $1.7 million from 2009 to 2010. The decrease in tenant recoveries of $22.5 million from the Joint Venture Centers was offset by an increase of $12.6million from the Same Centers, $7.5 million from the Redevelopment Centers and $0.7 million from the Mervyn's Properties.     Shopping Center and Operating Expenses:             Shopping center and operating expenses decreased $11.6 million, or 4.7%, from 2009 to 2010. The decrease in shopping center andoperating expenses is attributed to a decrease of $25.7 million from the Joint Venture Centers and $0.9 million from the Mervyn's Properties offset in part by an increase of $8.0 million from the SameCenters and $7.0 million from the Redevelopment Centers.     Management Companies' Operating Expenses:             Management Companies' operating expenses increased $11.1 million from 2009 to 2010 due to an increase in compensation costs in2010 offset in part by severance costs paid in connection with the implementation of the Company's workforce reduction plan in 2009.     REIT General and Administrative Expenses:             REIT general and administrative expenses decreased by $5.2 million from 2009 to 2010. The decrease is primarily due to closing costsincurred in connection with the formation of the co-venture arrangement in 2009 (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary).     Depreciation and Amortization:             Depreciation and amortization decreased $15.2 million from 2009 to 2010. The decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarilyattributed to a decrease of $17.0 million from the Mervyn's Properties and $13.0 million from the Joint Venture Centers offset in part by an increase of $8.3 million from the Redevelopment Centers and$5.0 million from the Same Centers.   54                     Interest Expense:             Interest expense decreased $54.1 million from 2009 to 2010. The decrease in interest expense is attributed to a decrease of $20.0million from the Joint Venture Centers, $14.0 million from interest rate swap agreements, $11.7 million from borrowings under the Company's line of credit, $5.5 million from term loans, $2.4 millionfrom the Senior Notes, $0.4 million from Same Centers and $0.1 million from the Redevelopment Centers. The decrease from interest rate swap agreements is due to the maturity of a $450.0 millioninterest rate swap agreement in April 2010.           Theabove interest expense items are net of capitalized interest, which increased from $21.3 million in 2009 to $25.7 million in 2010 due to an increase in redevelopment activity in2010.     Gain on Early Extinguishment of Debt:             The gain on early extinguishment of debt decreased from $29.2 million in 2009 to $3.7 million in 2010. The decrease in gain is due to adecrease in repurchases of the Senior Notes in 2010. (See Liquidity and Capital Resources).     Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:             Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures increased $11.4 million from 2009 to 2010. The increase in equity in income fromunconsolidated joint ventures is primarily attributed to the $7.6 million write-down at certain joint ventures in 2009 and the deconsolidation of the Joint Venture Centers upon sale in2009 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary).     Discontinued Operations:             Loss from discontinued operations decreased from $42.0 million in 2009 to $3.1 million in 2010. The decrease in loss is primarilyattributed to a loss of $40.2 million on the sales of six former Mervyn's stores and five non-core community centers in 2009.     Net Income:             Net income decreased $110.8 million from 2009 to 2010. The decrease in net income is primarily attributed to the$154.2 million gain on the sale of the 49% ownership interest in Queens Center in 2009 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) offset in part by the$16.9 million loss on the sale of five non-core community centers in 2009 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) and a $19.2 millionimpairment charge in 2009 to reduce the carrying value of land held for development.     Funds From Operations:             Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, FFOdiluted decreased 7.6% from $380.0 million in 2009 to $351.3million in 2010. For disclosure of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the periods and a reconciliation of FFO and FFOdiluted to net income available tocommon stockholders, (See "Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations").     Operating Activities:             Cash provided by operations increased from $120.9 million in 2009 to $200.4 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to changesin assets and liabilities and the results at the Centers as discussed above and an increase of $8.4 million in distribution of income from unconsolidated joint ventures.   55          Investing Activities:             Cash from investing activities decreased from a surplus of $302.4 million in 2009 to a deficit of $142.2 million in 2010. The decreasewas primarily due to the decrease in proceeds received from the sale of assets of $417.5 million in 2009, a decrease in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures of $51.9 million, offset inpart by a decrease in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures of $33.7 million.     Financing Activities:             Cash from financing activities increased from a deficit of $396.5 million in 2009 to a surplus of $294.1 million in 2010. The increasewas primarily attributed to the net proceeds from the stock offering of $1.2 billion in 2010 (See Liquidity and Capital Resources) and an increase in proceeds from the mortgages, bank and other notespayable of $501.8 million offset in part by net proceeds from the stock offering in 2009 of $383.5 million, an increase in payments on mortgages, bank and other notes payable of $339.1 million, adecrease in contributions from the co-venture partner of $168.2 million and an increase in dividends and distributions of $130.3 million.    Liquidity and Capital Resources            The Company anticipates meeting its liquidity needs for its operating expenses and debt service and dividend requirements for the nexttwelve months through cash generated from operations, working capital reserves and/or borrowings under its unsecured line of credit. On May 2, 2011, the Company obtained a new $1.5 billionrevolving line of credit, which provides the Company with additional liquidity (See Item 1. BusinessRecent Developments"Financing Activity").           Thefollowing tables summarize capital expenditures and lease acquisition costs incurred at the Centers for the years ended December 31:                      (Dollars in thousands)     2011      2010      2009          Consolidated Centers:                                    Acquisitions of property and equipment     $  314,575     $  12,888     $  11,001         Development, redevelopment and expansion of Centers        88,842        214,796        226,192         Tenant allowances        19,418        21,993        10,830         Deferred leasing charges        29,280        24,528        19,960                                       $  452,115     $  274,205     $  267,983                                   Joint Venture Centers (at Company's pro rata share):                                    Acquisitions of property and equipment     $  143,390     $  6,095     $  5,443         Development, redevelopment and expansion of Centers        37,712        42,289        61,184         Tenant allowances        8,406        8,130        5,092         Deferred leasing charges        4,910        4,664        3,852                                       $  194,418     $  61,178     $  75,571                                           TheCompany expects amounts to be incurred in future years for tenant allowances and deferred leasing charges to be comparable or less than 2011 and that capital for those expenditureswill be available from working capital, cash flow from operations, borrowings on property specific debt or unsecured corporate borrowings. The Company expects to incur between $200 million and $300million during the next twelve months for development, redevelopment, expansion and renovations. Capital for these major expenditures, developments and/or redevelopments has been, and is expected tocontinue to be obtained from a combination of debt or equity financings, which include borrowings under the Company's line of credit and construction loans. In addition to the Company's April 2010equity offering and property refinancings, the Company has also generated additional liquidity in the past   56        throughjoint venture transactions and the sale of non-core assets, and has plans to sell additional non-core assets in 2012. Furthermore, on September 9, 2011, the Company filed ashelf registration statement which registered an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, warrants, rights and units.           Thecapital and credit markets can fluctuate, and at times, limit access to debt and equity financing for companies. As demonstrated by the Company's recent activity, including its new$1.5 billion line of credit and April 2010 equity offering, the Company has recently been able to access capital; however, there is no assurance the Company will be able to do so in future periods oron similar terms and conditions. Many factors impact the Company's ability to access capital, such as its overall debt level, interest rates, interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions.In the event that the Companyhas significant tenant defaults as a result of the overall economy and general market conditions, the Company could have a decrease in cash flow from operations, which could create borrowings underits line of credit. These events could result in an increase in the Company's proportion of floating rate debt, which would cause it to be subject to interest rate fluctuations in the future.           TheCompany's total outstanding loan indebtedness at December 31, 2011 was $6.2 billion (including $852.8 million of unsecured debt and $1.9 billion of its pro rata share of jointventure debt). The majority of the Company's debt consists of fixed-rate conventional mortgages payable collateralized by individual properties. The Company expects that all of thematurities during the next twelve months, except the mortgage notes payable on Valley View Center and Prescott Gateway, will be refinanced, restructured, extended and/or paid off from the Company'sline of credit or cash on hand. The Company's obligation for the loan on Valley View Center is expected to be discharged in the near future (See "Management's Overview and SummaryOtherTransactions and Events").           TheSenior Notes bear interest at 3.25%, payable semiannually, mature on March 15, 2012. The Senior Notes are senior to unsecured debt of the Company and are guaranteed by theOperating Partnership. In October 2011, the Company repurchased $180.3 million of Senior Notes at par value. The repurchases were funded by additional borrowings under the Company's line of credit. Asof December 31, 2011, there were $437.8 million of the Senior Notes outstanding.           TheCompany believes it has various sources of liquidity to pay off the Senior Notes upon their maturity, including anticipated proceeds from the financing and refinancing of variousproperties and/or capacity under its line of credit. See Note 11Bank and Other Notes Payable in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.           TheCompany had, through the Operating Partnership, a $1.5 billion revolving line of credit that bore interest at LIBOR plus a spread of 0.75% to 1.10% that matured on April 25,2011. On May 2, 2011, the Company, through the Operating Partnership, obtained a new $1.5 billion revolving line of credit that bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread of 1.75% to 3.0% dependingon the Company's overall leverage and matures on May 2, 2015 with a one-year extension option. Based on the Company's current leverage levels, the borrowing rate on the new facilityis LIBOR plus 2.0%. The line of credit can be expanded, depending on certain conditions, up to a total facility of $2.0 billion less the outstanding balance of the $125.0 million unsecured term loan,as discussed below. All obligations under the line of credit are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries and are secured, subject to certainexceptions, by pledges of direct and indirect ownership interests in certain of the subsidiary guarantors. At December 31, 2011, total borrowings under the line of credit were $290.0 millionwith an average effective interest rate of 2.96%.           OnDecember 8, 2011, the Company obtained a seven-year, $125.0 million unsecured term loan under the Company's line of credit that bears interest at LIBOR plusa spread of 1.95 to 3.20% depending on the Company's overall leverage and matures on December 8, 2018. Based on the Company's current leverage levels, the borrowing rate is LIBOR plus 2.20%. Asof December 31, 2011, the total interest rate was 2.42%. The proceeds were used to pay down the Company's line of credit.   57                Cashdividends and distributions for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $296.9 million. A total of $237.3 million was funded by cash flows provided by operations. The remaining$59.6 million was funded through distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures which are included in the cash flows from investing activities section of the Company's ConsolidatedStatement of Cash Flows.           AtDecember 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all applicable loan covenants under its agreements.           AtDecember 31, 2011, the Company had cash and cash equivalents available of $67.2 million.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:             The Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures that it does not have a controlling interest or is not the primarybeneficiary using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Company as "Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures."           Inaddition, certain joint ventures have secured debt that could become recourse debt to the Company or its subsidiaries, in excess of the Company's pro rata share, should the jointventures be unable to discharge the obligations of the related debt. At December 31, 2011, the balance of the debt that could be recourse to the Company was $380.3 million offset in part by indemnityagreements from joint venture partners for $182.6 million. The maturities of the recourse debt, net of indemnification, are $169.8 million in 2013, $16.8 million in 2015 and $11.1 million in 2016.           Additionally,as of December 31, 2011, the Company is contingently liable for $19.6 million in letters of credit guaranteeing performance by the Company of certain obligations relatingto the Centers. The Company does not believe that these letters of credit will result in a liability to the Company.     Contractual Obligations:             The following is a schedule of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 for the consolidated Centers over the periods inwhich they are expected to be paid (in thousands):                                  Payment Due by Period        Contractual Obligations      Total      Less than 1 year      1 - 3 years      3 - 5 years      More than five years          Long-term debt obligations (includes expected interest payments)     $  4,400,388     $  1,357,487     $  1,171,017     $  1,275,125     $  596,759         Operating lease obligations(1)        846,723        14,641        28,358        24,916        778,808         Purchase obligations(1)        2,131        2,131                                 Other long-term liabilities        279,052        235,092        4,300        3,908        35,752                                                   $  5,528,294     $  1,609,351     $  1,203,675     $  1,303,949     $  1,411,319                                                   (1) SeeNote 19Commitments and Contingencies in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.     Funds From Operations ("FFO") and Adjusted Funds From Operations ("AFFO")            The Company uses FFO in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers FFO andFFO-diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") measures. The National Association of Real EstateInvestment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of   58        depreciatedoperating properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, impairment write-downs of real estate and write-downs of investments in an affiliate where the write-downshavebeen driven by a decrease in the value of real estate held by the affiliate and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated toreflect FFO on the same basis. The Company also adjusts FFO for the noncontrolling interest due to redemption value on the Rochester Properties (See Item 6Selected Financial Data).           AFFOexcludes the negative FFO impact of Shoppingtown Mall and Valley View Center for the year ended December 31, 2011. In December 2011, the Company conveyed Shoppingtown Mall tothe lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and Valley View Center is in receivership.           FFOand FFO on a diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. This is especially true since FFO excludes real estate depreciationand amortization, as the Company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. In addition,consistent with the key objective of FFO as a measure of operating performance, the adjustment of FFO for the noncontrolling interest in redemption value provides a more meaningful measure of theCompany's operating performance between periods without reference to the non-cash charge related to the adjustment in noncontrolling interest due to redemption value. The Company believesthat such a presentation also provides investors with a more meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to the operating results of other REITs. The Company believes that AFFO and AFFOon a diluted basis provide useful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance as they show a more meaningful and consistent comparison of the Company's operating performance and allowinvestors to more easily compare the Company's results without taking into account the unrelated non-cash charges on properties controlled by either a receiver or loan servicer, which arenon-routine items. FFO and AFFO on a diluted basis are measures investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities.           FFOand AFFO do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by GAAP, and are not indicative of cashavailable to fund all cash flow needs. The Company also cautions that FFO and AFFO, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts.           NAREITrecently clarified that under its definition of FFO, impairment write-downs of real estate should be added back to net income. Beginning with the year ended December 31,2011, the Company has revised its definition of FFO to add back impairment write-downs of real estate to its net income. Accordingly, the Company removed the adjustment for impairment write-downs of$35.9 million and $27.5 million, as previously reported during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impairment write-downs of real estate during the yearsended December 31, 2010 and 2007. The reconciliation of FFO and AFFO and FFO and AFFO-diluted to net income available to common stockholders is provided below.           Managementcompensates for the limitations of FFO and AFFO by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of FFO andAFFO and a reconciliation of FFO and AFFO and FFO and AFFO-diluted to net income available to common stockholders. Management believes that to further understand the Company's performance,FFO and AFFO should be compared with the Company's reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the Company's Consolidated FinancialStatements.   59                           The following reconciles net income available to common stockholders to FFO and FFO-diluted for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008 and2007 and FFO and FFOdiluted to AFFO and AFFOdiluted for the same periods (dollars and shares in thousands):                                  2011      2010      2009      2008      2007          Net incomeavailable to common stockholders     $  156,866     $  25,190     $  120,742     $  161,925     $  64,131         Adjustments to reconcile net income to FFObasic:                                                      Noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership        13,529        2,497        17,517        27,230        11,238         Loss (gain) on remeasurement, sale or write-down of consolidated assets        76,338        (474  )     (121,766  )     (68,714  )     (9,771  )      Adjustment for redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests                                        2,046         Add: gain on undepreciated assetsconsolidated assets        2,277                4,762        798        8,047         Add: noncontrolling interest share of (gain) loss on sale of consolidated joint ventures        (1,441  )     2        310        185        760         (Gain) loss on remeasurement, sale of assets from unconsolidated joint ventures(1)        (200,828  )     (823  )     7,642        (3,432  )     (400  )      Add: gain (loss) on sale of undepreciated assetsfrom unconsolidated joint ventures(1)        51        613        (152  )     3,039        2,793         Add noncontrolling interest on sale of undepreciated assetsconsolidated joint ventures                                487                 Depreciation and amortization on consolidated assets        269,286        246,812        266,164        279,339        231,860         Less: depreciation and amortization attributable to noncontrolling interest on consolidated joint ventures        (18,022  )     (17,979  )     (7,871  )     (3,395  )     (4,769  )      Depreciation and amortization on unconsolidated joint ventures(1)        115,431        109,906        106,435        96,441        88,807         Less: depreciation on personal property        (13,928  )     (14,436  )     (13,740  )     (9,952  )     (8,244  )                                            FFObasic        399,559        351,308        380,043        483,951        386,498         Additional adjustments to arrive at FFOdiluted:                                                      Impact of convertible preferred stock                                4,124        10,058         Impact of non-participating convertible preferred units                                979                                                       FFOdiluted        399,559        351,308        380,043        489,054        396,556         Add: Shoppingtown Mall negative FFO        3,491                                         Add: Valley View Center negative FFO        8,786                                                                               AFFO and AFFOdiluted     $  411,836     $  351,308     $  380,043     $  489,054     $  396,556                                               Weighted average number of FFO shares outstanding for:                                                      FFObasic(2)        142,986        132,283        93,010        86,794        84,467         Adjustments for the impact of dilutive securities in computing FFOdiluted:                                                      Convertible preferred stock                                1,447        3,512         Non-participating convertible preferred units                                205                 Share and unit-based compensation plans                                        293                                               FFOdiluted(3)        142,986        132,283        93,010        88,446        88,272                                                   (1) Unconsolidatedassets are presented at the Company's pro rata share.

The then outstanding preferred shares wereassumed converted for purposes of 2008 and 2007 FFOdiluted as they were dilutive to that calculation.             ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK                The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company has managed and will continue to manage interest raterisk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rateexposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with appropriately matching maturities, (3) using treasury rate locks whereappropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity.           Thefollowing table sets forth information as of December 31, 2011 concerning the Company's long term debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity,weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value ("FV") (dollars in thousands):                                           For the years ended December 31,                                2012      2013      2014      2015      2016      Thereafter      Total      FV          CONSOLIDATED CENTERS:                                                                                 Long term debt:                                                                                 Fixed rate     $  881,517     $  247,170     $  18,705     $  471,961     $  471,024     $  552,633     $  2,643,010     $  2,769,914         Average interest rate        5.53  %     5.48  %     5.32  %     6.14  %     5.74  %     4.83  %     5.53  %               Floating rate                785,394        88,413        171,305        392,952        125,000        1,563,064        1,585,782         Average interest rate                2.62  %     6.15  %     4.32  %     3.00  %     2.42  %     3.09  %                                                                       Total debtConsolidated Centers     $  881,517     $  1,032,564     $  107,118     $  643,266     $  863,976     $  677,633     $  4,206,074     $  4,355,696                                                                 UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE CENTERS:                                                                                 Long term debt (at Company's pro rata share):                                                                                 Fixed rate     $  229,909     $  530,855     $  216,260     $  265,452     $  263,921     $  282,031     $  1,788,428     $  1,904,545         Average interest rate        6.91  %     6.13  %     5.64  %     5.61  %     6.72  %     4.44  %     5.92  %               Floating rate        193        68,977                13,310        78,749                161,229        165,515         Average interest rate        3.11  %     4.89  %              3.25  %     3.09  %              3.88  %                                                                       Total debtUnconsolidated Joint Venture Centers     $  230,102     $  599,832     $  216,260     $  278,762     $  342,670     $  282,031     $  1,949,657     $  2,070,060                                                                         The Consolidated Centers' total fixed rate debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $2.6 billion and $3.1 billion,respectively. The average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was 5.53% and 5.98%, respectively. The Consolidated Centers' total floating rate debt atDecember 31, 2011 and 2010 was $1.6 billion and $766.9 million, respectively. The average interest rate on floating rate debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was 3.09% and3.85%, respectively.           TheCompany's pro rata share of the Joint Venture Centers' fixed rate debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. The averageinterest rate on such fixed rate debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was 5.92% and 6.11%, respectively. The Company's pro rata share of the Joint Venture Centers' floating rate debt atDecember 31, 2011 and 2010 was $161.2 million and   61        $241.7 million,respectively. The average interest rate on such floating rate debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was 3.88% and 2.24%, respectively.           TheCompany uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value(See Note 5Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).           Thefollowing derivative at December 31, 2011 was outstanding (amounts in thousands):                              Property/Entity      Notional Amount      Product      Rate      Maturity      Company's Ownership      Fair Value          Westside Pavilion        175,000     Cap        5.50  %     6/5/2012        100  %                      Interestrate cap agreements ("Cap") offer protection against floating rates on the notional amount from exceeding the rates noted in the above schedule, and interest rate swapagreements ("Swap") effectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a fixed rate as noted above.           Inaddition, the Company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows byapproximately $17.2 million per year based on $1.7 billion of floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2011.           Thefair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated based on a present value model utilizing interest rates that reflect the risks associated withlong-term debt ofsimilar risk and duration. In addition, the method of computing fair value for mortgage notes payable included a credit value adjustment based on the estimated value of the property that serves ascollateral for the underlying debt (See Note 10Mortgage Notes Payable and Note 11Bank and Other Notes Payable in the Company's Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements).
