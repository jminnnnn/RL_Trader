ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS          Management's Overview and Summary             The Company is involved in the acquisition, ownership, development, redevelopment, management and leasing of regional and community shopping centers located throughout the United States. The Company is the sole general partner of, and owns a majority of the ownership interests in, the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2008, the Operating Partnership owned or had an ownership interest in 72 regional shopping centers and 20 community shopping centers totaling approximately 76 million square feet of GLA. These 92 regional and community shopping centers are referred to hereinafter as the "Centers", unless the context otherwise requires. The Company is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and conducts all of its operations through the Operating Partnership and the Company's Management Companies.            The following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. It compares the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008 to the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2007. Also included is a comparison of the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2007 to the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2006. This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.       Acquisitions and Dispositions:               The financial statements reflect the following acquisitions, dispositions and changes in ownership subsequent to the occurrence of each transaction.            On February 1, 2006, the Company acquired Valley River Center, a 915,656 square foot super-regional mall in Eugene, Oregon. The total purchase price was $187.5 million and concurrent with the acquisition, the Company placed a $100.0 million ten-year loan on the property. The balance of the purchase price was funded by cash and borrowings under the Company's line of credit.            On June 9, 2006, the Company sold Scottsdale 101, a 564,000 square foot center in Phoenix, Arizona. The sale price was $117.6 million from which $56.0 million was used to payoff the mortgage on the property. The Company's share of the realized gain was $25.8 million.            On July 13, 2006, the Company sold Park Lane Mall, a 370,000 square foot center in Reno, Nevada, for $20 million resulting in a gain of $5.9 million.             On July 26, 2006, the Company purchased 11 department stores located in 10 of its Centers from Federated Department Stores, Inc. for approximately $100.0 million. The purchase price consisted of a $93.0 million cash payment at closing and a $7.0 million cash payment in 2007, in connection with development work by Federated at the Company's development properties. The Company's share of the purchase price was $81.0 million and was funded in part from the proceeds of sales of Park Lane Mall, Greeley Mall, Holiday Village Mall and Great Falls Marketplace, and from borrowings under the Company's line of credit. The balance of the purchase price was paid by the Company's joint venture partners.             On July 27, 2006, the Company sold Holiday Village Mall, a 498,000 square foot center in Great Falls, Montana, and Greeley Mall, a 564,000 square foot center in Greeley, Colorado, in a combined sale for $86.8 million, resulting in a gain of $28.7 million.            On August 11, 2006, the Company sold Great Falls Marketplace, a 215,000 square foot community center in Great Falls, Montana, for $27.5 million resulting in a gain of $11.8 million.    41                   On December 1, 2006, the Company acquired Deptford Mall, a two-level 1.0 million square foot super-regional mall in Deptford, New Jersey. The total purchase price of $240.1 million was funded by cash and borrowings under the Company's line of credit. On December 7, 2006, the Company placed a $100.0 million six-year loan bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.44% on the property.             On December 29, 2006, the Company sold Citadel Mall, a 1,095,000 square foot center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Crossroads Mall, a 1,268,000 square foot center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Northwest Arkansas Mall, a 820,000 square foot center in Fayetteville, Arkansas, in a combined sale for $373.8 million, resulting in a gain of $132.7 million. The net proceeds were used to pay down the Company's line of credit and pay off the Company's $75.0 million loan on Paradise Valley Mall.            Valley River Center and Deptford Mall are referred to herein as the "2006 Acquisition Centers."             On September 5, 2007, the Company purchased the remaining 50% outside ownership interest in Hilton Village, a 96,985 square foot specialty center in Scottsdale, Arizona. The total purchase price of $13.5 million was funded by cash, borrowings under the Company's line of credit and the assumption of a mortgage note payable. The Center was previously accounted for under the equity method as an investment in unconsolidated joint ventures.            On December 17, 2007, the Company purchased a portfolio of ground leasehold interest and/or fee interests in 39 freestanding Mervyn's stores located in the Southwest United States. The purchase price of $400.2 million was funded by cash and borrowings under the Company's line of credit.             Hilton Village and the interest in the 39 freestanding Mervyn's freestanding stores are referred herein as the "2007 Acquisition Properties."            On January 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, at the election of the holders, redeemed its 3.4 million Class A participating convertible preferred units ("PCPUs"). As a result of the redemption, the Company received the 16.32% minority interest in the portion of the Wilmorite portfolio acquired on April 25, 2005 that included Danbury Fair Mall, Freehold Raceway Mall, Great Northern Mall, Rotterdam Square, Shoppingtown Mall, Towne Mall, Tysons Corner Center and Wilton Mall, collectively, referred to as the "Non-Rochester Properties," for total consideration of $224.4 million, in exchange for the Company's ownership interest in the portion of the Wilmorite portfolio that consisted of Eastview Mall, Eastview Commons, Greece Ridge Center, Marketplace Mall and Pittsford Plaza, collectively referred to as the "Rochester Properties." Included in the redemption consideration was the assumption of the remaining 16.32% interest in the indebtedness of the Non-Rochester Properties, which had an estimated fair value of $106.0 million. In addition, the Company also received additional consideration of $11.8 million, in the form of a note, for certain working capital adjustments, extraordinary capital expenditures, leasing commissions, tenant allowances, and decreases in indebtedness during the Company's period of ownership of the Rochester Properties. The Company recognized a gain of $99.1 million on the exchange. This exchange is referred to herein as the "Rochester Redemption."            On January 10, 2008, the Company, in a 50/50 joint venture, acquired The Shops at North Bridge, a 680,933 square foot urban shopping center in Chicago, Illinois, for a total purchase price of $515.0 million. The Company's share of the purchase price was funded by the assumption of a pro rata share of the $205.0 million fixed rate mortgage on the Center and by borrowings under the Company's line of credit.             On January 31, 2008, the Company purchased a ground leasehold interest in a freestanding Mervyn's store located in Hayward, California. The purchase price of $13.2 million was funded by cash and borrowings under the Company's line of credit.    42                    On February 29, 2008, the Company purchased a fee simple interest in a freestanding Mervyn's store located in Monrovia, California. The purchase price of $19.3 million was funded by cash and borrowings under the Company's line of credit.            On May 20, 2008, the Company purchased a fee simple interest in a 161,350 square foot Boscov's department store at Deptford Mall in Deptford, New Jersey. The total purchase price of $23.5 million was funded by the assumption of the existing $15.2 million mortgage note on the property and by borrowings under the Company's line of credit.            The Boscov's store and the Mervyn's stores acquired in 2008 are referred to herein as the "2008 Acquisition Properties."             On June 11, 2008, the Company became a 50% owner in a joint venture that acquired One Scottsdale, which plans to develop a luxury retail and mixed-use property in Scottsdale, Arizona. The Company's share of the purchase price was $52.5 million, which was funded by borrowings under the Company's line of credit.            On December 19, 2008, the Company sold a fee and/or ground leasehold interest in three freestanding Mervyn's department stores to Pacific Premier Retail Trust, one of the Company's joint ventures, for $43.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of assets of $1.5 million. The Company's pro rata share of the proceeds were used to pay down the Company's line of credit.       Mervyn's:               In July 2008, Mervyn's filed for bankruptcy protection and announced in October its plans to liquidate all merchandise, auction its store leases and wind down its business. The Company has 45 former Mervyn's stores in its portfolio. The Company owns the ground leasehold and/or fee simple interest in 44 of those stores and the remaining store is owned by a third party but is located at one of the Centers. In connection with the acquisition of the Mervyn's portfolio (See Note 12-Acquisitions of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements) and applying Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, the Company recorded intangible assets of $110.7 million and intangible liabilities of $59.0 million.            In September 2008, the Company recorded a write-down of $5.2 million due to the anticipated rejection of six of the Company's leases by Mervyn's. In addition, the Company terminated its former plan to sell the 29 Mervyn's stores located at shopping centers not owned or managed by the Company. (See Note 13Discontinued Operations of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company's decision was based on current conditions in the credit market and the assumption that a better return could be obtained by holding and operating the assets. As result of the change in plans to sell, the Company recorded a loss of $5.3 million in order to adjust the carrying value of these assets for depreciation expense that otherwise would have been recognized had these assets been continuously classified as held and used.            In December 2008, Kohl's and Forever 21 assumed a total of 23 of the Mervyn's leases and the remaining 22 leases were rejected by Mervyn's under the bankruptcy laws. As a result, the Company wrote-off the unamortized intangible assets and liabilities related to the rejected and unassumed leases in December 2008. The Company wrote-off $27.7 million of unamortized intangible assets related to lease in place values, leasing commissions and legal costs to depreciation and amortization. Unamortized intangible assets of $14.9 million relating to above market leases and unamortized intangible liabilities of $24.5 million relating to below market leases were written-off to minimum rents.       Redevelopments and Developments:               Construction continues on Santa Monica Place, a regional shopping center under development in Santa Monica, California. In September, the Company announced that Bloomingdale's will join    43            Nordstrom. Bloomingdale's will open the first of the store's SoHo concept outside of Manhattan. In addition, the Company has announced deals with 11 retailers and restaurants slated to join the new Santa Monica PlaceEd Hardy, Arthur, R.O.C. Republic of Couture, Ilori, Love Culture, Michael Brandon, Shuz, restaurants La Sandia, Zengo and Pizza Antica, and gallery Artevo. These 11 strong brands join previously announced restaurants XINO and Osumo Sushi and fashion retailers Kitson LA, BCBG Max Azria, Coach, Lacoste, Joe's Jeans and True Religion, all of which are slated to open in 2010 alongside Bloomingdale's SoHo concept and Nordstrom.            At Scottsdale Fashion Square, construction on an approximately 160,000 square foot expansion continues on schedule toward a Fall 2009 opening. The expansion will be anchored by a 60,000 square foot Barneys New York. In addition, recently signed fashion retailer Ed Hardy, French luxury homewear retailer Arthur and Forever 21 will join previously announced True Religion and restaurants Marcella's and Modern Steak, in the new wing. Recent additions to the Center's interior merchandise mix include Cartier and Bvlgari.            Also during the three months ended December 31, 2008, the Company wrote off $8.7 million of development costs on development projects the Company has determined it will not pursue. In addition, the Company recorded an $18.8 million impairment charge to reduce its pro rata share of the carrying value of land held for development at a consolidated joint venture.       Inflation:               In the last three years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most of the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"). In addition, about 6%-13% of the leases expire each year, which enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. Additionally, historically the majority of the leases required the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses. In January 2005, the Company began entering into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any Center. This change shifts the burden of cost control to the Company.       Seasonality:               The shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels. In addition, shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter. As a result of the above, earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter.     Critical Accounting Policies             The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.            Some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition, estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals, provisions for uncollectible accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, and estimates for environmental matters. The Company's significant accounting policies are described    44             in more detail in Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the following policies are deemed to be critical.       Revenue Recognition               Minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. The difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the "straight line rent adjustment." Currently, 53% of the mall and freestanding leases contain provisions for CPI rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease. The Company believes that using an annual multiple of CPI increases, rather than fixed contractual rent increases, results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases. Percentage rents are recognized when the tenants' specified sales targets have been met. Estimated recoveries from certain tenants for their pro rata share of real estate taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. Other tenants pay a fixed rate and these tenant recoveries' revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related leases.       Property               The Company capitalizes costs incurred in redevelopment and development of properties in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 34 "Capitalization of Interest Cost" and SFAS No. 67 "Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Properties." The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized costs are allocated to the specific components of a project that are benefited. The Company considers a construction project as completed and held available for occupancy and ceases capitalization of costs when the areas under development have been substantially completed.            Maintenance and repair expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Costs for major replacements and betterments, which includes HVAC equipment, roofs, parking lots, etc., are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings.             Property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:               Buildings and improvements     5-40 years      Tenant improvements     5-7 years      Equipment and furnishings     5-7 years         Accounting for Acquisitions               The Company accounts for all acquisitions in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." The Company first determines the value of the land and buildings utilizing an "as if vacant" methodology. The Company then assigns a fair value to any debt assumed at acquisition. The balance of the purchase price is allocated to tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities. Tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair market value basis at the acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms. The tenant improvements are classified as an asset under real estate investments and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place    45           operating leases which come in three forms: (i) leasing commissions and legal costs, which represent the value associated with "cost avoidance" of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the Company's markets; (ii) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the "assumed vacant" property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (iii) above or below market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. Leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms. The value of in-place leases are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus an estimate of renewal of the acquired leases. Above or below market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets or in other accrued liabilities, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market, and the asset or liability is amortized to minimum rents over the remaining terms of the leases.             When the Company acquires a real estate property, the Company allocates the purchase price to the components of these acquisitions using relative fair values computed using its estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions impact the amount of costs allocated between various components as well as the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions. These allocations also impact depreciation expense and gains or losses recorded on future sales of properties.       Asset Impairment               The Company assesses whether there has been impairment in the value of its long-lived assets by considering factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. Such factors include the tenant's ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases. The Company may recognize impairment losses if the cash flows are not sufficient to cover its investment. Such a loss would be determined as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a center.       Fair Value of Financial Instruments:               On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions.            Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.    46                   The Company calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. When the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value, no additional disclosure is made.       Deferred Charges               Costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight-line method. Costs relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. In-place lease values are amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of the renewal term. Leasing commissions and legal costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the individual remaining lease years. The ranges of the terms of the agreements are as follows:             Deferred lease costs     1-15 years    Deferred financing costs     1-15 years    In-place lease values     Remaining lease term plus an estimate for renewal    Leasing commissions and legal costs     5-10 years         Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted               In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial StatementsAn Amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 141(R) requires an acquiring entity to recognize acquired assets and assumed liabilities in a transaction at fair value as of the acquisition date and changes the accounting treatment for certain items, including acquisition costs, which will be required to be expensed as incurred. SFAS No. 160 requires that noncontrolling interests be presented as a component of consolidated stockholders' equity and eliminates "minority interest accounting" such that the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests will be presented as part of consolidated net income on the consolidated statements of operations. SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160 require concurrent adoption and are to be applied prospectively for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Early adoption of either standard is prohibited. The Company believes that these statements will not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or cash flows. However, the Company is currently evaluating whether the adoption of SFAS No. 160 could have a material impact on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of stockholders' equity.             In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) ("FSP APB 14-1"). This new standard requires the initial proceeds from convertible debt that may be settled in cash to be bifurcated between a liability component and an equity component. The objective of the guidance is to require the liability and equity components of convertible debt to be separately accounted for in a manner such that the interest expense recorded on the convertible debt would not equal the contractual rate of interest on the convertible debt, but instead would be recorded at a rate that would reflect the issuer's conventional non-convertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance. This is accomplished through the creation of a discount on the debt that would be accreted using the effective interest method as additional non-cash interest expense over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding. The Company is required to adopt FSP APB 14-1 on January 1, 2009. This FSP will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company currently expects that FSP APB    47             14-1 will have a material impact on the accounting for the convertible senior notes ("Senior Notes") and the Company's consolidated balance sheets and results of operations.             In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF No. 03-6-1, "Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities." FSP EITF No. 03-6-1 will be applied retrospectively to all the periods presented for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of FSP EITF No. 03-6-1 on its results of operations and financial condition.            In June 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity's Own Stock. Paragraph 11(a) of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities, specifies that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative but is both (a) indexed to the Company's own stock and (b) classified in stockholders' equity in the statement of financial position would not be considered a derivative financial instrument. EITF Issue No. 07-5 provides a new two-step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer's own stock and thus able to qualify for the SFAS No. 133 paragraph 11(a) scope exception. EITF Issue No. 07-5 will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2008, and early adoption is prohibited. Management is currently evaluating whether the adoption of EITF Issue No. 07-5 will have an impact on the accounting for the Senior Notes and related capped call option transactions. In the event that management determines that the adoption of EITF Issue No. 07-05 impacts the accounting for the Senior Notes, management's current conclusion regarding the impact of FSP APB-14-1 could change.     Results of Operations             Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred due to the transactions described above including the 2008 Acquisition Properties, the 2007 Acquisition Properties, the 2006 Acquisition Centers and the Redevelopment Centers. For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007, the "Same Centers" include all consolidated Centers, excluding the 2008 Acquisition Properties, the 2007 Acquisition Properties and the Redevelopment Centers. For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006, the Same Centers include all consolidated Centers, excluding the 2007 Acquisition Properties, the 2006 Acquisition Centers and the Redevelopment Centers.            For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007, "Redevelopment Centers" include The Oaks, Northgate Mall, Santa Monica Place, Shoppingtown Mall, Westside Pavilion, The Marketplace at Flagstaff, SanTan Village Regional Center and Promenade at Casa Grande. For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006, "Redevelopment Centers" include The Oaks, Twenty Ninth Street, Santa Monica Place, Westside Pavilion, The Marketplace at Flagstaff Mall, SanTan Village Regional Center and Promenade at Casa Grande.            Unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected using the equity method of accounting. The Company's pro rata share of the results from these Centers is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures.     Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007        Revenues:               Minimum and percentage rents (collectively referred to as "rental revenue") increased by $61.7 million, or 12.3%, from 2007 to 2008. The increase in rental revenue is attributed to an increase of $42.1 million from the 2007 Acquisition Properties, $13.9 million from the Redevelopment Centers,    48           $3.8 million from the 2008 Acquisition Properties and $1.9 million from the Same Centers. The increase in the revenues from the Same Centers is primarily due to rent escalations and lease renewals at higher rents, which was offset by decreases in lease termination income, amortization of straight-line rents and amortization of above and below market leases. The increase in the revenues from the Same Centers was also offset by a decrease of $6.3 million in percentage rents due to a decrease in retail sales.            Rental revenue includes the amortization of above and below market leases, the amortization of straight-line rents and lease termination income. The amortization of above and below market leases increased from $10.6 million in 2007 to $21.5 million in 2008. The amortization of straight-lined rents decreased from $6.9 million in 2007 to $5.7 million in 2008. Lease termination income increased from $9.7 million in 2007 to $9.9 million in 2008. The increase in above and below market leases is primarily due to the early termination of Mervyn's leases in 2008 (See "Management's Overview and SummaryMervyn's.").            Tenant recoveries increased $21.4 million, or 8.7%, from 2007 to 2008. The increase in tenant recoveries is attributed to an increase of $9.4 million from the Same Centers, $6.3 million from the 2007 Acquisition Properties, $4.7 from the Redevelopment Centers and $1.0 million from the 2008 Acquisition Properties.             Management Companies' revenues increased by $1.0 million from 2007 to 2008, primarily due to increased management fees received from the Joint Venture Centers, additional third party management contracts and increased development fees from joint ventures.       Shopping Center and Operating Expenses:               Shopping center and operating expenses increased $30.3 million, or 11.8%, from 2007 to 2008. Approximately $13.6 million of the increase in shopping center and operating expenses is from the Same Centers, $11.3 million is from the 2007 Acquisition Properties, $5.0 million is from the Redevelopment Centers and $1.2 million is from the 2008 Acquisition Properties. The increase in Same Centers is primarily due to an increase in recoverable utility expenses and property taxes and a $2.0 million increase in bad debt expense.       Management Companies' Operating Expenses:               Management Companies' operating expenses increased $3.3 million in 2007 to 2008, in part as a result of the additional costs of managing the Joint Venture Centers and third party managed properties.       REIT General and Administrative Expenses:               REIT general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.1 million from 2007 to 2008. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in share and unit-based compensation expense in 2008.       Depreciation and Amortization:               Depreciation and amortization increased $65.3 million from 2007 to 2008. The increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily attributed to an increase of $42.1 million from the 2007 Acquisition Properties, $12.0 million from the Redevelopment Centers, $7.3 million from the Same Centers and $3.7 million from the 2008 Acquisition Properties. Included in the increase of depreciation and amortization of 2007 Acquisition Properties is the write-off of $32.9 million of intangible assets as a result of the early termination of Mervyn's leases (See "Management's Overview and SummaryMervyn's.")       Interest Expense:               Interest expense increased $31.2 million from 2007 to 2008. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributed to an increase of $17.9 million from borrowings under the Company's line of credit, $9.3 million from the Redevelopment Centers, $5.4 million from the Senior Notes issued on March 16, 2007 and $4.7 million from the Same Centers. The increase in interest expense was offset in part by a decrease of $3.8 million from term loans.    49        NAME="page_dq15701_1_50">                                                     The increase in interest expense on the Company's line of credit was due to an increase in average outstanding borrowings during 2008, in part, because of the purchase of The Shops at North Bridge, the 2007 Acquisition Properties and the 2008 Acquisition Properties and the repurchase and retirement of Senior Notes in 2008, which is offset in part by lower LIBOR rates and spreads. The decrease in interest on term loans was due to the repayment of the $250 million loan in 2007.             The above interest expense items are net of capitalized interest, which increased from $32.0 million in 2007 to $33.3 million in 2008 due to an increase in redevelopment activity in 2008.       (Gain) Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt:               The Company recorded a gain of $95.3 million on the early extinguishment of $222.8 million of the Senior Notes in 2008. In 2007, the Company recorded a $0.9 million loss from the early extinguishment of the $250 million term loan (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources".)       Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:               The equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures increased $12.4 million from 2007 to 2008. The increase in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures is due in part to commission income of $6.5 million earned in 2008 from a joint venture, $3.6 million relating to the acquisition of The Shops at North Bridge in 2008, and $2.0 million relating to a loss on the sale of assets in the SDG Macerich Properties, L.P. joint venture in 2007.       (Loss) Gain on Sale or Write-down of Assets:               The Company recorded a loss on sale or write down of assets of $31.8 million in 2008 relating to an $8.7 million write-off of development costs on projects the Company has determined not to pursue, a $19.2 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of land held for development and a $5.3 million adjustment to reduce the carrying value of Mervyn's stores that the Company had previously classified as held for sale (See "Management's Overview and SummaryMervyn's.") The gain on sale or write-down of assets in 2007 of $12.1 million is primarily related to gain on sales of land.       Discontinued Operations:               Income from discontinued operations increased $98.8 million from 2007 to 2008. The increase is primarily due to the $99.1 million gain from the Rochester Redemption in 2008. See "Management's Overview and SummaryAcquisitions and Dispositions." As a result of the Rochester Redemption, the Company classified the results of operations for these properties to discontinued operations for all periods presented.       Minority Interest in the Operating Partnership:               The minority interest in the Operating Partnership represents the 14.4% weighted average interest of the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company during 2008 compared to the 15.0% not owned by the Company during 2007. The decrease in minority interest is primarily attributed to the conversion of 3,067,131 preferred shares into common shares in 2008 (See Note 22Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements) and the repurchase of 807,000 shares in 2007 (See Note 21Stock Repurchase Program of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements).    50              Funds From Operations:               Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, "FFO"diluted increased 19.2% from $407.9 million in 2007 to $486.4 million in 2008. For disclosure of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the periods and a reconciliation of FFO and FFOdiluted to net income available to common stockholders, see "Funds from Operations."       Operating Activities:               Cash flow from operations decreased from $326.1 million in 2007 to $251.9 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities in 2007 compared to 2008, an increase in distributions of income from unconsolidated joint ventures and due to the results at the Centers as discussed above.       Investing Activities:               Cash used in investing activities decreased from $865.3 million in 2007 to $559.0 million in 2008. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures of $507.7 million and acquisition deposits of $51.9 million offset by a decrease in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures of $132.5 million and an increase in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures. The decrease in capital expenditures is primarily due to the purchase of the Mervyn's portfolio for $400.2 million in 2007. The decrease in acquisition deposits and the increase in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily due to the Company's purchase of a pro rata share of The Shops at North Bridge for $155.0 million in 2008 (See "Management's Overview and SummaryAcquisitions and Dispositions.") The decrease in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures is due to the receipt of the Company's pro rata share of loan proceeds from the refinance transactions at various unconsolidated joint ventures in 2007.       Financing Activities:               Cash flow provided by financing activities decreased from $355.1 million in 2007 to $288.3 million in 2008. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributed to the issuance of $950 million of Senior Notes in 2007, the repurchase of $222.8 million of Senior Notes in 2008 (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources") and the purchase of the Capped Calls in connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes in 2007.     Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006        Revenues:               Rental revenue increased by $39.7 million, or 8.6%, from 2006 to 2007. The increase in rental revenue is attributed to an increase of $17.9 million from the 2006 Acquisition Centers, $13.8 million from the Redevelopment Centers, $6.7 million from the Same Centers and $1.2 million from the 2007 Acquisition Properties.            The amortization of above and below market leases, which is recorded in rental revenue, decreased to $10.6 million in 2007 from $12.2 million in 2006. The decrease in amortization is primarily due to leases which were terminated in 2006. The amortization of straight-lined rents, included in rental revenue, was $6.9 million in 2007 compared to $4.7 million in 2006. Lease termination income, which is included in rental revenue, decreased to $9.8 million in 2007 from $13.2 million in 2006.             Tenant recoveries increased $17.9 million, or 7.9%, from 2006 to 2007. The increase in tenant recoveries is attributed to an increase of $11.0 million from the 2006 Acquisition Centers, $4.3 million from the Redevelopment Centers, $2.4 million from the Same Centers and $0.2 million from the 2007 Acquisition Properties.    51                    Management Companies' revenues increased by $8.3 million from 2006 to 2007, primarily due to increased management fees received from the Joint Venture Centers, additional third party management contracts and increased development fees from joint ventures.       Shopping Center and Operating Expenses:               Shopping center and operating expenses increased $23.1 million, or 9.9%, from 2006 to 2007. Approximately $9.6 million of the increase in shopping center and operating expenses is from the 2006 Acquisition Centers, $6.8 million is from the Redevelopment Centers, $6.1 million is from the Same Centers and $0.5 million is from the 2007 Acquisition Properties.       Management Companies' Operating Expenses:               Management Companies' operating expenses increased to $73.8 million in 2007 from $56.7 million in 2006, in part as a result of the additional costs of managing the Joint Venture Centers and third party managed properties, higher compensation expense due to increased staffing and higher professional fees.       REIT General and Administrative Expenses:               REIT general and administrative expenses increased by $3.1 million in 2007 from 2006, primarily due to increased share and unit-based compensation expense in 2007.       Depreciation and Amortization:               Depreciation and amortization increased $15.7 million in 2007 from 2006. The increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily attributed to an increase of $10.5 million at the Redevelopment Centers, $10.4 million from the 2006 Acquisition Centers and $0.1 million from the 2007 Acquisition Properties. This increase is offset in part by a decrease of $1.8 million from the Same Centers.       Interest Expense:               Interest expense decreased $10.6 million in 2007 from 2006. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributed to a decrease of $17.2 million from term loans, $16.1 million from the line of credit, $8.1 million from the Same Centers and $2.7 million from the Redevelopment Centers. The decrease in interest expense was offset in part by an increase of $27.3 million from the $950.0 million Senior Notes issued on March 16, 2007 and $6.6 million from the 2006 Acquisition Centers. The decrease in interest on term loans was due to the repayment of the $250 million loan in 2007 and the repayment of the $619 million term loan in 2006. The decrease in interest on the line of credit was due to: (i) a decrease in average outstanding borrowings during 2007, in part, because of the issuance of the Senior Notes, (ii) a decrease in interest rates because of the $400 million swap and (iii) lower LIBOR rates and spreads. The decrease in interest from the Same Centers is due to: (i) the repayment of the $75.0 million loan on Paradise Valley Mall in January 2007, (ii) an increase in capitalized interest and (iii) a decrease in LIBOR rates on floating rate mortgages payable. The above interest expense items are net of capitalized interest, which increased to $32.0 million in 2007 from $14.9 million in 2006 due to an increase in redevelopment activity in 2007.       Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt:               The Company recorded a $0.9 million loss from the early extinguishment of the $250 million term loan in 2007. In 2006, the Company recorded a loss from the early extinguishment of debt of $1.8 million related to the pay off of the $619 million term loan.    52              Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:               The equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $4.6 million in 2007 from 2006. The decrease in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures is due in part to a $2.0 million loss on sale of assets in the SDG Macerich Properties, L.P. joint venture and additional interest expense and depreciation at other joint ventures due to the completion of development projects.       Gain on Sale of Assets:               The Company recorded a gain on sale of assets of $12.1 million in 2007 relating to land sales of $8.8 million and $3.4 million relating to sale of equipment and furnishings.       Discontinued Operations:               The decrease of $211.5 million in income from discontinued operations is primarily related to the recognition of gain on the sales of Scottsdale 101, Park Lane Mall, Holiday Village Mall, Greeley Mall, Great Falls Marketplace, Citadel Mall, Crossroads Mall and Northwest Arkansas Mall in 2006 (See "Management's Overview and SummaryAcquisitions and Dispositions"). As result of these sales, the Company classified the results of operations for these properties to discontinued operations for all periods presented.       Minority Interest in the Operating Partnership:               The minority interest in the Operating Partnership represents the 15.0% weighted average interest of the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company during 2007 compared to the 15.8% not owned by the Company during 2006. The change in ownership interest is primarily due to the common stock offering by the Company in 2006, the conversion of partnership units and preferred shares into common shares in 2007 which is offset in part by the repurchase of 807,000 shares in 2007 (See Note 21Stock Repurchase Program of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements).       Funds From Operations:               Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, FFOdiluted increased 6.5% to $407.9 million in 2007 from $383.1 million in 2006. For disclosure of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the periods and the reconciliation of FFO and FFOdiluted to net income available to common stockholders, see "Funds from Operations."       Operating Activities:               Cash flow from operations increased to $326.1 million in 2007 from $211.9 million in 2006. The increase was primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities in 2007 compared to 2006 and due to the results at the Centers as discussed above.       Investing Activities:               Cash used in investing activities increased to $865.3 million in 2007 from $126.7 million in 2006. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a $580.3 million decrease in cash proceeds from the sales of assets and a $220.9 million increase in capital expenditures.       Financing Activities:               Cash flow provided by financing activities increased to $355.1 million in 2007 from $29.2 million in 2006. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributed to the issuance of $950 million of Senior Notes in 2007, offset in part by a decrease of $746.8 million in proceeds from    53           the common stock offering in 2006 and the purchase of the Capped Calls in connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes in 2007.      Liquidity and Capital Resources             Although general market liquidity is constrained, the Company anticipates meeting its liquidity needs for its operating expenses and debt service and dividend requirements through cash generated from operations, working capital reserves and/or borrowings under its unsecured line of credit. Additional liquidity may also be provided if the Company decides to pay a portion of its dividends in stock during 2009.            The following tables summarize capital expenditures incurred at the Centers for the years ended December 31:                     (Dollars in thousands)          2008      2007      2006          Consolidated Centers:                                    Acquisitions of property and equipment     $  87,516     $  387,899     $  580,542         Development, redevelopment and expansion of Centers        446,119        545,926        184,315         Renovations of Centers        8,541        31,065        51,406         Tenant allowances        14,651        27,959        26,976         Deferred leasing charges        22,263        21,611        21,610                                       $  579,090     $  1,014,460     $  864,849                                   Joint Venture Centers (at Company's pro rata share):                                    Acquisitions of property and equipment     $  294,416     $  24,828     $  28,732         Development, redevelopment and expansion of Centers        60,811        33,492        48,785         Renovations of Centers        3,080        10,495        8,119         Tenant allowances        13,759        15,066        13,795         Deferred leasing charges        4,997        4,181        4,269                                       $  377,063     $  88,062     $  103,700                                            Management expects levels to be incurred in future years for tenant allowances and deferred leasing charges to be comparable or less than 2008 and that capital for those expenditures will be available from working capital, cash flow from operations, borrowings on property specific debt or unsecured corporate borrowings. The Company expects to incur between $80 million to $120 million in 2009 for development, redevelopment, expansion and renovations. Capital for these major expenditures, developments and/or redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be, obtained from a combination of equity or debt financings, which include borrowings under the Company's line of credit and construction loans. In addition, the Company has also generated additional liquidity in the past through joint venture transactions and the sale of non-core assets, and may do so in the future. Furthermore, the Company has a shelf registration statement which registered an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and units.            Current turmoil in the capital and credit markets, however, has significantly limited access to debt and equity financing for many companies. As demonstrated by recent activity, the Company was able to access capital throughout 2008, however there is no assurance the Company will be able to do so in future periods or on similar terms and conditions. Many factors impact the Company's ability to access capital, such as its overall debt level, interest rates, interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions. As a result of the current state of the capital and commercial lending markets, the    54             Company may be required to finance more of its business activities with borrowings under its line of credit rather than with public and private unsecured debt and equity securities, fixed-rate mortgage financing and other traditional sources. In addition, in the event that the Company has significant tenant defaults as a result of the overall economy and general market conditions, the Company could have a decrease in cash flow from operations, which could create further borrowings under its line of credit. These events could result in an increase in the Company's proportion of variable-rate debt, which could cause it to be more subject to interest rate fluctuations in the future. See "Risk FactorsWe depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements."            The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness at December 31, 2008 was $8.0 billion (including $2.3 billion of unsecured debt and $2.0 billion of its pro rata share of joint venture debt). The majority of the Company's debt consists of fixed-rate conventional mortgages payable collateralized by individual properties. Assuming the closing of the Company's current loan commitment, approximately $406 million of its indebtedness matures in 2009 (excluding loans with extensions). The Company expects that all 2009 debt maturities will be refinanced, extended and/or paid off from the Company's line of credit.            On March 16, 2007, the Company issued $950 million in Senior Notes that mature on March 15, 2012. The Senior Notes bear interest at 3.25%, payable semiannually, are senior to unsecured debt of the Company and are guaranteed by the Operating Partnership. Prior to December 14, 2011, upon the occurrence of certain specified events, the Senior Notes will be convertible at the option of holder into cash, shares of the Company's common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, at the election of the Company, at an initial conversion rate of 8.9702 shares per $1,000 principal amount. On and after December 15, 2011, the Senior Notes will be convertible at any time prior to the second business day preceding the maturity date at the option of the holder at the initial conversion rate. The initial conversion price of approximately $111.48 per share represented a 20% premium over the closing price of the Company's common stock on March 12, 2007. The initial conversion rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. Holders of the Senior Notes do not have the right to require the Company to repurchase the Senior Notes prior to maturity except in connection with the occurrence of certain fundamental change transactions. During the period of October 21, 2008 to December 29, 2008, the Company repurchased and retired $222.8 million of the Senior Notes and as a result recorded a gain of $95.3 on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2008. The purchase price of $122.8 million was funded by additional borrowings on the Company's line of credit. On February 13 and February 17 2009, the Company repurchased and retired an additional $56.8 million of the Senior Notes for $30.9 million, resulting in a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $25.1 million.            In connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company purchased two capped calls ("Capped Calls") from affiliates of the initial purchasers of the Senior Notes. The Capped Calls effectively increase the conversion price of the Senior Notes to approximately $130.06, which represented a 40% premium to the March 12, 2007 closing price of $92.90 per common share of the Company.            The Company has a $1.5 billion revolving line of credit that matures on April 25, 2010 with a one-year extension option. The interest rate fluctuates between LIBOR plus 0.75% to LIBOR plus 1.10% depending on the Company's overall leverage. In September 2006, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate on $400.0 million of the outstanding balance of the line of credit at 6.23% until April 25, 2011. On March 16, 2007, the Company repaid $541.5 million of borrowings outstanding from the proceeds of the Senior Notes (See Note 10Bank and Other Notes Payable of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements). As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, borrowings outstanding were $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, at an average interest rate, net of the $400.0 million swapped portion, of 3.19% and 6.19%, respectively. The Company has access to the remaining balance of its $1.5 billion line of credit.    55                    On May 13, 2003, the Company issued $250.0 million in unsecured notes maturing in May 2007 with a one-year extension option bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.50%. On April 25, 2005, the Company modified these unsecured notes and reduced the interest rate to LIBOR plus 1.50%. On March 16, 2007, the Company repaid the notes from the proceeds of the Senior Notes (See Note 10Bank and Other Notes Payable of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements).            On April 25, 2005, the Company obtained a five year, $450.0 million term loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%. In November 2005, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate of the $450.0 million term loan at 6.30% from December 1, 2005 to April 15, 2010. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the loan had a balance outstanding of $446.3 million and $450.0 million, respectively, with an effective interest rate of 6.30%.            At December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all applicable loan covenants.            At December 31, 2008, the Company had cash and cash equivalents available of $66.5 million.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements               The Company has an ownership interest in a number of unconsolidated joint ventures as detailed in Note 4 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. The Company accounts for those investments that it does not have a controlling interest or is not the primary beneficiary using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Company as "Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures." A pro rata share of the mortgage debt on these properties is shown in "Item 2. PropertiesMortgage Debt."             In addition, certain joint ventures also have debt that could become recourse debt to the Company or its subsidiaries, in excess of the Company's pro rata share, should the joint ventures be unable to discharge the obligations of the related debt.            The following reflects the maximum amount of debt principal that could recourse to the Company at December 31, 2008 (in thousands):                  Property          Recourse Debt      Maturity Date          Boulevard Shops     $  4,280        12/17/2010         Chandler Village Center        4,375        1/15/2011         Estrella Falls, The Market at        8,243        6/1/2011                                    $  16,898                                                  Additionally, as of December 31, 2008, the Company is contingently liable for $19.7 million in letters of credit guaranteeing performance by the Company of certain obligations relating to the Centers.

Funds From Operations             The Company uses FFO in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers FFO and FFOdiluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to GAAP measures. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines FFO as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of depreciated operating properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO and FFO on a fully diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. This is especially true since FFO excludes real estate depreciation and amortization as the Company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. FFO on a fully diluted basis is one of the measures investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities. FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by GAAP and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. FFO, as presented, may not be comparable to    57             similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts. The reconciliation of FFO and FFOdiluted to net income available to common stockholders is provided below.             The following reconciles net income (loss) available to common stockholders to FFO and FFOdiluted (dollars in thousands):                                   2008      2007      2006      2005      2004          Net income (loss)available to common stockholders     $  183,316     $  73,704     $  217,404     $  (93,614  )  $  82,493         Adjustments to reconcile net income to FFObasic:                                                         Minority interest in the Operating Partnership        30,765        13,036        40,827        (22,001  )     19,870            Gain on sale of consolidated assets        (68,714  )     (9,771  )     (241,732  )     (1,530  )     (8,041  )         Adjustment of minority interest due to redemption value                2,046        17,062        183,620                    Add: Gain on undepreciated assetsconsolidated assets        798        8,047        8,827        1,068        939            Add: Minority interest share of gain on sale of consolidated joint ventures        185        760        36,831        239                    Less: write-down of consolidated assets        (27,445  )                                         Gain on sale of assets from unconsolidated entities (pro rata)        (3,432  )     (400  )     (725  )     (1,954  )     (3,353  )         Add: Gain on sale of undepreciated assetsfrom unconsolidated entities (pro rata)        3,039        2,793        725        2,092        3,464               Add minority interest on sale of undepreciated consolidated entities        487                                               Less write down of unconsolidated entities (pro rata)        (94  )                                         Depreciation and amortization on consolidated Centers        279,339        231,860        232,219        205,971        146,383            Less: depreciation and amortization allocable to minority interest on consolidated joint ventures        (3,395  )     (4,769  )     (5,422  )     (5,873  )     (1,555  )         Depreciation and amortization on joint ventures (pro rata)        96,441        88,807        82,745        73,247        61,060            Less: depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan costs and interest rate caps        (9,952  )     (8,244  )     (15,722  )     (14,724  )     (11,228  )                                            FFObasic        481,338        397,869        373,039        326,541        290,032         Additional adjustments to arrive at FFOdiluted:                                                         Impact of convertible preferred stock        4,124        10,058        10,083        9,649        9,140            Impact of non-participating convertible preferred units        979                        641                                                       FFOdiluted     $  486,441     $  407,927     $  383,122     $  336,831     $  299,172                                               Weighted average number of FFO shares outstanding for:                                                      FFObasic(1)        86,794        84,467        84,138        73,250        72,715         Adjustments for the impact of dilutive securities in computing FFO-diluted:                                                         Convertible preferred stock        1,447        3,512        3,627        3,627        3,627            Non-participating convertible preferred units        205                        197                    Stock options                293        293        323        385                                               FFOdiluted(2)        88,446        88,272        88,058        77,397        76,727                                                     (1) Calculated based upon basic net income (loss) as adjusted to reach basic FFO.

The Westcor partnership units were converted to OP Units on July 27, 2004 which were subsequently redeemed for common stock on October 4, 2005. (2) The computation of FFOdiluted shares outstanding includes the effect of share and unit-based compensation plans and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method. It also assumes the conversion of MACWH, LP common and preferred units to the extent that they are dilutive to the FFO computation (See Note 12Acquisitions of the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). On February 25, 1998, the Company sold $100 million of its Series A Preferred Stock. The holder of the Series A Preferred Stock converted 0.6 million, 0.7 million, 1.3 million and 1.0 million shares to common shares on October 18, 2007, May 6, 2008, May 8, 2008 and September 17, 2008, respectively. The preferred stock was convertible on a one-for-one basis for common stock. The then outstanding preferred shares were assumed converted for purposes of 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004 FFOdiluted as they were dilutive to that calculation.   58           NAME="dq15701_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02669">         ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK                  The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk.

In addition, the method of computing fair value for mortgage notes payable included a credit value adjustment based on the estimated value of the property that serves as collateral for the underlying debt (See Note 9Mortgage Notes Payable of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements).
