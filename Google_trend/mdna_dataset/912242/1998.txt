ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS   OF OPERATIONS    GENERAL BACKGROUND AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT      The Company believes that the most significant measures of its operating performance are Funds from Operations and EBITDA. Funds from Operations is defined as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of real property, plus depreciation and amortization (excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis. Funds from Operations does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs.      EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, minority interest, income in unconsolidated entities, extraordinary items and gain (loss) on sale of assets. This data is relevant to an understanding of the economics of the shopping center business as it indicates cash flow available from operations to service debt and satisfy certain fixed obligations. EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of liquidity. While the performance of individual Centers and the Management Companies determines EBITDA, the Company's capital structure also influences Funds from Operations. The most important component in determining EBITDA and Funds from Operations is Center revenues. Center revenues consist primarily of minimum rents, percentage rents and tenant expense recoveries. Minimum rents will increase to the extent that new leases are signed at market rents that are higher than prior rents. Minimum rent will also fluctuate up or down with changes in the occupancy level. Additionally, to the extent that new leases are signed with more favorable expense recovery terms, expense recoveries will increase.      Percentage rents generally increase or decrease with changes in tenant sales. As leases roll over, however, a portion of historical percentage rent is often converted to minimum rent. It is therefore common for percentage rents to decrease as minimum rents increase. Accordingly, in discussing financial performance, the Company combines minimum and percentage rents in order to better measure revenue growth.      The following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995. The following discussion compares the activity for the year ended December 31, 1997 to results of operations for 1996. Also included is a comparison of the activities for the year ended December 31, 1996 to the results for the year ended December 31, 1995.      This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.      This annual report on Form 10-K contains or incorporates statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements appear in a number of places in this Form 10-K and include statements regarding, among other matters, the Company's growth opportunities, the Company's acquisition strategy, regulatory matters pertaining to compliance with governmental regulations and other factors affecting the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

December 31, 1997        Great Falls, Montana   The financial statements include the results of these centers for periods subsequent to their acquisition.      Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred due to the addition of these properties to the portfolio during 1997 and 1996. Many factors, such as the availability and cost of capital, overall debt to market capitalization level, interest rates and availability of potential acquisition targets that meet the Company's criteria, impact the Company's ability to acquire additional properties. Accordingly, management is uncertain as to whether during the balance of 1998, and in future years, there will be similar acquisitions and corresponding increases in revenues, net income and funds from operations that occurred as a result of the addition of the 1997 and 1996 Acquisition Centers. All other centers are referred to herein as the "Same Centers".      The bankruptcy and/or closure of retail stores, particularly Anchors, may reduce customer traffic and cash flow generated by a Center. During 1997, Montgomery Ward filed bankruptcy. The Company has 11 Montgomery Ward stores in its portfolio. Montgomery Ward has not yet disclosed whether they will cease operating any of their stores in the Company's centers. The long-term closure of these or other stores could adversely affect the Company's performance.      In addition, the Company's success in the highly competitive real estate shopping center business depends upon many other factors, including general economic conditions, the ability of tenants to make rent payments, increases or decreases in operating expenses, occupancy levels, changes in demographics, competition from other centers and forms of retailing and the ability to renew leases or relet space upon the expiration or termination of leases.  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES      Total assets increased to $1,505 million at December 31, 1997 compared to $1,188 million at December 31, 1996 and $763 million at December 31, 1995. During that same period, total liabilities increased from $509 million in 1995 to $838 million in 1996 and $1,188 million in 1997. These changes were primarily as a result of the 1996 and 1995 common stock offerings, the 1997 convertible debenture offering,                                         23  the purchase of the 1997, 1996 and 1995 Acquisition Centers and related debt transactions described below.  A.  CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE OFFERING      On June 27, 1997, the Company issued and sold $150 million of convertible subordinated debentures due 2002 and an additional $11.4 million of debentures were sold in July 1997 ("the Debentures"). The Debentures, which were sold at par, bear interest at 7.25% annually (payable semi-annually) and are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at any time, on or after 60 days, from the date of issue at a conversion price of $31.125 per share. The Debentures mature on December 15, 2002 and are callable by the Company after June 15, 2002 at par plus accrued interest. The net proceeds from the sale of the Debentures of $157.4 million were used to repay floating rate debt and for general corporate purposes.  B.  ACQUISITIONS      South Towne Center was acquired on March 27, 1997. South Towne Center is a 1,240,143 square foot super regional mall located in Sandy, Utah. The purchase price was $98 million, consisting of $52 million of cash and $46 million of assumed mortgage indebtedness.      Stonewood Mall is a 927,218 square foot super regional mall in Downey, California, which the Company acquired on August 6, 1997. The purchase price was $92 million which was funded with $58 million in proceeds from a 10 year fixed rate loan placed concurrently on Villa Marina Marketplace and from cash on hand.      Manhattan Village located in Manhattan Beach, California was purchased by a joint venture on August 19, 1997. The Company owns a 10% interest in the joint venture. Manhattan Village is a regional center with a total of 551,685 square feet of retail, restaurant and entertainment space. The purchase price was $66.6 million and was paid in cash.      The Citadel, a 1,044,852 square foot super regional mall in Colorado Springs, Colorado, was purchased on December 19, 1997 for $108 million. The purchase price was funded by a concurrently placed loan of $75.6 million plus $32.4 million in cash.      Great Falls Marketplace is an 143,570 square foot community center developed by the Management Companies and sold to the Company on December 31, 1997. The purchase price of $14.8 million approximates the cost incurred by the Management Companies to acquire and develop the site.  C.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS      On February 27, 1998, the Company, through a 50/50 joint venture with an affiliate of Simon DeBartolo Group, Inc., acquired a portfolio of twelve regional malls. The properties in the portfolio total 10.7 million square feet and are located in eight states. The total purchase price was $974.5 million, which included $485 million of assumed debt. The balance of the Company's share of the purchase price was funded by issuing $100 million of convertible preferred stock, $79.6 million of common stock issued to two unit trusts, and the balance from the Company's line of credit.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 AND 1996      REVENUES      Minimum and percentage rents increased by 44% to $151.5 million from $105.2. Approximately $36.0 million of the increase resulted from the 1996 Acquisition Centers and $11.9 million resulted from the 1997 Acquisition Centers. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.5 million at Parklane Mall and $0.3 million at Crossroads-Boulder, both due to reduced occupancy incurred during redevelopment.                                         24      Tenant recoveries increased to $66.5 million in 1997 from $47.7 million in 1996. The 1997 and 1996 Acquisition Centers generated $19.6 million of this increase. These increases were partially offset by an $0.8 million reduction in Same Center recoverable expenses in 1997 compared to 1996.      Other income increased to $3.2 million in 1997 from $2.2 million in 1996. Approximately $0.5 million of the increase related to the 1997 and 1996 Acquisition Centers, and approximately $0.5 million of this increase resulted from nonrecurring fee income received in 1997.      EXPENSES      Shopping center expenses increased to $70.9 million in 1997 compared to $50.8 million in 1996. Approximately $20.9 million of the increase resulted from the 1997 and 1996 Acquisition Centers. The other centers had a net decrease of $0.8 million in shopping center expenses resulting primarily from decreased property taxes, insurance premiums and recoverable expenses.      General and administrative expenses increased to $2.8 million in 1997 from $2.4 million in 1996, primarily due to increased executive and director compensation expense and professional fee expense.      INTEREST EXPENSE      Interest expense increased to $66.4 million in 1997 from $42.4 million in 1996. This increase of $24.0 million is attributable to the acquisition activity in 1997 and 1996, which was partially funded with secured debt. In addition, in 1997 the Company issued $161.4 million of convertible debentures.      DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION      Depreciation increased to $41.5 million from $32.6 million in 1996. This increase relates primarily to the 1996 and 1997 Acquisition Centers.      MINORITY INTEREST      The minority interest represents the 31.8% weighted average interest of the Operating Partnership that was not owned by the Company during 1997. This compares to 36.9% not owned by the Company during 1996.      INCOME (LOSS) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AND MANAGEMENT COMPANIES      The loss from unconsolidated joint ventures and the management companies was $8.1 million for 1997, compared to a gain of $3.3 million in 1996. A total of $10.5 million of the change is attributable to the write down, and the loss on the sale, of North Valley Plaza in 1997.      GAIN ON SALE OF ASSETS      During 1997 the Company sold a parcel of land for a net gain of $1.6 million. There was no gain on sale recognized in 1996.      EXTRAORDINARY LOSS FROM EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT      In 1997 the Company wrote off $0.6 million of unamortized financing costs, compared to $0.3 million written off in 1996.      NET INCOME      As a result of the foregoing, net income increased to $22.0 million in 1997 from $18.9 million in 1996.                                         25      OPERATING ACTIVITIES      Cash flow from operations was $78.5 million compared to $80.4 million in 1996. The decrease resulted from the factors discussed above, primarily the impact of the 1996 and 1997 Acquisition Centers and related financings.      INVESTING ACTIVITIES      Cash flow used in investing activities was $215.0 million in 1997 compared to $296.7 million in 1996. The change resulted primarily from the four acquisitions completed in 1997, compared to seven acquisitions in 1996.      FINANCING ACTIVITIES      Cash flow from financing activities was $146.0 million in 1997 compared to $216.3 million in 1996. The decrease resulted from more acquisition financing done in 1996 than 1997.      EBITDA AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS      Due primarily to the factors mentioned above, EBITDA increased 45% to $147.6 million in 1997 from $101.9 million in 1996 and Funds From Operations increased 33% to $83.2 million from $62.4 million in 1996.    COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 AND 1995      REVENUES      Minimum and percentage rents increased by 42% to $105.2 million from $74.1 million. Approximately $19.0 million of the increase resulted from the 1995 Acquisition Centers and $13.2 million resulted from the 1996 Acquisition Centers. These increases were partially offset by declining rents of $1.1 million at Parklane Mall which was adversely impacted by an Anchor closure in 1996.      Tenant recoveries increased to $47.7 million in 1996 from $27.0 million in 1995. The 1996 and 1995 Acquisition Centers caused $19.3 million of this increase. Approximately $1.1 million of the increase was due to higher recoverable expenses in 1996 compared to 1995.      Other income increased to $2.2 million in 1996 from $1.4 million in 1995. Approximately $1.2 million of the increase related to the 1996 and 1995 Acquisition Centers. This increase was partially offset by lower interest income of $0.3 million in 1996 compared to 1995.      EXPENSES      Shopping center expenses increased to $50.8 million in 1996 compared to $31.6 million in 1995. Approximately $18.7 million of the increase resulted from the 1996 and 1995 Acquisition Centers. The other centers had a net increase of $0.5 million in shopping center expenses of which approximately $1.1 million was for increased property taxes and $0.5 million of increased bad debt expense, offset by a reduction in ground rent expense of $1.3 million which resulted from the October, 1995 acquisition of land at Crossroads Mall--Boulder which had previously been leased.      General and administrative expenses increased to $2.4 million in 1996 from $2.0 million in 1995 primarily due to increased professional fee expense.      INTEREST EXPENSE      Interest expense increased to $42.4 million in 1996 from $25.5 million in 1995. Interest expense attributable to County East Mall decreased $1.2 million in 1996 due to the payoff of that debt on                                         26  December 31, 1995. Also, there was a decrease of $1.3 million at Crossroads Mall--Boulder due to a December 1995 refinancing at a substantially lower interest rate. These reductions partially offset the increase of $19.1 million from the 1995 and 1996 Acquisition Centers.      DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION      Depreciation increased to $32.6 million from $25.7 million in 1995. An increase of approximately $7.6 million related to the 1995 and 1996 Acquisition Centers. This increase was offset by a decrease of approximately $1.4 million in amortization of financial instruments in 1996 which resulted from several financial instruments becoming fully amortized in 1995.      MINORITY INTEREST      The minority interest represents the 36.9% weighted average interest of the Operating Partnership that was not owned by the Company during 1996, compared to 45.0% during 1995.      INCOME (LOSS) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AND MANAGEMENT COMPANIES      The income from unconsolidated joint ventures and the management companies was $3.3 million for 1996, which was essentially the same as 1995.      EXTRAORDINARY LOSS FROM EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT      In connection with the sale of an interest rate cap, the Company wrote off unamortized financing costs of $0.3 million in 1996. In 1995 the Company wrote off $1.3 million of loan costs concurrent with the 1995 refinancing of Lakewood Mall.      NET INCOME      As a result of the foregoing, net income increased to $18.9 million in 1996 from $11.3 million in 1995.      OPERATING ACTIVITIES      Cash flow from operations increased to $80.4 million compared to $48.2 million in 1995. The increase resulted from the factors discussed above, primarily the impact of the 1995 and 1996 Acquisition Centers.      INVESTING ACTIVITIES      Cash flow used in investing activities was $296.7 million in 1996 compared to $88.4 million in 1995. The change resulted primarily from the seven acquisitions completed in 1996 compared to three acquisitions in 1995.      FINANCING ACTIVITIES      Cash flow from financing activities increased to $216.3 million in 1996 compared to $52.0 million in 1995. The increase resulted from more mortgage financing done in 1996, primarily to fund the 1996 acquisitions.      EBITDA AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS      Due primarily to the factors mentioned above, EBITDA increased 48%, to $101.9 million in 1996 from $68.9 million in 1995 and Funds From Operations increased 39%, to $62.4 million, from $44.9 million in 1995.                                         27      LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      The Company intends to meet its short term liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations and working capital reserves. The Company anticipates that revenues will continue to provide necessary funds for its operating expenses and debt service requirements, and to pay dividends to stockholders in accordance with REIT requirements. The Company anticipates that cash generated from operations, together with cash on hand, will be adequate to fund capital expenditures which will not be reimbursed by tenants, other than non-recurring capital expenditures. Capital for major expenditures or redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be, obtained from equity or debt financings.      The Company believes that it will have access to the capital necessary to expand its business in accordance with its strategies for growth and maximizing Funds from Operations. The Company presently intends to obtain additional capital necessary to expand its business through a combination of additional equity offerings and debt financings.      The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness at December 31, 1997 was $1.2 billion (including its pro rata share of joint venture debt). This equated to a debt to Total Market Capitalization (defined as total debt of the Operating Partnership, including its pro rata share of joint venture debt, plus aggregate market value of outstanding shares of common stock, assuming full conversion of OP Units into stock) rate of approximately 51.5% at year end. Such debt consists primarily of conventional mortgages payable secured by individual properties. See "Properties--Mortgage Debt" for a description of the Company's outstanding indebtedness. In connection with $65.1 million of the Company's floating rate indebtedness, the Company has entered into interest rate protection agreements that limit the Company's exposure to increases in interest rates. See "Properties--Mortgage Debt."      The Company has filed a shelf registration statement, effective December 8, 1997, to sell securities. The shelf registration is for a total of $500 million of common stock or common stock warrants. On February 18, 1998, the Company issued 1,826,484 shares from the shelf and on February 12, 1998 an additional 1,052,650 shares were issued from the shelf. The total proceeds of both transactions were approximately $79.6 million, leaving approximately $420 million available on the shelf registration.      The Company has an unsecured line of credit which has been recently expanded up to $150 million. There was $55 million outstanding at December 31, 1997 and $123 million outstanding after the ERE Yarmouth portfolio acquisition on February 27, 1998.      At December 31, 1997 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $25.2 million.      YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE      The Company has been advised by its independent software vendor that it has completed its evaluation, testing and modification of the property management and accounting software used by the Company and the necessary changes have been completed to achieve year 2000 compliance. The Company does not believe it will have any significant accounting or operations impact as a result of the year 2000.      FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS      The Company believes that the most significant measure of its performance is Funds from Operations ("FFO"). FFO is defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") to be: Net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of real property, plus depreciation and amortization (excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument cost) and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities will be calculated on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash flow from operations, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles, and is not                                         28  necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The following reconciles net income to FFO:                                                                                      1997                  1996                                                                           --------------------  --------------------                                                                            SHARES     AMOUNT     SHARES     AMOUNT                                                                           ---------  ---------  ---------  ---------                                                                                     (AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS)          Net income..............................................................             $  22,046             $  18,911  Adjustments to reconcile net income to FFO:   Minority interest.....................................................                10,567                10,975   Depreciation and amortization on wholly owned properties..............                41,535                32,591   Pro rata share of unconsolidated entities depreciation and     amortization........................................................                 2,312                 2,096   Extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt....................                   555                   315   Gain on sale of assets from wholly owned centers......................

Weighted average number of shares includes the weighted average shares of     common stock outstanding for 1997 assuming the conversion of OP units.  (2) The computation of dilutive and diluted average number of shares outstanding     includes the effect of common stock options outstanding and restricted stock     using the Treasury method. Convertible debentures are antidilutive and are     not included.      Included in minimum rents were rents attributable to the accounting practice of straight lining of rents. The amount of straight lining of rents that impacted minimum rents was $3,599,000 for 1997, $1,832,000 for 1996 and $944,000 for 1995.      INFLATION      In the last three years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most of the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on increases in the Consumer Price Index. In addition, many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years, which enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. Additionally, most of the leases require the tenants to pay their                                         29  pro rata share of operating expenses. This reduces the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.      NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED:      In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources. The Company does not expect this pronouncement to materially impact the Company's results of operations.      In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for disclosure about operating segments in annual financial statements and selected information in interim financial reports. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major customers. This statement supercedes SFAS No. 14, Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise. The new standard becomes effective for the Company for the year ending December 31, 1998, and requires that comparative information from earlier years be restated to conform to the requirements of this standard. The Company does not expect this pronouncement to materially change the Company's current reporting and disclosures.  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
