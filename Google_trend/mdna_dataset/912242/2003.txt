Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations         General Background and Performance Measurement     The Company believes that an important measure of its operating performance is Funds from Operations ("FFO"). FFO is defined as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring, sales or write-down of assets and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, plus depreciation and amortization (excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis. In calculating its FFO, the Company excluded minimum rent recognized in 2002 pursuant to SFAS No. 141. FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. FFO, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts. For the reconciliation of FFO to net income, see "Funds from Operations."    Percentage rents generally increase or decrease with changes in tenant sales. As leases roll over, however, a portion of historical percentage rent is often converted to minimum rent. It is therefore common for percentage rents to decrease as minimum rents increase. Accordingly, in discussing financial performance, the Company combines minimum and percentage rents in order to better measure revenue growth.    The following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. The following discussion compares the activity for the year ended December 31, 2002 to results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001. Also included is a comparison of the activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2000. This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.    Forward-Looking Statements     This annual report on Form 10-K contains or incorporates statements that constitute forward-looking statements. Those statements appear in a number of places in this Form 10-K and include statements regarding, among other matters, the Company's growth, acquisition, redevelopment and development opportunities, the Company's acquisition and other strategies, regulatory matters pertaining to compliance with governmental regulations and other factors affecting the Company's financial condition or results of operations. Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "projects," "predicts," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," and "should" and variations of these words and similar expressions, are used in many cases to identify these forward-looking statements. Stockholders are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of the Company or industry to vary materially from the Company's future results, performance or achievements, or those of the industry, expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Such factors include the matters described herein and the following factors among others: general industry, economic and business conditions, which will, among other things, affect demand for retail space or retail goods, availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants, tenant bankruptcies, lease rates and terms, availability and cost of financing, interest rate fluctuations and operating expenses; adverse changes in the real estate markets including,    Macerich 2002 Financial Statements     29         among other things, competition from other companies, retail formats and technologies, risks of real estate redevelopment, development, acquisitions and dispositions; governmental actions and initiatives (including legislative and regulatory changes); environmental and safety requirements; and terrorist activities that could adversely affect all of the above factors. The Company will not update any forward-looking information to reflect actual results or changes in the factors affecting the forward-looking information.    Statement on Critical Accounting Policies     The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") recently issued disclosure guidance for "critical accounting policies." The SEC defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.    Some of these estimates and assumptions include judgements on revenue recognition, estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals, provisions for uncollectable accounts, impairment of long-lived assets and estimates for environmental matters. The Company's significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the SEC definition.    Revenue Recognition:     Minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related lease. The difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the "straight lining of rent adjustment." Currently, 22% of the mall and freestanding leases contain provisions for CPI rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease. The Company believes that using CPI increases, rather than fixed contractual rent increases, results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases. Percentage rents are recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 101. Recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.    Property:     Costs related to the development, redevelopment, construction and improvement of properties are capitalized. Interest incurred or imputed on development, redevelopment and construction projects are capitalized until construction is substantially complete.    Maintenance and repairs expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Costs for major replacements and betterments, which includes HVAC equipment, roofs, parking lots, etc. are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Realized gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings.    30       Macerich 2002 Financial Statements          Property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:          Buildings and improvements     5-40 years    Tenant improvements     initial term of related lease    Equipment and furnishings     5-7 years          The Company accounts for all acquisitions entered into subsequent to June 30, 2001 in accordance with SFAS 141. The Company will determine a fair value for assets and liabilities acquired, which generally consist of land, buildings, acquired in-place leases and debt. Acquired in-place leases are valued based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in-place rates over the remaining lease term. The fair value of debt is determined based upon the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates for similar debt and the face value of the debt over the remaining term of the debt.     When the Company acquires real estate properties, the Company allocates the components of these acquisitions using relative fair values computed using its estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions impact the amount of costs allocated between land and different categories of land improvements as well as the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions. These allocations also impact depreciation expense and gains or losses recorded on future sales of properties.    The Company assesses whether there has been an impairment in the value of its long-lived assets by considering factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. Such factors include the tenants' ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases. The Company may recognize an impairment loss if the income stream is not sufficient to cover its investment. Such a loss would be determined as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a center.    Deferred Charges:     Costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight-line method. Cost relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The range of the terms of the agreements are as follows:          Deferred lease costs     1-15 years    Deferred financing costs     1-15 years          Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:     Debt guarantees:     The Company has an ownership interest in a number of joint ventures as detailed in Note 3 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. The Company accounts for those investments using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Company as "Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and the Management Companies." A pro rata share of the mortgage debt on these properties is shown in Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. In addition, the    Macerich 2002 Financial Statements     31         following joint ventures also have debt that could become recourse debt to the Company or its subsidiaries, in excess of its pro rata share, should the partnership be unable to discharge the obligations of the related debt:       Asset/Property       Maximum amount of debt  principal that could be  recourse to the Company       Maturity Date         Boulevard Shops     $9,648     1/1/2004    Chandler Festival     16,101     4/27/2004    Chandler Gateway     14,752     9/20/2004    Shops at Gainey Village     22,684     4/26/2004       Total     $63,185                Additionally, as of December 31, 2002, the Company has obtained $7.2 million in letters of credit guaranteeing performance by the Company of certain obligations relating to the Centers. The Company does not believe that these letters of credit will result in a liability to the Company.    32       Macerich 2002 Financial Statements         The following table reflects the Company's acquisitions in 2002. There were no acquisitions in 2001 or 2000.       Property/Entity       Date Acquired       Location         The Oaks     June 10, 2002     Thousand Oaks, California    Westcor Realty Limited Partnership     July 26, 2002     Nine regional and super-regional malls in Phoenix and Colorado and 18 urban villages or community centers. The aggregate gross leaseable area was approximately 14.1 million square feet. Additionally, the portfolio included two retail properties under development, as well as rights to over 1,000 acres of undeveloped land.           The financial statements include the results of these above properties/entities for periods subsequent to their acquisition.    On September 30, 2000, Manhattan Village, a 551,847 square foot, regional shopping center, which was owned 10% by the Operating Partnership, was sold. The joint venture sold the property for $89.0 million, including a note receivable from the buyer for $79.0 million at a fixed interest rate of 8.75% payable monthly, until its maturity date of September 30, 2001. On December 28, 2001, the note receivable was paid down by $5.0 million and the maturity date was extended to September 30, 2002 at a new fixed interest rate of 9.50%. On July 2, 2002, the note receivable of $74.0 million was paid off in full.    On December 14, 2001, Villa Marina Marketplace, a 448,262 square foot community shopping center located in Marina del Rey, California, a wholly-owned property of the Company, was sold. The center was sold for approximately $99.0 million, including the assumption of the existing mortgage of $58.0 million, which resulted in a $24.7 million gain. The Company used approximately $26 million of the net proceeds from this sale to retire $25.7 million of its outstanding convertible subordinated debentures due December 2002. The remaining balance of the proceeds was used for general corporate purposes.    On March 19, 2002, the Company sold Boulder Plaza, a 159,238 square foot community center in Boulder, Colorado for $24.7 million. The proceeds from the sale were used for general corporate purposes.    On June 10, 2002, the Company acquired The Oaks, a 1.1 million square foot super-regional mall in Thousand Oaks, California. The total purchase price was $152.5 million and was funded with $108.0 million of debt, bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.15%, placed concurrently with the acquisition. The balance of the purchase price was funded by cash and borrowings under the Company's line of credit.    On July 26, 2002, the Operating Partnership acquired Westcor Realty Limited Partnership and its affiliated companies ("Westcor"). The total purchase price was approximately $1.475 billion including the assumption of $733 million in existing debt and the issuance of approximately $72 million of convertible preferred operating partnership units at a price of $36.55 per unit.     Macerich 2002 Financial Statements     33           Additionally, $18.9 million of partnership units of Westcor Realty Limited Partnership were issued to limited partners of Westcor which, subject to certain conditions, can be converted on a one for one basis into operating partnership units of the Operating Partnership. The balance of the purchase price was paid in cash which was provided primarily from the $380.0 Interim Credit Facility with a term of six months plus two six-month extension options bearing interest at an average rate of LIBOR plus 3.25% and the $250.0 million Term Loan with a maturity of three years with two one-year extension options and with an interest rate ranging from LIBOR plus 2.75% to LIBOR plus 3.00% depending on the Company's overall leverage level.    On November 8, 2002, the Company purchased its joint venture partner's interest in Panorama City Associates, which owns Panorama Mall in Panorama, California. The purchase price was approximately $23.7 million.    On December 24, 2002, the former Montgomery Wards site at Pacific View Mall in Ventura, California was sold for approximately $15.4 million. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay a portion of the Term Loan.      A portion of the Westcor portfolio are joint ventures and the properties are reflected using the equity method of accounting. The results of these acquisitions are reflected in the consolidated results of operations of the Company in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures and the management companies.    Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred due to the acquisition of The Oaks and the Westcor portfolio during 2002. Many factors impact the Company's ability to acquire additional properties, including the availability and cost of capital, the Company's overall debt to market capitalization level, interest rates and the availability of potential acquisition targets that meet the Company's criteria. Crossroads Mall-Boulder, Parklane Mall and Queens Center are currently under redevelopment and are referred to herein as the "Redevelopment Centers." All other Centers, excluding the Redevelopment Centers and the two development properties, are referred to herein as the "Same Centers," unless the context otherwise requires.    Revenues include rents attributable to the accounting practice of straight-lining of rents which requires rent to be recognized each year in an amount equal to the average rent over the term of the lease, including fixed rent increases over that period. The amount of straight-lined rents, included in consolidated revenues, recognized in 2002 was $1.2 million compared to ($0.1) million in 2001 and $0.9 million in 2000. Additionally, the Company recognized through equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures, $2.3 million as its pro rata share of straight-lined rents from joint ventures in 2002 compared to $1.4 million in 2001 and $2.2 million in 2000. These variances resulted from the Company structuring the majority of its new leases using annual Consumer Price Index ("CPI") increases, which generally do not require straight-lining treatment and are offset by increases of $2.8 million relating to the acquisitions of The Oaks and Westcor portfolio during 2002. Currently, 22% of the mall and freestanding leases contain provisions for CPI rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease. The Company believes that using CPI increases, rather than fixed contractual rent increases, results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases.    The Company's historical growth in revenues, net income and Funds From Operations have been closely tied to the acquisition and redevelopment of shopping centers. Many factors, including the    34       Macerich 2002 Financial Statements          availability and cost of capital, the Company's total amount of debt outstanding, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect the Company's ability to acquire and redevelop additional properties in the future. The Company may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected in terms of achieving the anticipated financial and operating results. Increased competition for acquisitions may impact adversely the Company's ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. Expenses arising from the Company's efforts to complete acquisitions, redevelop properties or increase its market penetration may have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the following describes some of the other significant factors that may impact the Company's future results of operations.    General Factors Affecting the Centers; Competition:     Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of the Centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to the Company and the Company's stockholders. Income from shopping center properties may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: the national economic climate; the regional and local economy (which may be adversely impacted by plant closings, industry slowdowns, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist activities, and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the shopping center; and increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). A significant percentage of the Centers are located in California and the Westcor centers are concentrated in Arizona. To the extent that economic or other factors affect California or Arizona (or their respective regions generally) more severely than other areas of the country, the negative impact on the Company's economic performance could be significant. There are numerous shopping facilities that compete with the Centers in attracting tenants to lease space, and an increasing number of new retail formats and technologies other than retail shopping centers that compete with the Centers for retail sales (see "Business-Competition"). Increased competition could adversely affect the Company's revenues. Income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by such factors as applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws (see "Business-Environmental Matters"), interest rate levels and the availability and cost of financing.    Dependence on Tenants:     The Company's revenues and funds available for distribution would be adversely affected if a significant number of the Company's lessees were unable (due to poor operating results, bankruptcy, terrorist activities or other reasons) to meet their obligations, if the Company were unable to lease a significant amount of space in the Centers on economically favorable terms, or if for any reason, the Company were unable to collect a significant amount of rental payments. A decision by a department store or another significant tenant to cease operations at a Center could also have an adverse effect on the Company. In addition, mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, dispositions or bankruptcies in the retail industry could result in the loss of tenants at one or more Centers. (See "Business-Bankruptcy and/or Closure of Retail Stores.") Furthermore, if the store sales of retailers operating in the Centers were to decline sufficiently, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event of a default by a lessee, the Center may also experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor.    Macerich 2002 Financial Statements     35          Real Estate Development Risks:     Through the Company's acquisition of Westcor, its business strategy has expanded to include the selective development and construction of retail properties. Any development, redevelopment and construction activities that the Company undertakes will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. Furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable. Real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. If any of the above events occur, the ability to pay distributions and service the Company's indebtedness could be adversely affected.    Assets and Liabilities     Total assets increased to $3.7 billion at December 31, 2002 compared to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2001 and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2000. During that same period, total liabilities were $1.6 billion in 2000 and $1.6 billion in 2001 and increased to $2.4 billion in 2002. These changes were primarily a result of the acquisitions of The Oaks and Westcor portfolio in 2002 and various debt and equity transactions.     Recent Developments     A. Acquisitions     On June 10, 2002, the Company acquired The Oaks, a 1.1 million square foot super-regional mall in Thousand Oaks, California. The total purchase price was $152.5 million and was funded with $108.0 million of debt, bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.15%, placed concurrently with the acquisition. The balance of the purchase price was funded by cash and borrowings under the Company's line of credit.    On July 26, 2002, the Operating Partnership acquired Westcor Realty Limited Partnership and its affiliated companies ("Westcor"). Prior to this acquisition, Westcor was a privately-owned, fully integrated real estate operating company headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona. Westcor historically focused on the development, ownership and management of regional malls and the complementary community shopping center or "urban village" properties that surround regional malls. Substantially all of Westcor's portfolio had been developed from the ground up.    Westcor's portfolio included nine regional and super-regional malls, including the Scottsdale Fashion Square and Chandler Fashion Center in the Phoenix area and FlatIron Crossing in Colorado's Denver-Boulder area and 18 urban villages or community centers. The aggregate gross leaseable area in this portfolio was approximately 14.1 million square feet in Arizona and Colorado. In addition, the portfolio included two retail properties under development, as well as rights to over 1,000 acres of undeveloped land. A total of ten of these properties are wholly-owned and 19 are joint venture interests. The total purchase price was approximately $1.475 billion including the assumption of $733 million in existing debt and the issuance of approximately $72 million of convertible preferred operating partnership units at a price of $36.55 per unit. Additionally, $18.9 million of partnership units of Westcor Realty Limited Partnership were issued to limited partners of Westcor which, subject to certain conditions, can be converted on a one for one basis into operating partnership units of the Operating Partnership. The balance of the purchase price was paid in cash which was provided primarily from the $380.0 million Interim Credit Facility and the $250.0 million Term Loan.    36       Macerich 2002 Financial Statements       NAME="page_dq1226_1_37">      B. Equity Offerings     On February 28, 2002, the Company issued 1,968,957 common shares with total net proceeds of $52.3 million. The proceeds from the sale of the common shares were used principally to finance a portion of the Queens Center expansion and redevelopment project described below under "D. Redevelopment and Development Activity" and for general corporate purposes.     On November 27, 2002, the Company issued 15.2 million common shares with total net proceeds of $420.3 million. The proceeds of the offering were used to pay off the $380.0 million Interim Credit Facility and a portion of other acquisition related debt incurred under the Term Loan, and the Company's revolving credit facility.    C. Refinancings     In July 2002, to finance a portion of the Westcor acquisition, the Company entered into the $380 million Interim Credit Facility bearing interest at an average interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.25% with a term of six months plus two six-month extension options and a $250 million Term Loan with an interest rate ranging from LIBOR plus 2.75% to LIBOR plus 3%, depending on the Company's overall leverage level, with a maturity of three years with two one-year extension options. At the same time, the Company replaced the existing $200 million revolving credit facility with a new $425 million revolving credit facility. This increased revolving credit facility has a three-year term plus a one-year extension option. The interest rate fluctuates from LIBOR plus 1.75% to LIBOR plus 3.00% depending on the Company's overall leverage level. The Company used a portion of this new revolving credit facility to retire all of the outstanding 7.25% convertible subordinated debentures, which matured on December 15, 2002.    On October 21, 2002, the Company refinanced an existing loan at the recently-acquired Chandler Fashion Center, a super-regional mall in Chandler, Arizona with approximately 1.3 million square feet of gross leasable area. The new loan of $184 million has a fixed interest rate of 5.48% and matures in November 2012. The Company used a portion of the new loan proceeds to repay a $150 million floating rate construction loan that was scheduled to mature on December 28, 2002 and the balance to repay a portion of the Interim Credit Facility.    D. Redevelopment and Development Activity     Macy's opened a 102,000 square foot store at Capitola Mall in California on May 3, 2002.    At Queens Center, the redevelopment and expansion continued with the ground breaking in June 2002. The project will increase the size of the center from 623,278 square feet to approximately 1 million square feet. Completion is planned in phases starting in 2004 with stabilization expected in 2005.    At Lakewood Mall, Target commenced building a two-level Target store in the location formerly occupied by Montgomery Ward. Target's opening is scheduled for Fall 2003.    At Redmond Town Center, Bon Marche began construction of a new department store scheduled to open in Fall 2003.    At Southern Hills Mall, construction commenced for the addition of a new 60,000 square foot Scheel's sporting goods store and a Barnes and Noble store scheduled to open in 2003.    Macerich 2002 Financial Statements     37          In the third quarter of 2002, construction began at Scottsdale 101, a 629,000 square foot power center in north Phoenix and construction also commenced at La Encantada, a 253,972 square foot specialty center in Tucson, Arizona. Stabilization is projected to occur for both projects in 2004.    During October 2002, Macy's opened a 236,000 square foot store becoming the fifth department store at the dominant super regional mall, Scottsdale Fashion Square.     E. Other Events     On March 19, 2002, the Company sold Boulder Plaza, a 159,238 square foot community center in Boulder, Colorado for $24.7 million. The proceeds from the sale were used for general corporate purposes.    On November 8, 2002, the Company purchased its joint venture partner's interest in Panorama City Associates, which owns Panorama Mall in Panorama, California. The purchase price was approximately $23.7 million.    On December 24, 2002, the former Montgomery Ward site at Pacific View Mall in Ventura, California was sold for approximately $15.4 million. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay a portion of the Term Loan.    On January 2, 2003, the Company sold its 67% interest in Paradise Village Gateway, a 296,153 square foot Phoenix area urban village, for approximately $29.4 million. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay a portion of the Term Loan.    Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001     Revenues     Minimum and percentage rents increased by 15.6% to $245.4 million in 2002 from $212.2 million in 2001. Approximately $7.5 million of the increase is attributed to the Same Centers primarily due to releasing space at higher rents, $7.1 million of the increase relates to the acquisition of The Oaks, $0.7 million relates to the Company acquiring 50% of its joint venture partner's interest in Panorama and $28.3 million relates to the Westcor portfolio. This is offset by a $9.9 million decrease relating to the sale of Villa Marina Marketplace in 2001 and a $1.8 million decrease relating to the Redevelopment Centers.    On July 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141"). SFAS 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations for which the date of acquisition is after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 also establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets such as acquired in-place leases. The Company has determined that the impact of SFAS 141 on acquisitions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2002 was to recognize an additional $1.1 million of consolidated revenue which is included in minimum rents.     Tenant recoveries increased to $121.5 million in 2002 from $108.7 million in 2001. Approximately $4.1 million of the increase is attributable to the acquisition of The Oaks, $10.3 million relates to the Westcor portfolio and $0.5 million relates to the Same Centers. This is partially offset by $2.8 million relating to decreases from the sale of Villa Marina Marketplace.    38       Macerich 2002 Financial Statements          Expenses     Shopping center and operating expenses increased to $129.4 million in 2002 compared to $110.3 million in 2001. The increase is a result of $5.0 million of increased property taxes, insurance and other recoverable and non-recoverable expenses at the Same Centers. Additionally, effective March 29, 2001, the Macerich Property Management Company merged with and into Macerich Property Management Company, LLC ("MPMC, LLC"). Expenses for MPMC, LLC for periods commencing March 29, 2001, are now consolidated and represent $1.2 million of the change. Prior to March 29, 2001, MPMC, LLC was an unconsolidated entity accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Oaks accounted for $4.2 million of the increase in expenses, $10.9 million of the increase related to Westcor and $0.7 million relates to the Redevelopment Centers. These increases are offset by decreases of approximately $2.9 million related to the sale of Villa Marina Marketplace.    REIT general and administrative expenses increased to $8.3 million in 2002 from $6.8 million in 2001, primarily due to increases in professional services, travel expenses and stock-based compensation expense.    Interest Expense     Interest expense increased to $122.9 million in 2002 from $109.6 million in 2001.    Approximately $18.4 million of the increase is related to the debt from the Westcor transaction and $1.8 million from the acquisition of The Oaks. This increase is offset by decreases of approximately $4.0 million related to the sale of Villa Marina Marketplace and approximately $0.9 million related to the payoff of debt in 2001. In addition, the interest expense relating to the debentures paid off in December 2002 reduced interest expense by $2.3 million in 2002 compared to 2001. Capitalized interest was $7.8 million in 2002, up from $5.7 million in 2001.    Depreciation and Amortization     Depreciation and amortization increased to $78.7 million in 2002 from $65.6 million in 2001. Approximately $3.6 million relates to additional capital costs at the Same Centers, $2.3 million relates to the acquisition of The Oaks and $7.6 million relates to Westcor. This increase is offset by a decrease of $2.3 million from the sale of Villa Marina Marketplace.    Minority Interest     The minority interest represents the 24.7% weighted average interest of the Operating Partnership that was not owned by the Company during 2002. This compares to 24.8% not owned by the Company during 2001.    Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Macerich Management Companies     The income from unconsolidated joint ventures and the Macerich Management Companies was $43.0 million for 2002, compared to income of $32.9 million in 2001. Income from the Macerich Management Companies increased by $1.3 million primarily due to MPMC, LLC being consolidated effective March 29, 2001. SDG Macerich Properties, LP income increased by $3.1 million primarily due to lower interest expense on floating rate debt. Pacific Premier Retail Trust's income increased by $3.4 million primarily due to a $2.3 million gain on sale of a portion of land at Redmond Town Center in 2002 and approximately $1.1 million relating to increases in minimum and percentage rents. Additionally, $10.1 million was attributed to the acquisition of the Westcor portfolio which included $0.8 million of revenue relating to SFAS 141. These increases are    Macerich 2002 Financial Statements     39         offset by $10.2 million of loss from the write-down of the Company's investment in MerchantWired, LLC.    Discontinued Operations     The 2002 gain of $26.1 million was a result of the Company selling Boulder Plaza and recognizing a $13.9 million gain on March 19, 2002, and the Company recognizing a gain of $12.2 million as a result of the Company selling the former Montgomery Ward site at Pacific View Mall.     Gain (loss) on Sale or Write-Down of Assets     A loss of $3.8 million in 2002 compares to a gain of $24.5 million in 2001. Approximately $3.0 million of the loss in 2002 represents the write-down of assets from the Company's various technology investments compared to a gain on sale of assets of $24.5 million in 2001 as a result of the Company selling Villa Marina Marketplace on December 14, 2001.    Extraordinary Loss from Early Extinguishment of Debt     In 2002, the Company recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of $3.6 million compared to $2.0 million in 2001.     Net Income Available to Common Stockholders     Primarily as a result of the sales of Boulder Plaza and the former Montgomery Ward site at Pacific View Mall, the purchase of The Oaks, the Westcor transaction, the income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and the foregoing results, net income available to common stockholders increased to $61.0 million in 2002 from $58.0 million in 2001.    Operating Activities     Cash flow from operations was $206.2 million in 2002 compared to $140.5 million in 2001. The increase is primarily due to the Westcor transaction, acquisition of The Oaks, consolidating the results of MPMC, LLC effective March 29, 2001, and increased net operating income at the Centers as mentioned above.    Investing Activities     Cash used in investing activities was $918.3 million in 2002 compared to cash used in investing activities of $57.3 million in 2001. The change resulted primarily from the Westcor transaction, the acquisition of The Oaks and the write-down of assets of $10.2 million relating to MerchantWired, LLC, which is reflected in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures. These decreases are offset by the net cash proceeds received of $15.3 million in 2002 from the sales of Boulder Plaza and the former Montgomery Wards site at Pacific View Mall.    Financing Activities     Cash flow provided by financing activities was $739.1 million in 2002 compared to cash flow used in financing activities of $93.0 million in 2001. The change resulted primarily from the new debt from the Westcor transaction, the $471.9 million of net proceeds from the 2002 equity offerings, the financing of The Oaks in 2002 and the refinancing of Centers in 2001.    Funds From Operations      Primarily because of the factors mentioned above, Funds from OperationsDiluted increased 18.3% to $207.1 million in 2002 from $175.1 million in 2001.    40       Macerich 2002 Financial Statements         Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000     Revenues     Minimum and percentage rents increased by 3.2% to $212.2 million in 2001 from $205.6 million in 2000. Approximately $4.4 million of the increase is attributed to the Same Centers primarily due to releasing space at higher rents and $1.9 million of the increase relates to the Redevelopment Centers primarily due to the recently completed redevelopment at Pacific View Mall. This is partially offset by $0.2 million relating to the sale of Villa Marina Marketplace.    Tenant recoveries increased to $108.7 million in 2001 from $103.6 million in 2000 due to increased recoverable shopping center and operating expenses. Approximately $5.0 million of the increase is attributable to the Same Centers and $0.4 million of the increase relates to the Redevelopment Centers. This is partially offset by $0.3 million relating to decreases from the sale of Villa Marina Marketplace.    Other income increased to $11.5 million in 2001 from $8.2 million in 2000. This increase related primarily from parking fees, investment income and new business initiatives such as advertising revenue and preferred vendor income.    Expenses     Shopping center and operating expenses increased to $110.3 million in 2001 compared to $101.1 million in 2000. The increase is a result of $3.2 million of increased property taxes, insurance and other recoverable expenses at the Centers and approximately $0.9 million relates to increases in bad debt expense and legal fees at the Centers. Additionally, effective March 29, 2001, the Macerich Property Management Company merged with and into Macerich Property Management Company, LLC ("MPMC, LLC"). Expenses for MPMC, LLC for periods commencing March 29, 2001, are now consolidated and represented $5.0 million of the change. Prior to March 29, 2001, MPMC, LLC was an unconsolidated entity accounted for using the equity method of accounting.    REIT general and administrative expenses increased to $6.8 million in 2001 from $5.5 million in 2000 primarily due to marking to market the stock-based incentive plans.    Interest Expense     Interest expense increased to $109.6 million in 2001 from $108.4 million in 2000. Capitalized interest was $5.7 million in 2001, down from $7.2 million in 2000 primarily due to the reduction of capitalized interest at the recently redeveloped Pacific View Mall.    Depreciation and Amortization     Depreciation and amortization increased to $65.6 million in 2001 from $61.3 million in 2000. Approximately $1.4 million of the increase is due to greater depreciation at Pacific View, which recently completed an $89.0 million redevelopment and $3.0 million relates to additional capital costs at the Same Centers.    Minority Interest     The minority interest represents the 24.8% weighted average interest of the Operating Partnership that was not owned by the Company during 2001. This compares to 24.3% not owned by the Company during 2000.    Macerich 2002 Financial Statements     41         Income From Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Management Companies     The income from unconsolidated joint ventures and the Management Companies was $32.9 million for 2001, compared to income of $30.3 million in 2000. A total of $0.6 million of the increase is attributable to the Pacific Premier Retail Trust portfolio and $2.6 million is attributable to the SDG Macerich Properties, L.P. portfolio. Additionally, income from the Management Companies increased by $3.0 million primarily due to MPMC, LLC being consolidated effective March 29, 2001. These increases are partially offset by $2.8 million of additional loss as a result of the Company's investment in MerchantWired, LLC compared to 2000.    Gain (loss) on Sale of Assets     A gain of $24.5 million in 2001 compares to a loss of $2.8 million in 2000. The 2001 gain was a result of the Company selling Villa Marina Marketplace on December 14, 2001.    Extraordinary Loss from Early Extinguishment of Debt      In 2001, the Company recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of $2.0 million which was a result of write offs of unamortized financing costs, compared to the write off of $0.3 million of unamortized financing costs in 2000.    Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle     A charge of $1.0 million in 2000 was recorded as a result of implementation of SAB 101 at January 1, 2000.    Net Income Available to Common Stockholders      Primarily as a result of the sale of Villa Marina Marketplace and the foregoing results, net income available to common stockholders increased to $58.0 million in 2001 from $38.0 million in 2000.    Operating Activities     Cash flow from operations was $140.5 million in 2001 compared to $121.2 million in 2000. The increase is primarily due to consolidating the results of MPMC, LLC effective March 29, 2001 and increased net operating income at the Centers as mentioned above.    Investing Activities     Cash used in investing activities was $57.3 million in 2001 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $2.1 million in 2000. The change resulted primarily from $24.0 million of increased property improvements, renovations and expansion of Centers, tenant allowances and deferred leasing charges in 2001 compared to 2000. Additionally, joint venture distributions in 2001 were $70.2 million less than 2000 due to the distribution of proceeds in 2000 from the additional debt placed on the SDG Macerich Properties, L.P. portfolio. These decreases are offset by the net cash proceeds received of $39.7 million in 2001 from the sale of Villa Marina Marketplace.    Financing Activities      Cash flow used in financing activities was $93.0 million in 2001 compared to cash flow used in financing activities of $127.5 million in 2000. The change resulted primarily from the refinancing of Centers in 2001.    Funds From Operations     Primarily because of the factors mentioned above, Funds from OperationsDiluted increased 4.7% to $175.1 million in 2001 from $167.2 million in 2000.    42       Macerich 2002 Financial Statements       NAME="page_ds1226_1_43">        Liquidity and Capital Resources     The Company intends to meet its short term liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations, working capital reserves, property secured borrowings and borrowing under the new revolving line of credit. The Company anticipates that revenues will continue to provide necessary funds for its operating expenses and debt service requirements, and to pay dividends to stockholders in accordance with REIT requirements. The Company anticipates that cash generated from operations, together with cash on hand, will be adequate to fund capital expenditures which will not be reimbursed by tenants, other than non-recurring capital expenditures. The following table summarizes capital expenditures incurred at the Centers, including the pro rata share of joint ventures, for the twelve months ending December 31,:       (Dollars in Millions)            2002       2001       2000         Acquisitions of property and equipment     $1,661.2     $20.7     $6.7    Development, redevelopment and expansion of Centers     65.2     43.1     48.8    Renovations of Centers     6.9     14.6     15.8    Tenant allowances     16.0     16.4     8.3    Deferred leasing charges     16.5     13.9     12.8          Total     $1,765.8     $108.7     $92.4          Management expects similar levels to be incurred in future years for tenant allowances and deferred leasing charges and to incur between $200 million to $300 million in 2003 for development, redevelopment, expansion and renovations, excluding the Queens Center expansion and the developments of La Encantada and Scottsdale 101 which will be separately financed as described below. Capital for major expenditures or major developments and redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be, obtained from equity or debt financings which include borrowings under the Company's line of credit and construction loans. However, many factors impact the Company's ability to access capital, such as its overall debt level, interest rates, interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions.    On February 28, 2002, the Company issued 1,968,957 common shares with total net proceeds of $52.3 million. The proceeds from the sale of the common shares were used principally to finance a portion of the Queens Center expansion and redevelopment project and for general corporate purposes. The Queens Center expansion and redevelopment is anticipated to cost between $250 million and $275 million. The Company has a $225 million construction loan which converts to a permanent loan at completion and stabilization, which is collateralized by the Queens Center property, to finance the remaining project costs. Construction began in the second quarter of 2002 with completion estimated to be, in phases, through late 2004 and stabilization expected in 2005.    The Company has obtained a construction loan for $51.0 million for the development of La Encantada and the Company has negotiated a $54.0 million construction loan for the Scottsdale 101 development which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2003.    The Company believes that it will have access to the capital necessary to expand its business in accordance with its strategies for growth and maximizing Funds from Operations. The Company presently intends to obtain additional capital necessary for these purposes through a combination of debt or equity financings, joint ventures and the sale of non-core assets. The Company believes joint    Macerich 2002 Financial Statements     43          venture arrangements have in the past and may in the future provide an attractive alternative to other forms of financing, whether for acquisitions or other business opportunities.    The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness at December 31, 2002 was $3.4 billion (including its pro rata share of joint venture debt). This equated to a debt to Total Market Capitalization (defined as total debt of the Company, including its pro rata share of joint venture debt, plus aggregate market value of outstanding shares of common stock, assuming full conversion of OP Units and preferred stock into common stock) ratio of approximately 59.6% at December 31, 2002. The majority of the Company's debt consists of fixed-rate conventional mortgages payable collateralized by individual properties.    The Company has filed a shelf registration statement, effective June 6, 2002, to sell securities. The shelf registration is for a total of $1.0 billion of common stock, common stock warrant or common stock rights. The Company sold a total of 15.2 million shares of common stock under this shelf registration on November 27, 2002. The aggregate offering price of this transaction was approximately $440.2 million, leaving approximately $559.8 million available under the shelf registration statement.    The Company had a credit facility of $200.0 million with a maturity of July 26, 2002 with a right to extend the facility for one year subject to certain conditions. On July 26, 2002, concurrent with the closing of Westcor, the Company replaced this $200.0 million credit facility with a new $425.0 million revolving line of credit. This increased revolving line of credit has a three-year term plus a one-year extension. The interest rate fluctuates from LIBOR plus 1.75% to LIBOR plus 3.00% depending on the Company's overall leverage level. As of December 31, 2002, $344.0 million was outstanding at an average interest rate of 4.72%.    The Company had $125.1 million of convertible subordinated debentures (the "Debentures") which matured December 15, 2002. On December 13, 2002, the Debentures were repaid in full, using the Company's revolving credit facility.    At December 31, 2002, the Company had cash and cash equivalents available of $53.6 million.    Funds From Operations   The Company believes that an important measure of its performance is Funds From Operations ("FFO"). FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") to be: Net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring, sales or write-down of assets and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, plus depreciation and amortization (excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis. In calculating its FFO, the Company also excluded $1.9 million, including the pro rata share of joint ventures of $0.8 million, of minimum rent recognized in 2002 pursuant to SFAS No. 141. FFO does not represent cash flow from operations, as defined by GAAP, and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. FFO, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts.

Weighted average number of shares includes the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999 and 1998 assuming the conversion of all outstanding OP Units and Westcor partnership units. As of December 31, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999 and 1998, 13.7 million, 11.2 million, 11.2 million, 11.0 million and 12.3 million of OP Units and Westcor partnership units were outstanding, respectively.   (2)  The computation of FFOdiluted and diluted average number of shares outstanding includes the effect of outstanding common stock options and restricted stock using the treasury method. The convertible debentures were dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999 and were included in the FFO calculation. The convertible debentures were anti-dilutive for the year ended December 31, 1998 and were not included in the FFO calculation. On February 25, 1998, the Company sold $100 million of its Series A Preferred Stock. On June 16, 1998, the Company sold $150 million of its Series B Preferred Stock. The preferred stock can be converted on a one-for-one basis for common stock. The preferred shares are assumed converted for purposes of 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999 and 1998 FFO-diluted as they are dilutive to that calculation.    Included in minimum rents were rents attributable to the accounting practice of straight-lining of rents. The amount of straight-lining of rents, including the Company's pro rata share from joint ventures, that impacted minimum rents was $3.4 million for 2002, $1.3 million for 2001, $3.1 million for 2000, $5.0 million for 1999 and $5.0 million for 1998. The increase in straight-lining of rents in 2002 compared to 2001 is related to the acquisition of The Oaks and the Westcor portfolio in 2002. These are offset by decreases due to the Company structuring its new leases using rent increases tied to the change in CPI rather than using contractually fixed rent increases.    Macerich 2002 Financial Statements     45          Inflation   In the last three years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most of the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on increases in the CPI. In addition, about 7%-12% of the leases expire each year, which enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. Additionally, most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses. This reduces the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.    Seasonality   The shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels. In addition, shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter. As a result of the above and the implementation of Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter of each year.    New Pronouncements Issued     As a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") 133 on January 1, 2001, the Company recorded a transition adjustment of $7.1 million to accumulated other comprehensive income related to treasury rate lock transactions settled in prior years. The entire transition adjustment was reflected in the quarter ended March 31, 2001. The Company reclassified $1.3 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. Additionally, the Company recorded other comprehensive income of $0.3 million related to the mark to market of an interest rate swap agreement.    On July 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141"). SFAS 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations for which the date of acquisition is after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 also establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets such as acquired in-place leases. The Company has determined that the impact of SFAS 141 on acquisitions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2002 was to recognize an additional $1.9 million of revenue, including $0.8 million from the joint ventures at pro rata, and $0.2 million of depreciation expense, including $0.1 million from the joint ventures at pro rata.    In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"). SFAS 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. This statement supersedes SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of" ("SFAS 121"). SFAS 144 establishes a single accounting model, based on the framework established in SFAS 121, for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale. The Company adopted SFAS 144 on January 1, 2002. The Company sold Boulder Plaza on March 19, 2002 and in accordance with SFAS 144 the results of Boulder Plaza for the periods from January 1, 2002 to March 19, 2002 and from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2001 and January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2000 have been reclassified into "discontinued operations" on the consolidated statements of operations. Total revenues associated with Boulder Plaza was approximately $0.5 million, $2.1 million and    46       Macerich 2002 Financial Statements          $2.7 million for the periods January 1, 2002 to March 19, 2002, January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2001 and January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2000, respectively.    In May 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of SFAS Nos. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of SFAS 13, and Technical Corrections" ("SFAS 145"), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. SFAS 145 rescinds SFAS 4, SFAS 44 and SFAS 64 and amends SFAS 13 to modify the accounting for sales-leaseback transactions. SFAS 4 required the classification of gains and losses resulting from extinguishment of debt to be classified as extraordinary items. SFAS 64 amended SFAS 4 and is no longer necessary because SFAS 4 has been rescinded. The Company expects to reclassify a loss of $3.6 million, $2.0 million and $0.3 million for the years ending December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, from extraordinary items to continuing operations upon adoption of SFAS 145 on January 1, 2003.    In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. SFAS No. 146 is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, with earlier adoption encouraged. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 146 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.    In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure, and amendment of FASB Statement No. 123"("SFAS No. 148"). SFAS No. 148 amended SFAS No 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for employee stock-based compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No 123 to require prominent disclosure in annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based compensation and its effect on reported results. The disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 are included in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to the issuance of SFAS No. 148, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and will prospectively expense all stock options issued subsequent to January 1, 2002. The Company did not issue any stock options to employees in 2002.    In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," which elaborates on required disclosures by a guarantor in its financial statements about obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued and clarifies the need for a guarantor to recognize, at the inception of certain guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The Company is reviewing the provisions of this Interpretation relating to initial recognition and measurement of guarantor liabilities, which are effective for qualifying guarantees entered into or modified after December 31, 2002, but does not expect it to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.    In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entitiesan interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities, which have one or both of the following characteristics: 1) the equity investment at    Macerich 2002 Financial Statements     47          risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity, and 2) the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest. The Company has not evaluated the effect FIN 46 will have on its consolidated financial statements.    NAME="ds1226_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02669">      Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk         The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term variable rate debt through the use of interest rate caps with appropriately matching maturities, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity.     The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2002 concerning the Company's long term debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value ("FV"):       (dollars in thousands)                                    For the Years Ended December 31,                              2003       2004       2005       2006       2007       Thereafter       Total       FV         CONSOLIDATED CENTERS:                                                              Long term debt:                                                       Fixed rate     $34,826     $147,426     $27,595     $97,106     $128,815     $1,155,970     $1,591,738     $1,591,856       Average interest rate     6.93%     6.92%     6.93%     6.92%     7.06%     7.06%     6.94%            Variable rate          353,451     346,719                    700,170     700,170       Average interest rate          4.38%     4.71%                    4.33%            Total debtConsolidated Centers     $34,826     $500,877     $374,314     $97,106     $128,815     $1,155,970     $2,291,908     $2,292,026       JOINT VENTURE CENTERS:                                                              (at Company's pro rata share:)                                                       Fixed rate     $13,536     $15,020     $95,826     $99,155     $125,523     $440,352     $789,412     $788,407       Average interest rate     6.48%     6.51%     6.45%     6.43%     6.87%     6.87%     6.48%            Variable rate     100,727     138,980     187     55,012               294,906     294,906       Average interest rate     2.66%     2.80%     2.28%     2.20%               2.61%            Total debtJoint Ventures     $114,263     $154,000     $96,013     $154,167     $125,523     $440,352     $1,084,318     $1,083,313       Total debtAll Centers     $149,089     $654,877     $470,327     $251,273     $254,338     $1,596,322     $3,376,226     $3,375,339          In addition, the Company has assessed the market risk for its variable rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $9.9 million per year based on $995.1 million outstanding of variable rate debt at December 31, 2002.     The fair value of the Company's long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration.
