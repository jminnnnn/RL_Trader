Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and           Results of Operations - --------------------------------------------------------------------------      	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the  "Selected Financial Data" and the Company's Consolidated and Predecessor  Combined Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this  10-K.  General Background and Performance Measurement - ----------------------------------------------- 	The Company receives income primarily from two sources:  (1) Through its ownership of wholly-owned Centers. (2) Through its ownership interests in Joint Venture Centers which  include Panorama Mall (50%), Broadway Plaza (50%), North Valley  Plaza (50%), and West Acres Shopping Center (19%).                                                18    General Background and Performance Measurement, Continued - ---------------------------------------------------------     	The Company believes that the most significant measures of its operating  performance are Funds from Operations and EBITDA.  Funds from Operations is  defined as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding  gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of property, plus  depreciation and amortization (excluding depreciation on personal property and  amortization of loan and financial instrument costs), and after adjustments  for unconsolidated entities.  Adjustments for unconsolidated entities are  calculated on the same basis.  Funds from Operations does not represent cash  flow from operations as defined by GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of  cash available to fund all cash flow needs.        EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation,  amortization, minority interest, income in unconsolidated entities and  extraordinary items.  This data is relevant to an understanding of the  economics of the shopping center business as it indicates cash flow available  from operations to service debt and satisfy certain fixed obligations.  EBITDA  should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator  of the Company's operating performance, or to cash flows from operating  activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of  liquidity.  While the performance of individual Centers and the Management  Companies determines EBITDA, the Company's capital structure also influences  Funds from Operations.  The most important component in determining EBITDA and  Funds from Operations is Center revenues.  Center revenues consist primarily  of minimum rents, percentage rents and tenant expense recoveries. Minimum  rents will increase to the extent that new leases are signed at market rents  that are higher than prior rents.  Minimum rent will also fluctuate up or down  with changes in the occupancy level.  Additionally, to the extent that new  leases are signed with more favorable expense recovery terms, expense  recoveries will increase.      	Percentage rents generally increase or decrease with changes in tenant  sales.  As leases roll over, however, a significant portion of historical  percentage rent is often converted to minimum rent.  It is therefore common  for percentage rents to decrease as minimum rents increase.  Accordingly, in  discussing financial performance, the Company combines minimum and percentage  rents in order to better measure revenue growth.      	The following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated  financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 1996 and  1995, and for the period from March 16, 1994 (commencement of operations)  through December 31, 1994, and the combined financial statements of Macerich  Predecessor Affiliates ("Predecessor") for the period from January 1, 1994  through March 15, 1994.  The combined financial statements of the Predecessor  combine the balance sheet data and results of operations of the partnerships  that previously owned 14 of the properties and of the management and leasing  operations of the Predecessor which were contributed to the Company.  The  Predecessor is considered the predecessor entity to the Company and the  combined financial statements are presented for comparative purposes.  The  following discussion compares the activity for the year ended December 31,  1996 to results of operations for 1995.  Also included is a comparison of the  activities for the year ended December 31, 1995 to the results for the year  ended December 31, 1994, which includes a summation of the Company's and the  Predecessor's results of operations for 1994.        	This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying  consolidated and combined financial statements and notes thereto.      	On March 16, 1994 the Company acquired Crossroads Mall ("Crossroads-OK")  located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and on July 21, 1994 the Company acquired  Chesterfield Towne Center ("Chesterfield") in Richmond, Virginia.  Crossroads- OK and Chesterfield are collectively referred to herein as the "1994  Acquisition Centers".  In August, 1995, the Company acquired The Centre at  Salisbury ("Salisbury") in Salisbury, Maryland, and in December, 1995 the  Company acquired two malls, Capitola Mall ("Capitola"), in Capitola,  California, and Queens Center ("Queens"), in Queens, New York.  These  properties are known as the "1995 Acquisition Centers."  In January 1996, the  Company acquired Villa Marina Marketplace ("Villa Marina"), Valley View Mall  ("Valley View") in Dallas, Texas was acquired in October 1996 and Rimrock Mall  ("Rimrock") in Billings, Montana and Vintage Faire Mall ("Vintage Faire") in  Modesto, California were acquired in November 1996.  In December 1996 the  Company acquired Huntington Center ("Huntington") in Huntington Beach,  California, Buenaventura Mall ("Buenaventura") in Ventura, California, and  Fresno Fashion Fair ("Fresno") in Fresno, California.  These properties are  known as the "1996 Acquisition Centers."  The financial statements include the  results of the acquired properties from their acquisition dates.  As a result,  many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred  due to the addition of these properties to the Company's portfolio during  1996, 1995 and 1994.  Many factors, such as availability and cost of capital,  overall debt to market capitalization level, interest rates and availability  of potential acquisition targets that meet the Company's criteria, impact the  Company's ability to acquire additional properties.  Accordingly, management  is uncertain as to whether during 1997 and future years  there will be similar  acquisitions and corresponding increases in revenues, net income and Funds  from Operations that occurred as a result of the 1996, 1995 and 1994  acquisitions.                                           19   General Background and Performance Measurement, Continued - ---------------------------------------------------------      The bankruptcy and/or closure of retail stores, particularly Anchors,  may reduce customer traffic and cash flow generated by a Center.  During 1995,  Federated Department Stores, Inc. announced the closure of the Broadway Stores  at Panorama and Huntington Center and Weinstock's at Parklane.  The Company  acquired Weinstock's leasehold interest in 1996 and is negotiating with a  replacement.  Federated is currently negotiating with another retailer to sell  the former Panorama Broadway building.  The Huntington Center Broadway store  is being demolished and replaced with a 21 screen theater complex.  All three  stores remained closed through December 31, 1996.  The long-term closure of  these or other stores could adversely affect the Company's performance.      	In addition, the Company's success in the highly competitive real estate  shopping center business depends upon many other factors, including general  economic conditions, the ability of tenants to make rent payments, increases  or decreases in operating expenses and interest rates, occupancy levels,  changes in demographics, competition from other centers and forms of retailing  and the ability to renew leases or relet space upon the expiration or  termination of leases.  Assets and Liabilities - ----------------------     	Total assets increased to $1,187,753,000 at December 31, 1996 compared  to $763,398,000 at December 31, 1995 and $485,903,000 at December 31, 1994.   During that same period, total liabilities increased from $326,588,000 in 1994  to $509,313,000 in 1995 to $767,266,000 in 1996.  These changes were primarily  as a result of the 1996 and 1995 common stock offerings, the purchase of the  1996 Acquisition Centers and 1995 Acquisition Centers and various refinancing  and debt reduction transactions described below.  A.  Equity Offering       -------------------     	The Company had an equity offering in November, 1996 in which 5,750,000  shares were sold, raising $122.2 million of net equity, after costs of the  offering.  The use of those proceeds and timing are summarized below:      November 6, 1996 to repay the acquisition debt on Valley View Mall	     60,000,000   November 29, 1996 acquisition of Rimrock Mall and Vintage Faire Mall	   16,700,000  November 11, 1996 payoff of line of credit	                             45,500,000                                                                          	----------------                                                                Total	   122,200,000   B.  Acquisitions     ----------------     	On January 25, 1996, Villa Marina, a 447,684 square foot  entertainment/community center was acquired.  The purchase price was $80  million and included the assumption of debt of $22.5 million.        	On October 21, 1996 Valley View Mall, a 1.5 million square foot super  regional mall in Dallas, Texas was acquired.  The purchase price was $87.5  million.  Concurrent with the acquisition the Company placed $60 million of  debt on the property at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.50%.  The Company has  the option of converting this debt to fixed rate debt at any time prior to  October 1, 1997.      	On November 27, 1996, the Company purchased Rimrock and Vintage Faire.   The total purchase price was $118.2 million which included assumption of $88.4  million of debt which bears interest at an average fixed rate of 7.7%.      	On December 18, 1996, the Company acquired Huntington, Buenaventura and  Fresno.  The combined purchase price was $128.9 million and included  assumption of mortgage debt of $38.0 million and $3.8 million of other  liabilities.  C.  Refinancings and Debt Reductions     ------------------------------------     	On April 1, 1996 the mortgage debt on Crossroads-OK, Greentree Mall, and  the Centre at Salisbury was refinanced.  The total indebtedness was increased  to $117 million, from $88 million, and the average interest rate was fixed at  7.2%.                                            20  C.  Refinancings and Debt Reductions, Continued:       ------------------------------------------------      On September 30, 1996 the $65.1 million mortgage loan at Queens Center  was refinanced.  The interest rate was reduced from LIBOR plus 1.10% to LIBOR  plus 0.45%.         On December 23, 1996 the Villa Marina Marketplace mortgage debt of $22  million was paid off.         There was a $60 million loan placed on Valley View Mall concurrent with  its acquisition.  The interest rate is LIBOR plus 1.50% and the loan matures  in October 1997, but the Company can convert the loan into a fixed rate loan  that matures in October 2006.         Concurrent with the acquisition of Buenaventura Mall, Fresno Fashion  Fair and Huntington Center, a $57 million unsecured loan was obtained.  The  loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.625%.                                                     21    Results of Operations  - ---------------------    Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 1996 and 1995    ----------------------------------------------------     	Revenues      --------      Minimum and percentage rents increased by 42% to $105.2 million  from $74.1 million.  Approximately $19.0 million of the increase  resulted from the 1995 Acquisition Centers and $13.2 million resulted  from the 1996 Acquisition Centers.  These increases were partially  offset by declining rents of $1.1 million at Parklane Mall which was  adversely impacted by an anchor closure in 1996.         Tenant recoveries increased to $47.7 million in 1996 from $27  million in 1995.  The 1996 and 1995 Acquisition Centers caused $19.3  million of this increase.  Approximately $1.1 million of the increase  was due to higher recoverable expenses in 1996 compared to 1995.       Other income increased to $2.2 million in 1996 from $1.4 million  in 1995.  Approximately $1.2 million of the increase related to the 1996  and 1995 Acquisition Centers.  This increase was partially offset by  lower interest income of $0.3 million in 1996 compared to 1995.        	Expenses       --------       Shopping center expenses increased to $50.8 million in 1996  compared to $31.6 million in 1995.  Approximately $18.7 million of the  increase resulted from the 1996 and 1995 Acquisition Centers. The other  centers had a net increase of $0.5 million in shopping center expenses  of which approximately $1.1 million was for increased property taxes,  $0.5 million of increased bad debt expense, offset by a reduction in  ground rent expense of $1.3 million which resulted from the October,  1995 acquisition of land at Crossroads Mall-Boulder which had previously  been leased.          General and administrative expenses increased to $2.4 million in  1996 from $2.0 million in 1995 primarily due to increased professional  fee expense.      	Interest Expense      ----------------      Interest expense increased to $42.4 million in 1996 from $25.5  million in 1995. Interest expense attributable to County East Mall  decreased $1.2 million in 1996 due to the payoff of that debt on  December 31, 1995, also, there was a decrease of $1.3 million at  Crossroads Mall-Boulder due to a December 1995 refinancing at a  substantially lower interest rate.  These reductions partially offset  the increase of $19.1 million from the 1995 and 1996 Acquisition  Centers.       	Depreciation and Amortization       -----------------------------       Depreciation increased to $32.6 million from $25.7 million in  1995. An increase of approximately $7.6 million  related to the 1995 and  1996 Acquisition Centers. This increase was offset by a decrease of  approximately $1.4 million in amortization of financial instruments in  1996 which resulted from several financial instruments becoming fully  amortized in 1995.         	Minority Interest        -----------------       The minority interest represents the 36.7% weighted average  interest of the Operating Partnership that is not owned by the Company  during 1996.                               22         Gain (Loss) From Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Management Companies      -----------------------------------------------------------------------      The gain from unconsolidated joint ventures and the management  companies was $3.3 million for 1996, essentially the same as 1995.       	Extraordinary Loss on Early Retirement of Debt       ----------------------------------------------       In connection with the sale of an interest rate cap, the Company  wrote off unamortized financing costs of $0.3 million in 1996.  In 1995  the Company wrote off  $1.3 million of loan costs  concurrent with the  1995 refinancing of Lakewood Mall.       	Net Income       ----------       As a result of the foregoing, net income increased to $18.9  million in 1996 from $11.3 million in 1995.       	Operating Activities       -------------------        Cash flow from operations increased to $80.4 million compared to  $48.2 million in 1995.  The increase resulted from the factors discussed  above, primarily the impact of the 1995 and 1996 Acquisition Centers.       	Investing Activities       --------------------       Cash flow used in investing activities was $296.6 million in  1996 compared to a reduction of $88.4 million in 1995.  The change  resulted primarily from the seven acquisitions completed in 1996  compared to three acquisitions in 1995.       	Financing Activities       --------------------       Cash flow from financing activities increased to $216.3 million  in 1996 compared to $52.0 million in 1995.  The increase resulted from  more mortgage financing done in 1996, primarily to fund the 1996  acquisitions.       	EBITDA and Funds From Operations       --------------------------------       Due primarily to the factors mentioned above, EBITDA increased  48%, to $101.9 million in 1996 from $68.9 million in 1995 and Funds From  Operations increased 39%, to $62.4 million, from $44.9 million in 1995.                                                   23        Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 1995 and 1994     ---------------------------------------------------- 	     Revenues       --------       Minimum and percentage rents increased by 17.2% from $63,188,000  in 1994 to $74,067,000 in 1995.  The 1995 Acquisition Centers accounted  for approximately $3,407,000 of this increase and 1994 Acquisition  Centers accounted for $6,128,000 of the increase.  The primary reason  for the balance of the increase was contractual rent increases in  existing leases, and replacement of expiring leases with renewal leases  at higher minimum rents.          Tenant recoveries increased by $5,338,000 to $26,961,000 for the  year ended December 31, 1995, compared to the same period of 1994.  The  1995 Acquisition Centers accounted for $1,293,000 of this increase in  recoveries and the 1994 Acquisition Centers accounted for $3,494,000.   The balance of the increase resulted primarily from increased  recoverable expenses at the other properties.        Management fee income was $528,000 for the period from January  1, 1994 through March 15, 1994.   Prior to the IPO the Management  Companies were consolidated with the Predecessor.  Subsequent to the  IPO, the Management Companies are accounted for on the equity method and  included in income from unconsolidated joint ventures and management  companies.        Other income increased from $682,000 in 1994 to $1,441,000 in  1995.  This increase was due almost entirely to the temporary investment  of the proceeds of a common stock offering into interest bearing  investments until their ultimate use for debt repayment, acquisitions or  other corporate purposes.       	Expenses       --------       Shopping center expenses increased by $4,113,000 to $31,580,000  for 1995.  An increase of $2,989,000 was due to the 1994 Acquisition  Centers and $1,211,000 was due to the 1995 Acquisition Centers. The  increase due to the Acquisition Centers was partially offset by reduced  expense of $327,000 due to the purchase in October 1995 of a parcel of  land at Crossroads Mall-Boulder which had previously been ground leased.   In addition, real estate taxes, excluding the 1994 and 1995 Acquisition  Centers, increased by $277,000 due to reassessments.  There were no  management and leasing expenses in 1995 compared to $557,000 for 1994.   This decrease is a result of the Management Companies being accounted  for on the equity method after March 16, 1994.   General and  administrative expenses of the Company were $2,011,000 compared to  $1,545,000 during 1994.  This difference was primarily due to the  Company being operational for only nine and one-half months in 1994.       Interest Expense       ----------------      Interest expense increased by 14.8% from $22,237,000 for the  twelve months ended December 31, 1994 to $25,531,000 for 1995. This was  partially due to interest expense of $3,591,000 for the 1994 Acquisition  Centers and $710,000 for the 1995 Acquisition Centers.  There was a  reduction in same center interest expense in 1995 primarily due to the  net reduction of approximately $117,100,000 of debt in March, 1994  subsequent to the IPO.  During 1995, there was a full year of benefit  from those reductions.       	Depreciation and Amortization       -----------------------------       Depreciation increased by $3,280,000 to $25,749,000 for the  twelve months ended December 31, 1996. The 1995 Acquisition Centers  accounted for $717,000 of the difference and the Acquisition Centers  that were purchased in 1994, but depreciated for a full year in 1995,  accounted for $1,745,000. Also contributing to this increase was  $515,000 related to additional depreciation of the 1994 acquisition cost  of partnership interests.       	Minority Interest In Operating Partnership       ------------------------------------------       The minority interest in the Operating Partnership represents  the 42% weighted average interest in the Operating Partnership that is  not owned by the Company at December 31, 1995.                             24         	Gain (Loss) From Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Management Companies       -----------------------------------------------------------------------       The gain from unconsolidated joint ventures and the management  companies increased to $3,250,000 for 1995 compared to $2,784,000 for  1994.  This increase was primarily due to net income at Broadway Plaza  increasing by $1,341,000 largely resulting from the addition of 15,000  square feet of space which was completed during 1994 and reduction of  the interest expense due to a debt reduction in March, 1994.  The  Company owns a 50% joint venture interest in  Broadway Plaza.       	Extraordinary Loss on Early Retirement of Debt       ----------------------------------------------       In connection with the 1995 refinancing of mortgage debt at  Lakewood Mall, the Company wrote off unamortized financing costs of  $1,299,000 associated with the retired debt of.       	Net Income       ----------       As a result of the foregoing, net income increased by $3,565,000  in 1995 compared to 1994.       	Operating Activities       --------------------        Cash flow from operations was $44,936,000 in 1995, a 32.5%  increase over 1994, primarily due to the factors mentioned above.        	Investing Activities       --------------------       Cash was utilized in investing activities totaling ($88,413,000)  in 1995 compared to ($137,637,000) in 1994.  In 1994, cash flow was  reduced by investing activities, primarily the acquisition of property  and partnership interests concurrent with the IPO and the acquisition of  Chesterfield.  Also contributing to the decrease was $27,799,000 of  contributions to joint ventures which was primarily used to pay down  debt at the joint ventures.  During 1995, the decrease in cash flow due  to investing activities related primarily to cash expended for the 1995  Acquisition Centers.       	Financing Activities       --------------------       Financing activities reflected net cash flow of $51,973,000 in  1995, compared to $99,584,000 in 1994.  This was primarily the result of  the IPO in 1994 compared to the equity offering and refinancings in  1995.       	EBITDA and Funds From Operations       --------------------------------       Due to factors described above, EBITDA increased 22% to  $68,878,000 from $56,452,000 in 1994.  Funds from Operations increased  by 25.3% to $48,612,000 in 1995 from $38,790,000 in 1994.       Liquidity and Capital Resources      -------------------------------       The Company intends to meet its short term liquidity  requirements through cash generated from operations and working capital  reserves.  The Company anticipates that revenues will continue to  provide necessary funds for its operating expenses and debt service  requirements, and to pay dividends to stockholders in accordance with  REIT requirements.  The Company anticipates that cash generated from  operations, together with cash on hand, will be adequate to fund capital  expenditures which will not be reimbursed by tenants, other than non- recurring capital expenditures.  Capital for major expenditures or  redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be, obtained  from equity or debt financings.         The Company believes that it will have access to the capital  necessary to expand its business in accordance with its strategies for  growth and maximizing Funds from Operations.  The Company presently  intends to obtain additional capital necessary to expand its business  through a combination of additional equity offerings and debt  financings.                             25          Liquidity and Capital Resources, Continued       ------------------------------------------        The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness at December  31, 1996 was $818.0 million (including its pro rata share of joint  venture debt).  This equated to a debt to Total Market Capitalization  (defined as total debt of the Operating Partnership, including its pro  rata share of joint venture debt, plus aggregate market value of  outstanding shares of common stock, assuming full conversion of OP Units  into stock) rate of approximately 45.0% at year end.  Such debt consists  primarily of conventional mortgages payable secured by individual  properties.  See "Properties-Mortgage Debt" for a description of the  Company's outstanding indebtedness.  In connection with $65.1 million of  the Company's floating rate indebtedness, the Company has entered into  interest rate protection agreements that limit the Company's exposure to  increases in interest rates.  See "Properties-Mortgage Debt."         The Company has filed a shelf registration statement, which is  not yet effective, to sell securities.  The shelf registration is for a  total of $500 million of common stock or common stock warrants.           The Company has a line of credit up to $50 million.  There was  $12 million outstanding at December 31, 1996 and $0 outstanding at  December 31, 1995.           At December 31, 1996 the Company had cash and cash equivalents  available of $15.6 million.                                           26        	Funds From Operations       ---------------------       The Company believes that the most significant measure of its  performance is Funds from Operations ("FFO").  FFO is defined by The  National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") to be:   Net income, excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and  sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization and after  adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures.  Adjustments for  unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to  reflect FFO on the same basis.  This is herein referred to as "FFO -  Original Definition".  In May 1995, NAREIT issued a revised  interpretation of FFO.  This revised definition of FFO ("FFO - New  Definition") excludes the add back of non real estate depreciation and  amortization.  Extraordinary items and significant non-recurring events  are also excluded from FFO-New Definition.  FFO does not represent cash  flow from operations, as defined by generally accepted accounting  principles, and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund  all cash flow needs.

Substantially all the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments  periodically through the lease term.  These rent increases are either in  fixed increments or based on increases in the Consumer Price Index.  In  addition, many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years, which  enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher  base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing  market rate.  Additionally, most of the leases require the tenants to pay  their pro rata share of operating expenses.  This reduces the Company's  exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from  inflation.  New Pronouncements Issued: - -------------------------     	None.   Item 8.
