ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  GENERAL BACKGROUND AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT           The Company believes that the most significant measures of its operating performance are Funds from Operations and EBITDA. Funds from Operations is defined as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales or write-down of assets, plus depreciation and amortization (excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis. Funds from Operations does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs.           EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, minority interest, equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated entities, extraordinary items, gain (loss) on sale of assets and preferred dividends. This data is relevant to an understanding of the economics of the shopping center business as it indicates cash flow available from operations to service debt and satisfy certain fixed obligations. EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of liquidity. While the performance of individual Centers and the Management Companies determines EBITDA, the Company's capital structure also influences Funds from Operations. The most important component in determining EBITDA and Funds from Operations is Center revenues. Center revenues consist primarily of minimum rents, percentage rents and tenant expense recoveries. Minimum rents will increase to the extent that new leases are signed at market rents that are higher than prior rents. Minimum rent will also fluctuate up or down with changes in the occupancy level. Additionally, to the extent that new leases are signed with more favorable expense recovery terms, expense recoveries will increase.           Percentage rents generally increase or decrease with changes in tenant sales. As leases roll over, however, a portion of historical percentage rent is often converted to minimum rent. It is therefore common for percentage rents to decrease as minimum rents increase. Accordingly, in discussing financial performance, the Company combines minimum and percentage rents in order to better measure revenue growth.           The following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996. The following discussion compares the activity for the year ended December 31, 1998 to results of operations for 1997. Also included is a comparison of the activities for the year ended December 31, 1997 to the results for the year ended December 31, 1996. This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

The financial statements include the results of these Centers for periods subsequent to their acquisition.           Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed  below, occurred due to the addition of these properties to the portfolio  during 1998, 1997 and 1996. Many factors impact the Company's ability to  acquire additional properties including the availability and cost of capital,  overall debt to market capitalization level, interest rates and availability  of potential acquisition targets that meet the Company's criteria.  Accordingly, management is uncertain whether during the balance of 1999, and  in future years, there will be similar acquisitions and corresponding  increases in revenues, net income and Funds from Operations that occurred as  a result of the 1998, 1997 and 1996 Acquisition Centers. Pacific View  (formerly known as Buenaventura Mall), Crossroads Mall-Boulder, Huntington  Center and Parklane Mall are currently under redevelopment and are referred  to herein as the "Redevelopment Centers." All other centers are referred to  herein as the "Same Centers".           The bankruptcy and/or closure of an Anchor, or its sale to a less desirable retailer, could adversely affect customer traffic in a Center and thereby reduce the income generated by that Center. Furthermore, the closing of an Anchor could, under certain circumstances, allow certain other Anchors or other tenants to terminate their leases or cease operating their stores at the Center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the Center. During 1997, Montgomery Ward filed for bankruptcy. The Company has Montgomery Ward as an Anchor in 11 of its Centers. Montgomery Ward has indicated that it plans to cease operating at three of these locations. The Company is negotiating to recapture these locations and replace Montgomery Ward with another department store. Montgomery Ward has not yet disclosed whether they will cease to operate any of its eight remaining stores at the Centers. If Montgomery Ward ceases to operate any of its stores and the Company is unable to replace them with other tenants, it could have an adverse effect on a Center.           In addition, the Company's success in the highly competitive real estate shopping center business depends upon many other factors, including general economic conditions, the ability of tenants to make rent payments, increases or decreases in operating expenses, occupancy levels, changes in demographics, competition from other centers and forms of retailing and the ability to renew leases or relet space upon the expiration or termination of leases.                                     24   ASSETS AND LIABILITIES           Total assets increased to $2,322 million at December 31, 1998 compared to $1,505 million at December 31, 1997 and $1,188 million at December 31, 1996. During that same period, total liabilities increased from $838 million in 1996 to $1,188 million in 1997 and $1,579 million in 1998. These changes were primarily as a result of the 1996 and 1998 common stock offerings, the 1997 convertible debenture offering, the purchase of the 1998, 1997 and 1996 Acquisition Centers and related debt transactions.  A.       EQUITY OFFERINGS           The Company sold 7,920,181 shares of its common stock in six offerings during 1998, raising $203.8 million of net proceeds.           On February 25, 1998, the Company issued 3,627,131 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock for net proceeds totaling $99.0 million.           On June 17, 1998, the Company issued 5,487,471 shares of its Series B Preferred Stock for net proceeds totaling $148.5 million.           The total net proceeds from the 1998 common and preferred stock offerings totaled $451.3 million. These proceeds were used for the 1998 acquisitions, reducing borrowings under the Company's line of credit and general corporate purposes.  B.       ACQUISITIONS           On February 27, 1998, the Company, through a 50/50 joint venture with an affiliate of Simon Property Group, Inc., acquired the ERE Yarmouth portfolio of twelve regional malls. The properties in the portfolio comprise 10.7 million square feet and are located in eight states. The total purchase price was $974.5 million, which included $485.0 million of assumed debt, at market value. The Company's share of the cash component of the purchase price was funded by issuing $100.0 million of Series A Preferred Stock, $80.0 million of common stock and borrowing the balance from the Company's line of credit.           South Plains Mall was acquired on June 19, 1998. South Plains Mall is a 1,140,574 square foot super regional mall located in Lubbock, Texas. The purchase price was $115.5 million, consisting of $29.3 million of assumed debt, at fair market value, and $86.2 million of cash. The cash portion was funded with a portion of the proceeds from the Company's Series B Preferred Stock offering.           Westside Pavilion was acquired on July 1, 1998 for $170.5 million. Westside Pavilion is a 755,759 square foot regional mall located in Los Angeles, California. The purchase price was funded with a portion of the proceeds from the Company's Series B Preferred Stock offering, borrowings under the Company's line of credit and the placement of a ten year $100.0 million mortgage secured by the property.           The Village at Corte Madera is a 428,398 square foot regional mall in Corte Madera, California, which the Company acquired in two phases: (i) 40% on June 16, 1998 and (ii) the remaining 60% on July 24, 1998. In addition, Carmel Plaza, a 115,215 square foot community shopping center in Carmel, California was acquired on August 10, 1998. The combined purchase price was $165.5 million, consisting of $40.0 million of assumed debt, the issuance of $7.9 million of OP Units and $117.6 million in cash. The cash component was funded by borrowings under the Company's line of credit.           Northwest Arkansas Mall was acquired on December 15, 1998. Northwest Arkansas Mall is a 780,237 square foot regional mall located in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The purchase price of $94.0 million was funded by a concurrently placed loan of $63.0 million and borrowings of $31.0 million under the Company's line of credit.           On February 18, 1999, through a 51/49 joint venture with Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board, the Company closed on the first phase of a two phase acquisition of a portfolio of properties. The phase one closing included the acquisition of three regional malls, the retail component of a mixed-use development, five contiguous properties and two non-contiguous community shopping centers comprising approximately 3.6 million square feet for a total purchase price of approximately $427.0 million. The purchase price was funded with a $120.0 million loan placed concurrently with the closing, $140.4 million of debt from an affiliate of the seller, and $39.4 million of assumed debt. The balance of the purchase price was paid in cash. The Company's share of the cash component was funded with the proceeds from two refinancings of centers and borrowings under the Company's line of credit.                                     25   B.        ACQUISITIONS, CONTINUED:  The second phase consists of the acquisition of the office component of the mixed-use development for a purchase price of approximately $115 million. The closing of the second phase is expected to occur in May 1999.  C.       REFINANCINGS           On August 3, 1998, the Company, along with the joint venture partner, refinanced the debt secured by Broadway Plaza. The loan of $43.5 million was paid in full and a new note was issued for $75.0 million bearing interest at a fixed rate of 6.68% and maturing August 1, 2008.           On August 7, 1998, the Company refinanced the debt on Fresno Fashion Fair. A $38.0 million loan was paid in full and a new secured note was issued for $69.0 million bearing interest at a fixed rate of 6.52% and maturing August 10, 2008.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1997           REVENUES                      Minimum and percentage rents increased by 27% to $192.6          million in 1998 from $151.5 million in 1997. Approximately $18.9          million of the increase resulted from the 1997 Acquisition Centers,          $18.8 million resulted from the 1998 Acquisition Centers and $5.0          million of the increase was attributable to the Same Centers. These          increases were partially offset by revenue decreases at the          Redevelopment Centers of $1.6 million in 1998.                      Tenant recoveries increased to $86.7 million in 1998 from          $66.5 million in 1997. The 1998 and 1997 Acquisition Centers generated          $17.7 million of this increase and $2.2 million of the increase was          from the Same Centers.                      Other income increased to $4.5 million in 1998 from $3.2          million in 1997. Approximately $0.6 million of the increase related to          the 1998 and 1997 Acquisition Centers, $0.7 million of the increase was          attributable to the Same Centers and the Redevelopment Centers.           EXPENSES                      Shopping center expenses increased to $90.0 million in 1998          compared to $70.9 million in 1997. Approximately $17.3 million of the          increase resulted from the 1998 and 1997 Acquisition Centers. The other          Centers had a net increase of $1.8 million in shopping center expenses          resulting primarily from increased property taxes and recoverable          expenses.                      General and administrative expenses increased to $4.4          million in 1998 from $2.8 million in 1997 primarily due to the          accounting change required by EITF 97-11, "Accounting for Internal          Costs Relating to Real Estate Property Acquisitions," which requires          the expensing of internal acquisition costs. Previously in accordance          with GAAP, certain internal acquisition costs were capitalized. The          increase is also attributable to higher executive and director          compensation expense.            INTEREST EXPENSE                      Interest expense increased to $91.4 million in 1998 from          $66.4 million in 1997. This increase of $25.0 million is primarily          attributable to the acquisition activity in 1997 and 1998, which was          partially funded with secured debt and borrowings under the Company's          line of credit. In addition, in June and July of 1997, the Company          issued $161.4 million of convertible debentures, which contributed to          $5.7 million of this increase.           DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION                      Depreciation increased to $53.1 million from $41.5 million          in 1997. This increase relates primarily to the 1997 and 1998          Acquisition Centers.                                     26            MINORITY INTEREST                      The minority interest represents the 28.4% weighted average          interest of the Operating Partnership that was not owned by the Company          during 1998. This compares to 31.8% not owned by the Company during          1997.           INCOME (LOSS) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AND MANAGEMENT           COMPANIES                      The income from unconsolidated joint ventures and the          Management Companies was $14.5 million for 1998, compared to a loss of          $8.1 million in 1997. A total of $14.5 million of the change is          attributable to the 1998 acquisition of the ERE/Yarmouth portfolio.          Also, in 1997, there was a write-down and loss of $10.5 million on the          sale of North Valley Plaza.           GAIN ON SALE OF ASSETS                    During 1997, the Company sold a parcel of land for a net gain           of $1.6 million compared to a minimal amount of gain on sale           recognized in 1998.           EXTRAORDINARY LOSS FROM  EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT                      In 1998, the Company wrote off  $2.4 million of unamortized          financing costs, compared to $0.6 million written off in 1997.           NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS                      As a result of the foregoing, net income available to common          stockholders increased to $32.5 million in 1998 from $22.0 million in          1997.           OPERATING ACTIVITIES                      Cash flow from operations was $85.2 million in 1998 compared          to $78.4 million in 1997. The increase resulted from the factors          discussed above, primarily the impact of the 1997 and 1998 Acquisition          Centers.           INVESTING ACTIVITIES                      Cash flow used in investing activities was $761.1 million in          1998 compared to $215.0 million in 1997. The change resulted primarily          from the higher volume of acquisition activity completed in 1998          compared to 1997.           FINANCING ACTIVITIES                      Cash flow from financing activities was $676.0 million in          1998 compared to $146.0 million in 1997. The increase resulted from the          offerings of 7,920,181 shares of common stock, 3,627,131 shares of          Series A Preferred Stock and 5,487,471 shares of Series B Preferred          Stock completed in 1998. No equity was raised in 1997.           EBITDA AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS                      Primarily because of the factors mentioned above, EBITDA          increased 28% to $189.5 million in 1998 from $147.6 million in 1997 and          Funds from Operations - Diluted increased 44% to $120.5 million from          $83.4 million in 1997.  COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 AND 1996                    REVENUES                      Minimum and percentage rents increased by 44% to $151.5          million in 1997 from $105.2 million in 1996. Approximately $36.0          million of the increase resulted from the 1996 Acquisition Centers and          $11.9 million resulted from the 1997 Acquisition Centers. These          increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.5 million at          Parklane Mall and $0.3 million at Crossroads-Boulder, both due to          reduced occupancy incurred during redevelopment.                                     27            REVENUES, CONTINUED:                        Tenant recoveries increased to $66.5 million in 1997 from          $47.7 million in 1996. The 1997 and 1996 Acquisition Centers generated          $19.6 million of this increase. These increases were partially offset          by lower recoveries resulting from lower Same Center recoverable          expenses in 1997 compared to 1996.                      Other income increased to $3.2 million in 1997 from $2.2          million in 1996. Approximately $0.5 million of the increase related to          the 1997 and 1996 Acquisition Centers, and approximately $0.5 million          of this increase resulted from nonrecurring fee income received in          1997.           EXPENSES                      Shopping center expenses increased to $70.9 million in 1997          compared to $50.8 million in 1996. Approximately $20.9 million of the          increase resulted from the 1997 and 1996 Acquisition Centers. The other          centers had a net decrease of $0.8 million in shopping center expenses          resulting primarily from decreased property taxes, insurance premiums          and recoverable expenses.                      General and administrative expenses increased to $2.8          million in 1997 from $2.4 million in 1996, primarily due to increased          executive and director compensation expense and professional fee          expense.           INTEREST EXPENSE                      Interest expense increased to $66.4 million in 1997 from          $42.4 million in 1996. This increase of $24.0 million is attributable          to the acquisition activity in 1997 and 1996, which was partially          funded with secured debt. In addition, in June and July 1997, the          Company issued $161.4 million of convertible debentures.           DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION                      Depreciation increased to $41.5 million from $32.6 million          in 1996. This increase relates primarily to the 1996 and 1997          Acquisition Centers.           MINORITY INTEREST                      The minority interest represented the 31.8% weighted average          interest of the Operating Partnership that was not owned by the Company          during 1997. This compares to 36.9% not owned by the Company during          1996.           INCOME (LOSS) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AND MANAGEMENT           COMPANIES                      The loss from unconsolidated joint ventures and the          Management Companies was $8.1 million for 1997, compared to a gain of          $3.3 million in 1996. A total of $10.5 million of the change is          attributable to the write-down and the loss on the sale of North Valley          Plaza in 1997.           GAIN ON SALE OF ASSETS                    During 1997 the Company sold a parcel of land for a net gain           of $1.6 million.  There was no gain on sale recognized in 1996.           EXTRAORDINARY LOSS FROM EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT                      In 1997 the Company wrote off $0.6 million of unamortized          financing costs, compared to $0.3 million written off in 1996.           NET INCOME                      As a result of the foregoing, net income increased to $22.0          million in 1997 from $18.9 million in 1996.                                     28             OPERATING ACTIVITIES                      Cash flow from operations was $78.5 million in 1997 compared          to $80.4 million in 1996. The decrease resulted from the factors          discussed above, primarily the impact of the 1996 and 1997 Acquisition          Centers and related financings.           INVESTING ACTIVITIES                      Cash flow used in investing activities was $215.0 million in          1997 compared to $296.7 million in 1996. The change resulted primarily          from the four acquisitions completed in 1997 compared to seven          acquisitions in 1996.           FINANCING ACTIVITIES                      Cash flow from financing activities was $146.0 million in           1997 compared to $216.3 million in 1996.  The decrease resulted from           more acquisition financing done in 1996 than 1997.           EBITDA AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS                      Due primarily to the factors mentioned above, EBITDA          increased 45%, to $147.6 million in 1997 from $101.9 million in 1996          and Funds From Operations increased 33%, to $83.2 million, from $62.4          million in 1996.            LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES                      The Company intends to meet its short term liquidity          requirements through cash generated from operations and working capital          reserves. The Company anticipates that revenues will continue to          provide necessary funds for its operating expenses and debt service          requirements, and to pay dividends to stockholders in accordance with          REIT requirements. The Company anticipates that cash generated from          operations, together with cash on hand, will be adequate to fund          capital expenditures which will not be reimbursed by tenants, other          than non-recurring capital expenditures. Capital for major expenditures          or major redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be,          obtained from equity or debt financings which include borrowings under          the Company's line of credit and construction loans. However, many          factors impact the Company's ability to access capital, such as its           overall debt to market capitalization level, interest rates and           interest coverage ratios. The Company currently is undertaking a $90           million redevelopment of Pacific View. See "Item 2. Properties." The           Company has a bank construction loan agreement to fund $89.2 million           of these construction costs.                      The Company believes that it will have access to the capital          necessary to expand its business in accordance with its strategies for          growth and maximizing Funds from Operations. The Company presently          intends to obtain additional capital necessary to expand its business          through a combination of additional public and private equity          offerings, debt financings and/or joint ventures. During 1998 and 1999,          the Company acquired two portfolios through joint ventures with another          party. The Company believes such joint venture arrangements provide an          attractive alternative to other forms of financing, particularly during          periods when access to public capital markets is restricted by          prevailing market conditions. See "Equity Offerings" and          "Acquisitions."                      The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness at          December 31, 1998 was $1.8 billion (including its pro rata share of          joint venture debt). This equated to a debt to Total Market          Capitalization (defined as total debt of the Company, including its pro          rata share of joint venture debt, plus aggregate market value of          outstanding shares of common stock, assuming full conversion of OP          Units and preferred stock into common stock) ratio of approximately 56%          at December 31, 1998. The Company's debt consists primarily of          fixed-rate conventional mortgages payable secured by individual          properties. See "Properties-Mortgage Debt" for a description of the          Company's outstanding mortgage indebtedness.                      The Company has filed a shelf registration statement,          effective December 8, 1997, to sell securities. The shelf registration          is for a total of $500 million of common stock, common stock warrants          or common stock rights. On February 18, 1998, the Company issued          1,052,650 shares and on February 23, 1998 an additional 1,826,484          shares were issued. On April 24, 1998, the Company issued 808,989          shares and an additional 967,256, 1,864, 802 and 1,400,000 shares were          issued on April 29, 1998, May 29, 1998 and December 14, 1998,          respectively. The aggregate offering price of these transactions was          approximately $212.9 million, leaving approximately $287.1 million          available under the shelf registration statement.                                     29             LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES, CONTINUED:                      The Company has an unsecured line of credit for up to $150.0          million. There was $137.0 million of borrowings outstanding at           December 31, 1998.                      At December 31, 1998, the Company had cash and cash          equivalents available of $25.1 million.             YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE           THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BELOW CONTAINS YEAR 2000 STATEMENTS AND IS A YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO PUB. L. NO. 105-271.           YEAR 2000 ISSUES           The Year 2000 issue is the result of many existing computer programs and embedded technology using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year. The Company's computer equipment and software and devices with embedded technology that are time-sensitive may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000. This could result in system failure or erroneous data which would cause disruptions of operations.           The Company has initiated a Year 2000 compliance program consisting of the following phases: (1) identification of Year 2000 issues; (2) assessment of Year 2000 compliance of systems; (3) remediation or replacement of non-compliant systems; (4) testing to verify compliance; and (5) contingency planning, as appropriate. This program includes a review of both information technology ("IT") and non-IT systems and is being supervised by the Company's Year 2000 team which consists of management as well as operational and IT staff members.           On February 18, 1999, the Company acquired several properties from various Safeco Corporation entities and is in the process of reviewing each property's Year 2000 readiness. Such review is anticipated to be completed by June 30, 1999. See "Recent Developments - Acquisitions". The following disclosure provides information regarding the Company's properties excluding those acquisition properties.           IT SYSTEMS           The Company has reviewed its core computer hardware systems and software programs to determine if such systems and programs will properly process dates in the Year 2000 and thereafter. Based on manufacturer or vendor information, the Company presently believes most of its critical computer hardware systems and software programs are substantially Year 2000 compliant. The Company is aware of one critical hardware system which needs a Year 2000 upgrade at a cost of approximately $13,100. The Company is currently conducting its own evaluation and testing to verify compliance of its critical hardware systems and software and expects to conclude such testing by June 1, 1999.           The most important software program to the Company's operations is its property management and accounting software. The Company has been advised by its independent software vendor that it has completed its evaluation, testing and modification of this program and the necessary changes have been completed to achieve Year 2000 compliance. The Company is conducting its own evaluation and testing to confirm this conclusion and expects to complete such testing by June 1, 1999.           The Company completed its assessment of the Year 2000 compliance of its non-critical computer hardware systems and software programs by its target date of December 31, 1998. Based on manufacturer or vendor information, the Company presently believes that substantially all of its non-critical hardware systems and software programs are Year 2000 compliant.                                     30            YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE, CONTINED:           NON-IT SYSTEMS           Part of the Company's Year 2000 program also includes a review of  the various operating systems of each of its portfolio properties and main  offices. These systems typically include embedded technology which  complicates the Company's Year 2000 efforts. Examples of these types of  systems include energy management systems, telecommunication systems,  elevators, security systems and copiers. The various operating systems have  been assigned priorities based on the importance of the system to each  property's operations and the potential impact of non-compliance. All of the  Company's properties have substantially completed their initial assessment of  each system and are verifying Year 2000 compliance through the manufacturers  and/or vendors of the systems. Approximately 70% of the critical operating  systems for which the Company has received information from manufacturers or  vendors are substantially Year 2000 compliant as reported by such entities.  Certain critical systems, 11 energy management systems, one telephone system,  and one parking access computer software system, will need Year 2000 upgrades  and the Company is in the process of obtaining such upgrades at an aggregate  cost of approximately $50,000. Other non-compliant critical systems are being  upgraded by the manufacturer at no cost to the Company or were previously  scheduled for replacement or upgrades prior to January 1, 2000. With respect  to approximately 20% of its critical operating systems, the Company has not  received the necessary information to assess the Year 2000 compliance of such  systems. The Company is contacting these manufacturers/ vendors to obtain the  information necessary to complete its Year 2000 compliance assessment.           Each property is preparing recommendations regarding the remediation and testing phases. Remediation and testing recommendations and time lines are prepared based on the importance of each system to the property's operations and information received from the manufacturer/vendor. The Company plans to coordinate the testing phase with the manufacturers/vendors of the systems, as appropriate. The Company established June 1, 1999 as its target date to complete the remediation and testing phases for the critical operating systems at each property. The Company will need the cooperation of its manufacturers/vendors in providing information and testing assistance to meet this timeline for its critical operating systems. If such cooperation is not provided, completion of these phases will be delayed. The Company expects the Year 2000 program to continue beyond January 1, 2000 with respect to non-critical operating systems and issues.           MATERIAL THIRD PARTIES           The Company mailed surveys to its material vendors, utilities and tenants about their plans and progress in addressing the Year 2000 issue. Those entities surveyed include the utilities for each mall (i.e., electric, gas, water, telephone and waste management companies), the largest tenants of the Company based on the amount of their 1998 rent payments and certain Anchor tenants. As of this date, the Company has received responses from approximately 58% of those entities surveyed. Generally, the responses received state that the entity is in the process of addressing the Year 2000 compliance issues and expects to achieve compliance prior to January 1, 2000.           COSTS           Because the Company's assessment, remediation and testing efforts are ongoing, the Company is unable to estimate the actual costs of achieving Year 2000 compliance for its IT and non-IT systems. Based on information received from manufacturers/vendors, the Company presently anticipates that the assessment and remediation costs will not be material. As of December 31, 1998, the Company has not expended significant amounts since its evaluation of Year 2000 issues has been primarily conducted by its own personnel. The Company does not separately record the internal costs incurred for its Year 2000 compliance program. Such costs are primarily the related payroll costs for its personnel who are part of the Year 2000 program.           RISKS           As is true of most businesses, the Company is vulnerable to external forces that might generally effect industry and commerce, such as utility company Year 2000 compliance failures and related service interruptions. In addition, failure of information and operating systems of tenants may delay the payment of rent to the Company or impair their ability to operate. A formal contingency plan has not yet been developed for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario. The Company will continue to evaluate potential areas of risk and develop a contingency plan, as appropriate.           Based on currently available information, the Company believes that the Year 2000 issue will not pose significant operational problems for the Company. However, if all Year 2000 issues are not properly identified, or assessment, remediation and testing are not effected in a timely manner, there can be no assurance that the Year 2000 issue will not adversely affect the Company's results of operations or its relationships with tenants or other third parties. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Year 2000 issues of third parties will not have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations.                                     31            FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS                    The Company believes that the most significant measure of its          performance is FFO. FFO is defined by The National Association of Real          Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") to be: Net income (loss) (computed          in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from debt          restructuring and sales or write-down of assets, plus depreciation and          amortization (excluding depreciation on personal property and          amortization of loan and financial instrument costs) and after          adjustments for unconsolidated entities. Adjustments for unconsolidated          entities are calculated on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash          flow from operations, as defined by GAAP, and is not necessarily          indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The following          reconciles net income available to common stockholders to FFO:                                                                                 1998                        1997                                                                  --------------------------  --------------------------                                                                  Shares        Amount        Shares        Amount                                                                  ------------  ------------  ------------  ------------                                                                                 (amounts in thousands)               Net income - available to common stockholders                                 $32,528                     $22,046       Adjustments to reconcile net income to FFO-basic:            Minority interest                                                         12,902                      10,567           Loss on early extinguishment of debt                                       2,435                         555           Gain on sale of wholly-owned  assets                                          (9)                     (1,619)           Loss on sale or write-down of assets from                 unconsolidated entities (pro rata)                                     143                      10,400           Depreciation and amortization on wholly owned centers                     53,141                      41,535           Depreciation and amortization on joint ventures and                 from the management companies (pro rata)                            10,879                       2,312       Less:  depreciation on personal property and                amortization of loan costs and interest rate caps                    (3,716)                     (2,608)                                                                                 ------------                ------------      FFO - basic (1)                                                  43,016      $108,303        37,982       $83,188       Additional adjustment to arrive at FFO-diluted            Impact of convertible preferred stock                        6,058        11,547           N/A           N/A           Impact of stock options and restricted stock using               the treasury method                                        612           668           421           239           Impact of convertible debentures                                        (n/a anti-dilutive)                                                                  -----------   -----------   -----------   ------------       FFO - diluted (2)                                                49,686      $120,518        38,403       $83,427                                                                  -----------   -----------   -----------   ------------                                                                  -----------   -----------   -----------   ------------                                      32            FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, CONTINUED:           (1)   Calculated based upon basic net income as adjusted to reach                basic FFO. Weighted average number of shares includes the                weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for 1998                assuming the conversion of all outstanding OP Units.           (2)   The computation of FFO - diluted and diluted average number                of shares outstanding includes the effect of outstanding common                stock options and restricted stock using the treasury method.                Convertible debentures for the twelve month period are                anti-dilutive and are not included. On February 25, 1998, the                Company sold $100 million of its Series A Preferred Stock. On                June 17, 1998, the Company sold $150 million of its Series B                Preferred Stock. The preferred stock can be converted on a                one-for-one basis for common stock. The preferred shares are not                assumed converted for purposes of net income per share as they                would be anti-dilutive to that calculation. The preferred shares                are assumed converted for purposes of FFO-diluted per share as                they are dilutive to that calculation.           Included in minimum rents were rents attributable to the accounting          practice of straight lining of rents. The amount of straight lining of          rents that impacted minimum rents was $3,814,000 for 1998, $3,599,000          for 1997 and $1,832,000 for 1996.       INFLATION                 In the last three years, inflation has not had a significant      impact on the Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most of      the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically through the      lease term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on      increases in the Consumer Price Index. In addition, many of the leases are      for terms of less than ten years, which enables the Company to replace      existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the      existing leases are below the then existing market rate. Additionally, most      of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating      expenses. This reduces the Company's exposure to increases in costs and      operating expenses resulting from inflation.       SEASONALITY           The shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in the      fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail      sales are typically at their highest levels. In addition, shopping malls      achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents      during the holiday season. As a result of the above, earnings are generally      highest in the fourth quarter of each year.        NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED:                    In March, 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board      ("FASB"), through its Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF"), concluded based      on EITF 97-11, "Accounting for Internal Costs Relating to Real Estate      Property Acquisitions," that all internal costs to source, analyze and      close acquisitions should be expensed as incurred. The Company has      historically capitalized these costs in accordance with GAAP. The Company      has adopted the FASB's interpretation effective March 19,1998, and the      impact was approximately $0.04 per share reduction of net income and      FFO-diluted per share for 1998.                    In May, 1998, the FASB, through the EITF, modified the timing      of recognition of revenue for percentage rent received from tenants in EITF      98-9, "Accounting for Contingent Rent in Interim Financial Periods." The      Company applied this accounting change as of April 1, 1998. The accounting      change had the effect of deferring $1,792,000 of percentage rent in the      second quarter of 1998 and $972,000 of percentage rent in the third quarter      of 1998. During the fourth quarter of 1998, the FASB reversed EITF 98-9.      Accordingly, the Company has resumed accounting for percentage rent on the      accrual basis. The effect of these changes was that approximately      $2,764,000 was deferred from the second and third quarters of 1998 to the      fourth quarter of 1998.                                     33         NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED, CONTINUED:                    In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS 133, "Accounting for      Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which will be effective for      the Company's financial statements for periods beginning January 1, 2000.      The new standard requires companies to record derivatives on the balance      sheet, measured at fair value. Changes in the fair values of those      derivatives will be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative      and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The key criterion for hedge      accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in      achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows. The Company has      not yet determined when it will implement SFAS 133 nor has it completed the      complex analysis required to determine the impact on its financial      statements.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK                The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk.      The Company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by      (1) maintaining a conservative ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total      debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2)      reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term variable rate debt      through the use of interest rate caps with appropriately matching      maturities, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on      anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market      conditions for long-term debt and/or equity.                The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 1998      concerning the Company's long term debt obligations, including principal      cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and      estimated fair value ("FV").

The Company is currently in negotiations      to refinance the remaining $85.0 million maturing in 1999 with fixed rate      debt. The $137.0 million of variable debt maturing in 2001 represents the      outstanding borrowings under the Company's credit facility. The credit      facility matures in February 2000, with a one year option to extend the      maturity date to February 2001. The table reflects the Company extending      the maturity date to February 2001.                                     34   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK, CONTINUED:        In addition, the Company has assessed the market risk for its variable rate      debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease      future earnings and cash flows by approximately $3.8 million per year based      on $379.6 million outstanding at December 31, 1998.       The fair value of the Company's long term debt is estimated based on      discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflects      the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration.
