NAME="dk1004_management_s_overview_and_summary">      Management's Overview and Summary         The Macerich Company (the "Company") is involved in the acquisition, ownership, development, redevelopment, management, and leasing of regional and community shopping centers located throughout the United States. The Company is the sole general partner of, and owns a majority of the ownership interests in, The Macerich Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership"). As of December 31, 2006, the Operating Partnership owned or had an ownership interest in 73 regional shopping centers and 18 community shopping centers aggregating approximately 76.9 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA"). These 91 regional and community shopping centers are referred to hereinafter as the "Centers", unless the context otherwise requires. The Company is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") and conducts all of its operations through the Operating Partnership and the Management Companies.    The following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. It compares the activity for the year ended December 31, 2006 to results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. Also included is a comparison of the activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2004.

An affiliate of the Operating Partnership is the general partner and, together with other affiliates, own approximately 83% of Wilmorite Holdings, with the remaining 17% held by those limited partners of Wilmorite Holdings who elected to receive convertible preferred units or common units in Wilmorite Holdings rather than cash. The PCPUs can be redeemed, subject to certain conditions, for the portion of the Wilmorite portfolio generally located in the area of Rochester, New York.

The sale price was $117.6 million from which $56.0 million was used to payoff the mortgage on the property. The Company's share of the realized gain was $25.8 million.     On July 13, 2006, the Company sold Park Lane Mall, a 370,000 square foot center in Reno, Nevada, for $20 million resulting in a gain of $5.9 million.    On July 26, 2006, the Company purchased 11 department stores located in 10 of its Centers from Federated Department Stores, Inc. for approximately $100.0 million.

Valley River Center and Deptford Mall are referred to herein as the "2006 Acquisition Centers."     Redevelopment:     The grand opening of the first phase of Twenty Ninth Street, an 817,085 square foot shopping district in Boulder, Colorado, took place on October 13, 2006. The balance of the project is scheduled for completion in the Summer 2007. Phase I of the project is 93% leased. Recent store openings include Borders Books, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Helly Hansen, Lady Foot Locker, lululemon, and Solstice Sunglass Boutique. Wild Oats has also opened their corporate headquarters at this project. Recent lease commitments include Anthropologie, Sephora, Cantina Laredo, Jamba Juice and North Face.    On November 1, 2006, the Company received Phoenix City Council approval to add up to five mixed-use towers of up to 165 feet at Biltmore Fashion Park. Biltmore Fashion Park is an established luxury destination for first-to-market, high-end and luxury tenants in the metropolitan Phoenix market. The mixed-use towers are planned to be built over time based upon demand.    Groundbreaking took place on February 6, 2007 for the 230,000 square foot life style expansion at The Oaks in Thousand Oaks, California. Plans also call for the remodeling of both the interior spaces and the exterior façade, and will include a new 138,000 square foot Nordstrom scheduled to open at the Center in Fall 2008. New tenants include Abercrombie Kids, Forever 21, Forth & Towne, Guess?, J. Crew, Iridesse, Planet Funk and Solstice    The Macerich Company     43           Sunglass Boutique. The combined expansion and renovation of the center is projected to cost approximately $250 million and be completed in Fall 2008.    The first phase of SanTan Village, a $205 million regional shopping center under construction in Gilbert, Arizona, is scheduled to open in Fall 2007. The center, currently 85% leased, is an open-air streetscape that will contain in excess of 1.2 million square feet on 120 acres. More than 35 tenants have committed to date, including Dillard's, Harkins Theatres, Aeropostale, American Eagle Outfitters, Ann Taylor, Ann Taylor Loft, Apple, Banana Republic, Best Buy, Blue Wasabi, The Body Shop, The Buckle, Charlotte Russe, Chico's, The Children's Place, Coach, Coldwater Creek, The Disney Store, Eddie Bauer, J. Jill, Lane Bryant/Cacique, lucy, PacSun, Soma by Chico's, Swarovski Crystals, Victoria's Secret, Weisfield's Jewelers, White House/Black Market and Z Gallerie.    Construction began in late 2006 on The Promenade at Casa Grande, a $135 million, 1.0 million-square-foot regional shopping center in Arizona's fastest-growing county. Located in Casa Grande, Pinal County, the center will be located along the I-10 corridor between Phoenix and Tucson. The project is 85% committed, including anchors Target and JC Penney, and will deliver shopping, dining and entertainment options to a key growth corridor. Phase I of the project, which will include a combination of large-format retailers, specialty shops and restaurants, is scheduled for completion in Fall 2007. Phase II is comprised of small shops and is scheduled to open in March 2008. The Promenade at Casa Grande is 51% owned by the Company.    On January 22, 2007, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors approved plans for a transit-oriented development at Tysons Corner Center in McLean, Virginia. The expansion will add 3.5 million square feet of mixed-use space to the existing 2.2 million square foot regional shopping center. The project is planned to be built in phases over the next 10 years based on market demand and the expansion of the area's light rail system. Completion of the entitlement process for Phase I, totaling roughly 1.4 million square feet, is anticipated for the first quarter of 2008. The first phase of the project is anticipated to begin development in late 2009.    In late 2006, plans were announced to bring Barneys New York Department Store to Scottsdale Fashion Square, replacing one of the anchor spaces acquired as a result of the Federated-May merger. Demolition of the vacant space and adjoining parking structure will begin in 2007, allowing for construction of an additional 100,000 square feet of new shop space and the 65,000-square-foot Barneys New York location. This store is anticipated to open in Fall 2009.    Inflation:     In the last three years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most of the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"). In addition, about 6%-13% of the leases expire each year, which enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. Additionally, historically the majority of the leases required the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses. In January 2005, the Company began entering into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any center. This change shifts the burden of cost control to the Company.    44       The Macerich Company          Seasonality:     The shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels. In addition, shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter. As a result of the above, earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter.    NAME="dk1004_critical_accounting_policies">      Critical Accounting Policies         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.    Some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition, estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals, provisions for uncollectible accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, and estimates for environmental matters. The Company's significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the following policies are deemed to be critical.     Revenue Recognition     Minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. The difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the "straight lining of rent adjustment." Currently, 40% of the mall and freestanding leases contain provisions for CPI rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease. The Company believes that using an annual multiple of CPI increases, rather than fixed contractual rent increases, results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases. Percentage rents are recognized when the tenants' specified sales targets have been met. Estimated recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred.    Property     Costs related to the development, redevelopment, construction and improvement of properties are capitalized. Interest incurred on development, redevelopment and construction projects is capitalized until construction is substantially complete.    Maintenance and repairs expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Costs for major replacements and betterments, which includes HVAC equipment, roofs, parking lots, etc., are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings.    The Macerich Company     45           Property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:          Buildings and improvements     5-40 years    Tenant improvements     5-7 years    Equipment and furnishings     5-7 years          Accounting for Acquisitions     The Company accounts for all acquisitions in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations." The Company will first determine the value of the land and buildings utilizing an "as if vacant" methodology. The Company will then assign a fair value to any debt assumed at acquisition. The balance of the purchase price will be allocated to tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities. Tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair market value basis at the acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms. The tenant improvements are classified as an asset under real estate investments and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases which come in three forms: (i) leasing commissions and legal costs, which represent the value associated with "cost avoidance" of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the Company's markets; (ii) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the "assumed vacant" property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (iii) above or below market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. Leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms. The value of in-place leases are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus an estimate of renewal of the acquired leases. Above or below market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets or in other accrued liabilities, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market, and the asset or liability is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining terms of the leases.    When the Company acquires real estate properties, the Company allocates the purchase price to the components of these acquisitions using relative fair values computed using its estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions impact the amount of costs allocated between various components as well as the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions. These allocations also impact depreciation expense and gains or loses recorded on future sales of properties. Generally, the Company engages a valuation firm to assist with these allocations.    Asset Impairment     The Company assesses whether there has been impairment in the value of its long-lived assets by considering factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. Such factors include the tenant's ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases. The Company may recognize impairment losses if the cash flows are not sufficient to cover its investment. Such a loss would be determined as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a center.    46       The Macerich Company          Deferred Charges     Costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight-line method. Costs relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. In-place lease values are amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of renewal. Leasing commissions and legal costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the individual remaining lease years. The ranges of the terms of the agreements are as follows:          Deferred lease costs     1-15 years    Deferred financing costs     1-15 years    In-place lease values     Remaining lease term plus an estimate for renewal    Leasing commissions and legal costs     5-10 years                    Results of Operations         Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred due to the transactions described above including the 2006 Acquisition Centers, 2005 Acquisition Centers, 2004 Acquisition Centers and Redevelopment Centers. For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31, 2005, "Same Centers" include all consolidated Centers, excluding 2006 Acquisition Centers, 2005 Acquisition Centers and Redevelopment Centers. For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2005 to the year ended December 31, 2004, "Same Centers" include all consolidated Centers, except the 2005 Acquisition Centers, 2004 Acquisition Centers and Redevelopment Centers.    For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31, 2005, "Redevelopment Centers" include Twenty Ninth Street, Santa Monica Place and Westside Pavilion. For the comparison of year ended December 31, 2005 to the year ended December 31, 2004, "Redevelopment Centers" include La Encantada, Twenty-Ninth Street, Santa Monica Place and Queens Center.    For comparison of the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31, 2005, Kierland Commons, Metrocenter Mall, Ridgmar Mall and Tysons Center are referred to herein as the "Joint Venture Acquisition Centers." For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2005 to the year ended December 31, 2004, Biltmore Fashion Square, Inland Center and NorthPark Center are also included in the "Joint Venture Acquisition Centers". Unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected using the equity method of accounting. The Company's pro rata share of the results from these Centers is reflected in the results of operations in the income statement line item entitled "Equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures."    NAME="dk1004_comparison_of_years_ended_december_31,_2006_and_2005">      Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005          Revenues     Minimum and percentage rents (collectively referred to as "rental revenue") increased by $65.8 million or 14.7% from 2005 to 2006. Approximately $43.5 million of the increase in rental revenue related to the 2005 Acquisition Centers, $11.9 million was related to the 2006 Acquisition Centers and $9.9 million was related to the Same Centers due in part to an increase in lease termination income of $7.2 million compared to 2005 at the Same Centers. These increases are offset in part by a decrease in rental revenue of $0.5 million at the Redevelopment Centers.    The Macerich Company     47          The amount of straight-lined rents, included in rental revenue, was $7.8 million in 2006 compared to $6.7 million in 2005. This increase is primarily due to the 2006 Acquisition Centers.    The amortization of above and below market leases, which is recorded in rental revenue, increased to $13.1 million in 2006 from $11.6 million in 2005. The increase in amortization is primarily due to the 2005 Acquisition Centers and 2006 Acquisition Centers.    Tenant recoveries increased $39.7 million or 18.5% from 2005 to 2006. Approximately $23.0 million of the increase in tenant recoveries related to the 2005 Acquisition Centers, $5.1 million related to the 2006 Acquisition Centers and $12.4 million related to the Same Centers due to an increase in recoverable shopping center expenses. The increase in tenant recoveries was offset in part by a decrease of $0.9 million at the Redevelopment Centers.    Management Companies' Revenues      Management Companies' revenues increased by $5.3 million from 2005 to 2006, primarily due to increased management fees received from the Joint Venture Acquisition Centers, third party management contracts and increased development fees from joint ventures.    Shopping Center and Operating Expenses     Shopping center and operating expenses increased $38.2 million or 17.1% from 2005 to 2006. Approximately $25.6 million of the increase in shopping center and operating expenses related to the 2005 Acquisition Centers, $5.0 million related to the 2006 Acquisition Centers and $8.0 million related to the Same Centers offset in part by a $0.5 million decrease at the Redevelopment Centers.     Management Companies' Operating Expenses     Management Companies' operating expenses increased to $56.7 million in 2006 from $52.8 million in 2005, primarily as a result of the additional costs of managing the Joint Venture Acquisition Centers and third party managed properties.    REIT General and Administrative Expenses     REIT general and administrative expenses increased by $1.4 million in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to increased share-based compensation expense in 2006.    Depreciation and Amortization      Depreciation and amortization increased $31.1 million in 2006 from 2005. The increase is primarily attributed to the 2005 Acquisition Centers of $17.8 million, the 2006 Acquisition Centers of $6.2 million and the Same Centers of $7.4 million.    Interest Expense     Interest expense increased $37.6 million in 2006 from 2005. Approximately $13.8 million of the increase relates to the term loan associated with the 2005 Acquisition Centers, $12.4 million relates to assumed debt from the 2005 Acquisition Centers, $5.3 million relates to the 2006 Acquisition Centers, $13.3 million relates to increased borrowings and higher interest rates under the Company's line of credit, $6.7 million relates to higher interest rates on the $250 million term loan and approximately $8.9 million relates to increased interest expense due to    48       The Macerich Company          refinancings and higher rates on floating rate debt regarding the Same Centers. These increases were offset in part by an approximately $1.3 million decrease in interest expense at the Redevelopment Centers and $21.6 million relating to the pay off of the acquisition loan associated with the 2005 Acquisition Centers. Additionally, capitalized interest was $14.9 million in 2006, up from $10.0 million in 2005.    Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures     The equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures increased $9.7 million in 2006 from 2005. Approximately $6.5 million of the increase relates to increased income from the Joint Venture Acquisition Centers, increased net income of $3.3 million from the Pacific Premier Retail Trust joint venture due to increased rental revenue and $4.6 million from other joint ventures due to increased rental revenues. This is partly offset by a $4.7 million increase in interest expense from the SDG Macerich Properties, L.P. joint venture (See "Item 1. Business Recent Developments Financing Activities").    Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt     The Company recorded a loss from the early extinguishment of debt of $1.8 million in 2006 related to the pay off of the $619 million acquisition loan on January 19, 2006. In 2005, the Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.7 relating to the refinancing of the mortgage note payable on Valley View Mall.     Discontinued Operations     The increase of $202.1 million in discontinued operations relates to the gain on sales of Scottsdale/101, Park Lane Mall, Holiday Village, Greeley Mall, Great Falls Marketplace, Citadel Mall, Crossroads Mall and Northwest Arkansas Mall in 2006 (See "Management's Overview and Summary Acquisitions and dispositions"). As result of the sales, the Company reclassified the results of operations for these properties for 2006 and 2005.    Minority Interest in the Operating Partnership      The minority interest in the Operating Partnership represents the 15.8% weighted average interest of the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company during 2006 compared to the 19.0% not owned by the Company during 2005. The change is primarily due to the stock offering by the Company in January 2006.    Funds From Operations     Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, Funds from Operations ("FFO") Diluted increased 13.7% to $383.1 million in 2006 from $336.8 million in 2005. For the reconciliation of FFO and FFO-diluted to net income available to common stockholders, see "Funds from Operations."     Operating Activities     Cash flow from operations decreased to $211.9 million in 2006 from $235.3 million in 2005. The decrease is primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities in 2006 compared to 2005 and due to the results at the Centers as discussed above.    Investing Activities     Cash used in investing activities decreased to $126.7 million in 2006 from $131.9 million in 2005. The decrease is primarily attributed to the cash used to acquire the 2006 Acquisition Centers and increases in development and redevelopment costs at the Centers. This is offset by $610.6 million in proceeds from the sale of assets in 2006 (See "Management's Overview and Summary Acquisitions and dispositions").    The Macerich Company     49        NAME="page_dm1004_1_50">        Financing Activities     Cash flow provided by financing activities was $29.2 million in 2006 compared to cash used in financing activities of $20.3 million in 2005. The increase is primarily attributed to the net proceeds of $746.8 million from the stock offering in January 2006 offset in part by a reduction of debt of in 2006 compared to 2005.    NAME="dm1004_comparison_of_years_ended_december_31,_2005_and_2004">      Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004         Revenues     Rental revenue increased by 44.3% to $447.9 million in 2005 from $310.5 million in 2004. Approximately $92.9 million of the increase relates to the 2005 Acquisition Centers, $21.6 million relates to the 2004 Acquisition Centers and $24.0 million primarily relates to the Redevelopment Centers. The increase in rental revenue was offset by a decrease at the Same Centers of $1.1 million.    The amount of straight-lined rents, included in rental revenue, was $6.7 million in 2005 compared to $1.0 million in 2004. This increase in straight-lining of rents relates to the 2005 Acquisition Centers and the 2004 Acquisition Centers which is offset by decreases resulting from the Company structuring the majority of its new leases using an annual multiple of CPI increases, which generally do not require straight-lining treatment.     The amortization of above and below market leases, which is recorded in minimum rents, increased to $11.6 million in 2005 from $9.2 million in 2004. The increase is primarily due to the 2005 Acquisition Centers and the 2004 Acquisition Centers.    Tenant recoveries increased to $214.8 million in 2005 from $145.1 million in 2004. Approximately $52.9 million of the increase relates to the 2005 Acquisition Centers, $5.8 million relates to the Redevelopment Centers, $9.2 million relates to the 2004 Acquisition Centers and $1.8 million relates to the Same Centers.    Management Companies' revenues increased by 21.4% to $26.1 million in 2005 from $21.5 million in 2004 primarily due to increased management fees received from the 2005 and 2004 Joint Venture Acquisition Centers and third party management contracts.    Shopping Center and Operating Expenses     Shopping center and operating expenses increased to $223.9 million in 2005 compared to $146.5 million in 2004. This increase is a result of $54.9 million of expenses from the 2005 Acquisition Centers, $10.5 million from the 2004 Acquisition Centers and $5.6 million from the Redevelopment Centers. In addition, there was a write-off of a contingent compensation liability of $6.4 million in 2004.     Management Companies' Operating Expenses     Management Companies' operating expenses increased by 19.7% to $52.8 million in 2005 from $44.1 million in 2004, primarily due to a higher compensation expense in 2005 compared to 2004.    REIT General and Administrative Expenses     REIT general and administrative expenses increased to $12.1 million in 2005 from $11.1 million in 2004, primarily due to increases in stock-based compensation expense compared to 2004.    50       The Macerich Company          Depreciation and Amortization     Depreciation and amortization increased to $193.1 million in 2005 from $128.4 million in 2004. Approximately $60.6 million relates to the 2005 Acquisition Centers, $3.0 million related to the 2004 Acquisition Centers and $4.1 million relates to the Redevelopment Centers. This was offset by a $3.0 million decrease relating to the Same Centers.    Interest Expense     Interest expense increased to $237.1 million in 2005 from $134.5 million in 2004. Approximately $26.6 million relates to the assumed debt from the 2005 Acquisition Centers, $39.8 million relates to the term and acquisition loans for the Wilmorite Acquisition, $19.8 million relates to increased borrowings and higher interest rates under the Company's line of credit, $2.0 million relates to the Northridge Center loan which closed on June 30, 2004, $5.9 million relates to the 2004 Acquisition Centers, $11.4 million related to the Redevelopment Centers and $2.7 million relates to an increase in interest rates on floating rate debt at the Same Centers. These increases are offset in part by a $4.6 million decrease related to the payoff of the $250 million term loan on July 30, 2004. Additionally, capitalized interest was $10.0 million in 2005, down from $8.9 million in 2004.    Equity in Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures     The equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures was $76.3 million for 2005, compared to $54.9 million in 2004. This primarily relates to increased net income from the 2005 and 2004 Joint Venture Acquisition Centers of $13.7 million. Included in the equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures is the Company's pro rata share of straight-line rents, which increased to $4.8 million in 2005 from $1.0 million in 2004.    Gain on Sale of Assets     In 2005, a gain of $1.3 million was recorded relating to land sales compared to a $0.5 million gain on land sales in 2004.    Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt     In 2005, the Company recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of $1.7 million related to the refinancing of the Valley View Mall loan. In 2004, the Company recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of $1.6 million related to the payoff of a loan at one of the Redevelopment Centers and the payoff of the $250 million term loan on July 30, 2004.    Discontinued Operations     The gain on sale of $0.3 million in 2005 relates primarily to the sale of Arizona Lifestyle Galleries on January 5, 2005. In 2004, the gain on sale primarily related to the $6.8 million gain from the sale of the Westbar property on December 16, 2004. The decrease in income from discontinued operations relates to the Westbar property. As a result of sales of properties in 2006, the Company reclassified the results of operations for these properties in 2005 and 2004.    Minority Interest in the Operating Partnership      The minority interest in the Operating Partnership represents the 19.0% weighted average interest of the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company during 2005. This compares to 19.5% not owned by the Company during 2004.    The Macerich Company     51          Funds From Operations      Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, FFO Diluted increased 12.6% to $336.8 million in 2005 from $299.2 million in 2004. For the reconciliation of FFO and FFO diluted to net income available to common stockholders, see "Funds from Operations."    Operating Activities     Cash flow from operations was $235.3 million in 2005 compared to $213.2 million in 2004. The increase is primarily due to the foregoing results at the Centers and offset by an increase in working capital.    Investing Activities     Cash used in investing activities was $131.9 million in 2005 compared to $489.8 million in 2004. The change resulted primarily from increases in distributions of capital from unconsolidated joint ventures. This is offset by the joint venture acquisitions of Metrocenter and Kierland Commons, the Company's additional contributions to NorthPark Center and the decreased development, redevelopment, expansion and renovation of Centers in 2005 compared to 2004 due to completion of the Queens Center and La Encantada projects.    Financing Activities     Cash flow used in financing activities was $20.3 million in 2005 compared to cash flow provided by financing activities of $308.4 million in 2004. The 2005 decrease compared to 2004 resulted primarily from fewer refinancings for 2005 than 2004 and increased dividend payments to common stockholders. Additionally, the funding of the Queens construction loan was $65.7 million less in 2005 compared to 2004 due to the substantial completion of the expansion project.    Liquidity and Capital Resources     The Company intends to meet its short term liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations, working capital reserves, property secured borrowings, unsecured corporate borrowings and borrowings under the revolving line of credit. The Company anticipates that revenues will continue to provide necessary funds for its operating expenses and debt service requirements, and to pay dividends to stockholders in accordance with REIT requirements. The Company anticipates that cash generated from operations, together with cash on hand, will be adequate to fund capital expenditures which will not be reimbursed by tenants, other than non-recurring capital expenditures.    52       The Macerich Company          The following tables summarize capital expenditures incurred at the Centers for the years ended December 31:       (Dollars in thousands)  Consolidated Centers:       2006       2005       2004         Acquisitions of property and equipment     $580,542     $1,767,237     $301,061    Development, redevelopment and expansion of Centers     174,522     77,254     139,292    Renovations of Centers     51,406     51,092     21,240    Tenant allowances     35,603     21,765     10,876    Deferred leasing charges     22,776     21,836     16,822             $864,849     $1,939,184     $489,291       Joint Venture Centers (at Company's pro rata share):                            Acquisitions of property and equipment     $28,732     $736,451     $41,174    Development, redevelopment and expansion of Centers     48,785     79,400     6,596    Renovations of Centers     8,119     32,243     10,046    Tenant allowances     13,795     8,922     10,485    Deferred leasing charges     4,269     5,113     3,666             $103,700     $862,129     $71,967          Management expects similar levels to be incurred in future years for tenant allowances and deferred leasing charges and to incur between $400 million to $600 million in 2007 for development, redevelopment, expansion and renovations. Capital for major expenditures or major developments and redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be, obtained from equity or debt financings which include borrowings under the Company's line of credit and construction loans. However, many factors impact the Company's ability to access capital, such as its overall debt level, interest rates, interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions.    The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness at December 31, 2006 was $6.6 billion (including $1.7 billion of its pro rata share of joint venture debt). This equated to a debt to Total Market Capitalization (defined as total debt of the Company, including its pro rata share of joint venture debt, plus aggregate market value of outstanding shares of common stock, assuming full conversion of OP Units, MACWH, LP units and preferred stock into common stock) ratio of approximately 45.5% at December 31, 2006. The majority of the Company's debt consists of fixed-rate conventional mortgages payable collateralized by individual properties.    The Company has filed a shelf registration statement, effective June 6, 2002, to sell securities. The shelf registration is for a total of $1.0 billion of common stock, common stock warrant or common stock rights. The Company sold a total of 15.2 million shares of common stock under this shelf registration on November 27, 2002. The aggregate offering price of this transaction was approximately $440.2 million, leaving approximately $559.8 million available under the shelf registration statement. In addition, the Company filed another shelf registration statement, effective October 27, 2003, to sell up to $300 million of preferred stock. On January 12, 2006, the Company filed a shelf registration statement registering an unspecified amount of common stock that it may offer in the future.    On January 19, 2006, the Company issued 10.9 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $746.5 million. The net proceeds were used to pay off the $619.0 million acquisition loan and to pay down the line of credit pending use to pay part of the cash purchase price of Valley River Center.    The Macerich Company     53           On May 10, 2006, the SDG Macerich Properties, L.P. joint venture completed a refinancing of its portfolio debt. The joint venture paid off approximately $625.0 million of floating and fixed rate debt with an average interest rate of approximately 6.50%. This debt was replaced by a series of seven new ten-year mortgage notes payable totaling $796.5 million with an average interest rate of 5.81%. The Company's pro rata share of the net proceeds of approximately $85.5 million was used to pay down the Company's line of credit.    The Company had a $1.0 billion revolving line of credit that was set to mature on July 30, 2007 plus a one-year extension. The interest rate fluctuated from LIBOR plus 1.15% to LIBOR plus 1.70% depending on the Company's overall leverage level. On July 20, 2006, the Company amended and expanded the revolving line of credit to $1.5 billion and extended the maturity to April 25, 2010 with a one-year extension option. The interest rate, after amendment, will fluctuate from LIBOR plus 1.0% to LIBOR plus 1.35% depending on the Company's overall leverage. In September 2006, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate on $400.0 million of the outstanding balance of the line of credit at 6.23% until April 25, 2011. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, borrowings outstanding were $934.5 million and $863.0 million at an average interest rate, net of the $400.0 million swapped portion, of 6.60% and 5.93%, respectively.    On May 13, 2003, the Company issued $250.0 million in unsecured notes maturing in May 2007 with a one-year extension option bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.50%. On April 25, 2005, concurrent with the Wilmorite acquisition, the Company modified these unsecured notes and reduced the interest rate to LIBOR plus 1.50%. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the entire $250.0 million of notes were outstanding at an interest rate of 6.94% and 6.0%, respectively. The Company had an interest rate swap agreement which effectively fixed the interest rate at 4.45% from November 2003 to October 13, 2005.    On April 25, 2005, concurrent with the Wilmorite acquisition, the Company obtained a five year, $450.0 million term loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%. In November 2005, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate of the $450.0 million term loan at 6.30% from December 1, 2005 to April 15, 2010. At December 31, 2006 and 2005 the entire loan was outstanding with an interest rate of 6.30%.    On December 29, 2006, the Company sold Citadel Mall, Crossroads Mall and Northwest Arkansas Mall in a combined sale for $373.8 million. The net proceeds from these sales were used to pay down the Company's line of credit and to pay off the $75.0 million loan on Paradise Valley Mall on January 2, 2007.    At December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all applicable loan covenants.    At December 31, 2006, the Company had cash and cash equivalents available of $269.4 million.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     The Company has an ownership interest in a number of joint ventures as detailed in Note 4 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. The Company accounts for those investments that it does not have a controlling interest or is not the primary beneficiary using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Company as "Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures." A pro rata share of the mortgage debt on these properties is shown in Item 2. PropertiesMortgage Debt.    54       The Macerich Company          In addition, certain joint ventures also have debt that could become recourse debt to the Company or its subsidiaries, in excess of it's pro rata share, should the joint ventures be unable to discharge the obligations of the related debt.    The following reflects the maximum amount of debt principal that could recourse to the Company at December 31, 2006 (in thousands):       Property       Recourse Debt       Maturity Date         Boulevard Shops     $4,280     12/16/2007    Chandler Village Center     4,290     12/19/2007             $8,570                The above amounts decreased $13.1 million from December 31, 2005.    Additionally, as of December 31, 2006, the Company is contingently liable for $6.1 million in letters of credit guaranteeing performance by the Company of certain obligations relating to the Centers. The Company does not believe that these letters of credit will result in a liability to the Company.     Long-term contractual obligations     The following is a schedule of long-term contractual obligations (as of December 31, 2006) for the consolidated Centers over the periods in which they are expected to be paid (in thousands):             Payment Due by Period      Contractual Obligations       Total       Less than  1 year       1 - 3  years       3 - 5  years       More than  five years         Long-term debt obligations (includes expected interest payments)     $6,084,855     $865,129     $1,313,134     $2,596,702     $1,309,890    Operating lease obligations     263,898     5,251     10,576     10,700     237,371    Purchase obligations     31,111     31,111                   Other long-term liabilities     304,575     304,575                            $6,684,439     $1,206,066     $1,323,710     $2,607,402     $1,547,261          Funds From Operations     The Company uses Funds from Operations ("FFO") in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers FFO and FFO diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") measures. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of depreciated operating properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO and FFO on a fully diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. This is especially true since FFO excludes real estate depreciation and amortization as the    The Macerich Company     55          Company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. FFO on a fully diluted basis is one of the measures investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities. FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by GAAP and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs.

The Westcor partnership units were converted to OP Units on July 27, 2004 which were subsequently redeemed for common stock on October 4, 2005.  (2) The computation of FFO diluted shares outstanding includes the effect of outstanding common stock options and restricted stock using the treasury method. It also assumes the conversion of MACWH, LP common and preferred units to the extent that it is dilutive to the FFO computation (See Note 12 " Acquisitions of the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements " ). The convertible debentures were dilutive for the year ended December 31, 2002 and were included in the FFO calculation. The convertible debentures were paid off in full on December 13, 2002. On February 25, 1998, the Company sold $100 million of its Series A Preferred Stock. On June 16, 1998, the Company sold $150 million of its Series B Preferred Stock. On September 9, 2003, 5.5 million shares of Series B Preferred Stock were converted into common shares. The preferred stock can be converted on a one-for-one basis for common stock. The then outstanding preferred shares are assumed converted for purposes of 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002 FFO diluted as they are dilutive to that calculation.   56       The Macerich Company          NAME="dm1004_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02669">      Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk         The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with appropriately matching maturities, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity.     The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2006 concerning the Company's long term debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value ("FV") (dollars in thousands):             For the years ending December 31,                              2007       2008       2009       2010       2011       Thereafter       Total       FV         CONSOLIDATED CENTERS:                                              Long term debt:                                                       Fixed rate(1)     $134,750     $324,881     $356,932     $1,036,099     $721,632     $1,238,701     $3,812,995     $3,431,970       Average interest rate     6.00%     6.00%     6.00%     5.90%     5.70%     5.80%     5.99%             Floating rate     444,756     144,324     7,304     584,500               1,180,884     1,180,884       Average interest rate     6.60%     6.50%     6.50%     6.40%               6.59%             Total debt Consolidated Centers     $579,506     $469,205     $364,236     $1,620,599     $721,632     $1,238,701     $4,993,879     $4,612,854       JOINT VENTURE CENTERS:                                                            Long term debt (at Company's pro rata share):                                                       Fixed rate     $131,364     $85,362     $222,323     $121,132     $32,928     $872,907     $1,466,016     $1,502,388       Average interest rate     6.00%     6.00%     6.20%     5.90%     5.90%     5.80%     5.84%             Floating rate     54,343     39,200     16,089          66,300     22,499     198,431     198,431       Average interest rate     6.30%     6.30%     6.20%          6.10%     6.20%     6.33%             Total debt Joint Venture Centers     $185,707     $124,562     $238,412     $121,132     $99,228     $895,406     $1,664,447     $1,700,819          (1)  Fixed rate debt includes the $450 million floating rate term note and $400 million of the line of credit balance. These amounts have effective fixed rates over the remaining terms due to swap agreements as discussed below.   The consolidated Centers' total fixed rate debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $3.8 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. The average interest rate on fixed rate debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was 5.99% and 5.70%, respectively. The consolidated Centers' total floating rate debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $1.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. The average interest rate on floating rate debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was 6.59% and 5.80%, respectively.    The Company's pro rata share of the Joint Venture Centers' fixed rate debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The average interest rate on fixed rate debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was 5.84% and 6.60%, respectively. The Company's pro rata share of the Joint Venture Centers' floating rate debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $198.4 million and $250.3 million, respectively. The average interest rate on the floating rate debt was 6.33% and 5.20%, respectively.     The Company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 133,    The Macerich Company     57           "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (See "Note 5 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements).

Interest rate cap agreements ("Cap") offer protection against floating rates on the notional amount from exceeding the rates noted in the above schedule and interest rate swap agreements ("Swap") effectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a fixed rate as noted above.    In addition, the Company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $13.8 million per year based on $1.4 billion outstanding of floating rate debt at December 31, 2006.    The fair value of the Company's long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration.    58       The Macerich Company        NAME="page_do1004_1_59">        NAME="do1004_item_8._financial_statements_and_supplementary_data">      Item 8.
