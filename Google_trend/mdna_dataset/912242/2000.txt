ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GENERAL BACKGROUND AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT           The Company believes that the most significant measures of its operating performance are Funds from Operations and EBITDA. Funds from Operations is defined as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales or write-down of assets, plus depreciation and amortization (excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis. Funds from Operations does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs.           EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, minority interest, equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated entities, extraordinary items, gain (loss) on sale of assets and preferred dividends. This data is relevant to an understanding of the economics of the shopping center business as it indicates cash flow available from operations to service debt and satisfy certain fixed obligations. EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of liquidity. While the performance of individual Centers and the Management Companies determines EBITDA, the Company's capital structure also influences Funds from Operations. The most important component in determining EBITDA and Funds from Operations is Center revenues. Center revenues consist primarily of minimum rents, percentage rents and tenant expense recoveries. Minimum rents will increase to the extent that new leases are signed at market rents that are higher than prior rents. Minimum rents will also fluctuate up or down with changes in the occupancy level. Additionally, to the extent that new leases are signed with more favorable expense recovery terms, expense recoveries will increase.           Percentage rents generally increase or decrease with changes in tenant sales. As leases roll over, however, a portion of historical percentage rent is often converted to minimum rent. It is therefore common for percentage rents to decrease as minimum rents increase. Accordingly, in discussing financial performance, the Company combines minimum and percentage rents in order to better measure revenue growth.           The following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997. The following discussion compares the activity for the year ended December 31, 1999 to results of operations for 1998. Also included is a comparison of the activities for the year ended December 31, 1998 to the results for the year ended December 31, 1997. This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

Many factors impact the Company's ability to acquire additional properties; including the availability and cost of capital, the overall debt to market capitalization level, interest rates and availability of potential acquisition targets that meet the Company's criteria. Accordingly, management is uncertain whether during the balance of 2000, and in future years, there will be similar acquisitions and corresponding increases in revenues, net income and FFO that occurred as a result of the 1999 and 1998 Acquisition Centers. Management anticipates the pace of acquisitions to slow considerably in 2000 compared to 1999 and 1998. Pacific View (formerly known as Buenaventura Mall), Crossroads Mall-Boulder, Huntington Center and Parklane Mall are currently under redevelopment and are referred to herein as the "Redevelopment Centers." Huntington Center was sold on November 16, 1999. All other Centers, excluding the 1999 and 1998 Acquisition Centers and Redevelopment Centers, are referred to herein as the "Same Centers", unless the context otherwise requires.           The bankruptcy and/or closure of an Anchor, or its sale to a less desirable retailer, could adversely affect customer traffic in a Center and thereby reduce the income generated by that Center. Furthermore, the closing of an Anchor could, under certain circumstances, allow certain other Anchors or other tenants to terminate their leases or cease operating their stores at the Center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the Center. Other retail stores at the Centers may also seek the protection of bankruptcy laws and/or close stores, which could result in the termination of such tenants leases and thus cause a reduction in cash flow generated by the Centers.           In addition, the Company's success in the highly competitive real estate shopping center business depends upon many other factors, including general economic conditions, the ability of tenants to make rent payments, increases or decreases in operating expenses, occupancy levels, changes in demographics, competition from other centers and forms of retailing and the ability to renew leases or relet space upon the expiration or termination of leases.  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES           Total assets increased to $2,404 million at December 31, 1999 compared to $2,322 million at December 31, 1998 and $1,505 million at December 31, 1997. During that same period, total liabilities increased from $1,188 million in 1997 to $1,579 million in 1998 and $1,626 million in 1999. These changes were primarily a result of the 1998 common stock offerings of 7,920,181 shares, the 1998 preferred stock offerings of 9,114,602 shares, the 1997 offering of $161.4 million of debentures, the purchase of the 1999, 1998 and 1997 Acquisition Centers and related debt transactions.   A. ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURE DEVELOPMENTS           On February 18, 1999, the Company, through a 51/49 joint venture with Ontario Teachers closed on the first phase of a two phase acquisition of a portfolio of properties. The phase one closing included the acquisition of three regional malls, the retail component of a mixed-use development, five contiguous properties and two non-contiguous community shopping centers comprising approximately 3.6 million square feet for a total purchase price of approximately $427.0 million. The purchase price was funded with a $120.0 million loan placed concurrently with the closing, $140.4 million of debt from an affiliate of the seller, and $39.4 million of assumed debt. The balance of the purchase price was paid in cash. The Company's share of the cash component was funded with the proceeds from two refinancings of Centers and borrowings under the Company's line of credit. On July 12, 1999, the Company closed on the second phase of the acquisition. The second phase consisted of the acquisition of the office component of the mixed-use development for a purchase price of approximately $111.0 million. The purchase price was funded with a $76.7 million loan placed concurrently with the closing and the balance was paid in cash. The Company's share of the cash component was funded from borrowings under the Company's line of credit. The two non-contiguous community shopping centers were subsequently sold in October and November of 1999.           On June 2, 1999, Cerritos, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Macerich Management Company, acquired Los Cerritos Center, a 1,304,262 square foot super regional mall in Cerritos, California. The total purchase price was $188.0 million, which was funded with $120.0 million of debt placed concurrently with the closing and a $70.8 million loan from the Company. The Company funded this loan from borrowings under a $60.0 million bank loan agreement and the balance from the Company's line of credit.                                          25    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONTINUED:   ASSETS AND LIABILITIES - CONTINUED:           On October 26, 1999, 49% of the membership interests of Stonewood, Cerritos and Lakewood were sold to Ontario Teachers' and concurrently Ontario Teachers' and the Company contributed their 99% collective membership interests in Stonewood and Cerritos and 100% of their collective membership interests in Lakewood to PPRT, a real estate investment trust, owned approximately 51% by the Company and 49% by Ontario Teachers. Lakewood, Stonewood, and Cerritos own Lakewood Mall, Stonewood Mall and Los Cerritos Center, respectively. The total value of the transaction was approximately $535.0 million. The properties were contributed to PPRT subject to existing debt of $322.0 million. The net cash proceeds to the Company were approximately $104.0 million which were used for reduction of debt and for general corporate purposes.           On October 29, 1999, Macerich Santa Monica, LLC, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, acquired Santa Monica Place, a 560,623 square foot regional mall located in Santa Monica, California. The total purchase price was $130.8 million, which was funded with $80.0 million of debt placed concurrently with the closing with the balance funded from proceeds from the PPRT transaction described above.  B. REFINANCINGS           On February 4, 1999, the Company refinanced the debt on Queens Center. A $65.1 million floating rate loan was paid in full and a new note was issued for $100.0 million bearing interest at a fixed rate of 6.88% and maturing March 1, 2009.           On February 17, 1999, the Company refinanced the debt on South Plains Mall. A $28.4 million loan, at an effective interest rate of 6.3%, was paid in full and a new note was issued for $65.0 million bearing interest at a fixed rate of 8.22% and maturing March 1, 2009.           On April 30, 1999, the Company refinanced the debt on Carmel Plaza. A $25.0 million floating rate loan was paid in full and a new note was issued for $29.0 million bearing interest at a fixed rate of 8.18% and maturing May 1, 2009.           On October 8, 1999, the Company refinanced the debt on Village at Corte Madera. A $60.0 million floating rate loan was paid in full and a new note was issued for $72.0 million bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.75% and maturing November 1, 2009.  C. OTHER EVENTS           On November 15, 1999, the Company redeemed $25.1 million of OP Units of the Operating Partnership for cash from various unit holders. A total of 1,266,687 of OP Units were redeemed for cash at the Company's option in lieu of exchanging common stock for OP Units.           On November 16, 1999, the Company sold Huntington Center. Huntington Center is a shopping center located in Huntington Beach, California, that was purchased by the Company in December 1996. The Center was purchased as part of a package with Fresno Fashion Fair in Fresno, California, and Pacific View (formerly know as Buenaventura Mall) in Ventura, California. The Center was sold for $48.0 million and the net cash proceeds from the sale were used for general corporate purposes.                                          26    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 AND 1998        REVENUES              Minimum and percentage rents increased by 14.1% to $219.7 million in       1999 from $192.6 million in 1998. Approximately $26.3 million of the       increase resulted from the 1998 Acquisition Centers, $1.9 million from the       1999 acquisition of Santa Monica Place and $5.2 million of the increase       was attributable to the Same Centers. These increases were partially       offset by revenue decreases at the Redevelopment Centers of $2.1 million       in 1999 and $4.2 million of the decrease related to the contribution of       100% and 99% of the membership interests of Lakewood Mall and Stonewood       Mall, respectively, to the PPRT joint venture on October 26,1999.              Tenant recoveries increased to $99.1 million in 1999 from $86.7       million in 1998. The 1998 Acquisition Centers generated $12.9 million of       this increase, $1.3 million was from the acquisition of Santa Monica       Place, and $1.9 million of the increase was from the Same Centers. These       increases were partially offset by revenue decreases at the Redevelopment       Centers of $2.1 million in 1999 and $1.6 million of the decrease resulted       from the contribution of Lakewood Mall and Stonewood Mall to the PPRT       joint venture.              Other income increased to $8.6 million in 1999 from $4.5 million in       1998. Approximately $0.7 million of the increase related to the 1998       Acquisition Centers and the 1999 acquisition of Santa Monica Place, and       $3.7 million of the increase was attributable to the Same Centers.        EXPENSES              Shopping center expenses increased to $100.3 million in 1999       compared to $90.0 million in 1998. Approximately $13.2 million of the       increase resulted from the 1998 Acquisition Centers and the 1999       acquisition of Santa Monica Place and $1.1 million of the increase       resulted from increased property taxes and recoverable expenses at the       Same Centers. The Redevelopment Centers had a net decrease of $2.0 million       in shopping center expenses resulting primarily from decreased property       taxes and recoverable expenses. The contribution of Lakewood Mall and       Stonewood Mall to the PPRT joint venture resulted in $2.0 million of this       decrease.              General and administrative expenses increased to $5.5 million in       1999 from $4.4 million in 1998 primarily as a result of the accounting       change required by EITF 97-11, "Accounting for Internal Costs Relating to       Real Estate Property Acquisitions," which requires the expensing of       internal acquisition costs. Previously in accordance with GAAP, certain       internal acquisition costs were capitalized. The increase is also       attributable to higher executive and director compensation expense.        INTEREST EXPENSE              Interest expense increased to $113.3 million in 1999 from $91.4       million in 1998. This increase of $22.1 million is primarily attributable       to the acquisition activity in 1998 and 1999, which was partially funded       with secured debt and borrowings under the Company's line of credit.        DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION              Depreciation increased to $61.4 million from $53.1 million in 1998.       This increase relates primarily to the 1998 and 1999 Acquisition Centers.        MINORITY INTEREST              The minority interest represents the 26.3% weighted average interest       of the Operating Partnership that was not owned by the Company during       1999. This compares to 28.4% not owned by the Company during 1998.        INCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AND MANAGEMENT COMPANIES              The income from unconsolidated joint ventures and the Management       Companies was $25.9 million for 1999, compared to income of $14.5 million       in 1998. A total of $3.2 million of the change is attributable to the 1998       acquisitions of SDG Macerich Properties, L.P. and $7.9 million of the       change is attributable to the 1999 acquisitions by Pacific Premier Retail       Trust.                                          27    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONTINUED:  COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 AND 1998        GAIN ON SALE OF ASSETS              A gain on sale of assets of $96.0 million is a result of the Company       selling approximately 49% of the membership interests of Stonewood and       Lakewood to Ontario Teachers' in October 1999 and the Company's sale       of Huntington Center on November 16, 1999.        EXTRAORDINARY LOSS FROM EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT              In 1999, the Company wrote off $1.5 million of unamortized financing       costs, compared to $2.4 million written off in 1998.        NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS              As a result of the foregoing, including the gain on sale of assets,       net income available to common stockholders increased to $110.9 million in       1999 from $32.5 million in 1998.        OPERATING ACTIVITIES              Cash flow from operations was $139.6 million in 1999 compared to       $85.2 million in 1998. The increase is primarily because of increased net       operating income from the 1998 and 1999 Acquisition Centers.        INVESTING ACTIVITIES              Cash flow used in investing activities was $247.7 million in 1999       compared to $761.1 million in 1998. The change resulted primarily from the       cash contributions required by the Company for the joint venture       acquisitions of $240.2 million in 1998 compared to $116.9 million in 1999,       and the proceeds from the sale of assets in 1999 of $106.9 million.        FINANCING ACTIVITIES              Cash flow from financing activities was $123.4 million in 1999       compared to $676.0 million in 1998. The decrease resulted from no equity       offerings in 1999 compared to 7,920,181 shares of common stock sold in       1998. Additionally, 9,114,602 shares of preferred stock were sold in the       first and second quarters of 1998.        EBITDA AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS              Primarily because of the factors mentioned above, EBITDA increased       16.9% to $221.6 million in 1999 from $189.5 million in 1998 and Funds from       Operations - Diluted increased 36.3% to $164.3 million from $120.5 million       in 1998.                                           28     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONTINUED:  COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1997         REVENUES              Minimum and percentage rents increased by 27% to $192.6 million in       1998 from $151.5 million in 1997. Approximately $18.9 million of the       increase resulted from the 1997 Acquisition Centers, $18.8 million       resulted from the 1998 Acquisition Centers and $5.0 million of the       increase was attributable to the Same Centers. These increases were       partially offset by revenue decreases at the Redevelopment Centers of $1.6       million in 1998.              Tenant recoveries increased to $86.7 million in 1998 from $66.5       million in 1997. The 1998 and 1997 Acquisition Centers generated $17.7       million of this increase and $2.2 million of the increase was from the       Same Centers.              Other income increased to $4.5 million in 1998 from $3.2 million in       1997. Approximately $0.6 million of the increase related to the 1998 and       1997 Acquisition Centers, $0.7 million of the increase was attributable to       the Same Centers and the Redevelopment Centers.        EXPENSES              Shopping center expenses increased to $90.0 million in 1998 compared       to $70.9 million in 1997. Approximately $17.3 million of the increase       resulted from the 1998 and 1997 Acquisition Centers. The other Centers had       a net increase of $1.8 million in shopping center expenses resulting       primarily from increased property taxes and recoverable expenses.              General and administrative expenses increased to $4.4 million in       1998 from $2.8 million in 1997 primarily due to the accounting change       required by EITF 97-11, "Accounting for Internal Costs Relating to Real       Estate Property Acquisitions," which requires the expensing of internal       acquisition costs. Previously in accordance with GAAP, certain internal       acquisition costs were capitalized. The increase is also attributable to       higher executive and director compensation expense.         INTEREST EXPENSE              Interest expense increased to $91.4 million in 1998 from $66.4       million in 1997. This increase of $25.0 million is primarily attributable       to the acquisition activity in 1997 and 1998, which was partially funded       with secured debt and borrowings under the Company's line of credit. In       addition, in June and July of 1997, the Company issued $161.4 million of       convertible debentures, which contributed to $5.7 million of this       increase.        DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION              Depreciation and amortization increased to $53.1 million from $41.5       million in 1997. This increase relates primarily to the 1997 and 1998       Acquisition Centers.         MINORITY INTEREST              The minority interest represents the 28.4% weighted average interest       of the Operating Partnership that was not owned by the Company during       1998. This compares to 31.8% not owned by the Company during 1997.                                          29     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONTINUED:  COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1997 - CONTINUED:        INCOME (LOSS) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AND MANAGEMENT COMPANIES              The income from unconsolidated joint ventures and the Management       Companies was $14.5 million for 1998, compared to a loss of $8.1 million       in 1997. A total of $14.5 million of the change is attributable to the       1998 acquisition of the ERE/Yarmouth portfolio. Also, in 1997, there was a       write-down and loss of $10.5 million on the sale of North Valley Plaza.        GAIN ON SALE OF ASSETS              During 1997, the Company sold a parcel of land for a net gain of       $1.6 million compared to a minimal amount of gain on sale recognized in       1998.        EXTRAORDINARY LOSS FROM EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT              In 1998, the Company wrote off $2.4 million of unamortized financing       costs, compared to $0.6 million written off in 1997.        NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS              As a result of the foregoing, net income available to common       stockholders increased to $32.5 million in 1998 from $22.0 million in       1997.        OPERATING ACTIVITIES              Cash flow from operations was $85.2 million in 1998 compared to       $78.4 million in 1997. The increase resulted from the factors discussed       above, primarily the impact of the 1997 and 1998 Acquisition Centers.        INVESTING ACTIVITIES              Cash flow used in investing activities was $761.1 million in 1998       compared to $215.0 million in 1997. The change resulted primarily from the       higher volume of acquisition activity completed in 1998 compared to 1997.        FINANCING ACTIVITIES              Cash flow from financing activities was $676.0 million in 1998       compared to $146.0 million in 1997. The increase resulted from the       offerings of 7,920,181 shares of common stock, 3,627,131 shares of Series       A Preferred Stock and 5,487,471 shares of Series B Preferred Stock       completed in 1998. No equity was raised in 1997.        EBITDA AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS              Primarily because of the factors mentioned above, EBITDA increased       28% to $189.5 million in 1998 from $147.6 million in 1997 and Funds from       Operations - Diluted increased 44% to $120.5 million from $83.4 million in       1997.                                              30          LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES              The Company intends to meet its short term liquidity requirements       through cash generated from operations and working capital reserves. The       Company anticipates that revenues will continue to provide necessary funds       for its operating expenses and debt service requirements, and to pay       dividends to stockholders in accordance with REIT requirements. The       Company anticipates that cash generated from operations, together with       cash on hand, will be adequate to fund capital expenditures which will not       be reimbursed by tenants, other than non-recurring capital expenditures.       Capital for major expenditures or major redevelopments has been, and is       expected to continue to be, obtained from equity or debt financings which       include borrowings under the Company's line of credit and construction       loans. However, many factors impact the Company's ability to access       capital, such as its overall debt to market capitalization level, interest       rates, interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions. The       Company currently is undertaking a $90 million redevelopment of Pacific       View. See "Item 2. Properties." The Company has a bank construction loan       agreement to fund $89.2 million of these construction costs.              The Company believes that it will have access to the capital       necessary to expand its business in accordance with its strategies for       growth and maximizing Funds from Operations. The Company presently intends       to obtain additional capital necessary to expand its business through a       combination of additional public and private equity offerings, debt       financings and/or joint ventures. During 1998 and 1999, the Company       acquired two portfolios through joint ventures. The Company believes such       joint venture arrangements provide an attractive alternative to other       forms of financing. See "Acquisitions and Joint Venture Developments."              The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness at December 31,       1999 was $2.2 billion (including its pro rata share of joint venture       debt). This equated to a debt to Total Market Capitalization (defined as       total debt of the Company, including its pro rata share of joint venture       debt, plus aggregate market value of outstanding shares of common stock,       assuming full conversion of OP Units and preferred stock into common       stock) ratio of approximately 66% at December 31, 1999. The Company's debt       consists primarily of fixed-rate conventional mortgages payable secured by       individual properties. See "Properties-Mortgage Debt" for a description of       the Company's outstanding mortgage indebtedness.              The Company has filed a shelf registration statement, effective       December 8, 1997, to sell securities. The shelf registration is for a       total of $500 million of common stock, common stock warrants or common       stock rights. During 1998, the Company sold a total of 7,920,181 shares of       common stock under this shelf registration. The aggregate offering price       of these transactions was approximately $212.9 million, leaving       approximately $287.1 million available under the shelf registration       statement.              The Company has an unsecured line of credit for up to $150.0       million. There was $57.4 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31,       1999.              At December 31, 1999, the Company had cash and cash equivalents       available of $40.5 million.                                        31          YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE        THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BELOW CONTAINS YEAR 2000 STATEMENTS AND IS A YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO PUB. L. NO. 105-271.        YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE PROGRAM        Approximately two years ago, the Company initiated a Year 2000 compliance program which consisted of the following phases: (1) identification of Year 2000 issues; (2) assessment of Year 2000 compliance of systems; (3) remediation or replacement of non-compliant systems; (4) testing of critical systems to verify compliance; and (5) contingency planning, as appropriate. This program included a review of both information technology ("IT") and non-IT systems of the Company's offices and the Centers in which the Company has an ownership interest and manages. In addition, material tenants, anchors and vendors of the Centers were surveyed for Year 2000 compliance and contingency plans were prepared for each Center.        YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE PROGRAM RESULTS        Two of the key dates of the Company's Year 2000 program were January 1, 2000 and February 29, 2000. The Company encountered no Year 2000 compliance issues with any operating system, material tenant, anchor and/or vendor on either date because the Company was able to successfully identify and address the potential Year 2000 issues in advance.        COSTS        The Company was able to minimize costs by using its own personnel to administer the Year 2000 program. No outside consultants or third parties were hired except for testing purposes. The preliminary final costs for the Company's Year 2000 program were approximately $120,000 and consisted of the following:        (a)   IT SYSTEMS: One IT hardware system needed a Year 2000 upgrade at a             cost of $13,100.        (b)   NON-IT SYSTEMS: Certain critical systems, 14 energy management             systems, five telephone systems, two fire alarm systems, one             security alarm system, one CCTV system, one HVAC system and one             elevator intercom system required Year 2000 upgrades. Replacement             and/or remediation of all non-IT systems at the Centers and offices             cost the Company approximately $47,194.        (c)   ELECTRICAL INSPECTION: The electrical infrastructure of each Center             was inspected to ensure Year 2000 compliance at an estimated cost of             approximately $13,230.        (d)   TESTING OF CRITICAL SYSTEM: All date-sensitive critical operating             systems at each Center and office were tested to ensure Year 2000             compliance. In most cases outside vendors tested the system and             charged a fee. The Company's total testing costs were approximately             $9,125.        (e)   SECURITY CONTINGENCY PLANS: Each Center implemented security             contingency plans. The aggregate costs of approximately $37,500             included the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and             obtaining necessary equipment and back-up supplies ranging from             emergency generators to flashlights.        (f)   PERSONNEL: The Company did not separately record the internal costs             incurred for its Year 2000 compliance program. Such costs are             primarily the related payroll costs for its personnel who were part             of the Year 2000 program.                                           32    FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS        The Company believes that the most significant measure of its performance is FFO. FFO is defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") to be: Net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales or write-down of assets, plus depreciation and amortization (excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash flow from operations, as defined by GAAP, and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The following reconciles net income available to common stockholders to FFO:                                                                         1999                        1998                                                             -----------------------     ----------------------                                                              Shares        Amount        Shares        Amount                                                             ---------     ---------     ---------    ---------                                                                            (amounts in thousands)          Net income - available to common stockholders                             $ 110,873                  $  32,528  Adjustments to reconcile net income to FFO-basic:     Minority interest                                                         38,335                     12,902    Loss on early extinguishment of debt                                       1,478                      2,435    Gain on sale of wholly-owned assets                                      (95,981)                        (9)    Loss on sale or write-down of assets from       unconsolidated entities (pro rata)                                        193                        143    Depreciation and amortization on wholly owned centers                     61,383                     53,141    Depreciation and amortization on joint ventures and       from the management companies (pro rata)                               19,715                     10,879  Less: depreciation on personal property and       amortization of loan costs and interest rate caps                      (4,271)                    (3,716)                                                                           ---------                  --------- FFO - basic (1)                                                46,130     $ 131,725        43,016    $ 108,303  Additional adjustment to arrive at FFO-diluted     Impact of convertible preferred stock                        9,115        18,138         6,058       11,547    Impact of stock options and restricted stock using       the treasury method                                         462         1,823           612          668    Impact of convertible debentures                             5,186        12,616        (n/a anti-dilutive)                                                             ---------     ---------     ---------    ---------  FFO - diluted (2)                                              60,893     $ 164,302        49,686    $ 120,518                                                             =========     =========     =========    =========                                          33          FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, CONTINUED:        (1)   Calculated based upon basic net income as adjusted to reach basic             FFO. Weighted average number of shares includes the weighted average             shares of common stock outstanding for 1999 assuming the conversion             of all outstanding OP Units.        (2)   The computation of FFO - diluted and diluted average number of             shares outstanding includes the effect of outstanding common stock             options and restricted stock using the treasury method. Convertible             debentures for the twelve month period ending December 31, 1998 were             anti-dilutive and were not included in the FFO calculation. The             debentures are dilutive at December 31, 1999 and are included in the             FFO calculation. On February 25, 1998, the Company sold $100 million             of its Series A Preferred Stock. On June 17, 1998, the Company sold             $150 million of its Series B Preferred Stock. The preferred stock             can be converted on a one-for-one basis for common stock. The             preferred shares are assumed converted for purposes of 1999 net             income as they are dilutive to that calculation. The preferred             shares are anti-dilutive to net income for 1998. The preferred             shares are assumed converted for purposes of FFO-diluted per share             as they are dilutive to that calculation.        Included in minimum rents were rents attributable to the accounting       practice of straight lining of rents. The amount of straight lining of       rents that impacted minimum rents was $2,628,000 for 1999, $3,814,000 for       1998 and $3,599,000 for 1997.  INFLATION           In the last three years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most of the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on increases in the Consumer Price Index. In addition, many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years, which enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. Additionally, most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses. This reduces the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.  SEASONALITY           The shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels. In addition, shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season. As a result of the above, plus the accounting change discussed below for percentage rent, earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter of each year.  NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED           In May 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), through the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF"), modified the timing of recognition of revenue for percentage rent received from tenants in EITF 98-9, "Accounting for Contingent Rent in Interim Financial Periods" ("EITF 98-9"). The Company applied this accounting change as of April 1, 1998. The accounting change had the effect of deferring $3,241,000, including the pro rata share of joint ventures, of percentage rent from the second and third quarters of 1998 to the quarter ended December 31, 1998. During the fourth quarter of 1998, the FASB reversed EITF 98-9. Accordingly, the Company resumed accounting for percentage rent on the accrual basis for 1999. In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Committee issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," ("SAB 101") which will be effective for periods beginning after December 15, 1999. This bulletin again modified the timing of revenue recognition for percentage rent received from tenants and adopted the method mandated by EITF 98-9. The Company expects this change to defer recognition of a significant amount of percentage rent for the first three calendar quarters into the fourth quarter. The Company applied this accounting change as of January 1, 2000. Estimates of the effects of this change have not yet been determined.           In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," ("SFAS 133") which requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet, measured at fair value. Changes in the fair values of those derivatives will be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which delays the implementation of SFAS 133 from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2001. The Company has not yet determined when it will implement SFAS 133 nor has it completed the analysis required to determine the impact on its financial statements.                                         34   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK              The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk.       The Company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by       (1) maintaining a conservative ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to       total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable       level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term variable       rate debt through the use of interest rate caps with appropriately       matching maturities, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to       fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of       favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity.              The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 1999       concerning the Company's long term debt obligations, including principal       cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and       estimated fair value ("FV"):                                                   For the Years Ended December 31,                                                     (dollars in thousands)                                      2000        2001        2002        2003        2004      Thereafter     Total         FV                                    ---------   ---------   ---------   ---------   ---------   ----------   ----------   ----------                  Long term debt:      Fixed rate                     $  39,264   $ 108,479   $  11,717   $ 101,229   $ 127,705   $  801,263   $1,189,657   $1,130,015     Average interest rate               7.40%       7.37%       7.37%       7.33%       7.34%        7.34%        7.38%          --     Fixed rate - Debentures               --          --     161,400          --          --           --      161,400      157,175     Average interest rate                 --          --        7.25%         --          --           --         7.25%          --     Variable rate                         --     210,069          --          --          --           --      210,069      210,069     Average interest rate                 --        7.37%         --          --          --           --         7.37%          --                                    ---------   ---------   ---------   ---------   ---------   ----------   ----------   ----------  Total debt - Wholly owned Centers  $  39,264   $ 318,548   $ 173,117   $ 101,229   $ 127,705   $  801,263   $1,561,126   $1,497,259                                    ---------   ---------   ---------   ---------   ---------   ----------   ----------   ----------  Joint Venture Centers: (at Company's pro rata share)      Fixed rate                     $  26,515   $   6,498   $   6,939   $   7,413   $   7,913   $  452,146   $  507,424   $  461,553     Average interest rate               6.65%       6.65%       6.65%       6.65%       6.65%        6.55%        6.64%          --     Variable rate                         --      38,250          --      92,500          --           --      130,750      130,750     Average interest rate                 --        8.23%         --        6.15%         --           --         6.76%          --                                    ---------   ---------   ---------   ---------   ---------   ----------   ----------   ----------  Total debt - Joint Ventures        $  26,515   $  44,748   $   6,939   $  99,913   $   7,913   $  452,146   $  638,174   $  592,303                                    ---------   ---------   ---------   ---------   ---------   ----------   ----------   ----------  Total debt - All Centers           $  65,779   $ 363,296   $ 180,056   $ 201,142   $ 135,618   $1,253,409   $2,199,300   $2,089,562                                    =========   =========   =========   =========   =========   ==========   ==========   ==========          $57.4 million of variable debt maturing in 2001 represents the outstanding       borrowings under the Company's credit facility. The credit facility       matures in February 2001.        In addition, the Company has assessed the market risk for its variable       rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease       future earnings and cash flows by approximately $3.4 million per year       based on $340.8 million outstanding at December 31, 1999.        The fair value of the Company's long term debt is estimated based on       discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflects       the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration.
