ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         GENERAL BACKGROUND AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT     The Company believes that the most significant measures of its operating performance are Funds from Operations and EBITDA. Funds from Operations is defined as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring, sales or write-down of assets and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, plus depreciation and amortization (excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis. Funds from Operations does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs.    EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, minority interest, equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated entities, extraordinary items, gain (loss) on sale of assets, preferred dividends and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. This data is relevant to an understanding of the economics of the shopping center business as it indicates cash flow available from operations to service debt and satisfy certain fixed obligations. EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of liquidity. While the performance of individual Centers and the Management Companies determines EBITDA, the Company's capital structure also influences Funds from Operations. The most important component in determining EBITDA and Funds from Operations is Center revenues. Center revenues consist primarily of minimum rents, percentage rents and tenant expense recoveries. Minimum rents will increase to the extent that new leases are signed at market rents that are higher than prior rents. Minimum rents will also fluctuate up or down with changes in the occupancy level. Additionally, to the extent that new leases are signed with more favorable expense recovery terms, expense recoveries will increase.    Percentage rents generally increase or decrease with changes in tenant sales. As leases roll over, however, a portion of historical percentage rent is often converted to minimum rent. It is therefore common for percentage rents to decrease as minimum rents increase. Accordingly, in discussing financial performance, the Company combines minimum and percentage rents in order to better measure revenue growth.    The following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998. The following discussion compares the activity for the year ended December 31, 2000 to results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1999.    24          Also included is a comparison of the activities for the year ended December 31, 1999 to the results for the year ended December 31, 1998. This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

There were no acquisitions in 2000.             Date Acquired                                 Location         "1998 Acquisition Centers":                   SDG Macerich Properties, L.P.(*)      February 27, 1998      Twelve properties in eight states    South Plains Mall     June 19, 1998     Lubbock, Texas    Westside Pavilion     July 1, 1998     Los Angeles, California    Village at Corte Madera     June-July 1998     Corte Madera, California    Carmel Plaza     August 10, 1998     Carmel, California    Northwest Arkansas Mall     December 15, 1998     Fayetteville, Arkansas       "1999 Acquisition Centers":                   Pacific Premier Retail Trust(*)     February 18, 1999     Three regional malls, retail component of a mixed-use development and five contiguous properties in Washington and Oregon. The office component of the mixed-used development was acquired July 12, 1999.    PPR Albany Plaza LLC(*)  PPR Eastland Plaza LLC(*)     February 18, 1999     Two non-contiguous community shopping Centers located in Oregon and Ohio, respectively.    Los Cerritos Center(*)     June 2, 1999     Cerritos, California    Santa Monica Place     October 29, 1999     Santa Monica, California          (*)  denotes the Company owns its interests in these Centers through an unconsolidated joint venture or through one of the Management Companies.     The financial statements include the results of these Centers for periods subsequent to their acquisition.    On February 18, 1999, the Company formed Pacific Premier Retail Trust ("PPRT"), a 51/49 joint venture with Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board ("Ontario Teachers"), which closed on the acquisition of three regional malls, the retail component of a mixed-use development, five contiguous properties and two non-contiguous community shopping centers comprising approximately 3.6 million square feet for a total purchase price of approximately $427.0 million. On July 12, 1999, the Company closed on the acquisition of the office component of the mixed-use development for a purchase price of approximately $111.0 million.    On June 2, 1999, Macerich Cerritos, LLC ("Cerritos"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Macerich Management Company, acquired Los Cerritos Center, a 1,302,374 square foot super regional mall in Cerritos, California. The total purchase price was $188.0 million, which was funded with $120.0 million of debt placed concurrently with the closing and a $70.8 million loan from the Company.    On October 26, 1999, 49% of the membership interests of Macerich Stonewood, LLC ("Stonewood"), Cerritos and Macerich Lakewood, LLC ("Lakewood"), were sold to Ontario Teachers' and concurrently    26          Ontario Teachers' and the Company contributed their 99% collective membership interests in Stonewood and Cerritos and 100% of their collective membership interests in Lakewood to PPRT, a real estate investment trust, owned approximately 51% by the Company and 49% by Ontario Teachers. Lakewood, Stonewood, and Cerritos own Lakewood Mall, Stonewood Mall and Los Cerritos Center, respectively. The total value of the transaction was approximately $535.0 million. The properties were contributed to PPRT subject to existing debt of $322.0 million. The net cash proceeds to the Company were approximately $104.0 million, which were used for reduction of debt and for general corporate purposes. Lakewood and Stonewood are referred to herein as the "Contributed JV Assets."    On October 27, 1999, Albany Plaza, a 145,462 square foot community center, which was owned 51% by the Macerich Management Company, was sold.    On October 29, 1999, Macerich Santa Monica, LLC, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, acquired Santa Monica Place, a 560,421 square foot regional mall located in Santa Monica, California. The total purchase price was $130.8 million, which was funded with $80.0 million of debt placed concurrently with the closing with the balance funded from proceeds from the PPRT transaction described above. Santa Monica Place is referred to herein as the "1999 Acquisition Center."    On November 12, 1999, Eastland Plaza, a 65,313 square foot community center, which was 51% owned by the Macerich Management Company, was sold.    On November 16, 1999, the Company sold Huntington Center. Huntington Center is a shopping center located in Huntington Beach, California, that was purchased by the Company in December 1996. The Center was purchased as part of a package with Fresno Fashion Fair in Fresno, California, and Pacific View (formerly known as Buenaventura Mall) in Ventura, California. The Center was sold for $48.0 million and the net cash proceeds from the sale were used for general corporate purposes.    On September 30, 2000, Manhattan Village, a 551,847 square foot, regional shopping center, which was owned 10% by the Operating Partnership, was sold. The joint venture sold the property for $89.0 million, including a note receivable from the buyer for $79.0 million at an interest rate of 8.75% payable monthly, until its maturity date of September 30, 2001.    The properties acquired by SDG Macerich Properties, L.P., PPRT and the Management Companies ("Joint Venture Acquisitions") are reflected using the equity method of accounting. The results of these acquisitions are reflected in the consolidated results of operations of the Company in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures and the Management Companies.    Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred due to the Joint Venture Acquisition Centers, the 1999 and 1998 Acquisition Centers and the partial sale and contribution of the Contributed JV Assets to PPRT during 1999. Many factors impact the Company's ability to acquire additional properties; including the availability and cost of capital, the overall debt to market capitalization level, interest rates and availability of potential acquisition targets that meet the Company's criteria. There were no acquisitions in 2000 because of market conditions, including the cost of capital and the lack of attractive opportunities. Furthermore, management currently anticipates no acquisitions for 2001. Accordingly, management is uncertain whether in future years that there will be similar acquisitions and corresponding increases in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures    27          and the Management Companies and funds from operations that occurred as a result of the Joint Venture Acquisition Centers and the 1998 and 1999 Acquisition Centers. Pacific View (formerly known as Buenaventura Mall), Crossroads Mall-Boulder and Parklane Mall are currently under redevelopment and are referred to herein as the "Redevelopment Centers." All other Centers, excluding the 1999 and 1998 Acquisition Centers, the Joint Venture Acquisition Centers, the Contributed JV Assets and Redevelopment Centers, are referred to herein as the "Same Centers," unless the context otherwise requires.    Revenues include rents attributable to the accounting practice of straight lining of rents which requires rent to be recognized each year in an amount equal to the average rent over the term of the lease, including fixed rent increases over that period. The amount of straight lined rents, included in consolidated revenues, recognized in 2000 was $0.9 million compared to $2.6 million in 1999. Additionally, the Company recognized through equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures, $2.2 million as its pro rata share of straight lined rents from joint ventures in 2000 compared to $2.3 million in 1999. These decreases resulted from the Company structuring the majority of its new leases using annual Consumer Price Index ("CPI") increases, which generally do not require straight lining treatment. The Company believes that using CPI increases, rather than fixed contractual rent increases, results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases.    The bankruptcy and/or closure of an Anchor, or its sale to a less desirable retailer, could adversely affect customer traffic in a Center and thereby reduce the income generated by that Center. Furthermore, the closing of an Anchor could, under certain circumstances, allow certain other Anchors or other tenants to terminate their leases or cease operating their stores at the Center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the Center. Other retail stores at the Centers may also seek the protection of bankruptcy laws and/or close stores, which could result in the termination of such tenants and thus cause a reduction in cash flow generated by the Centers.    In addition, the Company's success in the highly competitive real estate shopping center business depends upon many other factors, including general economic conditions, the ability of tenants to make rent payments, increases or decreases in operating expenses, occupancy levels, changes in demographics, competition from other centers and forms of retailing and the ability to renew leases or relet space upon the expiration or termination of leases.    ASSETS AND LIABILITIES     Total assets decreased to $2,337 million at December 31, 2000 compared to $2,404 million at December 31, 1999 and $2,322 million at December 31, 1998. During that same period, total liabilities increased from $1,579 million in 1998 to $1,626 million in 1999 and decreased to $1,607 million in 2000. These changes were primarily a result of the 1999 and 1998 Acquisition Centers, the partial sale and contribution of the Contributed JV Assets to PPRT and related debt transactions.    A. Stock Repurchase Program   On November 10, 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to 3.4 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2000, the Company repurchased 564,000 shares of its common stock at an average price of $19.02 per share.    28       NAME="page_do1260_1_29">      B. Refinancings   On April 12, 2000, additional debt of $138.5 million was placed on the SDG Macerich Properties, L.P. portfolio. This debt, consisting of both fixed and floating interest rates, has a current average interest rate of 7.51% and matures May 15, 2006. The Company's share of the financing proceeds of $69.2 million was used to pay down the Company's line of credit.    On June 1, 2000, the PPRT joint venture refinanced the debt on Kitsap Mall. A $38.0 million loan at an effective interest rate of 8.60%, was paid in full and a new note was issued for $61.0 million bearing interest at a fixed rate of 8.06% and maturing June 1, 2010.    On August 31, 2000, the Company refinanced the debt on Vintage Faire Mall. The prior loan of $52.8 million, at a fixed interest rate of 7.65%, was paid in full and a new note was issued for $70.0 million bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.89% and maturing September 1, 2010.     On October 2, 2000, the Company refinanced the debt on Santa Monica Place. An $85.0 million floating rate loan was paid in full and a new note was issued for $85.0 million bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.70% and maturing November 1, 2010.    On December 1, 2000, the PPRT joint venture refinanced the debt on Stonewood Mall. A $75.0 million floating rate loan was paid in full and a new note was issued for $77.8 million bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.41% and maturing December 11, 2010.    C. Other Events   On September 30, 2000, Manhattan Village, a 551,847 square foot regional shopping center, 10% which was owned by the Operating Partnership, was sold. The joint venture sold the property for $89.0 million, including a note receivable from the buyer for $79.0 million at an interest rate of 8.75% payable monthly, until its maturity date of September 30, 2001.    During 2000, the Company entered into a ten-year energy management and procurement contract with Enron. Enron will manage the supply of electricity and natural gas and provide energy management services to a majority of the Company's Centers.    During 2000, the Company invested $4.3 million in and became a founding member of MerchantWired. MerchantWired is providing a broadband communications network to retail property owners and retailers.    29         Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2000 and 1999     Revenues   Minimum and percentage rents decreased by 5.4% to $207.8 million in 2000 from $219.7 million in 1999. Approximately $24.6 million of the decrease related to the contribution of 100% and 99% of the membership interests of Lakewood Mall and Stonewood Mall, respectively, to the PPRT joint venture on October 26, 1999. The Company's pro rata share of results from those assets subsequent to the contribution to PPRT is reflected in Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. The decreases due to the Contributed JV Assets are partially offset by revenue increases of $8.2 million relating to the 1999 acquisition of Santa Monica Place.    In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Committee issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB 101"), which became effective for periods beginning after December 15, 1999. This bulletin modified the timing of revenue recognition for percentage rent received from tenants. This change will defer recognition of a significant amount of percentage rent for the first three calendar quarters into the fourth quarter. The Company applied this change in accounting principle as of January 1, 2000. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle at the adoption date of January 1, 2000, including pro rata share of joint ventures, was approximately $1.8 million.    Tenant recoveries increased to $104.1 million in 2000 from $99.1 million in 1999. The increase resulted from the impact of Santa Monica Place, Pacific View and from the Same Centers. These increases were partially offset by revenue decreases of $7.7 million resulting from the Contributed JV Assets.    Other income decreased to $8.2 million in 2000 from $8.6 million in 1999.    Expenses   Shopping center expenses increased to $101.7 million in 2000 compared to $100.3 million in 1999. Approximately $6.4 million of the increase resulted from the 1999 acquisition of Santa Monica Place, $3.4 million of the increase resulted from increased property taxes and recoverable expenses at the Same Centers. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.1 million from the Contributed JV Assets.    Interest Expense   Interest expense decreased to $108.4 million in 2000 from $113.3 million in 1999. Approximately $7.5 million of the decrease is from the Contributed JV Assets. This decrease is partially offset by the acquisition activity in 1999, which was partially funded with secured debt and borrowings under the Company's line of credit.    Depreciation and Amortization   Depreciation and amortization increased to $61.6 million in 2000 from $61.4 million in 1999. Approximately $2.5 million of the increase relates primarily to the 1999 Acquisition Center, which is partially offset by a decrease of $4.6 million relating to the Contributed JV Assets.    Minority Interest   The minority interest represents the 24.3% weighted average interest of the Operating Partnership that was not owned by the Company during 2000. This compares to 26.3% not owned by the Company during 1999.    30         Income From Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Management Companies   The income from unconsolidated joint ventures and the Management Companies was $30.3 million for 2000, compared to income of $25.9  million in 1999. A total of $8.2 million of the increase is attributable to the 1999 Joint Venture Acquisitions and the Contributed JV Assets. Additionally, $1.1 million is attributable to the gain from the sale of Manhattan Village on September 30, 2000. These increases are partially offset by the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle for percentage rent required by SAB 101 of $0.8 million and additional interest expense from the debt restructuring at SDG Macerich Properties, L.P. of $4.8 million.     Gain (loss) on Sale of Assets   A loss of $2.8 million in 2000 compares to a gain of $96.0 million in 1999. The 1999 gain was a result of the Company selling approximately 49% of the membership interests of Stonewood and Lakewood to Ontario Teachers' in October of 1999 and the Company's sale of Huntington Center on November 16, 1999.    Extraordinary Loss from Early Extinguishment of Debt   In 2000, the Company recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million which was a result of write offs of $1.3 million of unamortized financing costs and is offset by a gain of $1.0 million relating to the Company's purchase and retirement of $10.6 million of the Debentures, compared to the write off of $1.5 million of unamortized financing costs in 1999.    Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle   A loss of $1.0 million in 2000 compared to no loss in 1999 is a result of implementation of SAB 101 at January 1, 2000.    Net Income Available to Common Stockholders   As a result of the foregoing, net income available to common stockholders decreased to $38.0 million in 2000 from $110.9 million in 1999.    Operating Activities   Cash flow from operations was $121.2 million in 2000 compared to $139.6 million in 1999. The decrease is primarily because of decreased net operating income from the factors mentioned above.    Investing Activities   Cash generated from investing activities was $1.7 million in 2000 compared to cash utilized by investing activities of $247.7 million in 1999. The change resulted primarily from the cash contributions for the joint venture acquisitions of $116.9 million in 1999 compared to $12.9 million in 2000. This is offset by increases in joint venture distributions of $113.0 million in 2000 compared to $30.0 million in 1999.     Financing Activities   Cash flow used in financing activities was $127.1 million in 2000 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $123.4 million in 1999. The change resulted primarily from the refinancing of Centers in 1999.    EBITDA and Funds From Operations   Primarily because of the factors mentioned above, EBITDA, including joint ventures at pro rata, increased 4.2% to $314.6 million in 2000 from $301.8 million in 1999 and Funds from OperationsDiluted increased 1.8% to $167.2 million in 2000 from $164.3 million in 1999.    31         Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 1999 and 1998     Revenues   Minimum and percentage rents increased by 14.1% to $219.7 million in 1999 from $192.6 million in 1998. Approximately $26.3 million of the increase resulted from the 1998 Acquisition Centers, $1.9 million from the 1999 acquisition of Santa Monica Place and $5.2 million of the increase was attributable to the Same Centers. These increases were partially offset by revenue decreases at the Redevelopment Centers of $2.1 million in 1999 and $4.2 million of the decrease related to the contribution of 100% and 99% of the membership interests of Lakewood Mall and Stonewood Mall, respectively, to the PPRT joint venture on October 26,1999.    Tenant recoveries increased to $99.1 million in 1999 from $86.7 million in 1998. The 1998 Acquisition Centers generated $12.9 million of this increase, $1.3 million was from the acquisition of Santa Monica Place, and $1.9 million of the increase was from the Same Centers. These increases were partially offset by revenue decreases at the Redevelopment Centers of $2.1 million in 1999 and $1.6 million of the decrease resulted from the contribution of Lakewood Mall and Stonewood Mall to the PPRT joint venture.     Other income increased to $8.6 million in 1999 from $4.5 million in 1998. Approximately $0.7 million of the increase related to the 1998 Acquisition Centers and the 1999 acquisition of Santa Monica Place, and $3.7 million of the increase was attributable to the Same Centers.    Expenses   Shopping center expenses increased to $100.3 million in 1999 compared to $90.0 million in 1998. Approximately $13.2 million of the increase resulted from the 1998 Acquisition Centers and the 1999 acquisition of Santa Monica Place and $1.1 million of the increase resulted from increased property taxes and recoverable expenses at the Same Centers. The Redevelopment Centers had a net decrease of $2.0 million in shopping center expenses resulting primarily from decreased property taxes and recoverable expenses. The contribution of Lakewood Mall and Stonewood Mall to the PPRT joint venture resulted in $2.0 million of this decrease.    General and administrative expenses increased to $5.5 million in 1999 from $4.4 million in 1998 primarily as a result of the accounting change required by EITF 97-11, "Accounting for Internal Costs Relating to Real Estate Property Acquisitions," which requires the expensing of internal acquisition costs. Previously, in accordance with GAAP, certain internal acquisition costs were capitalized. The increase is also attributable to higher executive and director compensation expense.     Interest Expense   Interest expense increased to $113.3 million in 1999 from $91.4 million in 1998. This increase of $22.1 million is primarily attributable to the acquisition activity in 1998 and 1999, which was partially funded with secured debt and borrowings under the Company's line of credit.    Depreciation and Amortization   Depreciation increased to $61.4 million from $53.1 million in 1998. This increase relates primarily to the 1998 and 1999 Acquisition Centers.    32         Minority Interest   The minority interest represents the 26.3% weighted average interest of the Operating Partnership that was not owned by the Company during 1999. This compares to 28.4% not owned by the Company during 1998.    Income From Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Management Companies   The income from unconsolidated joint ventures and the Management Companies was $25.9 million for 1999, compared to income of $14.5  million in 1998. A total of $3.2 million of the change is attributable to the 1998 acquisitions of SDG Macerich Properties, L.P. and $7.9 million of the change is attributable to the 1999 acquisitions by Pacific Premier Retail Trust.    Gain on Sale of Assets   A gain on sale of assets of $96.0 million is a result of the Company selling approximately 49% of the membership interests of Stonewood and Lakewood to Ontario Teachers' in October 1999 and the Company's sale of Huntington Center on November 16, 1999.    Extraordinary Loss from Early Extinguishment of Debt   In 1999, the Company wrote off $1.5 million of unamortized financing costs, compared to $2.4 million written off in 1998.    Net Income Available to Common Stockholders   As a result of the foregoing, including the gain on sale of assets, net income available to common stockholders increased to $110.9 million in 1999 from $32.5 million in 1998.    Operating Activities   Cash flow from operations was $139.6 million in 1999 compared to $85.2 million in 1998. The increase is primarily because of increased net operating income from the 1998 and 1999 Acquisition Centers.    Investing Activities   Cash flow used in investing activities was $247.7 million in 1999 compared to $761.1 million in 1998. The change resulted primarily from the cash contributions required by the Company for the joint venture acquisitions of $240.2 million in 1998 compared to $116.9 million in 1999, and the proceeds from the sale of assets in 1999 of $106.9 million.    Financing Activities   Cash flow from financing activities was $123.4 million in 1999 compared to $676.0 million in 1998. The decrease resulted from no equity offerings in 1999 compared to 7,920,181 shares of common stock sold in 1998. Additionally, 9,114,602 shares of preferred stock were sold in the first and second quarters of 1998.    EBITDA and Funds From Operations   Primarily because of the factors mentioned above, EBITDA, including joint ventures at pro rata, increased 31.0% to $301.8 million in 1999 from $230.4 million in 1998 and Funds from OperationsDiluted increased 36.3% to $164.3 million from $120.5 million in 1998.    33         Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company intends to meet its short term liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations and working capital reserves. The Company anticipates that revenues will continue to provide necessary funds for its operating expenses and debt service requirements, and to pay dividends to stockholders in accordance with REIT requirements. The Company anticipates that cash generated from operations, together with cash on hand, will be adequate to fund capital expenditures which will not be reimbursed by tenants, other than non-recurring capital expenditures. Capital for major expenditures or major redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be, obtained from equity or debt financings which include borrowings under the Company's line of credit and construction loans. However, many factors impact the Company's ability to access capital, such as its overall debt level, interest rates, interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions.    The Company believes that it will have access to the capital necessary to execute its share repurchase program and expand its business in accordance with its strategies for growth and maximizing Funds from Operations. The Company presently intends to obtain additional capital necessary to expand its business and execute its share repurchase program through a combination of debt financings, joint ventures and the sale of non-core assets. During 1998 and 1999, the Company acquired two portfolios through joint ventures and raised additional capital in 1999 from the sale of interests in two properties to one joint venture partner. The Company believes such joint venture arrangements provide an attractive alternative to other forms of financing whether for acquisitions or other business opportunities.    The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness at December 31, 2000 was $2.3 billion (including its pro rata share of joint venture debt). This equated to a debt to Total Market Capitalization (defined as total debt of the Company, including its pro rata share of joint venture debt, plus aggregate market value of outstanding shares of common stock, assuming full conversion of OP Units and preferred stock into common stock) ratio of approximately 69% at December 31, 2000. The Company's debt consists primarily of fixed-rate conventional mortgages payable secured by individual properties.    The Company has filed a shelf registration statement, effective December 8, 1997, to sell securities. The shelf registration is for a total of $500 million of common stock, common stock warrants or common stock rights. During 1998, the Company sold a total of 7,920,181 shares of common stock under this shelf registration. The aggregate offering price of these transactions was approximately $212.9 million, leaving approximately $287.1 million available under the shelf registration statement.     The Company has an unsecured line of credit for up to $150.0 million. There were $59.0 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2000. The line of credit has been extended to May 2002.    At December 31, 2000, the Company had cash and cash equivalents available of $36.3 million.    34       NAME="page_dq1260_1_35">        Funds From Operations   The Company believes that the most significant measure of its performance is FFO. FFO is defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") to be: Net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring, sales or write-down of assets and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, plus depreciation and amortization (excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash flow from operations, as defined by GAAP, and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The following reconciles net income available to common stockholders to FFO:       (amounts in thousands)                                       2000       1999               Shares       Amount       Shares       Amount               Net incomeavailable to common stockholders           $  37,971           $  110,873       Adjustments to reconcile net income to FFObasic:                                        Minority interest              12,168              38,335          Loss on early extinguishment of debt              304              1,478          (Gain) loss on sale of wholly-owned assets              2,773              (95,981  )       (Gain) loss on sale or write-down of assets from unconsolidated entities (pro rata)              (235  )           193          Depreciation and amortization on wholly owned centers              61,647              61,383          Depreciation and amortization on joint ventures and from the management companies (pro rata)              24,472              19,715          Cumulative effect of change in accounting principlewholly owned centers              963                        Cumulative effect of change in accounting principleprorata unconsolidated entities              787                     Less: depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan costs and interest rate caps              (5,106  )           (4,271  )          FFObasic(1)     45,050     $  135,744     46,130     $  131,725       Additional adjustment to arrive at FFOdiluted                                        Impact of convertible preferred stock     9,115        18,958     9,115        18,138          Impact of stock options and restricted stock using the treasury method     (n/aantidilutive)     462        1,823          Impact of convertible debentures     5,154        12,542     5,186        12,616             FFOdiluted(2)     59,319     $  167,244     60,893     $  164,302                (1) Calculated based upon basic net income as adjusted to reach basic FFO. Weighted average number of shares includes the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for 2000 assuming the conversion of all outstanding OP Units. As of December 31, 2000, 11.2 million of OP Units were outstanding.   (2)  The computation of FFOdiluted and diluted average number of shares outstanding includes the effect of outstanding common stock options and restricted stock using the treasury method. The debentures are dilutive at December 31, 2000 and 1999 and are included in the FFO calculation. On February 25, 1998, the Company sold $100 million of its Series A Preferred Stock. On June 17, 1998, the Company sold $150 million of its Series B Preferred Stock. The preferred stock can be converted on a one-for-one basis for common stock. The preferred shares are assumed converted for purposes of 1999 net income as they are dilutive to that calculation. The preferred shares are assumed converted for purposes of 2000 and 1999 FFO-diluted per share as they are dilutive to that calculation.    35         Included in minimum rents were rents attributable to the accounting practice of straight lining of rents. The amount of straight lining of rents that impacted minimum rents was $865,259 for 2000, $2,628,000 for 1999 and $3,814,000 for 1998. The decline in straight-lining of rents from 1999 to 2000 is due to the Company structuring its new leases using rent increases tied to the change in CPI rather than using contractually fixed rent increases. CPI increases do not generally require straight-lining of rent treatment.    Inflation   In the last three years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most of the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on increases in the CPI. In addition, many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years, which enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. Additionally, most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses. This reduces the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.    Seasonality   The shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels. In addition, shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter. As a result of the above, plus the change in accounting principle discussed below for percentage rent, earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter of each year.    New Pronouncements Issued   In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Committee issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB 101), which became effective for periods beginning after December 15, 1999. This bulletin modified the timing of revenue recognition for percentage rent received from tenants. This change will defer recognition of a significant amount of percentage rent for the first three calendar quarters into the fourth quarter. The Company applied this change in accounting principle as of January 1, 2000. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle at the adoption date of January 1, 2000, including the pro rata share of joint ventures, was approximately $1,750,000.    In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," ("SFAS 133") which requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet, measured at fair value. Changes in the fair values of those derivatives will be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which delays the implementation of SFAS 133 from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2001. In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activitiesan Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133," ("SFAS 138") which amends the accounting and reporting standards of SFAS 133. The Company has determined the implementation of SFAS 133 and SFAS 138 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.    36         NAME="dq1260_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02669">      ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK         The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a conservative ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term variable rate debt through the use of interest rate caps with appropriately matching maturities, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity.    The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2000 concerning the Company's long term debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value ("FV"):       (dollars in thousands)            For the Years Ended December 31,                              2001       2002       2003       2004       2005       Thereafter       Total       FV         Long term debt:                                                                               Fixed rate     $  108,607     $  11,858     $  52,630     $  129,297     $  12,554     $  937,801     $  1,252,747     $  1,282,163       Average interest rate        7.42  %     7.41  %     7.39  %     7.41  %     7.41  %     7.41  %     7.41  %            Fixed rateDebentures                150,848                                        150,848        148,132       Average interest rate                7.25  %                                     7.25  %            Variable rate        59,000        88,340                                        147,340        147,340       Average interest rate        8.75  %     8.62  %                                     8.69  %            Total debtWholly owned Centers     $  167,607     $  251,046     $  52,630     $  129,297     $  12,554     $  937,801     $  1,550,935     $  1,577,635       Joint Venture Centers:  (at Company's pro rata share)                                                                               Fixed rate     $  6,812     $  7,538     $  8,410     $  8,977     $  74,468     $  478,258     $  584,463     $  586,595       Average interest rate        6.86  %     6.86  %     6.86  %     6.87  %     6.83  %     6.83  %     6.85  %            Variable rate                8,224        92,250                        40,700        141,174        141,174       Average interest rate                9.00  %     7.21  %                     7.08  %     7.72  %            Total debtJoint Ventures     $  6,812     $  15,762     $  100,660     $  8,977     $  74,468     $  518,958     $  725,637     $  727,769       Total debtAll Centers     $  174,419     $  266,808     $  153,290     $  138,274     $  87,022     $  1,456,759     $  2,276,572     $  2,305,404        The $59.0 million of variable debt maturing in 2001 represents the outstanding borrowings under the Company's credit facility. Subsequent to December 31, 2000, the line of credit was extended to May 2002.    In addition, the Company has assessed the market risk for its variable rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.9 million per year based on $288.5 million outstanding at December 31, 2000.     The fair value of the Company's long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflects the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration.
