ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  The following discussion, as well as information contained elsewhere in this report, contain "forward-looking statements." These statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us, our directors or our officers with respect to, among other things: anticipated financial or operating results, financial projections, business prospects, future product performance and other matters that are not historical facts. The success of our business operations is dependent on factors such as the impact of competitive products, product development, commercialization and technology difficulties, the results of financing efforts and the effectiveness of our marketing strategies, and general competitive and economic conditions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in this report under "Risk Factors."  OVERVIEW  We were formed as a result of two mergers that occurred in 2004. First, in March 2004, World Waste of America, Inc. ("WWA") merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of Waste Solutions, Inc. ("WSI"), a California corporation. Cagan McAfee Capital Partners and its affiliates were the controlling shareholders of WSI. As a result of this merger, WSI continued as the surviving corporation, assumed the operations and business plan of WWA, the stockholders of WWA became stockholders of WSI, and WSI changed its name to World Waste Technologies, Inc. ("Old WWT").  In March 2004, Old WWT entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with Voice Powered Technologies International, Inc., a California corporation ("VPTI"), to merge with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of VPTI. VPTI was a publicly traded company trading under the stock symbol VPTI.OB. VPTI had no material assets, liabilities or operations. The merger of Old WWT with VPTI's wholly owned subsidiary was completed on August 24, 2004. Pursuant to the merger, Old WWT's shareholders became the holders of approximately 95% of the outstanding shares of VPTI. Upon completion of this merger, VPTI changed its name to World Waste Technologies, Inc. VPTI was incorporated on June 21, 1985 and provided voice recognition and voice activated products. Because the shareholders of Old WWT became the controlling shareholders of VPTI after the merger, Old WWT was treated as the acquirer for accounting purposes, and therefore the transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the historical financial statements presented are those of Old WWT. Additionally, the prior operating results of VPTI are not indicative of our future operations, and none of the assets or liabilities on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2007 relate to VPTI prior to the merger.  Since the formation of WWA in 2002, our efforts have been principally devoted to research and development activities, construction of a facility (which facility is no longer a component of our business strategy), raising capital, and recruiting additional personnel and advisors. To date, we have marketed and sold only a limited amount of product and have not generated any significant revenues, therefore, we continue to report as a Development Stage Company.                                 PLAN OF OPERATIONS  COMPANY OVERVIEW  We are a development stage company formed to develop, design, build, own and operate facilities which employ systems and technologies designed to profitably convert municipal solid waste (MSW) and other waste streams, such as wood waste, into usable commodities and products. These products are expected to include renewable energy, recyclable commodities, fuel alcohols, and bio-fuels. We plan to concentrate our efforts on producing renewable energy from waste materials through the use of gasification technologies in order to meet the rapidly growing demand for renewable power. We believe that this increased demand is being driven, to a large extent, by the adoption of Renewable Portfolio Standards in a number of states, which require or encourage utilities to have a specific percentage of their electricity sales come from renewable sources.  To accelerate implementation of our renewable energy platform, we plan to pursue the development of facilities in targeted markets where we believe we will be able to earn a "tipping" fee for accepting wastes and a premium for the sale of renewable energy products. In this regard, we were short-listed by two California utilities on a total of four projects. We also plan to develop or obtain the rights to use gasification technologies in a demonstration applications to gain operating experience with the unique aspects of gasifying biomass derived from municipal solid waste and other waste streams, to develop detailed design criteria for larger-scale systems.                                         15    We anticipate that the development of projects using these technologies could position us to generate three distinct revenue streams: (a) "tipping" fees charged to the entities that supply us with MSW or other waste materials, (b) recycling revenue from the sale of commodity recyclables (such as beverage containers, aluminum, steel, plastics, and glass) that our process recovers and which otherwise would be interred in landfills, and (c) revenue from the sale of our end products, anticipated to be primarily renewable electricity, and bio-fuels . We believe that our receipt of fees from waste generators or handlers could provide us with a low cost fuel source, which is an important and beneficial characteristic of our business model.  In June 2003, we entered into a multi-year recycle agreement with Taormina Industries, Inc., pursuant to which, among other things, Taormina agreed to deliver MSW to us for processing and we agreed to lease a building for the related recycling facility on Taormina's campus in Anaheim, California (the "Anaheim Facility"). The lease for the Anaheim Facility was entered into in July 2004. The recycling agreement, as amended, provided that the recycle agreement would terminate automatically upon termination of the lease.  As previously disclosed, during early 2007 we began using the Anaheim Facility to conduct research and development activities related to the production of renewable energy from MSW. In the third quarter of 2007, we determined that the ongoing research and development work would more efficiently be carried out at the location of Applied Power Concepts, our research and development partner. Consequently, in order to reduce costs and focus management attention and cash resources on our renewable energy process, we initiated conversations with Taormina regarding termination of the lease of the Anaheim Facility and the cancellation of the associated recycle agreement. On October 29, 2007, Taormina terminated the lease and the recycling agreement, effective as of October 31, 2007. On November 7, 2007, Taormina filed an unlawful detainer action against us, and in March 2007, we entered into a stipulation for entry of judgment in this action. The stipulation provided for: (a) the cancellation and forfeiture of the lease; (b) a payment by us to Taormina of $192,217.57; and (c) our right to remain in possession of the Anaheim Facility until June 30, 2008.  In March 2008, we entered into an agreement with Clean Earth Solutions, Inc. ("CES"), pursuant to which we agreed (i) to sell to CES specified assets relating to the "front end" process of our Anaheim Facility for a cash payment to us of $500,000 (the "First Closing"), (ii) to settle a dispute arising from design issues related to the steam classification vessels that we had intended to use in our operations, in exchange for a payment to us of $640,000 (the "Second Closing") and (iii) to sell to CES all of our intellectual property rights in our pressurized steam classification process in exchange for a payment to us of $800,000 (of which $236,000 was previously paid by CES to us) (the "Third Closing"). On March 7, 2008, CES paid $500,000 to us, and the First Closing was consummated. Pursuant to this agreement, the Second and Third Closings are to occur on such dates as are determined by CES, provided that the Second Closing occurs by May 1, 2008 and the Third Closing occurs by June 15, 2008. We expect to vacate the Anaheim Facility by June 30, 2008.  In addition to pursuing our current business strategy, we are also in the process of evaluating strategic alternatives that may include, but are not limited to, a sale or merger of our company (including with companies in unrelated businesses) and/or a restructuring. As of the date of this Report, we had not entered into any definitive agreements with respect to the foregoing, and we cannot assure you that any such alternatives, if undertaken, will be successfully consummated.  ELECTRICITY OPPORTUNITIES  We plan to focus our efforts on the utilization of one or more gasification technologies that will generate various renewable energy products from MSW and other waste streams. We plan to seek to enter into strategic relationships with companies that have developed gasification technologies, and to further investigate the commercialization of our own technology. A process which we believe has significant potential for successful commercialization involves using a gasification technology to produce a synthetic gas (or "syngas") from the cellulose biomass fraction of MSW derived from a materials' separation and classification process. Wood waste, sewage sludge and other commercial waste streams are also potential feedstocks. The resulting syngas would be used to fire a boiler driving a steam turbine. We also believe that, after a gas clean-up process, it may be possible to put the syngas directly into a gas-fired turbine. In either case, we believe the process has the potential to produce a significant amount of renewable electricity for sale to utilities.  We were short-listed in the selection process to provide renewable electric power to two major California utilities for a total of four projects. Each of the projects is expected to process residual MSW destined for landfills resulting in the production of greater than 20 megawatts of electricity for sale to utilities. We continue to work through the process of negotiating power purchase agreements with respect to these projects (which are not expected to be awarded until the first half of 2008, at the earliest.) If selected for these projects, we would still need to raise significant additional financing and accomplish many other tasks, including: completion of contracts for the supply of municipal solid waste, establishment of site control, securing the necessary permits, and designing, financing and constructing the facilities.                                         16    REVERSE STOCK SPLIT  On March 25, 2004, VPTI's controlling stockholder approved a one-for-60 reverse stock split of our common stock to be effectuated upon the closing of the merger between VPTI and Old WWT, which became effective at the close of business on August 24, 2004.  TRENDS IN OUR BUSINESS  The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1991 requires landfills to install expensive liners and other equipment to control leaching toxics. Due to the increased costs and expertise required to run landfills under this Act, many small, local landfills closed during the 1990's. Larger regional landfills were built requiring increased logistics costs for the waste haulers.  In addition, state and federal governments have continued to increase the pressure on the industry to improve their recycling percentages. California currently mandates one of the highest standards in the United States by requiring 50% of all incoming MSW to be diverted from landfills. We believe that the trend in state law throughout the U.S. is to migrate toward this California standard.  We expect that the resale price of our products, including renewable electricity and bio-fuels, will be tied to commodity markets. The market demand for these materials can be volatile, which could significantly impact our results of operations.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  Management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, impairment of long-lived assets, including finite lived intangible assets, accrued liabilities and certain expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 3 to the accompanying audited financial statements included in this report. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  USE OF ESTIMATES  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We used estimates to perform the undiscounted cash flow projections used in the impairment analysis of the Anaheim plant assets (see Fixed Assets below). We also used estimates in determine the employee stock based compensation expense.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  In 2006, revenue for receiving Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) was recognized when the MSW was delivered. Revenue for products sold, such as unbleached fiber, metals and aluminum, were recognized when the product was delivered to the customer. We recorded no revenue during 2007 or 2005.  All shipping and handling costs were included in gross sales and accounted for as cost of goods sold.  INTANGIBLES  Intangible assets are recorded at cost. On May 1, 2006, pursuant to a Patent Assignment Agreement and a Patent Assignment, both dated as of May 1, 2007, (the "Patent Assignment Agreement and a Patent Assignment"), we completed the purchase of all right, title and interest in United States Patent No. 6,306,248 (the "Patent") and related intellectual property, subject to existing licenses, from the University of Alabama in Huntsville for $100,000 and 167,000 shares of our unregistered common stock valued at approximately $698,000, based on the market price of the stock on the date issued, May 1, 2006.                                         17      During the fourth quarter of 2007, we determined that we would not use the patented technology in our future facilities and consequently ceased amortization of the patent and moved the unamortized intangible assets to assets held for sale and stated at its book value, which was lower of fair value less costs to sell in accordance with SFAS 144. In February of 2008, we entered into an agreement to sell the patent and all of its associated rights.  FIXED ASSETS  Machinery and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful asset lives or for leasehold improvements or equipment installed in our Anaheim plant(no longer being used), over the remaining life of the lease, whichever is shorter.  We completed the construction of our initial plant in Anaheim, California early in the second quarter of 2006. We capitalized all costs directly associated with developing the plant, including interest and labor, throughout the construction period. We placed into service and began depreciating the assets related to this facility in the second quarter of 2006.  Our policy regarding fixed assets is to review such fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the review indicates that intangible assets are not recoverable (i.e. the carrying amounts are more than the future projected undiscounted cash flows), their carrying amounts would be reduced to fair value.  The assets at the Anaheim plant were comprised of two basic technologies; the front half of the plant consisted of assets related to our patented technology related to "steam classification" and material separation and the back half of the plant consisted of assets related to screening and cleaning of the cellulose biomass material to prepare it for sale to paper mills. During the plant start up phase, we became aware of several issues, including the creation of an unexpectedly high level of biological oxygen demand (BOD) from organic wastes in the wastewater from the pulp screening and cleaning process, and design issues related to the steam classification vessels. We decided not to make the capital improvements necessary to the Anaheim plant's wetlap process, or "back half," which we considered necessary in order to recover the carrying amount of the wetlap plant assets through projected future undiscounted cash flow from its operation. Consequently, in 2006, we recorded a charge of $9,737,344 which represented the net carrying value of the wetlap process or back half equipment. The charge was equal to the carry cost of the assets of the wetlap process, net of accumulated depreciation. We did not record an impairment charge for the steam classification equipment or front half of the plant at that time because we intended to use that equipment in research and development activities as part of our development of alternative back end processes such as, but not limited to, gasification and acid hydrolysis.  During the third quarter of 2007, we determined that our ongoing research and development work would more efficiently be carried out at the location of Applied Power Concepts, our research and development partner. Consequently, in order to reduce costs and focus management attention and cash resources on our renewable energy process, we initiated conversations with Taormina regarding termination of the lease of the Anaheim Facility and the cancellation of the associated recycling agreement. On October 29, 2007, Taormina terminated the lease and the recycling agreement, effective as of October 31, 2007. Consequently, we recorded a charge of $8,454,106 in the third quarter of 2007 which represented the net carrying value of the assets at the Anaheim plant, net of estimated fair value of the equipment and estimated costs of the equipment removal and scrap. The estimated carrying value was revalued and adjusted at December 31, 2007. In February 2008, we sold the assets related to the "front-end" process of the facility.  We capitalize leases in accordance with FASB 13.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  Research and development costs are charged to operations when incurred.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  During the fourth quarter of 2004, we adopted SFAS No. 123 entitled, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" retroactively to our inception. Accordingly, we have expensed the compensation cost for the options and warrants issued based on their fair value at their grant dates. During the quarter ended March 31, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R, "Share Based Payments." The adoption had no material effect on our financial statements.  REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK  Convertible preferred stock which may be redeemable for cash at the determination of the holder is classified as mezzanine equity, in accordance with FAS 150, EITF Topic D 98 and ASR 268, and is shown net of discounts for offering costs, warrant values and beneficial conversion features.                                         18    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON OF FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006  REVENUES  During the plant start up phase of our Anaheim plant, we confronted several issues, including an unexpected high level of biological oxygen demand from organic waste in the wastewater from the pulp screening and cleaning process. In January 2007, we decided not to make the capital improvements necessary to the Anaheim plant's wetlap process which we considered necessary to operate the plant with the expectation of being profitable. Therefore, beginning in January 2007, we began to operate the plant only as part of research and development projects. Consequently, we did not recognize any revenue during 2007. All cash received for tip fees and the sale of recyclables was netted against research and development costs.  EXPENSES  Operating expense of $16.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased approximately $2.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to an increase of general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses, offset by a decrease in asset impairment expenses.  Research and development expenses of $2,380,944 for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,107,050 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This was primarily due to the cost of research and development activities related to gasification of approximately $307,000, Anaheim plant costs of approximately $1,134,000, and plant depreciation of $940,000 in 2007 being classified as research and development expense due to the then nature and intent of the plant operations  General and administrative expenses of $5,251,888 for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by approximately $1,097,780 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in employee stock option expense of $649,000 and consulting fees of approximately $504,000 primarily related to technologies and new sites and the costs of the annual shareholders meeting. General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was comprised primarily of employee option expense of approximately $1.6 million, compensation expense of approximately $1.0 million, business development expenses of approximately $0.9 million, professional fees of approximately $0.9 million, and other expenses of approximately $0.8 million.  During the third quarter of 2007, we determined that our ongoing research and development work would more efficiently be carried out at the location of Applied Power Concepts, our research and development partner. Consequently, in order to reduce costs and focus management attention and cash resources on our renewable energy process, we initiated conversations with Taormina regarding termination of the lease of the Anaheim Facility and the cancellation of the associated recycling agreement. On October 29, 2007, Taormina terminated the lease and the recycling agreement, effective as of October 31, 2007. Consequently, we recorded a charge of $8,454,106 in the third quarter of 2007 which represented the net carrying value of the assets at the Anaheim plant, net of estimated fair value of the equipment and estimated costs of the equipment removal and scrap.  Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2007 of $579,268 increased $471,458, primarily due to the interest earned on the cash received for the issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock in May of 2006.  We did not have any financing expense in 2007 as compared to 2006.  COMPARISON OF FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005  We completed construction of our first facility in the second quarter of 2006. During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2006, we commissioned the equipment and performed plant start-up procedures.  REVENUES  During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded revenue of approximately $94,000, from the sale of unbleached fiber, metals and aluminum separated from the processed MSW during the start-up phase of our first facility in Anaheim, California. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, we did not generate any revenue.  EXPENSES  Operating expense during the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of disposal of rejects of $65,526, plant operating expenses of $2,720,922 and depreciation of $1,843,615, which were related to costs incurred during the start-up phase of our first facility in Anaheim, California. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, we had no operations and consequently no cost of plant operating expense.                                         19    General and administrative expenses of $4,154,108 for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by approximately $550,000 compared to the year end December 31, 2005, primarily due to increases in employee option expense due to grants made to employees and directors in the fourth quarter of 2005 and legal and accounting fees related to additional SEC filings during 2005.  During the fourth quarter of 2006, we decided not to make the capital improvements necessary to the Anaheim plant's wetlap process which we considered necessary in order to recover the carrying amount of the plant assets through projected future undiscounted cash flow for its operation. Consequently, we recorded a charge of $9,737,344 during 2006 for impairment of assets which represented the net carrying value of the wetlap process equipment.  Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $107,810 was comprised of interest income of approximately $482,000 due to the cash from the issuance of our Series B Preferred Stock in May of 2006, partially offset by interest expense of $374,000, primarily from our senior debt that was issued in November 2005 and February 2006 and extinguished in May 2006.  Financing expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was comprised of: a) $1,647,250 attributable to the value of warrants issued to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock for their consent to issue additional senior secured debt and their agreement to waive certain of their veto rights and contractual rights to facilitate our round of financing which occurred in the first quarter of 2006; b) the unamortized warrant value and offering costs of $1,593,758 related to our senior secured debt expensed upon the early extinguishment of such debt which occurred in the second quarter of 2006; and c) the change in the fair value of $4,201,418 of the conversion feature of our Series A Preferred Stock due to the modification of its conversion price as a result of the application of an anti-dilution adjustment and the change in fair value of the associated warrants which occurred in the second quarter of 2006.  Change in fair value of warrant liability of a benefit of $1,079,721 relates to the change in the fair value of warrants to purchase common stock issued with registration rights as part of our Series A Preferred Stock offering in 2005. The quarterly effect was as follows: first quarter charge of $120,154, second quarter charge of $135,642, third quarter benefit of $831,297 and fourth quarter benefit of $504,220. In accordance with SFAS 133 and EITF 00-19, the fair value of the warrants was required to be recorded as a liability until we satisfied specified registration requirements. The warrant liability was required to be marked to market at the end of each reporting period. The registration statement was declared effective on December 5, 2006, and therefore, after December 5, 2006 the warrants are no longer recorded as a liability.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  At December 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of approximately $2.7 million and short-term investments of $7.1 million, which is a decrease of $4.5 million from December 31, 2006 cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $14.3 million.  During the year ended December 31, 2007, net cash used for operating activities was approximately $4.2 million. The use of cash was primarily for (i) research and development activities of approximately $1.3 million net of non cash items primarily comprised of depreciation, and (ii)general and administrative expenses of approximately $2.9 million net of non cash items primarily comprised of the amortization of employee options and warrants and accrued expenses for consulting. In addition to the $4.2 million used in operating activities we used approximately $0.1 million for fixed asset purchases and the value of short term investments was reduced by approximately $0.2 million for a valuation reserve.  During the year ended, December 31, 2007, net cash used for investing activities was approximately $7,400,000. This was primarily due to $7,260,000 used to purchase short-term marketable securities and approximately $128,000 for the purchase of equipment.  In March 2008, we received a payment from CES of $500,000 upon the sale of assets relating to the front-end process of our facility. CES is obligated to make additional payments to us aggregating $1.2 million in 2008 upon the closing of our sale of certain intellectual property rights and the settlement of an ongoing action with BPI.  Approximately $4.9 million of our securities are in the form of auction rate securities, the value of which could decline significantly.  We estimate that our cash will sustain operations through at least March of 2009, based on our current burn rate. We may, however, plan to change our current burn rate if and when we are able to move forward on certain initiatives, primarily related to gasification.                                         20      As of December 31, 2007, the only long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations, or other similar long-term liabilities, was the one capital lease described in Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements.  CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS  As of December 31, 2007, the scheduled maturities of our long-term contractual obligations were as follows:                                                                         Payments Due by Period                                             ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                              Less than                                        After                                               1 year         1-3 Years       4-5 Years        5 Years          Total                                             -----------     -----------     -----------     -----------     -----------            Operating leases (for San Diego office)     $    39,088     $        --     $        --     $        --     $    39,088 Capital leases (plant equipment, terminated   in March 2008)                                 49,524          30,826              --              --          80,350 Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock               --      47,189,502              --                      47,189,502                                             -----------     -----------     -----------     -----------     ----------- Total                                       $    88,612     $47,220,328     $        --     $        --     $47,308,940                                             ===========     ===========     ===========     ===========     ===========   Our Anaheim facility lease was terminated in October 2007. The Capital lease was terminated in March 2008. We are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements, and we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. In addition, we have no financial guarantees, debt or lease agreements or other arrangements that could trigger a requirement for an early payment or that could change the value of our assets.  We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business or operations.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 Summary - On July 13, 2006, FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, was issued. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The new FASB standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. We adopted this pronouncement on January 1, 2007. As we provide for a 100% reserve against our deferred tax asset, it did not have a material effect on the financial statements.  SFAS No 157, Fair Value Measurements - In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No 157 which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No 157 became effective for our company beginning January 1, 2008. Management is currently in the process of assessing the provisions of SFAS No 157 and determining how this framework for measuring fair value will affect the current accounting policies and procedures and our financial statements. Management has not determined whether the adoption of SFAS No 157 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  SFAS No 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - The FASB issued SFAS No 159 which permits an entity to chose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No 159 became effective for our company beginning January 1, 2008. Management is currently in the process of assessing the provisions of SFAS No 159 and determining how it will affect the current accounting policies and procedures and our financial statements. Management has not determined whether the adoption of SFAS No 159 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations. On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 141 (Revised 2007). Under Statement 141R, an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. Statement 141R will change the accounting treatment for certain specific items, including: acquisition costs will be generally expensed as incurred; noncontrolling interests (formerly known as "minority interests" -- see Statement 160 discussion below) will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date; acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non-acquired contingencies; in-process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense. Statement 141R also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements. Statement 141 applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. While we have had no such business combinations in the past, as we pursue our gasification strategy, we may pursue business combinations which would be effected by SFAS No. 141.                                         21    SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - An Amendment of ARB No. 51. On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160. Statement 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent's equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. Statement 160 clarifies that changes in a parent's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. Statement 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. Statement 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Because we have no such arrangements currently, the adoption of this principle will not have a material impact on our financial statements. However, as we pursue our gasification strategy, it may have such arrangements in the future.  EITF Issue No. 07-1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements Related to the Development and Commercialization of Intellectual Property. Issue No. 07-1 discusses how costs incurred and revenue generated on sales to third parties are reported in the income statements of the partners to a collaborative arrangement, how sharing payments made to, or received by, a partner in a collaborative arrangement are presented in the recipient's and payor's income statements, and what disclosures the partners to a collaborative arrangement should provide in the notes to their financial statements. While we currently have no such arrangements, as we pursue the development of our gasification strategy we may in the future.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk. To achieve our objectives, we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality. As of December 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $9.8 million. At December 31, 2007, we had $4.9 million invested in auction rate securities. Due to the uncertainties in the financial markets these securities have become subject to liquidity uncertainty and interest rate exposure and could fall in value if the market does not stabilize. They have been adjusted to their estimated fair value at December 31, 2007. Although we are actively working with our investment advisors and monitoring the market to minimize our exposure, we can not give any assurance as to the value of those securities.  We did not have any financial instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates at December 31, 2006. We currently do not conduct any business outside of the United States and therefore are not subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  If and when we begin to generate substantive revenues from our operations, we anticipate that we will be exposed to price changes in the commodity goods we sell in the ordinary course of our business, which changes could have a significant impact on our results of operations. We may in the future use financial instruments to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices.                                          22       ITEM 8.
