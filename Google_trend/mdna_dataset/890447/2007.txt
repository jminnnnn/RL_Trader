ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  The following discussion, as well as information contained elsewhere in this report, contain "forward-looking statements." These statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us, our directors or our officers with respect to, among other things: anticipated financial or operating results, financial projections, business prospects, future product performance and other matters that are not historical facts. The success of our business operations is dependent on factors such as the impact of competitive products, product development, commercialization and technology difficulties, the results of financing efforts and the effectiveness of our marketing strategies, and general competitive and economic conditions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in this report under "Risk Factors."  OVERVIEW  We were formed as a result of two mergers that occurred in 2004. First, in March 2004, World Waste of America, Inc. ("WWA") merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of Waste Solutions, Inc. ("WSI"), a California corporation. Cagan McAfee Capital Partners and its affiliates were the controlling shareholders of WSI. As a result of this merger, WSI continued as the surviving corporation, assumed the operations and business plan of WWA, the stockholders of WWA became stockholders of WSI, and WSI changed its name to World Waste Technologies, Inc. ("Old WWT").  In March 2004, Old WWT entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with Voice Powered Technologies International, Inc., a California corporation ("VPTI"), to merge with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of VPTI. VPTI was a publicly traded company trading under the stock symbol VPTI.OB. VPTI had no material assets, liabilities or operations. The merger of Old WWT with VPTI's wholly owned subsidiary was completed on August 24, 2004. Pursuant to the merger, Old WWT's shareholders became the holders of approximately 95% of the outstanding shares of VPTI. Upon completion of this merger, VPTI changed its name to World Waste Technologies, Inc. VPTI was incorporated on June 21, 1985 and provided voice recognition and voice activated products. We currently do not plan to conduct any business other than operations heretofore conducted or contemplated to be conducted by WWT. Because the shareholders of Old WWT became the controlling shareholders of VPTI after the merger, Old WWT was treated as the acquirer for accounting purposes, and therefore the transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the historical financial statements presented are those of Old WWT. Additionally, the prior operating results of VPTI are not indicative of our future operations, and none of the assets or liabilities on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 relate to VPTI prior to the merger.                                         25    Since the formation of WWA in 2002, our efforts have been principally devoted to research and development activities, construction of our initial facility, raising capital, and recruiting additional personnel and advisors. To date, we have marketed and sold only a limited amount of product and have not generated any significant revenues, therefore, the Company continues to report as a Development Stage Company.                                 PLAN OF OPERATIONS  COMPANY OVERVIEW  We are a development stage company formed to develop technologies designed to profitably transform municipal solid waste (MSW) into usable commodities and products such as ethanol, electricity and paper pulp, and to design, build, own and operate facilities that utilize such technologies. We recently completed construction of our first facility in Anaheim, California, located on the campus of the regional transfer facility and Material Recovery Facility (MRF) of Taormina Industries, a wholly owned subsidiary of Republic Services, Inc.  Our Anaheim facility has been in a limited startup phase and has successfully transformed MSW to produce small quantities of paper pulp, which we have sold to paper manufacturers. We are now utilizing the facility to continue improving our pulp technology and for research and development on additional technologies to create renewable energy products such as ethanol and electricity.  Although our Anaheim facility has successfully transformed MSW to produce paper pulp, we recently determined, based on a number of factors (including the prohibitive cost of making necessary capital improvements), that our initial facility could not under existing circumstances operate profitably on a commercial scale. Accordingly, we have reduced our work force and are running the plant on an intermittent basis so as to avoid the necessity of making certain capital expenditures. Our revised strategy is to utilize the facility solely to continue improving our pulp technology and to conduct research and development activities as we strive to develop additional technologies designed to transform MSW into renewable energy products such as ethanol and co-generated renewable electricity. Because these additional capital investments would be necessary in order to potentially recover the carrying amount of the plant assets through projected future cash flows from operations, we recorded a non-cash asset impairment charge of approximately $9.7 million at December 31, 2006, reflecting the carrying value of a portion of our plant assets. Please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of this impairment charge.  We anticipate that our technologies generally will position us to generate three distinct revenue streams: (a) "tipping" fees charged to the entities that supply us with MSW, (b) recycling revenue from the sale of commodity recyclables (such as aluminum, tin, steel, and plastics) that our process recovers and which otherwise would be interned in landfills, and (c) revenue from the sale of our end product, anticipated to be either ethanol, electricity, or paper pulp, depending on which technology is employed, which in turn will depend upon a number of factors including local market demand. We believe that the fact that we are able to receive fees from the entities that provide us with "feedstock" (i.e. waste) is an important and beneficial characteristic of our process and our design, build, own and operate business model.  According to information currently posted on the National Solid Waste Management Association's website (the most recent publicly available information on this topic that we are aware of), the MSW industry in the United States, the primary market that we plan to serve, accounts for approximately $43 billion in spending. We believe that our existing and future technologies will potentially offer benefits to a number of different constituencies, including solid waste companies (by reducing transportation costs and increasing diversion of waste from landfills), communities and regulators (by increasing recycling rates, lengthening landfill life, gaining a renewable energy source, and reducing traffic), utilities and ethanol distributors (by increasing renewable content in energy production and diversifying ethanol supply away from corn-based production), and environmentally conscious consumers (by decreasing reliance on hydrocarbon-based power, reducing greenhouse gases from landfill methane and truck traffic, and creating ethanol from non-grain sources).                                          26    We believe that our process will compliment the existing investment made by communities to create and expand curbside recycling programs by targeting the MSW that is still going to the landfill (the "residual MSW", or "RMSW"). RMSW may have already been processed by an MRF, and often contains material that has historically been the most difficult portion of MSW to recycle.  OUR ANAHEIM FACILITY  At our Anaheim facility, we use a rotating pressure vessel to combine steam, heat, pressure and agitation to change the waste's physical composition. The process converts paper, cardboard, and paper packaging found in RMSW into a cellulose biomass fiber-containing material. The cellulose biomass can be screened and cleaned using conventional and non-conventional pulp recycling equipment, and the resulting unbleached fiber, known as "wetlap" pulp, can be used as a raw material for making new lower grade paper stocks such as linerboard, corrugating medium, and packaging.  We have entered into a long-term contract with Taormina to supply us with RMSW. We began processing RMSW at our Anaheim facility on a limited start-up basis during the second quarter of 2006, and since then have processed over 2,500 tons of RMSW through the facility and the resulting cellulose biomass has been refined into over 400 tons of wetlap pulp. This wetlap product has been supplied to several cardboard and paper manufacturers with operations in Southern California. We have also sold a limited amount of the other inorganic, recyclable materials captured by our process including aluminum, steel, tin and plastics, into various commodity markets.  Although our customers have provided positive feedback on the pulp quality and specifications and have requested continued shipments, we recently became aware of several issues with our process, including its creation of an unexpectedly high level of biological oxygen demand (BOD) from organic wastes in the wastewater from the pulp screening and cleaning process, and design issues related to the steam classification vessels. These issues would require a significant level of reengineering and repairs to put us in a position to potentially conduct sustained and profitable operations on a commercial level at our current facility.  Due to, among other factors, the significant costs of additional capital improvements required at our Anaheim plant that would be necessary in order to address the BOD issue, we recently decided not to make these improvements for the pulp process or to actively pursue the creation or sale of wetlap pulp generated at this plant. Rather, we plan to expend our resources on analyzing the data gathered through the plant's limited operation and refining those lessons learned from the design, construction, commissioning and operation of the plant. We will focus our cash spending on the development of additional larger scale facilities and on the development of our renewable energy platform which we believe holds the potential for better returns than investing additional capital in a small scale facility. Accordingly, we recently reduced our workforce and began to run the plant on an intermittent basis for process improvement trials, technology demonstration, product development and other research and development initiatives, including as relates to the production of ethanol and electricity. We expect to continue to use the steam classification assets at the Anaheim facility in a research mode in an effort to develop ethanol, electricity and pulp opportunities until such time, if ever, as we can develop or acquire the technology to enable us to operate the plant profitably.  Based on our research and development, including our accumulated experience from operating the Anaheim plant, we believe the necessary characteristics for the successful development of additional wetlap-based MSW conversion facilities include: a relatively high volume of MSW, larger physical plant enabling a larger scale operation, a desire by the community to increase recycling rates to minimize the amount of this waste disposed of in landfills, feedstock composition which includes a higher amount of paper products, a fully scoped on-site water treatment facility, and higher landfill tipping fees than we currently receive in Anaheim, California. We plan to continue to conduct business development discussions with various paper and solid waste companies and government agencies to determine where the proper combination of operating characteristics can be achieved to pursue a larger scale wetlap production facility in future locations.                                         27    ETHANOL AND ELECTRICITY OPPORTUNITIES  We recently began pursuing the development of various energy products which can be produced from MSW. One process which we believe has potential for successful commercialization involves using gasification technologies to produce a synthetic gas (or "syngas") from wetlap or intermediate products in our process. This syngas can be used to produce energy to drive a turbine or passed through a catalyst environment to produce fuel grade alcohols, primarily ethanol. We believe this same basic process can also be used to produce hydrogen for industrial applications and fuel cells. In this area we recently filed a provisional patent covering a process and certain conditions, which we believe may maximize the yield of these alcohols. A by-product of catalyst process is a residual producer gas that can be used for the beneficial co-generation of renewable electricity. The syngas can be used to fire either a boiler driving a steam turbine, or a gas-fired turbine, and thereby produce energy to reduce our utility costs.  Also in the ethanol area, in addition to the above process for producing fuel alcohols through gasification, we are investigating alternative pathways for transforming our cellulose biomass product into ethanol using various acid and enzymatic hydrolysis processes. We have produced small quantities of ethanol through an intermediate acid hydrolysis process in the early trials and are currently performing additional testing and engineering studies to determine the economic feasibility of a commercial size plant based on the insights from our research.  We recently established a Technical Advisory Board to assist us in advancing our business of creating usable commodity products from MSW, particularly as it pertains to developing our ethanol and electricity technologies.  You should read this discussion in conjunction with the selected historical financial information and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.  REVERSE STOCK SPLIT  On March 25, 2004, VPTI's controlling stockholder approved a one-for-60 reverse stock split of our common stock to be effectuated upon the closing of the merger between VPTI and Old WWT, which became effective at the close of business on August 24, 2004.  TRENDS IN OUR BUSINESS  The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1991 requires landfills to install expensive liners and other equipment to control leaching toxics. Due to the increased costs and expertise required to run landfills under this Act, many small, local landfills closed during the 1990's. Larger regional landfills were built requiring increased logistics costs for the waste haulers.  In addition, state and federal governments have continued to increase the pressure on the industry to improve their recycling percentages. California currently mandates one of the highest standards in the United States by requiring 50% of all incoming MSW to be diverted from landfills. We believe that the trend in state law throughout the U.S. is to migrate toward this California standard.  We expect that the resale price of our products, including wetlap pulp, aluminum, steel, plastic, glass and tin will be tied to commodity markets. The resale and market demand for these materials can be volatile, which can significantly impact our results of operations. Due in part to increasing demands for packaging material from China and India, the demand is expected to increase in the future.                                         28    High prices for hydrocarbon-based fuels have led to increasing market interest in renewable fuel sources such as ethanol. Investment into corn-based ethanol production facilities is increasing in the U.S. Research and development investment spending is also increasing for technologies and processes which can convert cellulose biomass into ethanol and other fuels.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  Management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, impairment of long-lived assets, including finite lived intangible assets, accrued liabilities and certain expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 3 to the accompanying audited financial statements included in this report. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  USE OF ESTIMATES  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company used estimates to perform the undiscounted cash flow projections used in the impairment analysis of the Anaheim plant assets, see Fixed Assets below. The estimates of future operating costs and future revenues and plant alternations were derived from operating results during the last nine months and results from research and development activities.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  Revenue for receiving Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is recognized when the MSW is delivered. Revenue for products sold, such as unbleached fiber, metals and aluminum, are recognized when the product is delivered to the customer.  All shipping and handling costs are accounted for as cost of goods sold.  INTANGIBLES  Intangible assets are recorded at cost. On May 1, 2006, pursuant to a Patent Assignment Agreement and a Patent Assignment, both dated as of May 1, 2006, (the "Patent Assignment Agreement and a Patent Assignment"), we completed the purchase of all right, title and interest in United States Patent No. 6,306,248 (the "Patent") and related intellectual property, subject to existing licenses, from the University of Alabama in Huntsville for $100,000 and 167,000 shares of our unregistered common stock valued at approximately $698,000, based on the market price of the stock on the date issued, May 1, 2006.                                         29    FIXED ASSETS  Machinery and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful asset lives or for leasehold improvements or equipment installed in the Anaheim plant, over the remaining life of the lease, whichever is shorter.  We completed the construction of our initial plant in Anaheim, California early in the second quarter of 2006. We capitalized all costs directly associated with developing the plant, including interest and labor, throughout the construction period. We placed into service and began depreciating the assets related to this facility in the second quarter of 2006.  Our policy regarding fixed assets is to review such fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the review indicates that intangible assets are not recoverable (i.e. the carrying amounts are more than the future projected undiscounted cash flows), their carrying amounts would be reduced to fair value.  The assets at the Anaheim plant are comprised of two basic technologies; the front half of the plant consists of assets related to our core patented technology related to "steam classification" and material separation and the back half of the plant consist of assets related to screening and cleaning of the cellulose biomass material to prepare it for sale to paper mills. During the plant start up phase, we became aware of several issues, including the creation of an unexpectedly high level of biological oxygen demand (BOD) from organic wastes in the wastewater from the pulp screening and cleaning process, and design issues related to the steam classification vessels. We recently decided not to make the capital improvements necessary to the Anaheim plant's wetlap process, or "back half," which we consider necessary in order to recover the carrying amount of the wetlap plant assets through projected future undiscounted cash flow from its operation. Consequently, we recorded a charge of $9,737,344 which represented the net carrying value of the wetlap process or back half equipment. The charge was equal to the carry cost of the assets of the wetlap process, net of accumulated depreciation. We did not record an impairment charge for the steam classification equipment or front half of the plant because we intend to use that equipment in research and development activities as part of our development of alternative back end processes such as, but not limited to, gasification and acid hydrolysis and because we also believe that by making certain improvements to the plant, such as adding equipment for energy co-generation, and changing the use of the cellulose biomass mass from the wetlap process to another application, such as its use as a form of fuel, the future undiscounted cash flow from its operations might cover the its capitalized cost.  During 2007, we plan to operate primarily in the research and development mode. Consequently, depreciation of the "steam classification" equipment may be charged to research and development.  We capitalize leases in accordance with FASB 13.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  Research and development costs are charged to operations when incurred.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  During the fourth quarter of 2004, we adopted SFAS No. 123 entitled, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" retroactively to our inception. Accordingly, we have expensed the compensation cost for the options and warrants issued based on their fair value at their grant dates. During the quarter ended March 31, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R, "Share Based Payments." The adoption had no material effect on our financial statements.                                         30    REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK  Convertible preferred Stock which may be redeemable for cash at the determination of the holder is classified as mezzanine equity, in accordance with FAS 150, EITF Topic D 98 and ASR 268, and is shown net of discounts for offering costs, warrant values and beneficial conversion features.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON OF FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005  We completed construction of our first facility in the second quarter of 2006. During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2006, we have been commissioning the equipment and performing plant start-up procedures.  REVENUES  During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded revenue of approximately $94,000, from the sale of unbleached fiber, metals and aluminum separated from the processed MSW during the start-up phase of our first facility in Anaheim, California. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, we did not generate any revenue.  EXPENSES  Operating expense during the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of disposal of rejects of $65,526, plant operating expenses of $2,720,922 and depreciation of $1,843,615, which were related to costs incurred during the start-up phase of our first facility in Anaheim, California and are not indicative of the plant operating expense that we expect to incur going forward. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, we had no operations and consequently no cost of plant operating expense.  General and administrative expenses of $4,154,108 for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by approximately $550,000 compared to the year end December 31, 2005, primarily due to increases in employee option expense due to grants made to employees and directors in the fourth quarter of 2005 and legal and accounting fees related to additional SEC filings during 2005.  During the fourth quarter of 2006, we decided not to make the capital improvements necessary to the Anaheim plant's wetlap process which we consider necessary in order to recover the carrying amount of the plant assets through projected future undiscounted cash flow for its operation. Consequently, we recorded a charge of $9,737,344 during 2006 for impairment of assets which represented the net carrying value of the wetlap process equipment.  Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $107,810 was comprised of interest income of approximately $482,000 due to the cash from the issuance of our Series B Preferred Stock in May of 2006, partially offset by interest expense $374,000 primarily from our senior debt that was issued in November 2005 and February 2006 and extinguished in May 2006.  Financing expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was comprised of: a) $1,647,250 attributable to the value of warrants issued to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock for their consent to issue additional senior secured debt and their agreement to waive certain of their veto rights and contractual rights to facilitate our next round of financing which occurred in the first quarter of 2006; b) the unamortized warrant value and offering costs of $1,593,758 related to our senior secured debt expensed upon the early extinguishment of such debt which occurred in the second quarter of 2006; and c) the change in the fair value of $4,201,418 of the conversion feature of our Series A Preferred Stock due to the modification of its conversion price as a result of the application of an anti-dilution adjustment and the change in fair value of the associated warrants which occurred in the second quarter of 2006.                                         31    Change in fair value of warrant liability of a benefit of $1,079,721 relates to the change in the fair value of warrants to purchase common stock issued with registration rights as part of our Series A Preferred Stock offering in 2005. The quarterly effect was as follows: first quarter charge of $120,154, second quarter charge of $135,642, third quarter benefit of $831,297 and fourth quarter benefit of $504,220. In accordance with SFAS 133 and EITF 00-19, the fair value of the warrants is required to be recorded as a liability until we satisfy specified registration requirements. The warrant liability was required to be marked to market at the end of each reporting period. The registration statement was declared effective on December 4, 2006, and therefore, after December 4, 2006 the warrants are no longer recorded as a liability.  COMPARISON OF FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004  During 2005, we continued research on the licensed process and the intended use of the products from that process, development of our business plan, construction of our first facility in Anaheim, CA and capital raising activities.  REVENUES  We did not generate any operating revenues in fiscal 2005 or 2004.  EXPENSES  General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.4 million in 2005 primarily due to increases in employee-related expenses, rent and consulting fees. Employee-related expenses increased by approximately $1.0 million in 2005 due to salaries of approximately $650,000 related to the hiring of additional staff as we prepared for the opening of our first facility, amortization of employee stock option expense of approximately $350,000, travel due to increased business activities of $90,000 and relocation expense related to the hiring of additional staff of approximately $75,000. Rent increased by approximately $122,000 due to the payment of 12 months' rent in 2005 versus only four months' rent in 2004. Professional and consulting fees increased by approximately $100,000 in 2005 due primarily to the costs associated with complying with SEC reporting requirements as a result of becoming a reporting company in August 2004.  INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)  Interest income (expense) changed by approximately $128,000, from an expense of $65,000 in 2004 to income of $63,000 in 2005, primarily as a result of the cash received and invested from the sale of our common stock, preferred stock and senior debt.  CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF WARRANT LIABILITIES  Change in fair value of warrant liabilities of approximately $709,000 in 2005 relates to the fair value adjustment of warrants to purchase common stock issued with registration rights as part of our preferred stock offering in 2005 in accordance with SFAS 133 and EITF 00-19.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  At December 31, 2006, we had cash on hand of approximately $14.3 million, which is an increase of $11.5 million from December 31, 2005 of $2.8 million. During fiscal 2006, we raised approximately $22.0 million from the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock and Senior Secured Debt, net of offering costs of approximately $2.4 million and the repayment of senior secured debt of approximately $2.8 million. We used cash during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily for start-up costs at our Anaheim facility of approximately $2.7 million and general operating expenses of approximately $2.9 million and for the purchase of fixed assets related to the completion of our first plant of approximately $4.9 million. We estimate that our cash will sustain operations through approximately December 2008, based on our current expected burn rate, exclusive of any significant costs to make substantial changes to our initial facility or construct additional facilities, if we choose to do so.                                         32    In May 2006 we raised $19.9 million in cash from the sale of Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, net of offering costs of approximately $2.3 million and the repayment of Senior Secured Debt of approximately $2.8 million. These funds were used in part during 2006 approximately as follows: plant start-up and operating costs of $2.1 million, general administrative expenses of $1.5 million and equipment purchases of $2.1 million.  CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS           As of December 31, 2006, the scheduled maturities of our long-term contractual obligations were as follows:                                                                         Payments Due by Period                                             ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                              Less than                                        After                                               1 year         1-3 Years       4-5 Years        5 Years          Total                                             -----------     -----------     -----------     -----------     -----------            Operating leases (for plant and office)     $   253,264     $   441,381     $   402,294     $   519,628     $ 1,616,567 Capital leases (plant equipment)                 45,615          80,351              --              --         125,966 Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock               --              --      52,960,000              --      52,960,000                                             -----------     -----------     -----------     -----------     ----------- Total                                       $   298,879     $   521,732     $53,362,294     $   519,628     $54,702,533                                             ===========     ===========     ===========     ===========     ===========   We are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements, and we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. In addition, we have no financial guarantees, debt or lease agreements or other arrangements that could trigger a requirement for an early payment or that could change the value of our assets.  We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business or operations.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 Summary - On July 13, 2006, FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, was issued. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The new FASB standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. As we provide for a 100% reserve against our deferred tax asset, management does not believe that this statement will have a material effect on the financial statements.  SFAS No 157, Fair Value Measurements - In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No 157 which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No 157 will be effective for our company beginning January 1, 2008. Management is currently in the process of assessing the provisions of SFAS No 157 and determining how this framework for measuring fair value will affect the current accounting policies and procedures and our financial statements. Management has not determined whether the adoption of SFAS No 157 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  SFAS No 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - The FASB issued SFAS No 159 which permits an entity to chose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No 159 will be effective for our company beginning January 1, 2008. Management is currently in the process of assessing the provisions of SFAS No 159 and determining how it will affect the current accounting policies and procedures and our financial statements. Management has not determined whether the adoption of SFAS No 159 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.                                         33    EITF Issue No. 06-8, Issuer's Accounting for a Previously Bifurcated Conversion Option in Convertible Debt Instrument When the Conversion Option No Longer Meets the Bifurcation Criteria in FASB Statement No 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

In this bulletin the SEC staff gives guidance on determining the material of misstatements in the financial statements of the issuer. Although we are not aware of any material misstatements in our financial statements, we may be required to restate its financial statements in the future do to the guidelines given in this bulletin.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk. To achieve our objectives, we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality. As of December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $14.3 million. A portion of our investments may be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if market interest rates increase. However, because our investments are short-term in duration, we believe our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant and a 1% movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of out portfolio. We actively monitor changes in interest rates.  We did not have any financial instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates at December 31, 2006 or at December 31, 2005. We currently do not conduct any business outside of the United States and therefore are not subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  If and when we begin to generate substantive revenues from our operations, we anticipate that we will be exposed to price changes in the commodity goods we sell in the ordinary course of our business, which changes could have a significant impact on our results of operations. We may in the future use financial instruments to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices.  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
