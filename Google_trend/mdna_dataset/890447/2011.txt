Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    Description of Material Financial Line Items:    Revenues    We generate revenues from two existing operating divisions as follows:    BLACK OIL - Revenues for our Black Oil division are comprised primarily of feedstock sales (used motor oil) which are purchased from a network of local and regional suppliers.  Volumes are consolidated for efficient delivery and then sold to third-party re-refiners and fuel oil blenders for the export market.    REFINING AND MARKETING - The Refining and Marketing division generates revenues relating to the sales of finished products.  The Refining and Marketing division gathers hydrocarbon streams in the form of petroleum distillates, transmix and other chemical products that have become off-specification during the transportation or refining process. These feedstock streams are purchased from pipeline operators, refineries, chemical processing facilities and third-party providers, and then processed at a third-party facility under our direction. The end products are typically three distillate petroleum streams (gasoline blendstock and fuel oil cutterstock), which are sold to major oil companies or to large petroleum trading and blending companies. The end products are delivered by barge and truck to customers.  In addition, the Refining and Marketing division purchases black oil which is then re-refined through our thermal chemical extraction process.  The finished product is then sold by barge as fuel oil cutterstock and a feedstock component for major refineries.    Our revenues are affected by changes in various commodity prices including crude oil, natural gas, diesel and #6-oil.    Cost of Revenues    BLACK OIL - Cost of revenues for our Black Oil division are comprised primarily of feedstock purchases from a network of providers. Other cost of revenues include transportation costs incurred by third parties, purchasing and receiving costs, analytical assessments, brokerage fees and commissions, surveying and storage costs.    REFINING AND MARKETING - The Refining and Marketing division incurs cost of revenues relating to the purchase of feedstock, purchasing and receiving costs, and inspection and processing of the feedstock into gasoline blendstock and fuel oil cutter by a third party. Cost of revenues also includes broker’s fees, inspection and transportation costs.     Our cost of revenues are affected by changes in various commodity indices, including crude oil, natural gas and #6 oil.  For example, if the price for crude oil increases, the cost of solvent additives used in the production of blended oil products, and fuel cost for transportation cost from third party providers will generally increase. Similarly, if the price of crude oil falls, these costs may also decline.             -37-             General and Administrative Expenses     Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other employee-related benefits for executive, administrative, legal, financial and information technology personnel, as well as outsourced and professional services, rent, utilities, and related expenses at our headquarters, as well as certain taxes.     Merger Related Expenses     In connection with the merger with World Waste we incurred additional nonrecurring general and administrative expenses.  These expenses include legal, audit, stock compensation, and additional start-up compliance expenses that are nonrecurring and are a result of the merger.     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 COMPARED TO THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009     Set forth below are our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009; in the comparative tables below, increases in revenue/income or decreases in expense (favorable variances) are shown without parentheses while decreases in revenue/income or increases in expense (unfavorable variances) are shown with parentheses in the “ $ Change ” and “ % Change ” columns.               Twelve Months Ended December 31,                        2010          2009          $ Change          % Change        Revenues      $  58,140,985        $  38,703,847        $  19,437,138           50  %                                                         Cost of Revenues         53,901,041           35,974,295           (17,926,746  )        (50  )%                                                         Gross Profit         4,239,944           2,729,552           1,510,392           55  %                                                         Selling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of merger related expenses)         3,093,307           3,089,539           (3,768  )        (0  )%                                                         Merger related expenses         -           249,397           249,397           100  %                                                         Total selling, general and administrative expenses         3,093,307           3,338,936           245,629           7  %                                                         Income (loss) from operations         1,146,637           (609,384  )        1,756,021           288  %                                                         Other Income         219,333           -           219,333           100  %    Interest Expense         (116,747  )        -           (116,747  )        (100  )%    Total other income (expense)         102,586           -           102,586           100  %    Income tax expense         (20,797  )        -           (20,797  )        (100  )%                                                         Net income      $  1,228,426        $  (609,384  )     $  1,837,810           302  %              -38-               Each of our segments’ gross profit during these periods was as follows:               Twelve Months Ended December 31,                          Black Oil Segment       2010          2009          $ Change          % Change        Total revenue      $  15,355,192        $  22,197,711        $  (6,842,519  )        (31  )%    Total cost of revenue         14,378,393           20,338,112           5,959,719           29  %    Gross profit      $  976,799        $  1,859,599        $  (882,800  )        (47  )%                                                         Refining Segment                                                     Total revenue      $  42,785,793        $  16,506,136        $  26,279,657           159  %    Total cost of revenue         39,522,648           15,636,183           (23,886,465  )        (153  )%    Gross profit      $  3,263,145        $  869,953        $  2,393,192           275  %       Our revenues and cost of revenues are significantly impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices; decreases in commodity prices typically result in decreases in revenue and cost of revenues.  Our gross profit is to a large extent a function of the market discount we are able to obtain in purchasing feedstock, as well as how efficiently management conducts operations.     Total revenues increased 50% for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, due to increases in commodity pricing and increased volume.  The average posting (U.S. Gulfcoast Residual Fuel No. 6 3%) for 2010 increased $14.34 per barrel from a 2009 average of $55.76 per barrel to an average of $70.10 per barrel during 2010.  On average, prices we received for our products increased 26% for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting in a $19 million increase in revenue.     Volume for our Black Oil division decreased 3% percent during fiscal 2010 compared to 2009, respectively.  Our volumes were impacted somewhat due to the loss of the Omega Refining, LLC (“ Omega ”) contract; however such losses were offset by volumes delivered to other third party re-refiners along with newly formed relationships in the #6 oil blending market.  Our per barrel margin in the Black Oil division decreased approximately 46% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 from the same period in 2009.  The reductions in margins were due to the increase in volume of product being transferred to be used in the TCEP process.  As volumes and production increase for TCEP, we believe the margins in the Black Oil division will decrease; however the Company anticipates that additional margins will be recognized in our Refining and Marketing division as a result of any such decrease in margins in the Black Oil division.           Total volume company wide increased 17% during fiscal 2010 compared to 2009, and our per barrel margin increased approximately 32% for fiscal 2010, compared to 2009.            -39-                          Our Refining and Marketing division experienced an increase in production of 210% for its fuel oil cutter product for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, and commodity price increases of approximately 29% over the same period.  The increased production was due in large part to the increased TCEP production during 2010.  The average posting (U.S. Gulfcoast No. 2 Waterborne) during 2010 increased $19.95 per barrel from $67.87 per barrel for 2009 to $87.82 per barrel for 2010.       Our Pygas production decreased 11% for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009; however, commodity prices increased approximately 25% for our finished product for 2010, compared to the same period in 2009.     Our gasoline blendstock volumes increased 111% for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.  The overall increase in revenues associated with our Refining and Marketing division was due to increases in market prices as well as volumes for the period ended December 31, 2010.  Overall volume for the Refining and Marketing division increased 94% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2009.  Margins per barrel increased substantially as well, mostly as a result of market prices.    Our re-refining business, through the use of the contracted TCEP facility, generated revenues of $20,422,977 for the year ended December 31, 2010, with cost of revenues of $20,578,009 producing a gross loss of $155,032.  During the year ended December 31, 2009, these revenues were $5,247,131, with cost of revenues of $5,171,111 producing gross profit of $76,020.  The Company believes that the enhancements to the TCEP technology are substantially complete and that we will begin to see positive results of operations in the near future from such enhancements.  Furthermore, while the Company’s current operations may have been positively effected if it were unable to use the license (and therefore not obligated to pay expenses associated therewith) its ongoing operations would be significantly negatively impacted if it were to lose the License.    Therefore, if the Company were not able to use the CMT facilities moving forward, the Company would be negatively impacted by its ability to compete in the marketplace, as it believes that in order to compete with its competitors, it may need the CMT facilities to produce higher valued products from Black Oil streams.  Additionally, as our competitors bring new technologies to the marketplace, which will likely enable them to obtain higher values for the finished products created through their technologies from purchased Black Oil feedstock, they will be able to pay more for feedstock due to the additional value received from their finished product (i.e., as their margins increase, they are able to increase the prices they are willing to pay for feedstock).  If CMT is not able to continue to refine the technology and gain efficiencies in their TCEP process we could be negatively impacted by the ability of our competitors to bring new processes to market which compete with our processes as well as their ability to outbid us for feedstock supplies.    If we are unable to effectively compete with additional technologies brought to market by our competitors, our finished products could be worth less and if our competitors are willing to pay more for feedstock than we are, they could drive up prices, which would cause our revenues to decrease, and cause our cost of sales to increase, respectively.  Additionally, if we are forced to pay more for feedstock, our cash flows will be negatively impacted and our margins will decrease.    Provided the Company’s expenses do not increase, the Company is able to meet its objectives and reduce its operating costs associated with the TCEP technology, as well as increase volumes of Black Oil feedstock being purchased, and none of our competitors bring similar technology to market as our TCEP technology, we anticipate our revenues increasing moving forward.  In addition, if we are able to accomplish our goals, as described above, we believe our cash flow will improve substantially which will further the Company’s ability to expand its contracted TCEP operations as well as reduce its reliance on its Line of Credit with Bank of America. This will further increase available cash for future research and development and potentially the creation of additional facilities using its license.             -40-             Prevailing prices of certain commodity products significantly impacted our revenues and cash flows during 2010, as noted above the revenue variances from fiscal 2009 to 2010 were largely due to the changes in commodity pricing between the two periods as detailed below.     The following table sets forth the high and low spot prices during 2009 for our key benchmarks.

Our margins are a function of the difference between what we are able to pay for raw materials and the market prices for the range of products produced.  The various petroleum products produced are typically a function of Crude Oil indices and are quoted on multiple exchanges such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (“ NYMEX ”).  These prices are determined by a global market and can be influenced by many factors, including but not limited to supply/demand, weather, politics, and global/regional inventory levels.  As such, we cannot provide any assurances regarding results of operations for any future periods, as numerous factors outside of our control affect the prices paid for raw materials and the prices (for the most part keyed to the NYMEX) that can be charged for such products.  Additionally, for the near term, results of operations will be subject to further uncertainty, as the global markets and exchanges, including the NYMEX, have recently experienced extreme volatility due to a tightening of the credit markets and an overall malaise in the financial investment market in general.     Gross profit increased 55% from $2,729,552 for the twelve months ended 2009 to $4,239,944 for the twelve months ended 2010, primarily due to increased volumes, more stabilized and increasing commodity pricing, and adjustments to certain contracts which further reduce our market exposure.  The Company was able to increase its margins in light of increased costs related to its contracted TCEP process.             -41-             Selling, general, and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged; however when including merger related expenses they actually decreased 7% or $245,629 for the twelve months ended 2010 to $3,093,307 compared to $3,338,936 for the same period in 2009.  This decrease is primarily due to the absence of merger related expenses in 2010 some of which included legal expenses of approximately $75,000 specifically related to SEC filings, administrative and transitional costs.     We had net income of $1,228,426 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 compared to a net loss of $609,384 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, an increase in net income of $1,837,810 or 302% from the prior year’s period.  The increase in net income was largely due to maintaining similar selling, general, and administrative expenses as fiscal 2009, along with a 55% increase in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.      Financial Highlights for the Fourth Quarter Include:     .           Revenue increased 16% to $15.7 million for the fourth quarter 2010,  compared with $13.5 million in the year-ago quarter; and     .           Gross profit increased 55% to $1.5 million compared with $956,000 in  the year-ago quarter.         Liquidity and Capital Resources     The success of our current business operations is not dependent on extensive capital expenditures, but rather on relationships with feedstock suppliers and end-product customers, and on efficient management of overhead costs.  Through these relationships, we are able to achieve volume discounts in the procurement of our feedstock, thereby increasing the margins of our segments’ operations.  The resulting operating cash flow is crucial to the viability and growth of our existing business lines.     We had total assets of $8,139,345 as of December 31, 2010 compared to $7,547,987 at December 31, 2009.  This increase was partially due to the improvement in net income during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 which increased by $1,837,810 to net income of $1,228,426 for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, as well as the $922,898 increase in inventory which was somewhat offset by the $705,913 decrease in our Accounts receivable over the same period in 2009.  This increase in inventory is partly due to increased commodity pricing which increases the carrying cost of our inventory as well as timing of our sales.  In addition there was a $158,769 increase in the balance of the license for the TCEP technology (due to increased expenditures on such process offset by amortization on such asset), described below, all of which attributed to the increase in total assets as of December 31, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009.  Total current assets as of December 31, 2010 of $6,229,089 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $744,313, accounts receivable, net of $1,482,510, inventory of $3,901,781, and prepaid expenses of $100,485.  Long term assets consisted of fixed assets, net of $76,290, and a licensing agreement, net in the amount of $1,833,966, which represents the value of the Company’s licensing agreement for the use of the thermal chemical extraction technology, net of amortization.  As of December 31, 2010, an additional $619,904 of development investments have been made to the thermal/chemical process technology and added to the original $1.4 million license value.  The Company has fully paid CMT for the license for the thermal/chemical process as of the date of this filing.  Our cash, accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable fluctuate and are somewhat tied to one another based on the timing of our inventory cycles and sales.     The enhancements to the contracted TCEP process during the year ended December 31, 2010, which were expended by CMT and reimbursed by the Company totaled $288,015, and helped regulate the amount of chemicals being added to the process which also decreases future maintenance costs, monthly chemical costs and improves the quality of the finished product. The infrastructure and piping was reconfigured during the period to reduce the amount of water disposed of in the process, thus decreasing the monthly disposal costs associated with the operation of the process. Pumps were installed in certain areas of the process which will decrease the monthly repair and maintenance costs on site. Liners were added to some of the process tanks in order to preserve the future value of the assets. These are just a few of the enhancements that were made to the process during the year ended December 31, 2010, substantially all of which enhancements relate to improving the efficiency and quality of the process and did not relate to the replacement of existing equipment.             -42-             We had total liabilities of $5,600,472 as of December 31, 2010, compared to $6,422,144 at December 31, 2009.  This decrease was largely due to the payment of debt to a related party in the amount of $841,855, as well as a substantial reduction in our accounts payable during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 of $459,358.  At December 31, 2010, total liabilities consisted of accounts payable of $4,593,199, accounts payable – related parties of $407,273, and long-term liabilities of $600,000 relating to the 600,000 outstanding shares of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”), which are mandatorily redeemable, unless converted into common stock pursuant to the terms of such Series B Preferred Stock on the third anniversary of the issuance date of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock.    We had positive working capital of $1,228,617 as of December 31, 2010. Excluding current liabilities to related parties our working capital was $1,635,890 as of December 31, 2010.  The improvement in working capital from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 is due to the net income of $1,228,426 which we generated for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, the payment of debt to a related party in the amount of $841,855 (which decreased current liabilities), as well as a reduction in our accounts payable of $459,358 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010.     The continuing turmoil in the financial markets has resulted in a decreased willingness on the part of lenders to enter into new agreements or extend loans.  The banks and other businesses with which we transact our business have also been affected by market developments and conditions, which could affect their ability to enter into transactions with us and further impact the way we conduct business.      Our future operating cash flows will vary based on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including commodity prices, the cost of recovered oil, and the ability to turn our inventory.  Other factors that have affected and are expected to continue to affect earnings and cash flow are transportation, processing, and storage costs.  Over the long term, our operating cash flows will also be impacted by our ability to effectively manage our administrative and operating costs.     In September 2010, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Bank of America Merrill Lynch  (“Bank of America”). Prior to entering into the loan agreement, the Company satisfied in full all of its prior obligations owing to Regions Bank (“Regions”) under the revolving line of credit agreement entered into in June 2009 and amended on May 25, 2010, which had an outstanding balance of $1,300,000 on June 30, 2010, and terminated such line of credit agreement. Regions subsequently released all of its previously held security agreements and financing statements.    Pursuant to the loan agreement, Bank of America agreed to loan up to $3,500,000 in the form of a revolving line of credit, which is expected to be used for feedstock purchases and general corporate purposes. The line of credit bears interest at the Bank of America LIBOR rate plus 3%, adjusted daily, and is due on September 16, 2011.  We also agreed to certain affirmative and negative covenants in connection with our entry into the Loan Agreement, including, among other things, the requirement to maintain a ratio of (a) net income, plus income taxes and interest expense; to (b) interest expense, of at least 1.5 to 1, on a quarterly basis; and the prohibition, without the prior consent of Bank of America, of the sale of any assets outside the normal course of business and/or the acquisition of any assets outside the normal course of business.  As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance on all of its covenants.    The financing arrangement discussed above is secured by all of the assets of the Company. The available amount is based on ratios of accounts receivable and inventory. The management of the Company believes that with the financing arrangement, in addition to projected earnings, it will have sufficient liquidity to fund the Company’s operations for the foreseeable future, although it may seek additional financing to fund acquisitions or other development in the future.     As of December 31, 2010, there was no balance due on the Line of Credit, of which there was $2,600,000 available (based on the criteria described above, and the letter of credit described below).            -43-             In October 2010 we entered into a Sales Agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to purchase approximately 400,000 to 600,000 gallons of raw pyronaptha per month at a variable price per gallon formula, based on the prior weeks’ market prices of certain market indexes, for a term beginning on October 1, 2010 and ending on September 30, 2011.  The agreement required the Company to provide a standby letter of credit in the amount of $900,000, which expires on October 14, 2011.  To date there have been no draws against the letter of credit. This letter of credit reduces the amount of available balance under the line of credit.     Our re-refining business will require significant capital to design and construct any new facilities other than the existing facility in Baytown, Texas, owned by CMT.  We have the right to use the existing facility in Baytown, Texas, pursuant to an Operating Agreement with CMT described above. We currently estimate that the cost to construct a new, fully functional full-scale commercial process at another location would be approximately $2.5 to $5.0 million, based on throughput capacity.  The facility infrastructure would be an additional capitalized expenditure to these proposed process costs and would depend on the location and site specifics of the facility.     We believe that cash from ongoing operations and our working capital facility will be sufficient to satisfy our existing cash requirements.   However, in order to implement our growth strategy, and pay our outstanding debts (as described above) we may need to secure additional financing in the future.    Additionally, as part of our ongoing efforts to maintain a capital structure that is closely aligned with what we believe to be the potential of our business and goals for future growth, which is subject to cyclical changes in commodity prices, we will be exploring additional sources of external liquidity.  The receptiveness of the capital markets to an offering of debt or equities cannot be assured and may be negatively impacted by, among other things, debt maturities, current market conditions, and potential stockholder dilution. The sale of additional securities, if undertaken by the Company and if accomplished, may result in dilution to our shareholders. We cannot assure you, however, that future financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.     There is currently only a limited market for our common stock, and as such, we anticipate that such market will be illiquid, sporadic and subject to wide fluctuations in response to several factors moving forward, including, but not limited to:        (1)    actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;              (2)    our ability or inability to generate new revenues; and               (3)    the number of shares in our public float.       Furthermore, because our common stock is traded on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board, our stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. These market fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, at present, we have a limited number of shares in our public float, and as a result, there could be extreme fluctuations in the price of our common stock.  The total number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the date of this report was 8,452,169 shares, and approximately 6,600,000 of these shares are subject to Lock-up Agreements.  The Lock-up Agreements provide that until three years following the effective date of the Merger (the “ Lock-Up Period ”), shareholders subject to the Lock-Up Agreements cannot sell, assign, pledge or otherwise transfer any shares of common stock such holders beneficially own, without the Company's prior written consent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lock-up Agreements provide that the holders may transfer (i) all or any portion of the shares subject to the Lock-up Agreements commencing on the date that the closing price of our common stock has averaged at least $15.00 per share over a period of 20 consecutive trading days and the daily trading volume over the same 20-day period has averaged at least 7,500 shares; (ii) all or any portion of the shares as a bona fide gift or gifts, provided that the donee or donees thereof agree to be bound by the restrictions set forth in the Lock-up Agreement, (iii) all or any portion of the shares to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the holder or the immediate family of the holder, provided that the trustee of the trust agrees to be bound by the restrictions set forth in the Lock-up Agreement, and provided further that any such transfer shall not involve a disposition for value, and (iv) in any given three-month period commencing on the one-year anniversary of the effective date of the Merger, up to that number of shares equal to 5% of the total number of shares then beneficially owned by such holder.             -44-             The Company’s Board of Directors is currently in discussions regarding the potential partial or complete release and cancellation of some or all of the Lock-Up Agreements.  As a result, up to approximately 6.6 million of such shares currently subject to such Lock-Up Agreements may be eligible to be sold (subject to restrictions of such shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities Act ”)) following the release of such Lock-Up Agreements by the Board of Directors, subsequent to the filing of this Report.    Additionally, the Company has approximately 4.6 million shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“ Series A Preferred Stock ”) issued and outstanding as of the date of this report.  Among the other rights of the Series A Preferred Stock, each share of Series A Preferred Stock can be converted into one (1) share of common stock, provided that prior to the three-year anniversary of the Merger (April 16, 2012), no holder may, in any given three-month period, convert more than that number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock that equals 5% of the total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then beneficially owned by such holder (the “ Conversion Limitation ”).  Additionally, holders may convert only up to that number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, such that upon conversion, the aggregate beneficial ownership of the Company’s common stock held by any such holder does not exceed 4.99% of the Company’s common stock then outstanding (the “ Beneficial Limitation ”).  The Company’s Board of Directors is currently in discussions regarding the approval of an amended and restated Series A Preferred Stock designation which would remove all or some portion of the Conversion Limitation and may allow for the Series A Preferred Stock holders to convert the entire amount of their holdings of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of the Company’s common stock and sell such common stock, subject only to the Beneficial Limitation (and any conversion or resale limitations under the Securities Act).  Assuming the Board of Directors approves such amended and restated designation, such amendment will be subject to the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the filing of such amended designation with the Secretary of State of Nevada. The Company plans to file a current report on Form 8-K at such time as the Lock-Up Agreements (or any portion thereof) are terminated and/or the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock are amended.    As such, and subject to the above and any restrictions on resale set forth in the Securities Act, it is possible that following the filing of this report, and the Board of Director’s approval (and in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series A Preferred Stock shareholders’ approval), we will have an additional approximately 11.2 million shares of common stock available for immediate resale, which were previously locked-up and/or restricted from conversion.  The sale of such common stock previously subject to Lock-Up Agreements may cause the price of our common stock to decline in value and the conversion and sale of shares of Series A Preferred Stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline in value and/or cause immediate and substantial dilution to our common stock shareholders.  Additionally, the sale of such previously locked-up and/or converted Series A Preferred Stock shares on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board may cause continued downward pressure on the price of our common stock.      We believe that our stock prices (bid, ask and closing prices) are entirely arbitrary, are not related to the actual value of the Company, and may not reflect the actual value of our common stock (and may reflect a lower value). Shareholders and potential investors in our common stock should exercise caution before making an investment in the Company, and should not rely on the publicly quoted or traded stock prices in determining our common stock value, but should instead determine the value of our common stock based on the information contained in the Company's public reports, industry information, and those business valuation methods commonly used to value private companies.            -45-             We may seek the listing of our common stock on NASDAQ, NYSE, or AMEX or another national securities exchange in the future.  We believe that the listing of our securities on a national exchange will facilitate the Company’s access to capital, from which certain acquisitions and capital investments might be financed.  However, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to meet the initial listing standards of any stock exchange in the future, or that we will be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on any stock exchange in the future, assuming we are initially approved for quotation on an exchange of which there can be no assurance.  Until meeting the listing requirements of a national securities exchange, we expect that our common stock will continue to be eligible to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board, another over-the-counter quotation system, or on the " pink sheets, " where our stockholders may find it more difficult to dispose of shares or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock.    Cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period ended December 31, 2009:               Years ended December 31,               2010          2009                               Beginning cash and cash equivalents      $  514,136        $  17,616                                    Net cash provided by (used in):                             Operating activities         774,978           713,681       Investing activities         (305,229  )        (1,816,003  )    Financing activities         (239,572  )        1,598,842                                    Net increase in cash and cash equivalents         230,177           496,520                                    Ending cash and cash equivalents      $  744,313        $  514,136           Operating activities provided cash of $774,978 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to providing $713,681 of cash during the corresponding period in 2009.  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from our operations and the availability to borrow funds under our Line of Credit with Bank of America, described above.  The primary reasons for this increase are related to our net income of $1,228,426, our $705,913 decrease in accounts receivable, which was offset by a $459,358 decrease in accounts payable, and $120,459 decrease in accounts payable-related parties, and a $922,898 increase in inventory for the year ended December 31, 2010.  Additionally, non-cash net income related to stock compensation provided $182,321 of liquidity and depreciation and amortization contributed $145,977 of net cash.     Investing activities used cash of $305,229 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to having used $1,816,003 during the corresponding period in 2009.  Investing activities in 2010 are comprised of $288,015 in cash payments related to the license of the thermal chemical extraction process and $17,214 for the purchase of fixed assets.     Financing activities used $239,572 of cash during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, as compared to providing $1,598,842 during the corresponding period in 2009. Financing activities in 2010 included $841,855 of payments on amounts due to related parties representing amounts paid to an entity controlled by Vertex LP, an entity which is majority-owned and controlled by our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Benjamin P. Cowart, offset by $600,000 of proceeds from sale of Series B Preferred Stock and $2,283 of proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options.             -46-             Net Operating Losses    We intend to take advantage of any potential tax benefits related to net operating losses (“ NOLs ”) acquired as part of the World Waste merger.  As a result of the merger we acquired approximately $42 million of net operating losses that may be used to offset taxable income generated by the Company in future periods.     It is possible that the Company may be unable to use these NOLs in their entirety.  The extent to which the Company will be able to utilize these carry-forwards in future periods is subject to limitations based on a number of factors, including the number of shares issued within a three-year look-back period, whether the merger is deemed to be a change in control, whether there is deemed to be a continuity of World Waste’s historical business, and the extent of the Company’s subsequent income. The Company has not yet determined the extent, if any, to which it may be able to utilize these carry-forwards. The history of these NOLs and the related tax laws are complex and the Company is researching the facts and circumstances as to whether the Company will ultimately be able to utilize the benefit from these NOLs. As of December 31, 2010, there were approximately $39.8 million of potential NOLs.     Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates     Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets valuation, and legal matters. Actual results may differ from these estimates. (See Note 2 to the Vertex Energy, Inc. financial statements).    The Company evaluates the carrying value and recoverability of its long-lived assets within the provisions of the FASB ASC regarding long-lived assets.  It requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets.  Whenever any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.     Revenue Recognition.     Revenue for each of the Company’s divisions is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, goods are delivered, sales price is determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized upon delivery by truck and railcar of feedstock to its re-refining customers and upon product leaving the Company’s terminal facilities via barge.    Legal Matters.   Accruals are established for legal matters when, in our opinion, it is probable that a liability exists and the liability can be reasonably estimated. Actual expenses incurred in future periods can differ materially from accruals established.     Stock Based Compensation     The Company accounts for share-based expense and activity in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for services. Under this provision share-based compensation costs are measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and are recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period, generally the vesting period of the equity grant.     Share-based payments to non-employees are measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and are recognized as an expense over the service period, generally the vesting period of the equity grant. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award, expected option term, expected volatility of the stock over the option’s expected term, risk-free interest rate over the option’s expected term, and the expected annual dividend yield. The Company believes that the valuation technique and approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair values of the stock options granted.            -47-             Basic and Diluted Loss per Share     Basic and diluted loss per share has been calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.     License Agreement Development Costs    The Company capitalizes costs to improve any acquired intangible asset which is specifically identifiable, and has a definite life. All other costs are expensed as incurred.    Income Taxes     The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 740.  The Company records a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and when temporary differences become deductible.  The Company considers, among other available information, uncertainties surrounding the recoverability of deferred tax assets, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and other matters in making this assessment.     Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC Topic 810-10-15, “Consolidation-Variable Interest Entities,” or Topic 810-10-15.  Topic 810-10-15 improves financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities and provides more relevant and reliable information to users of financial statements.  Topic 810-10-15 is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009 and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period.  We adopted Topic 810-10-15 on January 1, 2010, but it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.    Market Risk    Our revenues and cost of revenues are affected by fluctuations in the value of energy related products.  We attempt to mitigate much of the risk associated with the volatility of relevant commodity prices by using our knowledge of the market to obtain feedstock at attractive costs, by efficiently managing the logistics associated with our products, by turning our inventory over quickly, and by selling our products into markets where we believe we can achieve the greatest value.  We believe that the current downward trend in natural gas prices coupled with increasing crude oil prices provides an attractive margin opportunity for our proposed thermal chemical extraction process.    Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (§ 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a “ smaller reporting company, ” as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).             -48-             Item 8.
