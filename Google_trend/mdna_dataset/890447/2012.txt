Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Strategy and Plan of Operations      Our goal is to continue to grow our business of recycling used motor oil and other   petroleum   by-product   streams. Strategies to achieve this goal include (1) working to grow revenues in core businesses, (2) seeking to increase margins through developing additional processing capabilities, including but not limited to TCEP at additional locations other than Baytown, Texas, (3) increasing market share through greenfield development or through acquisitions, and (4) continued pursuit of alternative energy project development opportunities, some of which were originally sourced by World Waste.           ·    Our primary focus is to continue to supply used motor oil and other hydrocarbons to existing customers and to cultivate additional feedstock supply volume by expanding relationships with existing suppliers and developing new supplier relationships. We will seek to maintain good relations with existing suppliers, customers and vendors and the high levels of customer service necessary to maintain these businesses. We plan to seek to develop relationships with several other re-refining facilities to serve as such facilities’ primary and exclusive feedstock provider.             ·    We intend to work to improve margins by applying new technologies, including but not limited to the re-refining of certain oil feedstock through TCEP to existing and new feedstock streams. The first application of this technology at CMT’s Baytown, Texas facility came on-line during the third quarter of 2009 and we have continued to enhance the facility and process since that time.  We also plan to build additional facilities for various processes to implement proprietary company-owned, leased, or potentially acquired technologies to upgrade feedstock materials to create fuel oil cutter, vacuum gas oil and other value-added energy products.  By moving from our historical role as a value-added logistics provider, to operating as an actual re-refiner ourselves, we plan to improve margins through the upgrading of used motor oil and transmix inventories into higher value end products, funding permitting, of which there can be no assurance.             ·    We plan to seek to grow our market share by consolidating feedstock supply through partnering with or acquiring collection and aggregation assets, funding permitting. For example, we may seek to use a combination of stock and cash to acquire or enter into joint ventures with various local used motor oil collectors and aggregators, technology providers, real estate partners and others. Such acquisitions and/or ventures, if successful, could add to revenues and provide better control over the quality and quantity of feedstock available for resale and/or upgrading as well as providing additional locations for the implementation of the contracted TCEP technology.  This may include the greenfield development of collection assets, terminals, re-refining facilities and equipment and opportunistic mergers and acquisitions.          Additionally, the Board of Directors has previously formed a sub-committee of the Related Party Transaction Committee to begin reviewing a potential acquisition of certain assets and/or business units related to Vertex LP, which is a related party, controlled by Benjamin P. Cowart, our largest shareholder, President and Director (“Vertex LP”).   As part of the Company’s merger transaction with World Waste Technologies, Inc. and Vertex LP, which closed on April 16, 2009, the Company was provided (1) a right of first refusal to match any third-party offer to purchase Vertex LP or its related entities (collectively the “Vertex LP Entities”) on the terms and conditions set forth in such offer; and (2) the option, exercisable in our sole discretion any time after the 18-month anniversary of the closing of the merger (which date was October 16, 2010) and so long as Mr. Cowart is employed by the Company, to purchase all or any part of the outstanding stock or assets of any of the Vertex LP Entities owned by Vertex LP or VTX, Inc. (its general partner, which is also controlled by Mr. Cowart), at a price based on an independent third-party valuation and appraisal of the fair market value of such Vertex LP Entity.         Pursuant to the merger agreement, the Company formed the Related Party Transaction Committee which is required to include at least two “independent directors” (defined as any individuals who do not beneficially own more than 5% of the outstanding voting shares of the Company, are not employed by, or officers of the Company or any entity related to Mr. Cowart, are not directors or managers of any such company, are not family members of Mr. Cowart, and would qualify as “Independent Directors” as defined in the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange). The Related Party Transaction Committee is charged with the review and pre-approval of any and all related party transactions, including between Vertex and Vertex LP, Mr. Cowart, or any other company or individual which may be affiliated with Mr. Cowart.  The previously formed sub-committee of the Related Party Transaction Committee including Dave Phillips, Dan Borgen and John Pimentel, will review and advise the Related Party Transaction Committee and the Board of Directors in connection with the potential exercise by the Company of the Right of First Refusal.               -35-               The Company has not entered into any definitive agreements or understandings to acquire any assets or securities of the Vertex LP Entities or to exercise its Right of First Refusal to date, but may enter into such agreements or understandings in the future.  Such transaction may include the Company assuming and/or acquiring substantial amounts of debt or liabilities; the payment of substantial cash consideration; and/or the issuance of significant non-cash consideration consisting of preferred stock, shares of our common stock or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, which may result in substantial dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders and may significantly dilute the Company’s common stock book value. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management’s ability to maintain control of the Company because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.   Any agreements or understandings would be subject to the approval of the management and owners of the Vertex LP Entities which may be acquired, the Company’s Related Party Transaction Committee, and where applicable, the approval of the Company’s shareholders.       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    Description of Material Financial Line Items:     Revenues       We generate revenues from two existing operating divisions as follows:         BLACK OIL - Revenues for our Black Oil division are comprised primarily of feedstock sales (used motor oil) which are purchased from a network of local and regional suppliers.  Volumes are consolidated for efficient delivery and then sold to third-party re-refiners and fuel oil blenders for the export market.         REFINING AND MARKETING - The Refining and Marketing division generates revenues relating to the sales of finished products.  The Refining and Marketing division gathers hydrocarbon streams in the form of petroleum distillates, transmix and other chemical products that have become off-specification during the transportation or refining process. These feedstock streams are purchased from pipeline operators, refineries, chemical processing facilities and third-party providers, and then processed at a third-party facility under our direction. The end products are typically three distillate petroleum streams (gasoline blendstock, pygas and fuel oil cutterstock), which are sold to major oil companies or to large petroleum trading and blending companies. The end products are delivered by barge and truck to customers.  In addition, the Refining and Marketing division purchases black oil which is then re-refined through TCEP.  The finished product is then sold by barge as a fuel oil cutterstock and a feedstock component for major refineries.         Our revenues are affected by changes in various commodity prices including crude oil, natural gas and #6 oil.       Cost of Revenues       BLACK OIL - Cost of revenues for our Black Oil division are comprised primarily of feedstock purchases from a network of providers. Other cost of revenues include transportation costs incurred by third parties, purchasing and receiving costs, analytical assessments, brokerage fees and commissions, surveying and storage costs.                     REFINING AND MARKETING - The Refining and Marketing division incurs cost of revenues relating to the purchase of feedstock, purchasing and receiving costs, and inspection and processing of the feedstock into gasoline blendstock, pygas and fuel oil cutter by a third party. Cost of revenues also includes broker’s fees, inspection and transportation costs.       Our cost of revenues are affected by changes in various commodity indices, including crude oil, natural gas and #6 oil.  For example, if the price for crude oil increases, the cost of solvent additives used in the production of blended oil products, and fuel cost for transportation cost from third party providers will generally increase. Similarly, if the price of crude oil falls, these costs may also decline.               -36-             General and Administrative Expenses       Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other employee-related benefits for executive, administrative, legal, financial and information technology personnel, as well as outsourced and professional services, rent, utilities, and related expenses at our headquarters, as well as certain taxes.        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 COMPARED TO THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010     Set forth below are our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the same period in 2010;

decreases in commodity prices typically result in decreases in revenue and cost of revenues.  Our gross profit is to a large extent a function of the market discount we are able to obtain in purchasing feedstock, as well as how efficiently management conducts operations.     Total revenues increased 89% for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, due to increases in commodity pricing and increased volume.  The average posting (U.S. Gulfcoast Residual Fuel No. 6 3%) for 2011 increased $25.99 per barrel from a 2010 average of $69.66 per barrel to an average of $95.66 per barrel during 2011.  On average, prices we received for our products increased 37% for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, resulting in a $51 million increase in revenue.     Volume for our Black Oil division decreased 15% percent during fiscal 2011 compared to 2010, respectively.  This volume decrease is attributable to the increased amount of product being transferred to TCEP for additional processing as opposed to being sold through our Black Oil division.  Our per barrel margin in the Black Oil division increased approximately 20% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 from the same period in 2010.  The increases in margins were due to the increase in volume of product being transferred to be used in the TCEP process as well as increased volume of product being delivered and sourced to third party re-refiners.  As volumes and production increase for TCEP, additional margins will be recognized in our Refining and Marketing division.             Total volume companywide increased 26% during fiscal 2011 compared to 2010, and our per barrel margin increased approximately 52% for fiscal 2011, compared to 2010.                 Our Refining and Marketing division experienced an increase in production of 72% for its fuel oil cutter product for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, and commodity price increases of approximately 39% over the same period.  The increased production was due in large part to the increased TCEP production during 2011.  The average posting (U.S. Gulfcoast No. 2 Waterborne) during 2011 increased $34.55 per barrel from $88.38 per barrel for 2010 to $122.73 per barrel for 2011.       Our Pygas production decreased 27% for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010; however, commodity prices increased approximately 33% for our finished product for 2011, compared to the same period in 2010.     Our gasoline blendstock volumes increased 60% for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.  The average posting (U.S. Gulfcoast Unleaded 87 Waterborne) during 2011 increased $.69 per gallon from  to $2.09 per gallon for 2010  to $2.78 per gallon during 2011. The overall increase in revenues associated with our Refining and Marketing division was due to increases in market prices as well as volumes for the period ended December 31, 2011.      Our re-refining business, through the use of the contracted TCEP facility, generated revenues of $52,097,274 for the year ended December 31, 2011, with cost of revenues of $49,941,692 producing a gross profit of $2,155,582.  During the year ended December 31, 2010, these revenues were $19,431,676 with cost of revenues of $20,578,009 producing gross loss of $1,146,333.  Due to the Company having the rights to license the use of the technology, its income from operations has been positively affected for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011.  We currently operate this technology from CMT pursuant to a perpetual license as described above under  “Operating and Licensing Agreement.”  Overall volume for the Refining and Marketing division increased 49% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2010.  Margins per barrel increased substantially as a result of improved costs for our TCEP operation as well as improved market conditions for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011.            -38-             If the Company were not able to use the CMT facilities moving forward, the Company would be negatively impacted by its ability to compete in the marketplace, as it believes that in order to compete with its competitors, it may need the CMT facilities to produce higher valued products from Black Oil streams.  Additionally, as our competitors bring new technologies to the marketplace, which will likely enable them to obtain higher values for the finished products created through their technologies from purchased Black Oil feedstock, they will be able to pay more for feedstock due to the additional value received from their finished product (i.e., as their margins increase, they are able to increase the prices they are willing to pay for feedstock).  If CMT is not able to continue to refine the technology and gain efficiencies in their TCEP process we could be negatively impacted by the ability of our competitors to bring new processes to market which compete with our processes as well as their ability to outbid us for feedstock supplies.    If we are unable to effectively compete with additional technologies brought to market by our competitors, our finished products could be worth less and if our competitors are willing to pay more for feedstock than we are, they could drive up prices, which would cause our revenues to decrease, and cause our cost of sales to increase, respectively.  Additionally, if we are forced to pay more for feedstock, our cash flows will be negatively impacted and our margins will decrease.    Provided the Company’s expenses do not increase, the Company is able to meet its objectives and reduce its operating costs associated with the TCEP technology, as well as increase volumes of Black Oil feedstock being purchased, and none of our competitors bring similar technology to market as our TCEP technology, we anticipate our revenues increasing moving forward.  In addition, if we are able to accomplish our goals, as described above, we believe our cash flow will improve substantially which will further the Company’s ability to expand its contracted TCEP operations as well as reduce its reliance on its Line of Credit with Bank of America. This will further increase available cash for future research and development and potentially the creation of additional facilities using its license.       Prevailing prices of certain commodity products significantly impacted our revenues and cash flows during 2011, as noted above the revenue variances from fiscal 2010 to 2011 were largely due to the changes in commodity pricing between the two periods as detailed below.     The following table sets forth the high and low spot prices during 2010 for our key benchmarks.        2010                     Benchmark    High    Date    Low    Date     U.S. Gulfcoast No. 2 Waterborne (dollars per gallon)    $2.50    December 23    $1.84    February 8     U.S. Gulfcoast Unleaded 87 Waterborne (dollars per gallon)    $2.41    December 23    $1.86    February 8     U.S. Gulfcoast Residual Fuel No. 6 3% (dollars per barrel)    $77.00    December 31    $60.55    May 25     NYMEX Crude oil (Dollars per barrel)    $91.38    December 31    $68.01    May 20           Reported in Platt's US Marketscan (Gulf Coast)                    The following table sets forth the high and low spot prices during 2011 for our key benchmarks.         2011                     Benchmark    High    Date    Low    Date     U.S. Gulfcoast No. 2 Waterborne (dollars per gallon)     $3.30    April 8     $2.44    January 4     U.S. Gulfcoast Unleaded 87 Waterborne (dollars per gallon)     $3.53    May 9     $2.33    January 25     U.S. Gulfcoast Residual Fuel No. 6 3% (dollars per barrel)     $105.20    November 8     $76.70    January 4     NYMEX Crude oil (Dollars per barrel)     $113.93    April 29     $75.67    October 4           Reported in Platt's US Marketscan (Gulf Coast)                            -39-             We have seen steady increases in each of the benchmark commodities we track through December 2011.    Our margins are a function of the difference between what we are able to pay for raw materials and the market prices for the range of products produced.  The various petroleum products produced are typically a function of Crude Oil indices and are quoted on multiple exchanges such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (“ NYMEX ”).  These prices are determined by a global market and can be influenced by many factors, including but not limited to supply/demand, weather, politics, and global/regional inventory levels.  As such, we cannot provide any assurances regarding results of operations for any future periods, as numerous factors outside of our control affect the prices paid for raw materials and the prices (for the most part keyed to the NYMEX) that can be charged for such products.  Additionally, for the near term, results of operations will be subject to further uncertainty, as the global markets and exchanges, including the NYMEX, continue to experience volatility.     Gross profit increased 90% from $4,239,944 for the twelve months ended 2010 to $8,074,070 for the twelve months ended 2011, primarily due to increases in volumes sold or re-refined, more stabilized and increasing commodity pricing, and reduced costs related to the contracted TCEP process.        We had selling, general and administrative expenses of $4,099,682 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, compared to $3,093,307 from the prior year’s period, an increase of $1,006,375 or 33% from the prior period, due to increases in marketing, investor relations and payroll expenses from the prior period.     We had income before income taxes of $3,911,702 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 compared to income before income taxes of $1,249,223 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, an increase in net income of $2,662,479 or 213% from the prior year’s period.  The increase in net income before taxes was largely due to increased volumes and improved performance of our TCEP process which created an increase of 90% in our gross profit, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.   We had an income tax benefit of $1,841,813 for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to an income tax expense of $20,797 for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The increase is due to a benefit for income taxes, for which for the Company has recorded a net deferred asset based on reducing our valuation allowance related to our approximately $42 million of net operating losses that may be used to offset taxable income generated by the Company in future periods.     We had net income of $5,753,515 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 compared to net income of $1,228,426 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, an increase in net income of $4,525,089 or 368% from the prior year’s period.     Financial Highlights for the Fourth Quarter Include:         ·      Revenue increased 99% to $31.3 million for the fourth quarter 2011, compared with $16 million in the year-ago quarter;            ·      Gross profit decreased 12% to $1.30 million compared with $1.48 million in the prior year’s quarter; and           ·      Volumes increased 29% during the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 2010, and our per barrel margin decreased approximately 32% for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to the prior year’s fourth quarter.         Liquidity and Capital Resources     The success of our current business operations is not dependent on extensive capital expenditures, but rather on relationships with feedstock suppliers and end-product customers, and on efficient management of overhead costs.  Through these relationships, we are able to achieve volume discounts in the procurement of our feedstock, thereby increasing the margins of our segments’ operations.  The resulting operating cash flow is crucial to the viability and growth of our existing business lines.             -40-             We had total assets of $16,733,971 as of December 31, 2011 compared to $8,139,345 at December 31, 2010.  This increase was partially due to the improvement in net income during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 which increased by $4,525,089 to net income of $5,753,515 for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, as well as the $2,506,999 increase in inventory along with an increase in accounts receivable of $3,953,496 as of December 31, 2011, compared to December 31, 2010.  This increase in inventory is partly due to increased commodity pricing which increases the carrying cost of our inventory as well as timing of our sales.  In addition there was a $95,583 increase in the balance of the license for the TCEP technology (due to increased expenditures on such process offset by amortization on such asset), described below, all of which attributed to the increase in total assets as of December 31, 2011, compared to December 31, 2010.  Total current assets as of December 31, 2011 of $12,674,254 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $675,188, accounts receivable, net of $5,436,006, accounts receivable-related party of $2,459, inventory of $6,408,780, and prepaid expenses of $151,821.  Long term assets consisted of fixed assets, net of $124,168, and a licensing agreement, net, in the amount of $1,929,549, which represents the value of the Company’s licensing agreement for the use of TCEP, net of amortization.  As of December 31, 2011, an additional $861,358 of development investments have been made to TCEP and added to the original $1.4 million license value.  In addition as a result of the approximately $42 million of net operating losses that may be used to offset taxable income generated by the Company in future periods, the Company has recorded a deferred federal income tax asset of $2,006,000 as of December 31, 2011. The Company has fully paid CMT for the license for the thermal/chemical process as of the date of this filing.  Our cash, accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable fluctuate and are somewhat tied to one another based on the timing of our inventory cycles and sales.     The enhancements to the contracted TCEP process during the year ended December 31, 2011, which were expended by CMT and reimbursed by the Company totaled $241,454, and helped increase certain efficiencies related to the plant, as well as increase the volume of throughput capacity through the facility.     We had total liabilities of $7,396,474 as of December 31, 2011, compared to $5,600,472 at December 31, 2010.  This increase was largely due to the increase in our accounts payable during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 of $1,870,994, At December 31, 2011, total liabilities consisted of accounts payable of $6,464,193, accounts payable – related parties of $620,724 and deposits of $235,557 and deferred federal income tax of $76,000.  Total liabilities decreased by $600,000 as of December 31, 2011, compared to December 31, 2010, in connection with the mandatorily redeemable Series B Preferred Stock, which was converted into common stock in 2011, as described below.    We had positive working capital of $5,353,780 as of December 31, 2011. Excluding current liabilities and current assets related to related parties, our working capital was $5,972,045 as of December 31, 2011.  The improvement in working capital from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 is mainly due to the net income of $5,753,515 which we generated for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011.     Our future operating cash flows will vary based on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including commodity prices, the cost of recovered oil, and the ability to turn our inventory.  Other factors that have affected and are expected to continue to affect earnings and cash flow are transportation, processing, and storage costs.  Over the long term, our operating cash flows will also be impacted by our ability to effectively manage our administrative and operating costs.     In September 2010, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (“Bank of America”).    Pursuant to the loan agreement, Bank of America agreed to loan up to $3,500,000 in the form of a revolving line of credit, which is expected to be used for feedstock purchases and general corporate purposes. The line of credit bears interest at the Bank of America LIBOR rate plus 3%, adjusted daily, and was due on September 16, 2011.  On September 22, 2011, Bank of America provided an extension through December 31, 2011 on the Line of Credit and on December 19, 2011 Bank of America provided an additional extension through March 31, 2012.  We also agreed to certain affirmative and negative covenants in connection with our entry into the Loan Agreement, including, among other things, the requirement to maintain a ratio of (a) net income, plus income taxes and interest expense; to (b) interest expense, of at least 1.5 to 1, on a quarterly basis; and the prohibition, without the prior consent of Bank of America, of the sale of any assets outside the normal course of business and/or the acquisition of any assets outside the normal course of business.  As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance on all of its covenants.            -41-             The financing arrangement discussed above is secured by all of the assets of the Company. The available amount is based on ratios of accounts receivable and inventory. The management of the Company believes that with the financing arrangement, in addition to projected earnings, it will have sufficient liquidity to fund the Company’s operations for the foreseeable future, although it may seek additional financing to fund acquisitions or other development in the future.     As of December 31, 2011, there was no balance due on the Line of Credit, of which there was $3,500,000 available (based on the criteria described above, and the letter of credit described below).    Our re-refining business will require significant capital to design and construct any new facilities other than the existing facility in Baytown, Texas, owned by CMT.  We have the right to use the existing facility in Baytown, Texas, pursuant to an Operating Agreement with CMT described above. We currently estimate that the cost to construct a new, fully functional full-scale commercial process at another location would be approximately $2.5 to $5.0 million, based on throughput capacity.  The facility infrastructure would be an additional capitalized expenditure to these proposed process costs and would depend on the location and site specifics of the facility.     We believe that cash from ongoing operations and our working capital facility will be sufficient to satisfy our existing cash requirements.   However, in order to implement our growth strategy, and pay our outstanding debts (as described above) we may need to secure additional financing in the future.    Additionally, as part of our ongoing efforts to maintain a capital structure that is closely aligned with what we believe to be the potential of our business and goals for future growth, which is subject to cyclical changes in commodity prices, we will be exploring additional sources of external liquidity.  The receptiveness of the capital markets to an offering of debt or equities cannot be assured and may be negatively impacted by, among other things, debt maturities, current market conditions, and potential stockholder dilution. The sale of additional securities, if undertaken by the Company and if accomplished, may result in dilution to our shareholders. We cannot assure you, however, that future financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.     There is currently only a limited market for our common stock, and as such, we anticipate that such market will be illiquid, sporadic and subject to wide fluctuations in response to several factors moving forward, including, but not limited to:        (1)    actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;              (2)    our ability or inability to generate new revenues; and               (3)    the number of shares in our public float.       Furthermore, because our common stock is traded on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board, our stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. These market fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, at present, we have a limited number of shares in our public float, and as a result, there could be extreme fluctuations in the price of our common stock.  The total number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the date of this report was 9,443,921 shares, and approximately 6,600,000 of these shares are subject to Lock-up Agreements.  The Lock-up Agreements provide that until April 16, 2012 (the “ Lock-Up Period ”), shareholders subject to the Lock-Up Agreements cannot sell, assign, pledge or otherwise transfer any shares of common stock such holders beneficially own, without the Company's prior written consent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lock-up Agreements provide that the holders may transfer (i) all or any portion of the shares subject to the Lock-up Agreements commencing on the date that the closing price of our common stock has averaged at least $15.00 per share over a period of 20 consecutive trading days and the daily trading volume over the same 20-day period has averaged at least 7,500 shares; (ii) all or any portion of the shares as a bona fide gift or gifts, provided that the donee or donees thereof agree to be bound by the restrictions set forth in the Lock-up Agreement, (iii) all or any portion of the shares to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the holder or the immediate family of the holder, provided that the trustee of the trust agrees to be bound by the restrictions set forth in the Lock-up Agreement, and provided further that any such transfer shall not involve a disposition for value, and (iv) in any given three-month period commencing on the one-year anniversary of the effective date of the Merger, up to that number of shares equal to 5% of the total number of shares then beneficially owned by such holder.             -42-             Additionally, the Company has approximately 4.4 million shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“ Series A Preferred Stock ”) issued and outstanding as of the date of this report.  Among the other rights of the Series A Preferred Stock, each share of Series A Preferred Stock can be converted into one (1) share of common stock, provided that prior to April 16, 2012, no holder may, in any given three-month period, convert more than that number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock that equals 5% of the total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then beneficially owned by such holder (the “ Conversion Limitation ”).  Additionally, holders may convert only up to that number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, such that upon conversion, the aggregate beneficial ownership of the Company’s common stock held by any such holder does not exceed 4.99% of the Company’s common stock then outstanding (the “ Beneficial Limitation ”).      Consequently, in April 2012, we will have an additional approximately 11 million shares of common stock available for immediate resale, which were previously locked-up and/or restricted from conversion.  The sale of such common stock previously subject to Lock-Up Agreements may cause the price of our common stock to decline in value and the conversion and sale of shares of Series A Preferred Stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline in value and/or may cause immediate and substantial dilution to our common stock shareholders.  Additionally, the sale of such previously locked-up and/or converted Series A Preferred Stock shares may cause continued downward pressure on the price of our common stock.  Such sales and downward pressure may be exacerbated by the limited volume of our shares which trade.    We believe that our stock prices (bid, ask and closing prices) are entirely arbitrary, are not related to the actual value of the Company, and may not reflect the actual value of our common stock (and may reflect a lower value). Shareholders and potential investors in our common stock should exercise caution before making an investment in the Company, and should not rely on the publicly quoted or traded stock prices in determining our common stock value, but should instead determine the value of our common stock based on the information contained in the Company's public reports, industry information, and those business valuation methods commonly used to value private companies.     We may seek the listing of our common stock on NASDAQ, NYSE, or AMEX or another national securities exchange in the future.  We believe that the listing of our securities on a national exchange will facilitate the Company’s access to capital, from which certain acquisitions and capital investments might be financed.  However, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to meet the initial listing standards of any stock exchange in the future, or that we will be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on any stock exchange in the future, assuming we are initially approved for quotation on an exchange of which there can be no assurance.  Until meeting the listing requirements of a national securities exchange, we expect that our common stock will continue to be eligible to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board, another over-the-counter quotation system, or on the " pink sheets, " where our stockholders may find it more difficult to dispose of shares or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock.    Cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 were:                Years ended December 31,               2011          2010                               Beginning cash and cash equivalents      $  744,313        $  514,136                                    Net cash provided by (used in):                             Operating activities         (70,866  )        774,978       Investing activities         (304,509  )        (305,229  )    Financing activities         306,250           (239,572  )                                 Net change in cash and cash equivalents         (69,125  )        230,177                                    Ending cash and cash equivalents      $  675,188        $  744,313                 -43-                Operating activities used cash of $70,866 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to providing $774,978 of cash during the corresponding period in 2010.  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from our operations and the availability to borrow funds under our Line of Credit with Bank of America, described above.  The primary reasons for the decrease in cash provided by operating activities are related to the increase of $3,953,496 in accounts receivable, along with a $2,506,999 increase in inventory and $1,930,000 of deferred federal income tax, offset by a $1,870,994 increase in accounts payable for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $5,753,515 of net income.  Additionally, non-cash items increasing net income related to stock compensation provided $138,859 of liquidity and depreciation and amortization contributed $161,048 of net cash.     Investing activities used cash of $304,509 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to having used $305,229 during the corresponding period in 2010.  Investing activities in 2011 were comprised of $241,454 in cash payments related to the license of the TCEP and $63,055 for the purchase of fixed assets.     Financing activities provided $306,250 of cash during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, as compared to using $239,572 during the corresponding period in 2010. Financing activities in 2011 included $306,250 of proceeds from the exercise of common stock warrants and options.    In January 2010, the Company began a private placement offering to accredited investors only of up to 2,000,000 units (the “ Offering ”), each consisting of (a) one share of Series B Preferred Stock; and (b) one three year warrant to purchase one share of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $2.00 per share (each a “ Unit ”).  We also agreed to grant investors in the Offering piggy-back registration rights (which were subsequently waived at the Company’s request) in connection with the shares of common stock issuable in connection with the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and the shares of common stock underlying the exercise of the warrants sold in the Offering. The shares of Series B Preferred Stock are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at the rate of one for one, automatically convert into common stock if our common stock trades for at least ten consecutive trading days over $2.00 per share, accrue quarterly dividends at the rate of 12% per annum, and are required to be redeemed by the Company, if not converted prior to such redemption date, on the third anniversary of the issuance date of such shares at a redemption rate of $1.00 per share. The dividends are recorded as interest expense, due to the preferred stock being classified as a liability.    During 2010, the Company sold 600,000 Units and raised $600,000 in connection with the Offering.  These  600,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding until June 15, 2011 at which point they were converted into common stock as described below.    The Mandatory Conversion provision of the Series B Stock provided that if the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock was equal to or greater than $2.00 per share for a period of ten (10) consecutive trading days (as occurred between June 2 and June 15, 2011), each share of Series B Stock, without any required action by any holder of such Series B Stock, automatically converts into one (1) share of common stock of the Company (the “ Automatic Conversion ”).  In connection with the Automatic Conversion, each share of Series B Stock was automatically converted into common stock effective June 15, 2011, and such Series B Stock and all rights thereunder were automatically terminated and cancelled.     In September 2011, one of the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock exercised warrants to purchase 150,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and provided the Company aggregate proceeds of $300,000 (warrant exercised at $2 per share).     Net Operating Losses    We intend to take advantage of any potential tax benefits related to net operating losses (“ NOLs ”) acquired as part of the World Waste merger.  As a result of the merger we acquired approximately $42 million of net operating losses that may be used to offset taxable income generated by the Company in future periods.     It is possible that the Company may be unable to use these NOLs in their entirety.  The extent to which the Company will be able to utilize these carry-forwards in future periods is subject to limitations based on a number of factors, including the number of shares issued within a three-year look-back period, whether the merger is deemed to be a change in control, whether there is deemed to be a continuity of World Waste’s historical business, and the extent of the Company’s subsequent income. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had utilized $1,616,638 of these NOLs leaving approximately $39.8 million of potential NOLs of which we expect to utilize approximately $4.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011.             -44-             Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates     Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets valuation, and legal matters. Actual results may differ from these estimates. (See Note 2 to the Vertex Energy, Inc. financial statements).    The Company evaluates the carrying value and recoverability of its long-lived assets within the provisions of the FASB ASC regarding long-lived assets.  It requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets.  Whenever any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.     Revenue Recognition.     Revenue for each of the Company’s divisions is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, goods are delivered, sales price is determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized upon delivery by truck and railcar of feedstock to its re-refining customers and upon product leaving the Company’s terminal facilities via barge.    Legal Matters.   Accruals are established for legal matters when, in our opinion, it is probable that a liability exists and the liability can be reasonably estimated. Actual expenses incurred in future periods can differ materially from accruals established.     Stock Based Compensation     The Company accounts for share-based expense and activity in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for services. Under this provision share-based compensation costs are measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and are recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period, generally the vesting period of the equity grant.     Share-based payments to non-employees are measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and are recognized as an expense over the service period, generally the vesting period of the equity grant. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award, expected option term, expected volatility of the stock over the option’s expected term, risk-free interest rate over the option’s expected term, and the expected annual dividend yield. The Company believes that the valuation technique and approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair values of the stock options granted.       Basic and Diluted Loss per Share     Basic and diluted loss per share has been calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.     License Agreement Development Costs    The Company capitalizes costs to improve any acquired intangible asset which is specifically identifiable, and has a definite life. All other costs are expensed as incurred.    Income Taxes     The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 740.  The Company records a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and when temporary differences become deductible.  The Company considers, among other available information, uncertainties surrounding the recoverability of deferred tax assets, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and other matters in making this assessment.             -45-             Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    In May 2011, the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” were amended to clarify the application of existing fair value measurements and to change certain fair value measurement and disclosure requirements.  Amendments that change measurement and disclosure requirements relate to (i) fair value measurement of financial instruments that are managed within a portfolio, (ii) application of premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement, and (iii) additional disclosures about fair value measurements categorized with Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  These provisions are effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 31, 2011.  The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2012 will not affect our financial position or results of operations, but may result in additional disclosure.    In December 2011, the provisions of ASC Topic 210, “Balance Sheet,” were amended to require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of these arrangements on its financial position.  The guidance requires entities to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the balance sheet and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement.  These provisions are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2013 will not affect our financial position or results of operations, but may result in additional disclosures.    Market Risk    Our revenues and cost of revenues are affected by fluctuations in the value of energy related products.  We attempt to mitigate much of the risk associated with the volatility of relevant commodity prices by using our knowledge of the market to obtain feedstock at attractive costs, by efficiently managing the logistics associated with our products, by turning our inventory over quickly, and by selling our products into markets where we believe we can achieve the greatest value.  We believe that the current downward trend in natural gas prices coupled with increasing crude oil prices provides an attractive margin opportunity for our proposed thermal chemical extraction process.    Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (§ 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a “ smaller reporting company, ” as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).             -46-             Item 8.
