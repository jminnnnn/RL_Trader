Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Strategy and Plan of Operations      The Principal elements of our strategy include:             ·    Expand Feedstock Supply Volume.   We intend to expand our feedstock supply volume by growing our collection and aggregation operations.  We plan to increase the volume of feedstock we collect directly by developing new relationships with generators and working to displace incumbent collectors; increasing the number of collection personnel, vehicles, equipment, and geographical areas we serve; and acquiring collectors in new or existing territories.  We intend to increase the volume of feedstock we aggregate from third-party collectors by expanding our existing relationships and developing new vendor relationships.  We believe that our ability to acquire large feedstock volumes will help to cultivate new vendor relationships because collectors often prefer to work with a single, reliable customer rather than manage multiple relationships and the uncertainty of excess inventory.                 ·    Broaden Existing Customer Relationships and Secure New Large Accounts .  We intend to broaden our existing customer relationships by increasing sales of used motor oil and re-refined products to these accounts. In some cases, we may also seek to serve as our customers’ primary or exclusive supplier.  We also believe that as we increase our supply of feedstock and re-refined products that we will secure larger customer accounts that require a partner who can consistently deliver high volumes.                 ·    Re-Refine Higher Value End Products.    We intend to develop, lease, or acquire technologies to re-refine our feedstock supply into higher-value end products, including assets or technologies which complement TCEP.  Currently, we are using TCEP to re-refine used oil feedstock into cutterstock for use in the marine fuel market.  We believe that the expansion of our TCEP facilities and our technology, and investments in additional technologies, will enable us to upgrade feedstock into end products, such as lubricating base oil, that command higher market prices than the current re-refined products we produce.                    ·    Expand TCEP Re-Refinement Capacity.    We intend to expand our TCEP capacity by building additional TCEP facilities to re-refine feedstock.  We believe the TCEP technology has a distinct competitive advantage over conventional re-refining technology because it produces a high-quality fuel oil product, and the capital expenditures required to build a TCEP plant are significantly lower than a comparable conventional re-refining facility.  By continuing the transition from our historical role as a value-added logistics provider to operating as a re-refiner, we believe we will be able to leverage our feedstock supply network and aggregation capabilities to upgrade a larger percentage of our feedstock inventory into higher value end products which we believe should lead to increased revenue and gross margins. We intend to build TCEP facilities near the geographic location of substantial feedstock sources that we have relationships with through our existing operations or from an acquisition.  By establishing TCEP facilities near proven feedstock sources, we seek to lower our transportation costs and lower the risk of operating plants at low capacity.                              ·    Pursue Selective Strategic Relationships or Acquisitions.    We plan to grow market share by consolidating feedstock supply through partnering with or acquiring collection and aggregation assets.  Such acquisitions and/or partnerships could increase our revenue and provide better control over the quality and quantity of feedstock available for resale and/or upgrading as well as providing additional locations for the implementation of TCEP.  In addition, we intend to pursue further vertical integration opportunities by acquiring complementary recycling and processing technologies where we can realize synergies by leveraging our customer and vendor relationships, infrastructure, and personnel, and by eliminating duplicative overhead costs.                 ·    Alternative Energy Project Development.   We will continue to evaluate and potentially pursue various alternative energy project development opportunities.  These opportunities may be a continuation of the projects sourced originally by World Waste Technologies, Inc., a development stage municipal solid waste conversion company we merged with in April 2009, and/or may include new projects initiated by us.                 31               In connection with the above elements of our business strategy,   and  in order to further strengthen our foothold in the collection and re-refining business, improve profitability and simplify related party transactions, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Holdings on September 11, 2012 pursuant to the Acquisition, as described above under “ Business ” – “ Recent Acquisition ”.     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    Description of Material Financial Line Items:     Revenues       We generate revenues from two existing operating divisions as follows:         BLACK OIL - Revenues for our Black Oil division are comprised primarily of feedstock sales (used motor oil) which are purchased from generators of used motor oil such as oil change shops and garages, as well as a network of local and regional suppliers.  Volumes are consolidated for efficient delivery and then sold to third-party re-refiners and fuel oil blenders for the export market.  In addition, through used oil re-refining, we re-refine used oil through TCEP.  The finished product is then sold by barge as a fuel oil cutterstock and a feedstock component for major refineries.         REFINING AND MARKETING - The Refining and Marketing division generates revenues relating to the sales of finished products.  The Refining and Marketing division gathers hydrocarbon streams in the form of petroleum distillates, transmix and other chemical products that have become off-specification during the transportation or refining process. These feedstock streams are purchased from pipeline operators, refineries, chemical processing facilities and third-party providers, and then processed at a third-party facility under our direction. The end products are typically three distillate petroleum streams (gasoline blendstock, pygas and fuel oil cutterstock), which are sold to major oil companies or to large petroleum trading and blending companies. The end products are delivered by barge and truck to customers.           Our revenues are affected by changes in various commodity prices including crude oil, natural gas and #6 oil.       Cost of Revenues       BLACK OIL - Cost of revenues for our Black Oil division are comprised primarily of feedstock purchases from a network of providers. Other cost of revenues include processing costs, transportation costs, purchasing and receiving costs, analytical assessments, brokerage fees and commissions, and surveying and storage costs.                     REFINING AND MARKETING - The Refining and Marketing division incurs cost of revenues relating to the purchase of feedstock, purchasing and receiving costs, and inspection and processing of the feedstock into gasoline blendstock, pygas and fuel oil cutter by a third party. Cost of revenues also includes broker’s fees, inspection and transportation costs.       Our cost of revenues are affected by changes in various commodity indices, including crude oil, natural gas and #6 oil.  For example, if the price for crude oil increases, the cost of solvent additives used in the production of blended oil products, and fuel cost for transportation cost from third party providers will generally increase. Similarly, if the price of crude oil falls, these costs may also decline.       General and Administrative Expenses       Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other employee-related benefits for executive, administrative, legal, financial and information technology personnel, as well as outsourced and professional services, rent, utilities, and related expenses at our headquarters, as well as certain taxes.        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 COMPARED TO THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011     Set forth below are our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the same period in 2011;

decreases in commodity prices typically result in decreases in revenue and cost of revenues.  Our gross profit is to a large extent a function of the market discount we are able to obtain in purchasing feedstock, as well as how efficiently management conducts operations.     Total revenues increased 23% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, due to increases in commodity pricing and increased volume.  The average posting (U.S. Gulfcoast Residual Fuel No. 6 3%) for 2012 increased $3.67 per barrel from a 2011 average of $95.66 per barrel to an average of $99.33 per barrel during 2012.  On average, prices we received for our products increased 4% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.  The increases in pricing and volume described above resulted in a $25 million increase in revenue.             33             Volume for our Black Oil division increased 53% percent during fiscal 2012 compared to 2011, respectively.  This volume increase is attributable to the increased amount of product being processed through TCEP, as well as increased volume being delivered and sourced to third party re-refiners and fuel blending companies.  Our per barrel margin in the Black Oil division decreased approximately 3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 from the same period in 2011.  The decrease in margins was due to the increase in volume of product being managed along with increased pricing for feedstock and increased processing costs during 2012 for TCEP.  As volumes and production increase in our Black Oil division it often takes a few quarters to recognize increased additional per barrel margin, this is because of the fact that when we move into a new geographic location it takes us a period of time before we are able to create and benefit from economies of scale.    Our Black Oil business, through the use of the TCEP, generated revenues of $57,698,912 for the year ended December 31, 2012, with cost of revenues of $55,264,067, producing a gross profit of $2,434,845.  During the year ended December 31, 2011, these revenues were $52,097,274 with cost of revenues of $49,941,692, producing gross profit of $2,155,582.  Due to the Company now owning the TCEP technology at year-end and during the year having a license to the technology (which technology was acquired as part of the Acquisition, described above under “ Business ” – “ Recent Acquisition ”), our income from operations has been positively affected for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012.  Prior to September 1, 2012, we operated this technology from CMT pursuant to a perpetual license agreement.  Gross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 2011, as a result of increased volumes processed through our TCEP operation as well as improved market conditions for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012.     Total volume companywide increased 22% during fiscal 2012 compared to 2011, and our per barrel margin decreased approximately 1% for fiscal 2012, compared to 2011.                 Our Refining and Marketing division experienced an increase in production of 24% for its fuel oil cutter product for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, and commodity prices increased approximately 3% over the same period.    The average posting (U.S. Gulfcoast No. 2 Waterborne) during 2012 increased $3.44 per barrel from $122.73 per barrel for 2011 to $126.17 per barrel for 2012.       Our pygas production increased 41% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011 and commodity prices increased approximately 4% for our finished product for 2012, compared to the same period in 2011.     Our gasoline blendstock volumes decreased 15% for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 2011.  The average posting (U.S. Gulfcoast Unleaded 87 Waterborne) during 2012 increased $0.12 per gallon from  $2.78 per gallon for 2011 to $2.90 per gallon during 2012. The overall increase in revenues associated with our Refining and Marketing division was due to increases in volumes as well as market prices for the period ended December 31, 2012.      Overall volume for the Refining and Marketing division increased 16% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2011.  Margins per barrel also increased in the Refining and Marketing division as a result of improved operating costs and market conditions.       Prevailing prices of certain commodity products can significantly impact our revenues and cash flows., As noted above the revenue variances from fiscal 2011 to 2012 were impacted slightly due to the changes in commodity pricing between the two periods as detailed below.             34             The following table sets forth the high and low spot prices during 2011 for our key benchmarks.         2011                               Benchmark       High       Date       Low       Date     U.S. Gulfcoast No. 2 Waterborne (dollars per gallon)      $  3.30      April 8      $  2.44      January 4     U.S. Gulfcoast Unleaded 87 Waterborne (dollars per gallon)      $  3.53      May 9      $  2.33      January 25     U.S. Gulfcoast Residual Fuel No. 6 3% (dollars per barrel)      $  105.20      November 8      $  76.70      January 4     NYMEX Crude oil (Dollars per barrel)      $  113.93      April 29      $  75.67      October 4     Reported in Platt's US Marketscan (Gulf Coast)                              The following table sets forth the high and low spot prices during 2012 for our key benchmarks.        2012                               Benchmark       High       Date       Low       Date     U.S. Gulfcoast No. 2 Waterborne (dollars per gallon)      $  3.27      Feb. 24      $  2.54      June 28     U.S. Gulfcoast Unleaded 87 Waterborne (dollars per gallon)      $  3.43      April 2      $  2.36      Dec. 10     U.S. Gulfcoast Residual Fuel No. 6 3% (dollars per barrel)      $  114.35      March 1      $  82.60      June 21     NYMEX Crude oil (Dollars per barrel)      $  109.77      Feb. 24      $  77.69      June 28     Reported in Platt's US Marketscan (Gulf Coast)                              We have seen on average a fairly stable market in each of the benchmark commodities we track during 2011 and 2012.    Our margins are a function of the difference between what we are able to pay for raw materials and the market prices for the range of products produced.  The various petroleum products produced are typically a function of Crude Oil indices and are quoted on multiple exchanges such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (“ NYMEX ”).  These prices are determined by a global market and can be influenced by many factors, including but not limited to supply/demand, weather, politics, and global/regional inventory levels.  As such, we cannot provide any assurances regarding results of operations for any future periods, as numerous factors outside of our control affect the prices paid for raw materials and the prices (for the most part keyed to the NYMEX) that can be charged for such products.  Additionally, for the near term, results of operations will be subject to further uncertainty, as the global markets and exchanges, including the NYMEX, continue to experience volatility.     Gross profit increased 21% from $8,074,070 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 to $9,785,127 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to increases in volumes sold or re-refined, more stabilized and slight increases in commodity pricing.     We had selling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of acquisition related expenses) of $6,137,301 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, compared to $4,099,682 from the prior year’s period, an increase of $2,037,619 or 50% from the prior period, due to an increase in overall administrative expenses generated by the new business lines and additional compensation expenses associated with employees acquired as a result of the Acquisition.  The Company incurred an additional $1,256,576 of one-time legal, accounting, auditing and investment banking expenses during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 related to the Acquisition of Holdings.     We had income before income taxes of $2,257,626 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 compared to income before income taxes of $3,911,702 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, a decrease in net income before taxes of $1,654,076 or 42% from the prior year’s period.  The decrease in net income before taxes was largely due to increased administrative expenses related to the one-time Acquisition related expenses of  $1,256,576. We anticipate the Acquisition having a minimal impact on revenue; however we expect to see a reduction in our cost of revenues and consequently an improvement in our gross profit margin as well as our net income as a result of the Acquisition.  We had an income tax benefit of $1,400,641 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, compared to an income tax benefit of 1,841,813 for the same period ended December 31, 2011.    The benefit for income taxes, for which for the Company has recorded a net deferred asset based on reducing our valuation allowance related to our approximately $36 million of net operating losses that may be used to offset taxable income generated by the Company in future periods.            35              We had net income of $3,658,267 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 compared to net income of $5,753,515 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, a decrease in net income of $2,095,248 or 36% from the prior year’s period.     Financial Highlights for the fourth quarter Include:               ·    Revenue increased 3% to $32.2 million for the fourth quarter 2012, compared with $31.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011;                 ·    Gross profit increased 127% to $2.9 million compared with $1.3 million in the prior year’s quarter; and                 ·    Volumes increased 15% during the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 2011, and our per barrel margin increased approximately 98% for the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to the prior year’s fourth quarter.         Liquidity and Capital Resources       The success of our current business operations is not dependent on extensive capital expenditures, but rather on relationships with feedstock suppliers and end-product customers, and on efficient management of overhead costs.   Through these relationships, we have historically been able to achieve volume discounts in the procurement of our feedstock, thereby increasing the margins of our segments’ operations.  The resulting operating cash flow is crucial to the viability and growth of our existing business lines.                  We had total assets of $49,102,377 as of December 31, 2012 compared to $16,733,971 at December 31, 2011.  This significant increase was mainly due to the Acquisition of Holdings’ assets which included fixed assets of $11,617,368 consisting of five used oil collection branch locations and associated storage facilities and rolling stock (collection and transport trucks), a 19 acre tank terminal storage facility located on the Houston ship-channel, and a small trucking operation.  In addition it included $15,934,724 of intangible assets which represented the value of the purchase of the patents and technology related to the TCEP operation.  The increase was also due to the $3,658,267 of net income which was generated during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2012; a $132,752 increase in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, as well as a $1,724,774 increase in accounts receivable, net, as of December 31, 2012, compared to December 31, 2011.   The increase in assets was offset by the $1,804,389 of Acquisition related adjustments associated with the purchase price allocation of the Holdings’ Acquisition.  Total current assets as of December 31, 2012 of $14,331,308 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $807,940, accounts receivable, net of $7,160,780, inventory of $5,870,121, and prepaid expenses of $492,467.  Long term assets consisted of fixed assets, net of $11,617,368, an intangible asset in the amount of $15,934,724, which represents the value of the Company’s TCEP patent, and $3,515,977 of goodwill (booked in connection with the Acquisition of Holdings).     As of December 31, 2012, as a result of the Acquisition, the Company owns outright and no longer licenses the TCEP technology.  In addition, mainly as a result of the approximately $36 million of net operating losses that may be used to offset taxable income generated by the Company in future periods, the Company has recorded a deferred federal income tax asset of $3,703,000 as of December 31, 2012 and $2,006,000 as of December 31, 2011.  Our cash, accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable fluctuate and are somewhat tied to one another based on the timing of our inventory cycles and sales.        We had total current liabilities of $10,618,563 as of December 31, 2012, compared to $7,320,474 at December 31, 2011.  This increase was largely due to the increase in our accounts payable during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 of $2,405,041, in addition and in connection with the Acquisition, the Company obtained a term loan with Bank of America of which the current portion outstanding at December 31, 2012 was $1,700,000.  We had total liabilities of $28,702,020 as of December 31, 2012, including current liabilities of $10,618,563 and long-term liabilities of $18,083,457, which included $6,281,457 of long-term debt representing amounts due on the Term Note, line of credit of $6,750,000, representing amounts borrowed under the Revolving Note, $4,711,000 of contingent consideration relating to the Earn-Out Payments associated with the Acquisition, and $341,000 of deferred federal income tax.    We had working capital of $3,712,745 as of December 31, 2012, compared to working capital of $5,353,780 as of December 31, 2011.  The reduction in working capital from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012 is mainly due to liabilities assumed as a result of and incurred in connection with the Acquisition.             36             Our future operating cash flows will vary based on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including commodity prices, the cost of recovered oil, and the ability to turn our inventory.  Other factors that have affected and are expected to continue to affect earnings and cash flow are transportation, processing, and storage costs.  Over the long term, our operating cash flows will also be impacted by our ability to effectively manage our administrative and operating costs. Additionally, we may incur future capital expenditures related to new TCEP facilities.      In September 2010, we entered into a loan agreement with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Pursuant to the loan agreement, Bank of America Merrill Lynch agreed to loan up to $3,500,000 in the form of a revolving line of credit. The line of credit accrued interest at the bank’s LIBOR rate plus 3%, adjusted daily, and was originally due on September 16, 2011 (provided that the parties subsequently entered into various extensions of the line of credit, extending the due date to March 31, 2014).   The loan agreement was terminated pursuant to our entry into the Credit Agreement described below. We had not borrowed any funds under the loan agreement at the time it was terminated, and as such $3,500,000 was available under such loan agreement.           On September 11, 2012, we entered into a Credit Agreement with the Lender effective as of August 31, 2012, pursuant to which we borrowed $8,500,000 in the form of a term loan, which is evidenced by a Term Note, and the Lender agreed to provide us with an additional $10,000,000 revolving credit facility (the “ Credit Facility ”), which is evidenced by a Revolving Note.        Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, we can request loans from time to time under the Credit Facility, subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, provided that the total amount loaned pursuant to the Credit Facility cannot exceed the lesser of (a) $10,000,000 and (b) an amount equal to the total of (i) 80% of our accounts in which Lender has a first-priority perfected security interest; (ii) 80% of our finished-goods inventory in which Lender holds a first-priority perfected security interest, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, plus (iii) $1,500,000 through December 31, 2012, and $0 thereafter.        Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Note bear interest at our option at the lesser of the Lender’s prime commercial lending rate then in effect or the LIBOR rate in effect plus 2.75%.  Accrued and unpaid interest on the Revolving Note is due and payable monthly in arrears and all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Note are due and payable on August 31, 2014.        Amounts borrowed under the Term Note bear interest at our option at the lesser of the Lender’s prime commercial lending rate then in effect or the LIBOR rate in effect plus 2.75%.  Accrued and unpaid interest on the Term Note is due and payable monthly in arrears and all amounts outstanding under the Term Note are due and payable on August 31, 2015.  Additionally, payments of principal in the amount of $141,667 are due and payable on the Term Note, monthly in arrears on the last day of each month beginning September 30, 2012, and continuing thereafter until the maturity date.           We agreed to comply with certain standard affirmative and negative covenants in connection with the Credit Agreement and agreed to meet the following financial covenants at such time as any loans or other obligations are outstanding under the Credit Agreement, commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2012: (i) the ratio of (a) our EBITDA minus cash taxes, minus distributions, minus unfinanced capital expenditures, in each case for the immediately preceding four fiscal-quarter period, to (b) the sum of our interest expense for the immediately preceding four fiscal-quarter period, plus our current maturities of long-term debt, in each case, as of the last day of such four fiscal-quarter period, all as determined in accordance with GAAP, may not at any time be less than 1.25 to 1.00 (calculated and tested quarterly); (ii) the ratio of total debt funded under the Credit Agreement to our EBITDA cannot be greater than 2.00 to 1.00 (calculated and tested quarterly); and (iii) the sum of our tangible net worth cannot be less than $10,000,000 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.  While we were not in compliance with the tangible net worth requirement of the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2012; the tangible net worth requirement was included in the Credit Agreement in error and we and the Lender entered into a waiver and amendment agreement in January 2013, pursuant to which the Lender agreed to waive such prior non-compliance with the tangible net worth requirement and to amend the Credit Agreement to remove such net tangible worth requirement moving forward.      The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default for facilities of similar nature and size as the Credit Agreement and also provides that an event of default occurs if (i) Benjamin P. Cowart, our Chief Executive Officer, President Chairman of the Board and largest shareholder, ceases to be actively involved in our day-to-day management or operation or if Mr. Cowart ceases to own and control at least 25% of our equity interests; (ii) we cease at any time to own and control 100% of the Transferred Partnerships acquired pursuant to the closing of the Acquisition; Vertex II GP, LLC (“ Vertex GP ”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, formed for the purpose of the transaction, ceases to be the sole general partner of the Transferred Partnerships; (iii) an agreement, letter of intent, or agreement in principle is executed with respect to any proposed transaction or event or series of transactions or events which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in either (i) or (ii), above; or (iv) a default occurs under the lease agreement for certain premises leased by CMT.              37             We agreed to pay the Lender the following fees in connection with the Credit Agreement: (i) a fee equal to 0.25% of the actual daily amount by which (a) the committed amount of the Credit Facility exceeds (b) the amount outstanding under the Credit Facility plus the amount of any lines of credit issued by Lender to us, so long as the average daily amount drawn on the Credit Facility is less than $5,000,000, for the calendar quarter then-ended, payable quarterly in arrears beginning September 30, 2012; (ii) a closing fee in connection with the closing of the Credit Facility; and (iii) certain fees associated with lines of credit issued by Lender as described in greater detail in the Credit Agreement.     Our obligations under the Credit Agreement and Notes are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, including those assets and properties acquired in connection with the closing of the Acquisition, which was granted pursuant to our, and certain of our subsidiaries, entry into security agreements with the Lender. Additionally, the Transferred Partnerships, Vertex GP and Acquisition guaranteed our obligations under the Credit Agreement and Notes pursuant to guarantees entered into in favor of the Lender.     On September 11, 2012, we borrowed a total of $8.5 million under the Term Note and $8.75 million under the Revolving Note, the majority of which funds have been used to pay Holdings the cash portion of the Purchase Price due in connection with the closing of the Acquisition, as described in greater detail below under “ Business ” – “ Recent Acquisition, ” and to pay fees and costs associated with the closing of the Acquisition.     As of December 31, 2012, the Revolving Note had a balance of $6,750,000 and the Term Note had a balance of   $7,933,333.      Management believes that the financing arrangement, in addition to projected earnings, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future, although we may seek additional financing to fund acquisitions or other development in the future.           Our re-refining business will require significant capital to design and construct any new facilities other than the existing facility in Baytown, Texas.  We currently estimate that the cost to construct a new, fully functional full-scale commercial process at another location would be approximately $2.5 to $5.0 million, based on throughput capacity.  The facility infrastructure would be an additional capitalized expenditure to these proposed process costs and would depend on the location and site specifics of the facility.         We believe that cash from ongoing operations and our working capital facility will be sufficient to satisfy our existing cash requirements.   However, in order to implement our growth strategy, and pay our outstanding debts (as described above) we may need to secure additional financing in the future.      Additionally, as part of our ongoing efforts to maintain a capital structure that is closely aligned with what we believe to be the potential of our business and goals for future growth, which is subject to cyclical changes in commodity prices, we will be exploring additional sources of external liquidity.  The receptiveness of the capital markets to an offering of debt or equities cannot be assured and may be negatively impacted by, among other things, debt maturities, current market conditions, and potential stockholder dilution. The sale of additional securities, if undertaken by us and if accomplished, may result in dilution to our shareholders. We cannot assure you, however, that future financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.     There is currently only a limited market for our common stock, and as such, we anticipate that such market will be illiquid, sporadic and subject to wide fluctuations in response to several factors moving forward, including, but not limited to:        (1)    actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;              (2)    our ability or inability to generate new revenues; and               (3)    the number of shares in our public float.                38             Furthermore, because our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market, our stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. These market fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, at present, we have a limited number of shares in our public float, and as a result, there could be extreme fluctuations in the price of our common stock.      We believe that our stock prices (bid, ask and closing prices) may not relate to the actual value our company, and may not reflect the actual value of our common stock. Shareholders and potential investors in our common stock should exercise caution before making an investment in our common stock, and should not rely on the publicly quoted or traded stock prices in determining our common stock value, but should instead determine the value of our common stock based on the information contained in our public reports, industry information, and those business valuation methods commonly used to value private companies.     Cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 were:               Twelve Months Ended December 31,               2012          2011                               Beginning cash and cash equivalents      $  675,188        $  744,313                                    Net cash provided by (used in):                             Operating activities         3,000,114           (70,866  )    Investing activities         (3,148,025  )        (304,509  )    Financing activities         280,663           306,250                                    Net increase in cash and cash equivalents         132,752           (69,125  )                                 Ending cash and cash equivalents      $  807,940        $  675,188             Operating activities provided cash of $3,000,114 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 as compared to using $70,866 of cash during the corresponding period in 2011.  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from our operations and the availability to borrow funds under the Term Note.    The primary reasons for the increase in cash provided by operating activities are related to the net income of $3,658,267 generated during the year ended December 31, 2012 and the increase in accounts payable of $2,405,041, offset by $3,703,000 of deferred federal income tax asset, and a decrease of $235,557 in deposits.  Additionally, non-cash items increasing net income included stock compensation, which provided $178,968 of liquidity and depreciation and amortization which contributed $711,555 of net cash.     Investing activities used cash of $3,148,025 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 as compared to having used $304,509 during the corresponding period in 2011.  Investing activities in 2012 were comprised of $209,061 in cash payments related to the license of the TCEP (which was acquired as part of the Acquisition), $1,804,389 of net cash used in the Acquisition, and $1,134,575 used for the purchase of fixed assets.     Financing activities provided $280,663 of cash during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, as compared to $306,250 during the corresponding period in 2011. Financing activities in 2012 included $112,625 of proceeds from the exercise of common stock warrants and $750,000 of proceeds from amounts borrowed under the Line of Credit, offset by payments towards the Term Note of $581,962.             39             Net Operating Losses    We intend to take advantage of any potential tax benefits related to net operating losses (“ NOLs ”) acquired as part of the World Waste merger.  As a result of the merger we acquired approximately $42 million of net operating losses that may be used to offset taxable income generated by the Company in future periods.     It is possible that the Company may be unable to use these NOLs in their entirety.  The extent to which the Company will be able to utilize these carry-forwards in future periods is subject to limitations based on a number of factors, including the number of shares issued within a three-year look-back period, whether the merger is deemed to be a change in control, whether there is deemed to be a continuity of World Waste’s historical business, and the extent of the Company’s subsequent income. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had utilized approximately $4.4 million of these NOLs leaving approximately $35.4 million of potential NOLs of which we expect to utilize approximately $1.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, leaving approximately $33.9 million of potential NOLs.     Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates     Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets valuation, and legal matters. Actual results may differ from these estimates. (See Note 2 to the Vertex Energy, Inc. financial statements included herein).    We evaluate the carrying value and recoverability of our long-lived assets within the provisions of the FASB ASC regarding long-lived assets.  It requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets.  Whenever any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.     Revenue Recognition.     Revenue for each of our divisions is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, goods are delivered, sales price is determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized upon delivery by truck and railcar of feedstock to our re-refining customers and upon product leaving our terminal facilities via barge.    Legal Matters.   Accruals are established for legal matters when, in our opinion, it is probable that a liability exists and the liability can be reasonably estimated. Actual expenses incurred in future periods can differ materially from accruals established.     Stock Based Compensation     We account for share-based expense and activity in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for services. Under this provision share-based compensation costs are measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and are recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period, generally the vesting period of the equity grant.     Share-based payments to non-employees are measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and are recognized as an expense over the service period, generally the vesting period of the equity grant. We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award, expected option term, expected volatility of the stock over the option’s expected term, risk-free interest rate over the option’s expected term, and the expected annual dividend yield. We believe that the valuation technique and approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair values of the stock options granted.       Basic and Diluted Loss per Share     Basic and diluted loss per share has been calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.             40             License Agreement Development Costs    We capitalize costs to improve any acquired intangible asset which is specifically identifiable, and has a definite life. All other costs are expensed as incurred.    Income Taxes     We account for income taxes in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 740.  We record a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and when temporary differences become deductible.  We consider, among other available information, uncertainties surrounding the recoverability of deferred tax assets, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and other matters in making this assessment.     Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    In May 2011, the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “ Fair Value Measurement, ” were amended to clarify the application of existing fair value measurements and to change certain fair value measurement and disclosure requirements.  Amendments that change measurement and disclosure requirements relate to (i) fair value measurement of financial instruments that are managed within a portfolio, (ii) application of premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement, and (iii) additional disclosures about fair value measurements categorized with Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  These provisions are effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 31, 2011.  The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2012 did not affect our financial position or results of operations, but may result in additional disclosure.    In December 2011, the provisions of ASC Topic 210, “ Balance Sheet, ” were amended to require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of these arrangements on its financial position.  The guidance requires entities to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the balance sheet and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement.  These provisions are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2013 will not affect our financial position or results of operations, but may result in additional disclosures.    Market Risk    Our revenues and cost of revenues are affected by fluctuations in the value of energy related products.  We attempt to mitigate much of the risk associated with the volatility of relevant commodity prices by using our knowledge of the market to obtain feedstock at attractive costs, by efficiently managing the logistics associated with our products, by turning our inventory over quickly, and by selling our products into markets where we believe we can achieve the greatest value.  We believe that the current downward trend in natural gas prices coupled with increasing crude oil prices provides an attractive margin opportunity for our TCEP.    Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (§ 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a “ smaller reporting company, ” as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).                                        41             Item 8.
