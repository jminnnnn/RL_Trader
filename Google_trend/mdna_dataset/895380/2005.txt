Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition     FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS          This annual report on Form 10-K of Diametrics Medical, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2004 contains forward-looking statements, principally in the sections entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Business. Generally, you can identify these statements because they use words like anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, plans, and similar terms. These statements reflect only our current expectations. Although we do not make forward-looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so, we cannot guarantee their accuracy and actual results may differ materially from those we anticipated due to a number of uncertainties, many of which are unforeseen, including, among others, the risks we face as described in this filing. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which apply only as of the date of this annual report. These forward-looking statements are within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. To the extent that such statements are not recitations of historical fact, such statements constitute forward-looking statements that, by definition, involve risks and uncertainties. In any forward-looking statement where we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation of belief will be accomplished.        We believe it is important to communicate our expectations to our investors. There may be events in the future, however, that we are unable to predict accurately or over which we have no control. The risk factors listed in this filing, as well as any cautionary language in this annual report, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated, include, but are not limited to: our ability to successfully develop new products; the ability to obtain financing for product development; changes in product strategies; general economic, financial and business conditions; changes in and compliance with governmental healthcare and other regulations; changes in tax laws; and the availability of key management and other personnel.   OVERVIEW          The focus of the Company has changed significantly over the past 18 months. On November 1, 2004, we terminated all of our employees in the United Kingdom and all but four of our employees in the United States. On November 22, 2004, a Meeting of Creditors was held in London, England for the purposes of liquidating the assets of the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, Diametrics Medical Limited (DML). The Company subsequently created a new, wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, TGC Research Limited (TGC), which acquired certain equipment and intellectual property from the liquidator of DML in early 2005.        TGC will become a research and development organization which will focus initially on the development of a line of new products aimed at continuous glucose monitoring and control in critically ill patients in a hospital setting at the point-of-patient care. During the past three years, clinical practice patterns in intensive care units around the world have changed dramatically. Clinical evidence, we believe, has conclusively demonstrated that maintaining patients within strict glycemic limits (a clinical practice known as tight glycemic control) can dramatically reduce mortality, risk of infection and other complications. We believe that optimal glycemic control can only be achieved by the continuous monitoring of glucose, a measurement modality that is not currently available in intensive care units. We believe that clinically accurate glucose measurements can only be achieved by in-vivo measurement. Our new focus will be to develop a product system that will effectively and accurately measure, on a continuous basis, glucose in the critically ill patient. We expect this product offering will allow clinicians around the world to maintain tight glycemic control in this patient population, which we believe, represents a significant business opportunity.        From October 2003 to November 1, 2004, we developed, manufactured and distributed blood and tissue monitoring systems that provided continuous diagnostic information at the point-of-patient care. That business, known as Diametrics Medical, Ltd., was acquired in late 1996 and operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, with manufacturing, research and development and marketing operations located in High Wycombe, England. Blood and tissue analysis is an integral part of patient diagnosis and treatment and timely access to certain measurements is critical to effective patient care. We believed that use of our systems would result in more timely decisions by providing accurate and continuous test results at the patients bedside, thereby reducing the time spent in critical care settings. Our monitoring systems had also recently been used in several biotech applications to provide continuous measurement of environments surrounding cell research and growth. Most of those utilizations had been on a trial basis, although others had generated revenue from systems and sensor sales.   12                We marketed and distributed our TrendCare products through a direct sales force in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany and through nonexclusive third-party distributors in various other countries. We distributed our Neurotrend cerebral tissue monitoring system through Codman & Shurtleff, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson Company (Codman), under an exclusive worldwide distribution agreement.        Our primary line of business from our inception in 1990 through September 2003 was the development, manufacture and distribution of intermittent blood testing products. That line of business, which comprised 66% and 57% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, was sold in late September 2003 to International Technidyne Corporation (ITC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Thoratec Corporation, for approximately $5.2 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities, including $583,000 in trade payables. Of the cash payment, $758,000 was placed in escrow by ITC for 180 days to cover any shortfall in collected receivables or any indemnification claims. In late March 2004, sales proceeds of $713,000 remaining in escrow were released to the Company.        The results of operations for the intermittent testing business have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report. Revenues of the intermittent testing business totaled $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, and $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net losses attributable to the intermittent testing business during the same periods totaled $2.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively. The carrying value of assets sold to ITC approximated $3 million and ITC assumed liabilities of the intermittent testing business totaling $669,000.        The results of operation for the continuous monitoring business have also been reported as discontinued operation for all periods presented in this report. Revenues of the continuous monitoring business totaled $2.4 million, $3.1 million and $5.5 million, respectively for the three years ended December 31, 2004. Net losses attributable to that business during those periods were $4.1 million, $6.2 million and $2.4 million, respectively.   APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES          The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts, giving due consideration to materiality. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies (more fully described in notes to the consolidated financial statements), the following are particularly important to the portrayal of the Companys results of operations and financial position and may require the application of a higher level of judgment by the Companys management, and as a result are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.         Debt and Equity Instruments.  On December 15, 2004, the Company borrowed $1,800,000 under Convertible Senior Secured Notes due December 15, 2007 (the Convertible Senior Notes). Principal and interest are payable in cash or registered shares over a 32-month period beginning 120 days after closing. The subscribers also received warrants to purchase up to 45,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $0.025. The warrants expire on December 15, 2009.        The Company determined the relative fair value of the debt was $2,627,588 and $1,549,818 for the warrants. The Company allocated $1,018,980 and $601,020 of the net proceeds totaling $1,620,000 to the debt and warrants, respectively. The application of the provisions of EITF 98-5, Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios, and EITF 00-27, Application of Issue 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments resulted in the calculation of an embedded beneficial conversion feature in the Convertible Senior Notes, which is required to be treated as an additional discount to the debt. The value of the beneficial conversion feature of $1,018,980 was limited to the amount allocated to the debt. $16,010 of the beneficial conversion feature was amortized into interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2004.        The relative fair value of the warrants issued were determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following assumptions: volatility of 116%, expected life of 5 years, risk free interest rate of 3.53% and no dividends.        The subscribers received a first lien on all of the assets of the Company. The holders of the Companys previously issued convertible senior secured fixed rate notes due August 4, 2005 (the Convertible Subordinated Notes), consented to the new financing and the subordination of their secured position to a second lien on all of the assets of the Company in consideration for an amendment of the conversion price of the Convertible Subordinated Notes to $0.02 per share and the amendment of the exercise price of their outstanding warrants to purchase up to 4,255,837 shares of the Companys common stock to $0.025 per share. See below for the recording of the amendment to the Convertible Subordinated Notes.   13                Stock warrants outstanding to purchase up to 17,555,589 shares of the Companys common stock, issued in connection with the Companys Series E, F and G preferred stock financing, were also amended to reduce the exercise price thereof to $0.025 per share, of which certain warrants outstanding to purchase up to 12,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock were further amended to reduce the exercise price thereof to $0.01 per share. See note 6 for discussion related to the accounting for the modification of these warrants. The reductions in the exercise price or ceiling exercise price, as applicable, of the warrants previously issued to these investors and the issuance of new warrants to purchase 12,000,000 additional shares of common stock resulted in a deemed dividend on the Series E, F and G preferred stock, requiring a charge to retained earnings and an offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital aggregating $1,211,247. Similar to the beneficial conversion features, this amount was charged to retained earnings, with an offsetting credit to additional paid-in-capital, and was treated as a reconciling item on the statement of operations to adjust the reported net loss to net loss available to common shareholders, which is used in the numerator in the loss per share calculation for the year ended December 31, 2004.        The Company classified the warrants issued in connection with the Series E, F and G preferred stock financing as equity rather than debt based upon an assessment of the Companys contractual obligations for registration of the related common shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants as provided under EITF 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own Stock.        During the second quarter 2003, the Company completed the renegotiation of the terms of its Convertible Subordinated Notes and completed a $1.5 million financing through the sale of 15,000 shares of Series E convertible preferred stock. Both transactions also included the issuance of warrants for the purchase of the Companys common stock. The accounting for these debt and equity related transactions was complex and required the Company to make certain judgements regarding their accounting treatment. The Companys significant conclusions related to these transactions included: 1) the accounting applicable to the modification of the convertible notes falls primarily under the treatment prescribed by EITF 96-19, Debtors Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments, 2) the determination of the respective fair values to use as a basis for recording the carrying values of the convertible notes, Series E preferred stock and warrants issued in connection with each transaction and 3) the classification of the warrants as equity versus debt based upon an assessment under EITF 00-19 of the Companys contractual obligations for registration of the related common shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants.        On January 16, 2004, the Company completed the sale of 15,000 shares of Series F convertible preferred stock at a price of $100 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $1.5 million. Each share of preferred stock is convertible at any time into common stock at 75% of the volume weighted average trading price of the lowest three inter-day trading prices of the common stock for the five consecutive trading days preceding the conversion date, but at an exercise price of no more than $.25 per share and no less than $.20 per share. In accordance with the terms of the Series F preferred stock agreement, the floor conversion price was reduced to $.15 per share effective June 30, 2004, due to the Companys inability to achieve a six-month cash flow projection through that date. Five-year warrants were also issued to purchase an aggregate of 6,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock at the lower of $.35 per share or the average of the lowest ten inter-day closing prices of the Companys common stock on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board during the 10 trading days immediately preceding the exercise date. The ceiling exercise price on the Series F warrants was reduced from $.35 to $.11 per share in connection with the Series G preferred stock financing transaction completed in May 2004.        Accounting for this transaction falls primarily under EITF 98-5, Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios, and EITF 00-27, Application of Issue 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments. The Company allocated the net investor proceeds of $1,350,000 from the issuance of the Series F convertible preferred stock to the preferred stock and associated warrants based upon their estimated relative fair values. The resulting fair value allocations of $665,994 and $684,006 for the preferred stock and warrants, respectively, were recorded as equity in the first quarter 2004. The beneficial conversion feature embedded in the preferred stock was calculated at $665,994 and was limited to the fair value allocated to the preferred stock. The beneficial conversion feature of $665,994 was treated as a deemed dividend to preferred shareholders, and was charged to retained earnings, with the offsetting credit to additional paid-in-capital. Additionally, the Company treated the beneficial conversion feature of $665,994 as a reconciling item on the statement of operations to adjust its reported net loss to net loss available to common shareholders, which is used in the calculation for the year ended December 31, 2004.        On May 28, 2004, the Company completed a $1.5 million financing through the sale of 15,000 shares of Series G convertible preferred stock at $100 per share. Each share of the Series G preferred stock is convertible at any time into common stock at 75% of the volume weighted average trading price of the lowest three inter-day trading prices of the common stock during the five consecutive trading days preceding the conversion date, with a maximum exercise price of $.14 per share and a minimum price of $.06 per share. The minimum exercise price was decreased automatically to $.03 per share after the shareholders of the Company authorized an increase in common stock from 100 million shares to 200 million shares on September 7, 2004.        As part of this financing, the Company issued three-year warrants (Series G warrants) to the purchasers of the Series G preferred stock. Those warrants entitle the holders to purchase an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of the Companys common stock at the lower of $.11 per share or the average of the lowest ten inter-day closing prices of the Companys common stock during the ten trading days preceding the   14             exercise date. The Company also issued three-year warrants to investors in the Companys Series E and Series F preferred stock to purchase an aggregate of 12,241,608 shares of common stock at $.05 per share.        In connection with the Series G financing, the holders of the Companys Convertible Subordinated Debt agreed to defer until December 31, 2004 the Companys obligation to make interest payments previously due on June 30, 2004 (including interest payments originally due on December 31, 2003 and March 31, 2004, payment of which was deferred until June 30, 2004) and September 30, 2004. In exchange for the deferral of interest payments, the exercise price on the note holders common stock warrants was reduced from $.34 per share to $.09 per share. Accounting for these transactions required a review of several criteria, including assessment of the treatment of the beneficial conversion feature associated with the Series G preferred stock, an assessment of the classification as debt or equity of the warrants issued in connection with the Series G preferred stock financing, an assessment of the impact of the changes in the exercise and ceiling exercise prices, as applicable, of the common stock warrants previously issued to the note holders and the Series E and Series F preferred stock investors and an assessment of the treatment of the fair value associated with the new warrants issued to the Series E and Series F preferred stock investors.        Additionally, in connection with the Series G financing, the exercise price of the outstanding common stock warrants issued as part of the Series E preferred stock financing was reduced from $.35 per share to $.11 per share, and the ceiling price for the exercise of the common stock warrants issued as part of the Series F preferred stock financing was reduced from $.35 per share to $.11 per share.        The application of the provisions of EITF 98-5, Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios, and EITF 00-27, Application of Issue 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments resulted in the calculation of an embedded beneficial conversion feature in the Series G preferred stock, which is required to be treated as a deemed dividend to preferred shareholders. The Company allocated the net investor proceeds of $1,445,000 from the issuance of the Series G convertible preferred stock to the preferred stock and Series G warrants based upon their relative fair values. The fair value allocated to the Series G warrants of $68,205 was recorded as equity. The fair value allocated to the preferred stock of $1,376,795 and the original conversion terms were used to calculate the value of the beneficial conversion feature of $1,067,650 at the date of issuance of the Series G preferred stock. The $1,067,650 was charged to retained earnings with the offsetting credit to additional paid-in-capital. The Company treated the beneficial conversion feature of $1,067,650 as a reconciling item on the statement of operations to adjust its reported net loss to net loss available to common shareholders. As a result of the decrease in the conversions rate to $.03 per share, the Company increased the value of beneficial conversion feature to $1,280,216 which was limited to the amount of proceeds allocated to the Series G preferred stock. Additionally, the Company treated the beneficial conversion feature of $1,280,216 as a reconciling item on the statement of operations to adjust its reported net loss to net loss available to common shareholders, which is used in the numerator in the loss per share calculation for the year ended December 31, 2004.         Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable . Effective July 1, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of EITF Issue 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, which provides guidance on the measurement and allocation of revenue from sales undertakings to deliver more than one product or service. Sales of the Companys hardware and disposable sensors were priced and sold separately and had readily determined fair market values based upon sales histories of these products. As such, the hardware and disposable sensors have stand-alone value to the customer. Sales to distributors and existing end-user customers were specifically priced for each product and had no right of return, except for standard warranty provisions. Revenue was recognized upon shipment of products to distributors and direct customers or, in the case of trial monitors placed directly with end-user customers, upon the customers acceptance of the product. Sales to new direct end-user customers requires training on the products during a product evaluation period completed prior to the customer making the purchase. Revenue for these sales transactions was recognized when the purchase was made at the end of the evaluation period.        Many of the Companys distribution agreements governing the terms of sales transactions with its European and Asian distributors provided for retention of title to products delivered to such distributors until the distributor made payment to allow the Company to recover the products in the event of distributor defaulted on payment. The agreements provided for this protection because the laws of the countries in which the distributors conducted business did not provide for a sellers retention of a security interest in goods in the same manner as established in the U.S. Uniform Commercial Code. The Company recognized revenue on sales transactions governed by such distributor agreements upon delivery of the products, which may occur prior to receipt of payment and the transfer of title. This treatment is permitted under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104  Revenue Recognition, as all other revenue recognition criteria outlined in SAB No. 104 had been met and the only rights the Company retained with the title in such transactions were those enabling recovery of the products in the event of distributor payment default. The Company did not retain any other rights of ownership, such as the ability to direct the disposition of the products sold, rescind the transaction or prohibit the distributor from moving, selling or otherwise using the goods in the normal course of business.   15          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     2004 Compared to 2003           Revenue and Cost of Revenue . As a result of discontinued operations, the Company has no revenue or cost of sales related to continuing operations.         Operating Expenses . Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $1,665,794, a decrease of $721,288 or 30% relative to 2003. The decrease in expense reflects the Companys reduction in expenditures as operations declined. All operating expenses were related to corporate level activities as all selling and research and development expenditures were reclassified to discontinued operations.         Other Income (Expense).  The significant changes between periods in net other income and expense occurred primarily as a result of the accounting treatment for the issuance of additional debt and the modification of debt. The expensing of the beneficial conversion feature related to the Convertible Senior Secured Notes resulted in the recognition of $16,010 of interest expense and the modification of the Convertible Subordinated Debt resulted in a loss $1,670,683 in 2004. Total accretion on notes payable in 2004 was $1,206,884 compared to $632,143 in 2003. Modification of the Companys Convertible Subordinated Debt in April 2003, resulted in recognition of a $1,500,000 gain during the second quarter 2003.         Discontinued Operations.  On October 4, 2004, the Company concluded that it was no longer able to fund the operations of DML. The Directors of DML then ceased all operations in the U.K. and, effective November 1, 2004 terminated all of our employees there. On November 22, 2004, a Meeting of Creditors was held in London, England for the purposes of liquidating the assets of DML. Based upon a review of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets, the Company assessed the measurement date for the sale transaction as the date of Director approval, which occurred on October 4, 2004. As prescribed by SFAS No. 144, the Company began reporting the results of operations of DML as discontinued operations effective as of the year ended December 31, 2004 for all periods presented. Upon DML entering liquidation in November, the Company recorded a loss of $2.4 million.        The operations of the Companys continuous monitoring business, reflected in discontinued operations, reported a net loss of $4,127,982, $6,170,974, and $2,368,005 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively. The decrease in net loss from 2003 to 2004 is primarily the result of restructuring that took place in 2003. The increase in net loss from 2002 to 2003 is primarily the result of a reduction in revenues and an increase in sales and marketing expenses as the Company expended its distribution channels after the termination of the exclusive agreement with Philips Medical Systems.         Net Loss / Net Loss Available to Common Shareholders.  The Companys reported consolidated net loss in 2004 of $10,978,828 was further adjusted by a $1,946,210 charge for a beneficial conversion feature and $1,211,247 for deemed dividend on preferred stock to arrive at net loss available to common shareholders of $14,136,285, which is used in the numerator in the loss per share calculation. This occurred as a result of the application of the provisions of EITF 98-5, Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios, and EITF 00-27, Application of Issue 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments resulted in the calculation of an embedded beneficial conversion feature in the Series F and G preferred stock. The beneficial conversion feature  preferred stock dividend for Series F and G was $665,994 and $1,280,216, respectively.        Subsequent to the preferred stock financings described above, the exercise price of the warrants issued with the preferred stock were adjusted downward during 2004 as a result of the issuance of the Series G financing and the new Convertible Senior Notes. In addition new warrants to purchase 12,241,608 shares of common stock were issued to the Series E and Series F investors as a result of the Series G financing. The new Convertible Senior Note financing reduce the exercise price of warrants to purchase 5,555,589 shares of common stock to $.025 per share and warrants to purchase 12,000,000 shares of common stock to $.01 per share. The reductions in the exercise price or ceiling exercise price, as applicable, of the warrants previously issued to these investors and the issuance of new warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock resulted in a deemed dividend on the Series E, F and G preferred stock, requiring a charge to retained earnings and an offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital aggregating $1,211,247. Similar to the beneficial conversion features discussed above, this amount was charged to retained earnings, with an offsetting credit to additional paid-in-capital, and was treated as a reconciling item on the statement of operations to adjust the reported net loss to net loss available to common shareholders, which is used in the numerator in the loss per share calculation for the year ended December 31, 2004.   16           2003 Compared to 2002           Revenue and Cost of Revenue . As a result of discontinued operations, the Company has no revenue or cost of sales related to continuing operations.         Operating Expenses.  Total operating expenses from continuing operations decreased by $601,831 or 20% from 2002 to 2003. The decrease in expense reflects the Companys reduction in expenditures as operations declined. All operating expenses were related to corporate level activities as all selling and research and development expenditures were reclassified to discontinued operations.         Interest and Other Income / Expense.  The Company realized interest income of $15,878 in 2003 compared to $86,441 in 2002. The year-to-year declines reflect the impact of lower average cash and investment balances and lower average interest rates.        The gain on modification of convertible notes in 2003 occurred as a result of the accounting treatment for the modification of the Companys Convertible Subordinated Notes, which resulted in the recognition as other income in the second quarter 2003 of a $1,500,000 gain. The modified notes and associated warrants were recorded at their individual estimated fair values of $5,000,000 and $800,000, respectively. The $7,300,000 carrying value of the original notes was retired, and the residual amount of $1,500,000 was reflected as a gain on the transaction. Prior to the additional modification to the Convertible Subordinated Notes, the Company was accreting the initial $5,000,000 carrying value of the modified notes to their redemption value of $7,300,000 using the effective interest method over the remaining term of the modified notes, which would have resulted in the recording of $2,300,000 of additional interest expense over this period. Accordingly, the accretion of the convertible notes balance resulted in an additional charge to interest expense of $632,143 in 2003, partially offsetting the gain.        Interest expense totaled $1,262,307 in 2003, compared to $545,976 in 2002. The significant increase in interest expense in 2003 primarily reflects the recognition of additional interest expense of $632,143 for the accretion of the convertible notes discussed above, the amortization of extension costs associated with the Companys convertible notes and the impact of higher average interest rates on capital lease obligations entered into in late 2002 and early 2003.         Discontinued Operations.  On October 4, 2004 the Company concluded that it was no longer able to fund the operations of DML. The Directors of DML then ceased all operations in the U.K. and, effective November 1, 2004, terminated all of its employees there. On November 22, 2004, a Meeting of Creditors was held in London, England for the purposes of liquidating the assets of DML. Based upon a review of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long-lived Assets, the Company assessed the measurement date for the sale transaction as the date of Director approval, October 4, 2004. As prescribed by SFAS No. 144, the Company began reporting the results of operations of DML as discontinued operations effective as of the year ended December 31, 2004 for all periods presented. Upon DML entering liquidation in November, the Company recorded a loss of $2.4 million.        On September 29, 2003, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets used in the Companys intermittent testing business to ITC. Based upon a review of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets, the Company assessed the measurement date for the sale transaction as the date of shareholder approval, which occurred on September 19, 2003. As prescribed by SFAS No. 144, the Company began reporting the results of operations of the intermittent testing business as discontinued operations effective with the quarter ended September 30, 2003, for all periods presented. Upon completion of the sale transaction in September, the Company recorded a gain on the sale of the intermittent testing business of $1.8 million.        The operations of the Companys intermittent testing business, reflected in discontinued operations, reported a net loss of $2,071,036 and $1,864,469 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 respectively. The increase in net loss is primarily the result of a reduction in revenues and an increase in sales and marketing expenses, both stemming from the termination of the exclusive agreement with Philips and the resulting transition to expanded distribution channels.         Net Loss / Net Loss Available to Common Shareholders.  The Companys reported consolidated net loss in 2003 of $8,479,145 was further adjusted by a $958,962 charge for a beneficial conversion feature to arrive at net loss available to common shareholders of $9,438,107, which is used in the numerator in the loss per share calculation. This occurred as a result of the required accounting treatment of the Companys issuance of $1.5 million of Series E convertible preferred stock and associated warrants in May 2003. As further discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company allocated the net investor proceeds of $1,350,000 from the issuance of the Series E convertible preferred stock to the preferred stock and associated warrants based upon their estimated relative fair values. The resulting fair value allocations of $958,962 and $391,038 for the preferred stock and warrants, respectively, were recorded as equity. The beneficial conversion feature embedded in the preferred stock was calculated at $958,962 and was limited to the fair value allocated to the preferred stock. The beneficial conversion feature of $958,962 was treated as a deemed dividend to preferred shareholders, and was charged to retained earnings, with the offsetting credit to additional paid-in-capital.   17                 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES         The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and other commitments in the normal course of business. The report of the Companys independent auditors contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern as a result of recurring losses and negative cash flows. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.        At December 31, 2004, the Company had negative working capital of approximately $331,000, compared with negative working capital of approximately $417,000 at December 31, 2003, after restatement of the balance sheet for the impact of discontinued operations. Cash of $1,096,000 represented 87% of total current assets at December 31, 2004. Current liabilities of $1,477,000 at that date consisted primarily of $1,355,000 in accounts payable and accrued expenses and $28,000 in current maturities of long-term debt. The Company used the net proceeds from $1,800,000 of Convertible Senior Notes funded on December 15, 2004, after banking, legal and accounting fees related to that financing, to pay certain critical liabilities. Others have been negotiated or are being paid over several months.        Net losses for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $10,979,000 and $8,479,000 respectively, after losses related to discontinued operations of $6,008,000 and $6,410,000. In addition, charges were recorded for a deemed preferred stock dividend related to beneficial conversion features of $1,946,000 in 2004 and $959,000 in 2003 and a deemed dividend of $1,211,000 on preferred stock in 2004.        During 2004, the Company received net proceeds of $1,620,000 from borrowings and $2,611,000 from sales of preferred stock. These proceeds were used primarily to fund net requirements for continuing operating activities in the amount of $1,351,000 and requirements for discontinued operations in the amount of $1,947,000. The net increase in cash compared with net decreases of $3,736,000 in 2003 and $3,233,000 in 2002. The most significant sources of funds in 2003 were $4,153,000 net proceeds, including gain from the sale of discontinued operations and $596,000 from sales of preferred and common stock, less mandatory redemptions. Continuing operations used $3,648,000 in 2003 and provided $618,000 in 2002.        The Company is monitoring its cash position carefully and is evaluating its future operating cash requirements in the context of its strategy, business objectives and expected business performance. Cash on hand at December 31, 2004 was expected to provide five to six months of funding as the Company developed plans for its new product development activities. An additional $150,000 was borrowed on May 2, 2005 and additional amounts will likely be required to complete that planning. After receipt of the $150,000 in May 2005, the Company had available funds of $250,000. Operations used about $100,000 in April 2005 and it is expected that requirements will be similar in future months, excluding incremental accounting, auditing and legal fees related to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and any initial new product development costs.        The Companys long-term capital requirements for the development of its new products will depend upon numerous factors, including the rate of market acceptance of the Companys products and the level of research and development activities. It is presently anticipated that such activities will require from $10 to $15 million. While there can be no assurance that adequate funds will be available when needed, or on acceptable terms, management believes that the Company will be able to raise adequate funding to meet its operational requirements. If the Company is unable to raise an adequate level of additional capital or generate sufficient cash flows from operations, the Companys ability to execute its business plan and remain a going concern will be significantly impaired.        Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $4,246,000 in 2004, an increase over the $514,000 of net cash provided financing activities in 2003. Financing activities in 2004 related to the issuance of $1,620,000 net of cash discounts for the Convertible Senior Notes in December 2004 and two rounds of preferred stock offerings which totaled $2,611,000 after offering costs which occurred in January 2004 and May 2004.         Income Tax Carryforwards.  At December 31, 2004, the Company had U.S. tax net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately $139,500,000 and $1,493,000, respectively. Pursuant to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, use of a portion of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards are limited due to a change in ownership. If not used, these net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2005 ($500,000) and at increasing amounts between 2006 and 2023 ($31.6 million between 2006 and 2009, and $100 million thereafter).   18           Disclosure of Contractual Obligations          In late 1996 the Company entered into a long-term debt obligation consisting of a $7.3 million senior secured fixed rate loan note issued to Pfizer Inc. in connection with the Companys acquisition of DML. Proceeds from the issuance in August 1998 of $7.3 million of Convertible Subordinated Notes, issued in conjunction with a private equity placement, were simultaneously used to retire the $7.3 million Pfizer note. Payments on the Companys contractual obligations, consisting of debt, capital leases and operating leases are summarized below:                                                                                                         Year ending December 31                     2005              2006              Thereafter              Total              Long-term debt (1)         $                  $                  $    10,075,028              $    10,075,028           Operating leases              103,147                   104,014                   121,202                   328,363           Long Term Notes              582,737                   763,453                   706,078                   2,052,268                                                                              Total contractual obligations         $    685,884              $    867,467              $    10,902,308              $    12,455,659                                                                                         (1)         Amounts include principal and interest.              NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS         EITF Issue No. 03-01, Meaning of Other-Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, addresses both qualitative and quantitative disclosures required for marketable equity and debt securities accounted for under FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. EITF Issue No. 03-01 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.        In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, which established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both debt and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances) because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer. For example, the Statement requires liability classification for a financial instrument issued in the form of shares that are mandatorily redeemable, e.g., includes an unconditional obligation requiring the issuer to redeem it by transferring at a specified or determinable date or dates or upon an event certain to occur. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 150 and applied its provisions to the classification at September 30, 2003 of the $750,000 of Series E convertible preferred stock that was put back to the Company effective with the sale of the Companys intermittent testing business.        In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which replaces the original issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46 in January 2003 and clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements. This interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.      Item 7.a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk          The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the British pound sterling to the U.S. dollar as the financial position and operating results of the Companys U.K. subsidiary, TGC, are translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation. The Company is presently considering certain product development contracts with European based businesses. Such contracts would likely be denominated in Euros which would also create market risk as funds were transferred from the U.S. The Companys exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from transferring funds to its U.K. subsidiary in British pounds sterling.        As a result of fluctuations of the British pound sterling to the U.S. dollar in 2003, the Companys reported consolidated net loss for 2003 increased in excess of $400,000 relative to 2002. The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Companys financial results for 2002 was not material. The Company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge against exchange rate risk or   19             interest rate risk. The Companys debt obligations as of December 31, 2004 bear interest at fixed rates, and are therefore not subject to exposure from fluctuating interest rates.      Item 8.
