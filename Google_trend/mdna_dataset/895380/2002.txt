Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition  SUMMARY     Diametrics Medical, Inc., which began operations in 1990, is engaged in the development, manufacture and commercialization of critical care blood and tissue analysis systems which provide immediate or continuous diagnostic results at the point-of-patient care.     Since its commencement of operations in 1990, the Company has transitioned from a development stage company to a full-scale development, manufacturing and marketing organization (primarily through distributors). As of December 31, 2001, the primary funding for the operations of the Company has been approximately $148 million raised through public and private sales of its equity securities and issuance of convertible promissory notes.     Distribution and commercialization of the Company's products primarily occurs through Philips Medical Systems ("Philips") and Codman & Shurtleff, a Johnson & Johnson company ("Codman"). Philips is the exclusive global distributor of the Company's critical care blood monitoring products, the IRMA(R)SL blood analysis system and the Trendcare(R) continuous blood gas monitoring systems, including Paratrend(R) and Neotrend(TM). Philips also is the exclusive global distributor of the Blood Analysis Portal System, co- developed by the Company and Philips. Codman is the exclusive worldwide distributor of the Neurotrend(TM) cerebral tissue monitoring system.     The Codman distribution agreement was initiated in October 1998, has a term of six years and is renewable for two years. If minimum sales levels and marketing expenditure levels are not achieved by Codman, certain payments will be due to the Company. Also, Codman has the right of first refusal to market new continuous monitoring products developed for the neuro market. In addition, Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation has an equity investment of approximately $4 million in the Company's Common Stock.     The distribution agreement with Philips was signed in June 1999, initially as an agreement between the Company and Hewlett Packard Company ("HP"). Under the terms of the distribution agreement, the Company transferred full responsibility for marketing, sales and distribution of the blood monitoring products described above to HP. The initial term of the agreement is three and a half years, with the option for extensions. Concurrently with the execution of the agreement, HP made a $9.5 million equity investment in the Company. In addition to HP's equity investment, the agreement also provides for minimum purchase commitments of the Company's products, market development commitments, research and development funding and royalty payments, as well as funding of sales and marketing costs during a sales transition period in 1999. In late 1999, HP assigned the distribution agreement and its equity investment with the Company to Agilent Technologies, Inc. ("Agilent"), a leading provider of test and measurement solutions and communications components, which was formed as a new company and subsidiary of HP. HP spun off its ownership in Agilent to HP shareholders during 2000. In August 2001, Agilent completed the sale of its healthcare business to Royal Philips Electronics, including its equity investment in the Company. Also as part of this transaction, the distribution agreement between the Company and Agilent was assigned to Philips Medical Systems, a division of Royal Philips Electronics. The initial three- and-a half year term of the Company's distribution agreement with Philips ends on October 31, 2002, with the option for three three-year extensions. The Company is discussing various options for the possible continuation of a relationship with Philips following the end of the initial term, which could include a continuation of the distribution relationship with Philips under modified terms yet to be determined. The Company's sales to Philips in 2001 represented 90% of total sales, and the Company recognized in 2001 approximately $2 million of funding from Philips as a reduction in research and development expenses. Sales to Philips include product purchases by Philips to meet sales demand of its end-user customers and to fulfill its internal product requirements associated with the sales process, as well as contractual purchase commitments and royalties under the distribution agreement. As a result, the level of the Company's sales to Philips during any period is not indicative of Philips' sales to its end-user customers during that period, which are estimated to be substantially less than the Company's sales to Philips in each of the last three years.     The Company's historical trend of achieving successive improvements in annual operating results was suspended in 2001 primarily due to the realization of uncertainties affecting revenues described in the                                        14   Company's 2000 Annual Report, including: 1) delayed sales due to the transition of the Company's distribution channel as a result of the sale of Agilent's healthcare business to Royal Philips Electronics, 2) the impact of new product introductions on hardware sales of the Company's existing product lines, and 3) the impact on sales of reduced capital spending in the healthcare sector after hospitals made investments to address Year 2000 date change requirements. Total revenues for the year were down 3% from the prior year. Revenue from product sales, which excludes non-product revenue such as royalties, grew 4% for the year. Gross profit was 27% of sales in 2001, a three percentage point reduction from the prior year, while operating expenses declined 2% year over year. The resulting net loss for the year increased 46% from the previous year. The decline in gross profit and increase in net loss were driven by a $1.7 million reduction in non-product revenue, primarily royalties.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES     The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts, giving due consideration to materiality. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies (more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements), the following are particularly important to the portrayal of the Company's results of operations and financial position and may require the application of a higher level of judgment by the Company's management, and as a result are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.     Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable. The Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101, "Revenue Recognition" provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues, and the Company's revenue recognition policies are in compliance with SAB 101. The Company markets and distributes its products primarily through two global distribution partnerships with Philips and Codman. The Company also continues to sell direct to end-users and through regional distributors for a small volume of products and transactions that are not subject to the exclusive distribution agreements. The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment of product to its distributors and direct customers or, in the case of trial instruments and monitors placed directly with end-user customers, upon the customer's acceptance of the product. The Company's sales terms to its distributors and customers provide no right of return outside of the Company's standard warranty policy (see Note 1), and payment terms consistent with industry standards apply. Sales terms and pricing extended to the Company's distributors are governed by the respective distribution agreements, together with binding purchase orders for each transaction. Most of the Company's sales since 1999 (after the inception of the Company's distribution partnerships with Philips and Codman) have been to its distribution partners, totaling 94% of total sales in 2001, and 90% and 70% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company's distribution partners purchase the Company's products to meet sales demand of their end-user customers as well as to fulfill their internal requirements associated with the sales process and contractual purchase requirements under the respective distribution agreements. Internal and other requirements include purchases of products by Philips (and to a lesser extent, Codman) for training, demonstration and evaluation purposes, clinical evaluations, product support, establishing inventories, meeting minimum purchase commitments, and for royalties primarily in 2000. As a result, the level of the Company's revenue during any period is not indicative of its distributors' sales to end-user customers during that period, which are estimated to be substantially less than the Company's sales to those distributors in each of the last three years. While this does not affect the Company's recognition of revenue for direct sales to its distributors or the collectibility of its receivables, the Company's future revenue growth may be impacted by its distributors' level of inventories of the Company's products, their sales to end-user customers and their internal product requirements.     As sales to the Company's two global distribution partners comprise most of the Company's revenues, the Company's accounts receivable balance at any point in time likewise reflects a concentration of amounts due from these parties. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of its customers to make required payments. While the Company believes that the quality of its                                        15   receivables from its distribution partners is high, if the financial condition of the Company's distribution partners were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.     Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method. Reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based upon current and expected future product sales and the expected impact of product transitions or modifications. While the Company expects its distributors' sales to grow, a reduction in its distributors' sales could reduce the demand for the Company's products, and additional inventory reserves may be required.     Recognition of Research and Development Funding. Research and development funds earned by the Company under the Philips distribution agreement are recorded as a reduction of the development costs incurred, and have totaled approximately $2 million annually.     Foreign Currency Translation/Transactions. The financial position and results of operations of the Company's foreign subsidiary, DML, are measured using local currency as the functional currency. The financial statements of the Company's foreign subsidiary are translated in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 52. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated using period-end exchange rates and statements of operations items are translated using average exchange rates for the period, with the resulting translation adjustments recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Also recorded as translation adjustments in shareholders' equity are transaction gains and losses on intercompany balances for which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future. Other foreign currency transaction gains and losses are credited or charged against earnings. The Company's subsidiary has had negative cash flows since its acquisition by the Company in late 1996, and is expected to continue to have negative cash flows and require funding from the Company for the foreseeable future. As a result, settlement of the Company's net intercompany receivable balance with its subsidiary is not expected in the foreseeable future. As such, the Company records transaction gains or losses on intercompany balances in shareholders' equity in accordance with SFAS No. 52. The Company will continue to evaluate the potential for future settlement of intercompany balances. Settlement of intercompany balances on a near-term basis would require the Company to include transaction gains or losses on intercompany balances as credits or charges to current income (vs. shareholders' equity), potentially resulting in an increase in the volatility of the Company's Statements of Operations.     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets at December 31, 2001 consist of property and equipment and purchased software. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Sales     Sales of the Company's products were $24,488,928 for 2001, compared to $25,258,407 for 2000, and $18,687,184 for 1999. The 35% increase in sales from 1999 to 2000 reflects a 32% growth in sales of instruments and a 9% increase in disposable cartridge and sensor sales. Unit sales in 2000 grew at a higher rate than the related revenues, at 42% for instruments and 28% for disposable cartridges and sensors. The reduced rate of revenue growth relative to units resulted from the impact of lower average sales prices under the Philips and Codman distribution agreements. The impact of reduced pricing was partially mitigated in 2000 by the recognition of royalty revenue under the Philips distribution agreement of $2,260,000. Sales declined 3% in 2001 from 2000, driven by a reduction in non-product revenue, primarily royalties. Product revenues increased 4% during 2001, with a 10% increase in disposable cartridge and sensor sales and a 1% increase in instrument sales. Unit sales in 2001 also grew at a higher rate than the related revenues, at 20% for both instruments and                                        16   disposable cartridges and sensors. The favorable revenue impact of unit sales growth in 2001 was partially offset by lower average cartridge sales prices to Philips, resulting from volume price reductions, and a higher ratio of IRMA analyzer instrument sales, which have lower average sales prices, relative to total instrument sales. The Company's sales to Philips and Codman comprised approximately 94%, 90% and 70% of total sales in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and are expected to approximate 2001 levels as a percentage of total sales in 2002. Due to the significant purchases of the Company's products by its distributors for their internal use in the sales process and to meet minimum purchase commitments, the distributors' sales to their end- user customers over the last three years are estimated to be approximately 40% of the Company's product sales related to those distributors over that period. While expected to remain below the level of the Company's sales to the distributors in 2002, the distributors' sales to their end-user customers in 2002 are expected to increase as a percentage of the Company's product sales to those distributors compared to the last three years.     For the year ended December 31, 2001, both intermittent blood testing products revenue and continuous monitoring products revenue were comprised of 71% instrument related revenue and 29% disposable cartridge and sensor related revenue. Intermittent testing products represented 57%, 44% and 39% of sales in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, with continuous monitoring products comprising the remaining sales in each year. The Company's revenues are affected principally by the number of instruments, both monitors and IRMA analyzers, sold to distributors, the extent to which the distributors sell these instruments to end-user customers, and the rate at which disposable sensors and cartridges are used in connection with these products. As of December 31, 2001, the Company has sold approximately 10,800 instruments. Unit sales in 2001 of both instruments and disposable sensors and cartridges increased approximately 20% from 2000. As the Company grows, it is expected that the growing end-user customer base will increase the usage and rate of usage of disposable products, with the result that overall disposable product sales will exceed that of instrument sales.  Cost of Sales     Cost of sales totaled $17,984,341 for 2001, compared to $17,738,103 for 2000 and $15,779,694 for 1999. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was 73% in 2001, 70% in 2000 and 84% in 1999. The three percentage point increase in 2001 relative to 2000 was primarily caused by lower non-product revenue, primarily royalties. Excluding the impact of non-product revenues, cost of sales as a percentage of revenue improved by four percentage points from 2000 to 2001. The year-to-year improvements in the Company's cost of sales as a percentage of revenue, excluding the impact of non-product revenue, reflect lower disposable unit manufacturing costs resulting from increased unit sales volumes and improved cartridge and sensor yields, a reduction in instrument material costs, and the impact of operational efficiencies and process improvements. Partially offsetting the improvement in 2001 was the impact of lower average cartridge sales prices, resulting from volume price reductions. Improvements in 2000 and 1999 were partially offset by the impact of generally lower average sales prices resulting from the initiation in mid 1999 of the distribution agreement with Philips. Sales returns in 1999 from distributors that were displaced as a result of the Company's exclusive distribution agreement with Philips also partially offset the improvement in that year. The Company introduced a new intermittent testing hardware product in the first quarter of 2002, which will supplement but not replace the Company's existing hardware product line. It is not expected that the introduction of the new hardware product will increase obsolescence of existing hardware inventories.  Operating Expenses     Total operating expenses decreased $181,000 or 2% from 2000 to 2001, following a decrease of $2.7 million or 21% from 1999 to 2000. The significant decline in operating expenses from 1999 to 2000 is primarily the result of the transfer during 1999 of the Company's sales and marketing functions to Philips and the recognition in 2000 of a full year of research and development funding received from Philips as part of the distribution agreement.     Research and development expenses totaled $5,137,974 for 2001, compared to $4,962,348 in 2000 and $4,847,463 in 1999. The year-to-year increases in expenses of 2% and 4% in 2000 and 2001, respectively, were                                        17   primarily due to increased investments to support new research and development projects, partially offset by the recognition of funding from Philips in the amounts of $2.2 million in 2001, $2 million in 2000 and $1.2 million in 1999.     Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $4,944,599 for 2001, compared to $5,300,918 in 2000 and $8,103,826 in 1999. The significant decrease in expenses from 1999 to 2000 was primarily impacted by the transfer during 1999 of most of the Company's sales and marketing functions to Philips. The decrease in expenses from 2000 to 2001 was primarily due to a reduction in personnel.  Interest and Other Expense     The Company realized interest income of $323,490 in 2001, compared to $787,396 in 2000 and $528,787 in 1999. The improvement in interest income from 1999 to 2000 reflects the impact of higher average cash and investment balances, primarily affected by the timing of the Company's financing activities, funding received from Philips and improved cash flows from operations. The decline in interest income from 2000 to 2001 reflects the impact of lower average cash and investment balances and lower average interest rates.     Interest expense totaled $572,618 in 2001, compared to $586,616 in 2000 and $630,459 in 1999. The decline in expense from 1999 to 2000 primarily reflects the impact of lower average debt balances, while the decline from 2000 to 2001 reflects the impact of slightly lower average interest rates on comparable average debt balances.     Net other expense totaled $48,785 in 2001, compared to $105,435 in 2000 and $98,076 in 1999. The change in net amounts from 2000 to 2001 was primarily due to a decrease in foreign currency transaction losses. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material in any of the years presented.  Net loss     Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $3,875,899, compared to $2,647,617 in 2000 and $10,243,547 in 1999. The improvement in net loss from 1999 to 2000 reflects revenue growth; improved margins, influenced by higher unit volumes, changes in product mix, royalty revenue and improved manufacturing yields; and reduced operating expenses due primarily to research and development funding received from Philips and the transfer of the Company's sales and marketing functions to Philips. The net loss in 2001 increased from 2000 primarily as a result of a reduction in non-product revenue, changes in product mix and lower interest income.     The Company anticipates that commercial success of its distribution partners should result in growth in disposable sensor and cartridge revenue in 2002. This growth is likely to be offset initially by a decline in instrument revenue due to the impact of a new hardware product introduction on average hardware sales prices and sales of existing hardware product lines as distributors reduce inventories of these products. Revenue and gross profit levels in 2002 will depend on the impact of the new product line introduction, revenue mix, and sales performance of the Company's distributors. As a result, the Company's financial performance for 2002 may not improve from or may be less favorable than that of 2001. If sales growth does occur in 2002, it is expected to be delayed to the later part of the year due to these factors.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     At December 31, 2001, the Company had working capital of approximately $11.9 million, a decrease of approximately $2.4 million from the working capital of $14.3 million reported at December 31, 2000. The net decrease primarily reflects the impact of the increase in net loss between years of $1.2 million and a $3.6 million decrease in proceeds from warrant exercises and employee stock plans, partially offset by a $2.3 million reduction in purchases of property and equipment. Through December 31, 2001, the Company raised approximately $148 million through the public and private sales of its equity securities and the issuance of convertible promissory notes.                                        18      Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $5.4 million and $3 million for the same periods in 2000 and 1999, respectively. This was the result of net losses of $3.9 million, $2.6 million and $10.2 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, adjusted by changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred credits and revenue, discussed below.     Net accounts receivable decreased $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to a decrease of $109,000 in 2000 and an increase of $1.4 million in 1999. In spite of a significant increase in sales between 1999 and 2000, the accounts receivable balance decreased in 2000 primarily due to an improvement in days sales outstanding, impacted by the Company's distribution partnerships, and the timing of sales. The larger decline in accounts receivable during 2001 was primarily due to the timing of sales and an improvement in days sales outstanding.     Inventories decreased $213,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, after an increase of $164,000 in 2000 and a decrease of $651,000 in 1999. The decrease in 1999 and small increase in 2000 reflect a decrease in finished goods inventories in both years. The decline in finished goods inventory in 2000 was offset by an increase in work-in-process inventory to meet anticipated production and sales requirements in the first quarter of 2001. The decrease in 2001 reflects a decrease in continuous monitoring inventories of $628,000 due to the production and shipment of products to the Company's distributors, partially offset by an increase in intermittent testing hardware inventories in preparation for shipment in the first quarter 2002 of initial sales of a new hardware product line as well as sales of existing hardware products. Each year's average inventory balance was positively impacted by successive improvements in inventory turnover, stemming from improved inventory management.     Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased $954,000 on a combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2001, after a decrease of $647,000 in 2000 and an increase of $405,000 in 1999. The increase in 1999 is primarily due to increased accruals for employee bonuses and costs to complete committed product upgrades. The declines in 2000 and 2001 were affected primarily by the timing of vendor payments and reductions in product upgrade accruals as upgrades were completed during 2000 and 2001 from the upgrade program which began in 1999.     Deferred credits and revenue increased $750,000 during 2001, after a $4.1 million decrease during 2000 and a $5.1 million increase in 1999. The increase in 1999 primarily reflects the receipt of $9.5 million of prepaid funding from Philips under the terms of the distribution agreement, partially offset by the recognition of approximately $4.4 million of the funding as a reduction of 1999 expenses and royalty revenue. The decrease in 2000 represents the recognition of funding from Philips for research and development and royalties of $4.3 million, partially offset by customer advance payments. The increase in 2001 primarily reflects the receipt of $3 million of research and development funding from Philips, partially offset by the recognition of approximately $2.2 million of the funding as a reduction of 2001 expenses.     Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, following net cash provided by investing activities of $1.6 million in 2000 and net cash used in investing activities of $9.1 million in 1999. These year-to-year changes were primarily affected by the amounts and timing of equity funding, funding received from Philips and operating cash flow requirements, which all affected the amount of cash available for the purchase of marketable securities. Purchases of property and equipment also affected net cash provided by or used in investing activities, and totaled $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, $3.4 million in 2000 and $1.7 million in 1999. Capital additions in each year consisted primarily of investments in production and development equipment, software and instruments for internal use in research and development. In 2002, the Company expects total capital expenditures and new lease commitments to approximate $1.2 million for the year, primarily reflecting investments to support new product development and production.                                         19      Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $191,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $3.6 million in 2000 and $11.8 million in 1999. The year-to-year changes were due primarily to the amounts and timing of equity funding and the amount of proceeds from employee stock plans and warrant exercises in each of these years.     In late 1996 and throughout 1997, the Company entered into long-term debt obligations of approximately $8.9 million. The original debt consisted of a $7.3 million senior secured fixed rate loan note issued to Pfizer Inc. in connection with the Company's acquisition of DML and approximately $1.6 million in notes payable for equipment financing. Proceeds from the issuance in August 1998 of $7.3 million of Convertible Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes, issued in conjunction with a private equity placement, were simultaneously used to retire the $7.3 million Pfizer note. Repayments on the Company's contractual obligations, consisting of debt, capital leases and operating leases, are summarized below:                                                Year ending December 31                                   --------------------------------------------                                      2002       2003    Thereafter    Total                                   ---------- ---------- ---------- -----------               Long-term debt (1)............ $  678,587 $7,610,978  $    --   $ 8,289,565    Capital leases (1)............    159,511    159,511   166,675      485,697    Operating leases..............    760,762    695,249   557,660    2,013,671                                   ---------- ----------  --------  -----------      Total contractual obliga-       tions...................... $1,598,860 $8,465,738  $724,335  $10,788,933                                   ========== ==========  ========  ===========    --------   (1) Amounts include principal and interest.     Effective March 31, 1998, the Company secured a $1 million receivable- backed line of credit. The loan agreement requires the Company's accounts receivable collections to be applied to reduce the loan balance, including advances, interest and fees. At December 31, 2001, no advances were outstanding under the line of credit. The existing line of credit agreement will not be renewed upon its expiration in mid 2002; however, the Company plans to re-establish a line of credit agreement with an alternative source in 2002.     At December 31, 2001, the Company had U.S. net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately $120.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively. (See note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion).     The full principal balance of the Company's $7.3 million Convertible Senior Fixed Rate Notes becomes due August 4, 2003, unless the note holders elect prior to that date to convert the notes into shares of the Company's Common Stock at a conversion price of $8.40 per share. If the note holders do not exercise the conversion option or do not elect to extend the due date, the Company plans to refinance the notes with debt or equity to the extent cash flows from operations or partnering activities are not sufficient to retire the notes. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to refinance the notes or be able to refinance under favorable terms. The Company believes, however, that excluding the impact of retiring or refinancing the notes, currently available funds and cash generated from projected operating revenues, supplemented by proceeds from employee stock plans, warrant exercises, asset based credit and partnering activities will meet the Company's working capital and capital expenditure requirements. If the amount or timing of funding from these sources or cash requirements vary materially from those currently planned, the Company could require additional capital. The Company's long-term capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the rate of market acceptance of the Company's products, the level of resources devoted to expanding the Company's business and manufacturing capabilities, and the level of research and development activities. While there can be no assurance that adequate funds will be available when needed or on acceptable terms, management believes that the Company will be able to raise adequate funding if needed.                                        20   EURO CONVERSION     The Company sells and distributes most of its products globally through distributors, with sales denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's subsidiary, DML, conducts its operations from the U.K. The U.K. is one of three countries of the European Union ("EU") that has not adopted the euro as its legal currency; however, the U.K. may convert to the euro at a later date. The euro will be the sole official currency in participating EU countries on July 1, 2002.     While the Company will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro conversion over time, based upon currently available information, management does not believe that the conversion to the euro currency will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or overall trends in results of operations.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS     In July 2001, The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141 "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which change the accounting for business combinations and goodwill. SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. Use of the pooling-of-interests method is prohibited. SFAS No. 142 changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment-only approach. Amortization of goodwill, including goodwill recorded in past business combinations, will therefore cease upon adoption of the Statement, which for the Company will be January 1, 2002. The Company has evaluated SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142, and has concluded that they do not have a material effect on its financial statements.     In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." This Statement supersedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long- Lived Assets to be Disposed Of," and addresses significant issues related to the implementation of SFAS No. 121. SFAS No. 144 establishes a single accounting method under which long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are measured, which is the lower of book value or fair value less costs to sell. Additionally, SFAS No. 144 expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations and cash flows that (1) can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and (2) will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction. SFAS No. 144 is effective January 1, 2002 and its provisions are to be applied prospectively. The Company has evaluated SFAS No. 144 and has concluded that it does not have a material effect on its financial statements.     The Company's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition, including statements regarding the Company's expectations about new and existing products, future financial performance, market risk exposure and other forward looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, demand and acceptance of new and existing products, technological advances and product obsolescence, competitive factors, stability of domestic and international financial markets and economies, the performance of the Company's distributors and the availability of capital to finance growth. These and other risks are discussed in greater detail in Exhibit 99 to this Form 10-K.  Item 7.a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     The Company's primary market risk exposure is foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the British pound sterling to the U.S. dollar as the financial position and operating results of the Company's U.K. subsidiary, DML, are translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation. The Company's exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from transferring funds to its U.K. subsidiary in British pounds sterling. Effective November 1, 1999, most of the Company's sales are made to distributors and denominated in U.S. dollars, thereby significantly mitigating the risk of exchange rate fluctuations on trade receivables. November 1, 1999 marked the completion of a sales transition period with Philips, the Company's exclusive global distributor of the IRMA SL blood analysis system and the Trendcare continuous blood monitoring products, which followed the completion of a distribution agreement in the fourth quarter 1998 with Codman, who is the exclusive global distributor of Neurotrend, a continuous cerebral tissue monitoring product.                                        21      The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Company's financial results for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was not material. The Company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge against exchange rate risk. Because foreign exchange exposure to these rate fluctuations increases as intercompany balances grow, the Company will continue to evaluate the need to initiate hedging programs to mitigate the impact on intercompany balances of changes in the exchange rate of the British pound sterling to the U.S. dollar.     The Company's exposure to interest rate risk is limited to borrowings under a $1 million receivable backed credit line and a bank loan. Any advances under the line of credit bear interest on the unpaid principal amount at a fluctuating rate tied to the Prime Rate, while amounts outstanding under the bank loan bear interest at a fluctuating rate tied to the bank's base rate. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. Borrowings under the line of credit are limited to $1 million and are generally repaid within a few months. The outstanding balance under the bank loan is less than $50,000. Given the above, the Company's exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material. All other existing debt agreements of the Company bear interest at fixed rates, and are therefore not subject to exposure from fluctuating interest rates.  Item 8.
