ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GENERAL    At June 30, 1997 the Company had total assets of $801.4 million, total deposits of $553.2 million and stockholders' equity of $70.2 million, representing 8.77% of total assets. This compares to total assets of $725.1 million, total deposits of $512.5 and stockholders' equity of $67.9 million at June 30, 1996. This represents a 10.53% increase in total assets and a 3.41% increase in stockholders' equity during the 1997 fiscal year. All historical earnings per share data herein reflect a 25% common stock dividend paid to shareholders on May 30, 1997.    The Southern California economy and real estate markets in the Company's primary lending area have shown improvement during the year, especially in income property values. The Company's level of nonperforming assets declined from June 30, 1996, both in dollars and as a percentage of total assets. The Company currently includes nonaccrual loans 60 or more days past due (less any specific allowances on these loans), troubled debt restructured loans and REO in determining its level of nonperforming assets. Although many financial institutions do not consider a loan nonperforming until it is 90 or more days past due, the Company ceases to accrue interest after loan payments are 60 days past due in an effort to recognize problem assets sooner. At June 30, 1997, the Company reported $10.5 million in nonperforming assets in the Company's portfolio compared to $13.1 million and $13.2 million at June 30, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The Company recorded provisions for loan losses of $3.0 million for the year ended June 30, 1997 compared to $2.1 million and $998,000 for the years ended June 30, 1996 and 1995, respectively. See "Business--Allowances for Loan and Real Estate Losses."  PROBLEM ASSETS    Nonperforming assets have been reduced by more than 50% since the peak levels following the Northridge earthquake in 1994. The Company's ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 1.33%, 1.71%, and 2.01% at June 30, 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. The Company attributes the decrease in its nonperforming loans primarily to the disposition of real estate acquired through foreclosure. This includes some real estate properties damaged in the Northridge earthquake in January 1994. Although the Company has been able to reduce nonperforming assets over the last several quarters, there are no assurances that nonperforming assets will not increase in the future resulting in possible increases in provisions for loan losses.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    General. The Company reported net earnings of $2.8 million, $0.61 per share, for the year ended June 30, 1997, compared to net earnings of $3.6 million, $0.74 per share and $2.3 million, $0.48 per share for the years ended June 30, 1996 and 1995, respectively. This decrease in earnings for fiscal 1997 compared to fiscal 1996 was primarily attributable to the one-time SAIF special assessment offset by an increase in net interest income. The special assessment resulted in the Association accruing $3.1 million in operating expenses during the first quarter of fiscal 1997 and paying this amount during the second quarter. Excluding the effects of the special SAIF assessment, net earnings for fiscal 1997 would have been $4.6 million, $1.00 per share. The increase in earnings in fiscal 1996 over 1995 is primarily due to an increase in the net interest margin during fiscal 1996.    Interest Income. Interest income was $58.7 million, $52.6 million and $41.0 million for the years ended June 30, 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. The $6.1 million increase in interest income in 1997 compared to 1996 resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $76.1 million while the average yield on interest-earnings assets remained unchanged. The $11.6 million increase in interest income in 1996 compared to 1995 resulted from an increase in the                                        39   average balance of interest-earning assets of $90.9 million, and an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets of 0.77% to 7.94%.    Interest Expense. Interest expense was $34.9 million, $31.2 million, and $23.5 million for the years ended June 30, 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. The $3.7 million increase in 1997 compared to 1996 resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $76.1 million partially offset by a reduction in the average cost on interest-bearing liabilities of 0.06% to 5.20%. The $7.7 million increase in 1996 compared to 1995 resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $85.5 million, as well as an increase in the average cost on interest-bearing liabilities of 0.65% to 5.26%.    Net Interest Income Before Provision for Loan Losses. Net interest income before provision for loan losses was $23.8 million, $21.5 million, and $17.5 million for the years ended June 30, 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. The increase in 1997 compared to 1996 was primarily a result of the increase in interest-earning assets relative to interest-bearing liabilities during the year. The increase in 1996 compared to 1995 was primarily a result of the net interest margin increasing to 3.24% from 3.07% during the year.    Provision for Loan Losses. During 1997, 1996, and 1995 the Company established $3.0 million, $2.1 million and $998,000, respectively, of provisions for losses on loans. The increase of $900,000 in 1997 compared to 1996 and the increase of $1.1 million in 1996 compared to 1995 was necessary in order to replenish the allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes to be adequate due to charge-offs taken during those years. Management considers the level of nonperforming assets, the regional economic conditions and relevant real estate values and other factors when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss. The Southern California economy and real estate markets in the Company's primary lending area has shown improvement during the year, especially in income property values and management considers the level of allowance for loan losses at June 30, 1997 to be adequate. However, even though the local economy is showing signs of improvement, there can be no assurance that nonperforming assets will not increase and that the Company may have to establish additional loss provisions in the future.    Other Income. Other income increased by $280,000, or 11.25%, in 1997 to $2.8 million as compared to 1996. There were increases in transactional fee income for deposits and loans due to a larger loan and deposit base. Gains on the sale of loans and fees received for servicing loans increased during the year as well. Other income increased by $409,000 or 19.66% in 1996 to $2.5 million as compared to 1995. Fee income for deposits and loans serviced increased due to a larger loan and deposit base in fiscal 1996. In addition, commissions from the sale on noninsured deposit products increased due to improved sales volumes.    Other Expense. Other expense increased $2.8 million, or 17.62%, from $15.7 million in 1996 to $18.5 million in 1997. This increase is primarily due to the $3.1 million one-time special SAIF assessment during the fiscal year. In September 1996, federal legislation which recapitalized the SAIF fund through a one-time special assessment for all thrifts was enacted. SAIF is a part of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The special assessment was based on the Association's deposits as of March 31, 1995 at an assessment rate of 65.7 basis points. During the quarter ended September 30, 1996, the Association accrued $3.1 million in expense for this special assessment and paid this amount during the second quarter of fiscal 1997. Beginning January 1, 1997, the annual amount the Association pays for deposit insurance was reduced to 6.45 basis points from 23.00 basis points. Compensation and employee benefits increased $264,000 or 3.49% in 1997 as compared to 1996 due to increases in salaries and expenses related to the Employees Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). Companies that established an ESOP after 1992 are required to account for the expense of the ESOP at the fair value of the related shares released. Due to the overall increase in the fair value of the QCBC stock during the past few quarters, ESOP expense has shown a corresponding increase. The                                        40   expense related to the ESOP was $715,000, $583,000, and $470,000 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. FDIC insurance decreased $399,000 in 1997 compared to the previous year due to the reduction of the deposit insurance premium that went into effect January 1997.    The following is a summary of other general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended:                                                                    JUNE 30,                                                            --------------------                                                             1997   1996   1995                                                            ------ ------ ------                                                               (IN THOUSANDS)             Professional fees...................................... $  236 $  219 $  215    Advertising and promotional............................    573    513    464    Bank service charges...................................    270    380    375    Miscellaneous loan expenses............................    368    630    660    Consulting fees........................................    437    350    250    Other..................................................  1,152  1,258  1,179                                                            ------ ------ ------                                                            $3,036 $3,350 $3,143                                                            ====== ====== ======     Income Taxes. Income taxes decreased by $370,000 from $2.6 million in 1996 to $2.2 million in 1997. The decrease in taxes is due to the lower net earnings before income taxes in 1997 compared to 1996 due to the one-time SAIF special assessment during fiscal 1997. Income taxes increased by $1.3 million from $1.3 million in 1995 to $2.6 million in 1996. The increase is due to the increase in earnings before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 43.86%, 41.89% and 35.31% for the years ended June 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in 1997 as compared to 1996 is primarily a result of the increase in the fair value of QCBC stock over the year. This resulted in the aforementioned increase in ESOP expense for financial statement purposes relative to the income tax deduction which is required to be taken at the cost basis of the shares released. The increase in the effective tax rate in 1995 as compared to 1996 is a result of a State of California tax benefit allowed for the Los Angeles Revitalization Zone.  FINANCIAL CONDITION    The Company's consolidated assets totaled $801.4 million at June 30, 1997, compared to $725.1 million at June 30, 1996. Stockholders' equity totaled $70.2 million at June 30, 1997 compared to $67.9 million June 30, 1996. The increase in assets is primarily attributable to the implementation of the Company's growth strategies funded by retail deposit promotions and FHLB advances.    Loans and MBS (including assets held or available for sale) increased to $719.7 million at June 30, 1997, from $651.7 million at June 30, 1996. Loans originated and purchased for investment decreased to $95.9 million for the year ended June 30, 1997, compared to $121.2 million for the same period the previous year. MBS purchased for investment increased to $40.2 million at June 30, 1997, from $13.8 million for the same period the previous year.    At June 30, 1997, the Company's multifamily loan portfolio totaled $302.0 million or 45.77% of total loans. Of the Company's $3.0 million of charge-offs in fiscal 1997, $2.2 million or 73.33% were for multifamily loans. See "Business--Allowances for Loan and Real Estate Losses." Multifamily loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk and to be more vulnerable to deteriorating economic conditions than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. These loans typically involve higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of such loans generally depend on the income produced by the operation or sale of the property being sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. Even though the southern California real estate market is showing signs of improvement, recessionary economic conditions of the type that have prevailed in recent years in                                        41   the Company's primary lending market area tend to result in higher vacancy and reduced rental rates and net operating incomes from multifamily properties.    Loan sales increased to $33.9 million for the year ended June 30, 1997, compared to $27.7 million for the same period ended June 30, 1996. The increase in loan sales is primarily a result of an increase in funding of fixed rate loans that were generally held for sale during this period. Loans serviced for others increased to $227.9 million at June 30, 1997 from $212.6 million at June 30, 1996 primarily due to the increase in fixed rate loans sold servicing retained.  CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY   Regulatory Capital Requirements    FIRREA and implementing OTS capital regulations require the Association to maintain certain minimum tangible, core and risk-based regulatory capital levels.    The following table summarizes the regulatory capital requirements for the Association at June 30, 1997. As indicated in the table, the Association's capital levels exceed all three of the currently applicable minimum capital requirements.

Under FDICIA, the OTS issued regulations establishing five separate capital categories: "well capitalized." "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized," and "critically undercapitalized," differentiated by core capital ratio, level of core capital to risk-weighted assets and risk-based capital ratio. See "Business--Regulation and Supervision--Prompt Corrective Action Requirements."    An institution is treated as "well capitalized" if its core capital ratio is at least 5%, its ratio of core capital to risk-based assets is at least 6% and its risk-based capital ratio is at least 10%. The following table summarizes the capital ratios of the "well capitalized" category and the Association's regulatory capital at June 30, 1997 as compared to such ratios. As indicated in the table, the Association's capital levels exceeded the three minimum capital ratios of the "well capitalized" category.

At June 30, 1997, a total of 118,750 shares had been repurchased at prices ranging from $13.40 to $17.125 per share. In 1996, 197,000 shares had been repurchased under a previous repurchase plan. The Company may complete the repurchase of shares over the next several months. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company announced a 25% common stock dividend paid to shareholders on May 30, 1997. The decrease in the Company's book value per share reflects the effect of the 25% stock dividend, partially offset by the reduced number of shares outstanding resulting from the stock repurchase program and the Company's earnings.   Sources of Funds and Liquidity    Sources of capital and liquidity for the Company include distributions from the Association and borrowings, such as repurchase transactions. Dividends and other capital distributions from the Association are subject to regulatory restrictions. See "Business--Regulation and Supervision--Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation--Payment of Dividends and Other Capital Distributions by Association" and "Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matter."    The Association's primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans, proceeds from the sale of loans and advances from the FHLB. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Although competition for deposits in the Southern California area is substantial, the Association experienced an increase in deposits in fiscal 1997. The Association also has other potential sources of liquidity, such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase and liquidating existing short-term assets.    The Association has continued to maintain the required minimum levels of liquid assets as defined by OTS regulations. This requirement, which may be varied at the direction of the OTS depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows, is based upon a percentage of deposits and short-term borrowings. The required ratio is currently 5%. The Association's average liquidity ratios were 5.18%, 5.37%, and 5.13%, at June 30, 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. Management currently attempts to maintain a liquidity ratio as close to the minimum as possible. Liquidity levels reflect management's strategy to invest excess liquidity in higher yielding interest- earning assets such as loans or mortgage-backed securities.    In the second quarter of fiscal 1997, the Association paid $3.1 million for the one-time special SAIF assessment charged to all thrifts during the fiscal year. The payment of this assessment did not have a significant impact on the liquidity and capital resources of the Association. See "Business--Regulation and Supervision--Deposit Insurance."    The Company's cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities consisted primarily of cash flows from the sale of loans held for sale which totaled $33.9 million, $27.7 million, and $10.3 million for fiscal 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. The Company originated loans for sale of $31.6 million, $28.9 million, and $12.2 million during fiscal years 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. Net cash used by investing activities consisted primarily of loan originations and investment purchases, offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from principal reductions on MBS and maturities of other investment securities. Loans originated and purchased for investment were $95.9 million, $121.2 million, and $118.8 million for fiscal 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. Proceeds from maturities and principal payments of investment securities were $8.8 million, $31.6 million, and $12.0 million for fiscal years ended 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. Net cash used by financing activities consisting primarily of net activity in deposit accounts and proceeds from                                        43   funding and repayments of FHLB advances. The net change in deposits was an increase of $40.7 million for fiscal 1997, and increase of $31.4 million for fiscal 1996, and an increase of $57.2 million for fiscal 1995. The net proceeds (repayments) from FHLB advances were $22.4 million, $71.4 million, and $51.0 million for fiscal 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.    Due to the Company's growth strategies in fiscal 1997, 1996, and 1995, the Company's use of FHLB advances increased. At June 30, 1997, the Company had $157.7 million in advances outstanding from the FHLB advances that the Company had outstanding at any month-end was $166.6 million. At June 30, 1997, the amount of additional credit available from the FHLB was $75.3 million. Management anticipates increased borrowing from the FHLB again in fiscal 1998. See "Business--Sources and Funds--Borrowings."    Liquidity levels were maintained in fiscal 1997 with a higher level of reliance on short-term borrowings. The Company's most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets are dependent on the Company's operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At June 30, 1997, cash and short-term investments totaled $20.4 million.    At June 30, 1997, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $9.9 million and commitments to purchase loans of $15.0 million. At June 30, 1997, the Company had $18.9 million of approved undisbursed lines of credit. The Company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination and purchase commitments. Certificates of deposits which have contractual maturities in one year or less from June 30, 1997, totaled $301.2 million. If a significant portion of the maturing certificates are not renewed at maturity, the Company's other sources of liquidity include FHLB advances and other borrowings, such as repurchase transactions. The Company could also choose to pay higher rates to maintain maturing deposits, which could result in increased cost of funds. Historically, the Company has maintained a significant portion of maturing deposits. While management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the current competitive rate environment, these are not expected to have a material impact on the long-term liquidity position of the Company.                                        44   MARKET RISK    Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The Company's market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities. To that end, management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure.    The Company's profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely impact the Company's earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent, or on the same basis. The Company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income using several tools. One measure of the Company's exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is shown in the Company's Maturity and Rate Sensitivity Analysis under the Asset/Liability Management caption. Another measure, required to be performed by OTS-regulated institutions, is the test specified by OTS Thrift Bulletin No. 13, "Interest Rate Risk Management." This test measures the impact on net interest income and on net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in 100 basis point increments. Net portfolio value is defined as the net present value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. Following are the estimated impacts of immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels at June 30, 1997, calculated in compliance with Thrift Bulletin No. 13:                                                   PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN:                                    ---------------------------------------------      CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES        (IN BASIS POINTS)           NET INTEREST INCOME(1) NET PORTFOLIO VALUE(2)      ------------------------      ---------------------- ----------------------                +400......................           -8%                   -45%         +300......................           -6                    -32         +200......................           -3                    -20         +100......................           -2                    -10         -100......................            2                      7         -200......................            0                     13         -300......................           -2                     18         -400......................           -4                     14  - -------- (1) The percentage change is this column represents net interest income for 12     months in a stable interest rate environment versus the Net Interest     Income in the various rate scenarios.  (2) The percentage change is this column represents net portfolio value of the     Association in a stable interest rate environment versus the net portfolio     value in the various rate scenarios.    The Company's primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the Company's net interest income and capital, while structuring the Company's asset-liability structure to obtain the maximum yield-cost spread on that structure. The Company relies primarily on its asset-liability structure to control interest rate risk.    The Company continually evaluates interest rate risk management opportunities, including the use of derivative financial instruments. Management believes that hedging instruments currently available are not cost- effective, and therefore, has focused its efforts on increasing the Company's yield-cost spread through wholesale and retail growth opportunities.                                        45     The following table shows the Company's financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, categorized by expected maturity, and the instruments' fair values at June 30, 1997. Market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as on- and off-balance sheet derivatives and other financial instruments.

(2) Total balance equals the notional amount of off-balance sheet items and     interest rates are the weighted average interest rates of the underlying     loans.    Expected maturities are contractual maturities adjusted for prepayments of principal. The Company uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities. For assets, expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity, projected repayments and prepayments of principal. The prepayment experience reflected herein is based on the Company's historical experience. The Company's average Constant Prepayment Rate ("CPR") on its total fixed-rate portfolio is 10%, and 6% on its adjustable-rate portfolio for interest-earning assets (excluding investment securities, which do not have prepayment features). For deposit liabilities, in accordance with standard industry practice and the Company's own historical experience, "decay factors," used to                                        46   estimate deposit runoff of 12.5%, 8.8%, and between 8% and 100% for passbook, checking and money market deposit accounts, respectively. The actual maturities of these instruments could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from the Company's historical experience.  ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT    The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are "interest rate sensitive" and by monitoring an institution's interest-rate sensitivity "gap." An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest- earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets. During a period of falling interest rates therefore, the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap theoretically may be adversely affected due to its interest-earning assets repricing to a greater extent than its interest- bearing liabilities. Conversely, during a period of rising interest rates, theoretically, the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap position may increase as it is able to invest in higher yielding interest-earning assets at a more rapid rate than its interest-bearing liabilities reprice. In addition, a positive gap may not protect an institution with a large portfolio of ARM loans from increases in interest rates for extended time periods as such instruments generally have periodic and lifetime interest rate caps. Additionally, the Company's ARM loans are predominantly tied to COFI, a lagging market index, and rapid increases in interest rates could have a negative impact on the Company's earnings. Accordingly, interest rates and the resulting cost of funds increases in a rapidly increasing rate environment could exceed the cap levels on these instruments and negatively impact net interest income. Declining interest rates have, in general, benefited the Company primarily due to the effect of the lagging market index which has resulted in interest income declining at a slower rate than interest expense. This effect of the lagging index has been partially offset by the increase in refinancings of portfolio loans to lower yielding loans.    The Company has managed its interest rate risk through the aggressive marketing and funding of ARM loans, which generally reprice at least semi- annually and are generally indexed to COFI. As a result of this strategy, and based upon the assumptions used in the table set forth below, at June 30, 1997, the Company's total interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within one year exceeded its total interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing in the same time by $147.0 million, representing a one year cumulative positive gap ratio of 18.35%. This compares to $50.1 million at June 30, 1996, which represented a positive GAP ratio of 6.91%. In the third quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company ceased its origination of COFI ARM multifamily and commercial loan origination. New multifamily and commercial loan originations are tied to a treasury based index or are fixed rate for 5 years then adjusted to a new 5 year fixed rate also based upon a treasury index.    The Company closely monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies. The Association's Board of Directors has established an Asset/Liability Committee, responsible for reviewing its asset/liability policies and interest rate risk position, which generally meets weekly and reports to the Board of Directors on interest rate risk and trends on a quarterly basis. The Company's cumulative gap position is at a level satisfactory to management. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to maintain its positive gap position or that its strategies will not result in a negative gap position in the future. The level of the movement of interest rates, up or down, is an uncertainty and could have a negative impact on the earnings of the Company.    The Company does not currently engage in the use of trading activities, high risk derivatives and synthetic instruments or hedging activities in controlling its interest rate risk. Such uses are permitted                                        47   at the recommendation of the Asset/Liability Committee with the approval of the Board of Directors, however, the Company does not anticipate engaging in such practices in the immediate future.    The following table sets forth the amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at June 30, 1997, which are anticipated by the Company, based upon certain assumptions, to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability. Additionally, the Company utilized deposit decay rate assumptions of 12.5% for passbook accounts, 8.8% for checking accounts and 8% to 100% for money market deposit accounts in the one year or less category. The range of decay rates for money market deposit accounts is due to the market rate sensitivity of various money market checking accounts. These decay rates are based upon the Company's historical experience, but there is no assurance that the assumed rates will correspond to future rates.

For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as ARM loans, have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their ARM loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase.  AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET    The following table sets forth certain information relating to the Company for the years ended June 30, 1997, 1996, and 1995. The yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown except where noted otherwise. Average balances are derived from average month-end balances. Management does not believe that the use of average monthly balances instead of average daily balances has caused any material differences in the information presented. The average balance of loans receivable includes loans on which the Company has discontinued accruing interest. The yields and costs include fees which are considered adjustments to yields.                                        50                                                                        YEAR

IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES    The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the Company's operations. Unlike industrial companies, nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company's performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services. See "--Asset/Liability Management."  IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS    In February 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share". SFAS No. 128 provides reporting standards for basic and diluted earnings per share and is effective for financial statement                                        52   periods ending after December 15, 1997. Earlier application is not permitted. Had the Company applied SFAS No. 128 to the accompanying financial statements, basic earnings per share would have been $0.64, $0.77 and $0.50, and diluted earnings per share would have been $0.61, $0.74 and $0.48 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.    In February 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 129, "Disclosure of Information about Capital Structure". This statement was issued in connection with SFAS No. 128 and lists the required disclosures about capital structure that had been included in a number of previously existing separate statements and opinions. The guidance relative to SFAS No. 129 is applicable to both public and non-public entities. SFAS No. 129 is effective for financial statements for periods ending after December 15, 1997. Implementation of SFAS No. 129 will not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.    In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income". Comprehensive income represents the change in equity of the Company during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non- owner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements. SFAS No. 130 requires all components of comprehensive income, which are required to be recognized under accounting standards, be reported in a financial statement that is displayed in equal prominence with the other financial statements. SFAS No. 130 does not require a specific presentation format, but will require the Company to display an amount representing total comprehensive income for the period in the financial statements. SFAS No. 130 is effective for both interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 1997. Implementation of SFAS No. 130 will not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.    In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information". SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for the way public business enterprises are to report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires those enterprises to report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major customers. SFAS No. 131 supercedes numerous requirements in a previously issued statement--SFAS No. 14, "Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise"--but retains the requirement to report information about major customers. SFAS No. 131 is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after December 15, 1997. Implementation of SFAS No. 131 will not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.                                        53   ITEM 8.
