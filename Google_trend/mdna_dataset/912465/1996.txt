ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GENERAL    For the year ended June 30, 1996, the Company reported net earnings of $3.6 million, $0.92 per share. This compares to net earnings of $2.3 million, $0.60 per share for the year ended June 30, 1995. The Company had total consolidated assets of $725.1 million, total deposits of $512.5 million and stockholders' equity of $67.9 million, representing 9.37% of total assets. This compares to total consolidated assets of $641.2 million, total deposits of $481.2 and stockholders' equity of $66.4 million at June 30, 1995. This represents a 13.09% increase in assets during the 1996 fiscal year.    The Southern California economy and real estate markets in the Association's primary lending area continued to remain weak during 1996, however, the Association's level of non-performing assets declined from June 30, 1995. The Association currently includes nonaccruing loans, troubled debt restructured loans and REO in determining its level of non-performing assets. At June 30, 1996, the Company reported $14.9 million in non-performing assets in the Association's portfolio compared to $16.9 million and $22.2 million at June 30, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The Association recorded provisions for loan losses of $2.1 million for the year ended June 30, 1996 compared to $998,000 and $10.2 million for the years ended June 30, 1995 and 1994, respectively. See "Business--Allowances for Loan and Real Estate Losses" and "--Results of Operations--Provision for Loan Losses," below.  PROBLEM ASSETS    Even though non-performing assets declined during the year, recognition, control, and disposition of problem assets (non-performing loans and REO) continues to be a primary objective of the Association. The Association's ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 2.00%, 2.67%, and 4.22% at June 30, 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively. The Association attributes the decrease in its non-performing loans primarily to the disposition of real estate acquired through foreclosure including some real estate properties damaged in the Northridge earthquake in January 1994. However, the Association's primary lending area, Southern California, continues to experience weak real estate values that may cause an increase in nonperforming assets and a corresponding increase in provisions for loan losses in the future.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    General. The Company reported net earnings of $3.6 million for the year ended June 30, 1996, compared to net earnings of $2.3 million for the year ended June 30, 1995 and a net loss of $2.3 million for the year ended June 30, 1994. The increase in earnings for fiscal 1996 was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income before provision for loan losses. The increase in earnings in fiscal 1995 over 1994 was primarily due to a reduction in provision for loan losses of $9.2 million in 1995 from the amount recorded in 1994.    Interest Income. Interest income was $52.6 million, $41.0 million and $35.3 million for the years ended June 30, 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively. The $11.6 million increase in interest income in 1996 compared to 1995 resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $90.9 million and an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets of 0.77% to 7.94%. The $5.8 million increase in interest income in 1995 compared to 1994 resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest- earning assets of $85.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on interest-earning assets of 0.08% to 7.18%.    Interest Expense. Interest expense was $31.2 million, $23.5 million, and $17.5 million for the years ended June 30, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The $7.7 million increase in 1996 compared to 1995 resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of $83.1 million                                        41   and an increase in the average cost on interest-bearing liabilities of 0.65% to 5.26%. The $6.0 million increase in 1995 compared to 1994 resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $78.7 million, as well as an increase in the average cost on interest-bearing liabilities of 0.56% to 4.61%. The increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities in fiscal 1996 and 1995 resulted primarily from increasing market rates during the period.    Net Interest Income Before Provision for Loan Losses. Net interest income before provision for loan losses was $21.5 million, $17.5 million, and $17.8 million for the years ended June 30, 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively. The increase in 1996 compared to 1995 was primarily a result of the net interest margin increasing to 3.24% from 3.07% during the year. Net interest income before provision for loan losses remained relatively unchanged in 1995 as compared to 1994. Although there was a decline in net interest margin in 1995 as compared to 1994 this was offset by asset growth.    Provision for Loan Losses. During 1996, 1995, and 1994 the Association established $2.1 million, $998,000, and $10.2 million, respectively, of provisions for losses on loans. Management believes the increase of $1.1 million in 1996 compared to 1995 was necessary in order to replenish the allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes to be adequate following increased charge-offs during 1996 compared to 1995 and 1994. The decrease of $9.2 million in 1995 compared to 1994 was primarily a result of the reduction in nonperforming assets. Non-performing loans decreased $5.1 million to $14.9 million during fiscal 1995. In 1994, the Association was only beginning to acquire title or resolve properties damaged in the January 1994 Northridge earthquake. As of the end of fiscal 1995, the Association had either acquired title to all of the earthquake affected properties or entered into workout agreements allowing the owners of the remaining damaged property to make partial payments. The $10.2 million provision for loan losses in 1994 reflected management's assessment of the loan portfolio in consideration of various factors, including the trends in the Association's nonperforming assets during that time, continued declines in the Southern California economy and the real estate markets in the Association's primary lending area, the Northridge earthquake and the regulatory environment. Management considers the level of non-performing assets, the regional economic conditions and relevant real estate values and other factors when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss. The Southern California economy and real estate markets in the Association's primary lending area remained weak during 1996 although management considers the level of allowance for loan losses at June 30, 1996 to be adequate. There can be no assurance that the Association will not have to establish additional loss provisions in the future.    Other Income. Other income increased by $409,000, or 19.66%, in 1996 to $2.5 million as compared to 1995. Fee income for deposits and loans serviced increased due to a larger loan and deposit base. In addition, commissions from the sale on noninsured deposit products increased due to improved sales volumes. Other income declined by $776,000, or 27.17%, in 1995 to $2.1 million as compared to 1994 primarily as a result of a reduced volume of loans originated and sold.    Other Expense. Other expense increased $706,000, or 4.70%, from $15.0 million in 1995 to $15.7 million in 1996. Compensation and employee benefits increased $194,000 or 2.63% in 1996 as compared to 1995 due to increases in salaries and accounting for the ESOP plan. FDIC insurance increased $139,000 in 1996 compared to the previous year due to an increase in the deposit balances that the insurance premium is based upon. Other general and administrative expense increased $287,000 primarily relating to data processing due to the Association converting to new deposit software and hardware, and increased consulting costs relating to these changes.                                         42     The following is a summary of other general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended:                                                                     JUNE 30,                                                            --------------------                                                             1996   1995   1994                                                            ------ ------ ------                                                               (IN THOUSANDS)                Professional fees................................... $  219 $  215 $  421       Data processing.....................................    641    561    591       Advertising and promotional.........................    513    464    396       Bank service charges................................    380    375    349       Miscellaneous loan expenses.........................    630    660    449       Consulting fees.....................................    350    250    252       Other...............................................  1,258  1,179  1,219                                                            ------ ------ ------                                                            $3,991 $3,704 $3,677                                                            ====== ====== ======     Income Taxes (Benefit). Income taxes increased by $1.3 million from $1.3 million in 1995 to $2.6 million in 1996. Income taxes increased by $2.9 million from a $1.6 million benefit in 1994 to a $1.3 million expense in 1995. The increases are due to the increase in earnings before income taxes.  FINANCIAL CONDITION    The Company's consolidated assets totaled $725.1 million at June 30, 1996, compared to $641.2 million at June 30, 1995. Stockholders' equity totaled $67.9 million at June 30, 1996, compared to $66.4 million June 30, 1995. The increase in assets is primarily attributable to the implementation of the Company's growth strategies funded by deposit promotions and FHLB advances.    Loans and MBS (including assets held or available for sale) increased to $651.7 million at June 30, 1996, from $579.1 million at June 30, 1995. Loans originated and purchased for investment increased slightly to $121.2 million for the year ended June 30, 1996 compared to $118.8 million for the same period the previous year.    At June 30, 1996, the Association's multifamily loan portfolio totaled $259.0 million, or 41.45% of total loans. Of the Association's $6.2 million of charge-offs in fiscal 1996, $4.4 million, or 70.71%, were for multifamily loans. See "Business--Allowances for Loan and Real Estate Losses." Multifamily loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk and to be more vulnerable to deteriorating economic conditions than one- to four- family residential mortgage loans. These loans typically involve higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of such loans generally depend on the income produced by the operation or sale of the property being sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. Recessionary economic conditions of the type that have prevailed in the Company's primary lending market area tend to result in higher vacancy and reduced rental rates and net operating incomes from multifamily residential properties.    Loan sales increased to $27.7 million for the year ended June 30, 1996, compared to $10.3 million for the same period ended June 30, 1995. The increase in loan sales is primarily a result of an increase in funding of fixed-rate loans that were generally held for sale during this period. Loans serviced for others increased slightly to $212.6 million at June 30, 1996 from $204.7 million at June 30, 1995 primarily due to the increase in fixed rate loans sold with servicing retained.                                         43   CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY   Regulatory Capital Requirements    FIRREA and implementing OTS capital regulations require the Association to maintain certain minimum tangible, core and risk-based regulatory capital levels.    The following table summarizes the regulatory capital requirements for the Association at June 30, 1996. As indicated in the table, the Association's capital levels exceed all three of the currently applicable minimum capital requirements.

Under FDICIA, the OTS issued regulations establishing five separate capital categories: "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized,", "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" and "critically undercapitalized," differentiated by core capital ratio, level of core capital to risk-weighted assets and risk-based capital ratio. See "Business--Regulation and Supervision--Prompt Corrective Action Requirements."    An institution is treated as well capitalized if its core capital ratio is at least 5%, its ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 6% and its risk-based capital ratio is at least 10%. The following table summarizes the capital ratios of the well capitalized category and the Association's regulatory capital at June 30, 1996 as compared to such ratios. As indicated in the table, the Association's capital levels exceeded the three minimum capital ratios of the well capitalized category.

At June 30, 1996, a total of 164,000 shares had been repurchased at prices ranging from $12.90 to $14.60 per share. For the year ended December 31, 1995, 206,400 shares had been repurchased under a previous repurchase plan. The Company may resume repurchasing shares shortly and complete the repurchase over the next several months. The increase in the Company's book value per share reflects both the Company's earnings and the reduced number of shares outstanding resulting from the stock repurchase program.                                        44    Sources of Funds and Liquidity    The Association's primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans, proceeds from the sale of loans and advances from the FHLB. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Although competition for deposits in the Southern California area is substantial, the Association experienced an increase in deposits. The Association also has other potential sources of liquidity, such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase and liquidating existing short-term assets.    The Association has continued to maintain the required minimum levels of liquid assets as defined by OTS regulations. This requirement, which may be varied at the direction of the OTS depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows, is based upon a percentage of deposits and short-term borrowings. The required ratio is currently 5%. The Association's average liquidity ratios were 5.37%, 5.13% and 5.15% at June 30, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Management currently attempts to maintain a liquidity ratio as close to the minimum as possible. Liquidity levels reflect management's strategy to invest excess liquidity in higher yielding interest-earning assets such as loans.    The Company's cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities consisted primarily of cash flows from the sale of loans held for sale which totaled $27.7 million, $10.3 million, and $54.9 million for fiscal 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively. The Association originated loans for sale of $28.9 million, $12.2 million, and $47.6 million during fiscal years 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively. Net cash used by investing activities consisted primarily of loan originations and investment purchases, offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from principal reductions on MBS and maturities of other investment securities. Loans originated and purchased for investment were $121.2 million, $118.8 million, and $112.2 million for fiscal 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively. Proceeds from maturities and principal payments of investment securities and sales of MBS available for sale were $33.4 million, $12.0 million, and $11.0 million for fiscal years ended 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively. Net cash used by financing activities consisting primarily of net activity in deposit accounts and proceeds from funding and repayments of FHLB advances. The net change in deposits was an increase of $31.4 million for fiscal 1996, an increase of $57.2 million for fiscal 1995, and a decrease of $12.4 million for fiscal 1994. The net proceeds from FHLB advances were $71.4 million, $51.0 million, and $11.0 million for fiscal 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.    The major variances in the statements of cash flows for fiscal 1996, 1995, and 1994 included in this report can be explained largely by the change in the Association's liquidity management activities. See "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Due to the Association's growth strategies in fiscal 1996 and 1995, the Association's use of FHLB advances increased. In fiscal 1994, the Association's use of FHLB advances increased due to a decrease in deposits. At June 30, 1996, the Association had $135.3 million in advances outstanding from the FHLB. During fiscal 1996, the maximum amount of FHLB advances that the Association had outstanding at any month-end was $135.3 million. Management anticipates increased borrowing from the FHLB in fiscal 1997. See "Business--Sources and Funds--Borrowings."    Liquidity levels were maintained in fiscal 1996 with a higher level of reliance on short-term borrowings. The Association's most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets are dependent on the Association's operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At June 30, 1996, cash and short-term investments totaled $13.6 million.    At June 30, 1996, the Association had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $26.7 million. The Association anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination commitments. Certificates of deposit which are scheduled to mature in one year or less                                        45   from June 30, 1996, totaled $322.6 million. While management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity, due to the current competitive rate environment, these are not expected to have a material impact on the long-term liquidity position of the Association.    Other sources of capital and liquidity for the Company include distributions from the Association and borrowings, such as repurchase transactions. Dividends and other capital distributions from the Association are subject to regulatory restrictions. See "Business--Regulation and Supervision--Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation--Payment of Dividends and Other Capital Distributions by Association" and "Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters."  ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT    The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are "interest rate sensitive" and by monitoring an institution's interest-rate sensitivity "gap." An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest-rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest- earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest-rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest-rate sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest-rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest-rate sensitive assets. During a period of falling interest rates therefore, the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap theoretically may be adversely affected due to its interest-earning assets repricing to a greater extent than its interest- bearing liabilities. Conversely, during a period of rising interest rates, theoretically, the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap position may increase as it is able to invest in higher yielding interest-earning assets at a more rapid rate than its interest-bearing liabilities reprice. In addition, a positive gap may not protect an institution with a large portfolio of ARM loans from increases in interest rates for extended time periods as such instruments generally have periodic and lifetime interest rate caps. Additionally, the Association's ARM loans are predominantly tied to COFI, a lagging market index, and rapid increases in interest rates could have a negative impact on the Association's earnings. Accordingly, interest rates and the resulting cost of funds increases in a rapidly increasing rate environment could exceed the cap levels on these instruments and negatively impact net interest income. Declining interest rates have, in general, benefited the Association primarily due to the effect of the lagging market index which has resulted in the interest income declining at a slower rate than interest expense. This effect of the lagging index has been partially offset by the increase in refinancings of portfolio loans to lower yielding loans.    The Association has managed its interest-rate risk through the aggressive marketing and funding of adjustable rate loans, which generally reprice at least semi-annually and are generally indexed to COFI. As a result of this strategy, and based upon the assumptions used in the table set forth below, at June 30, 1996 the Association's total net interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within one year exceeded its total interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing in the same time by $50.1 million, representing a one year cumulative gap ratio of positive 6.91%. This compares to $154.3 million at June 30, 1995, which represented a positive GAP ratio of 24.06%. The decline in 1996 is primarily the result of the shortening time remaining to maturity on the Association's certificate accounts. At June 30, 1995 certificate accounts maturing in one year or less totaled $247.1 million compared to June 30, 1996 which totaled $348.0 million. The increase in certificates with terms to maturity of one year or less, is primarily a result of customers desire for shorter term certificates.    Furthermore, the Association moderately increased the level of short term borrowings during 1996. FHLB advances and borrowings with maturities of one year or less totalled $94.9 million at June 30,                                        46   1996 compared to $59.8 million at June 30, 1995. The Association closely monitors its interest-rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies. The Association's Board of Directors has established an Asset/Liability Committee, responsible for reviewing its asset/liability policies and interest-rate risk position, which generally meets weekly and reports to the Board of Directors on interest-rate risk and trends on a quarterly basis. The Association's cumulative gap position is at a level satisfactory to management. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to maintain its positive gap position or that its strategies will not result in a negative gap position in the future. The level of the movement of interest rates, up or down, is an uncertainty and could have a negative impact on the earnings of the Association.   The Association does not currently engage in the use of trading activities, high risk derivatives and synthetic instruments or hedging activities in controlling its interest-rate risk. Such uses are permitted at the recommendation of the Asset/Liability Committee with the approval of the Board of Directors; however, the Association does not intend to engage in such practices in the immediate future.    The following table sets forth the amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at June 30, 1996, which are anticipated by the Association, based upon certain assumptions, to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability. Specifically, the Association assumed a prepayment rate ranging from 6% to 18% on ARM loans, and 6% to 37% on fixed-rate loans. Additionally, the Association utilized deposit decay rate assumptions ranging from 14% to 17% for passbook accounts, 17% to 37% for checking accounts and 79% for money market deposit accounts in the one year or less category.

For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as ARM loans, have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their ARM loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase.  NET INTEREST INCOME    Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest- earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income also depends upon the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them.  AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET    The following table sets forth certain information relating to the Company for the years ended June 30, 1996, 1995 and 1994. The yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown except where noted otherwise. Average balances are derived from average month-end balances. Management does not believe that the use of average monthly balances instead of average daily balances has caused any material differences in the information presented. The average balance of loans receivable includes loans on which the Association has discontinued accruing interest. The yields and costs include fees which are considered adjustments to yields.                                         49                                                            YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,

IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES    The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the Association's operations. Unlike industrial companies, nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the Association are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Association's performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services. See "--Asset/Liability Management."                                        51   IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS    In November 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." This statement establishes financial accounting standards for stock-based employee compensation plans. SFAS No. 123 permits the Company to choose either a new fair-value-based method or the current APB Opinion 25 intrinsic valued-based method of accounting for its stock-based compensation arrangements with pro forma disclosures of net earnings and earnings per share computed as if the fair-value-based method had been applied. SFAS No. 123 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. It is not expected that SFAS No. 123 will have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.    In June 1996, the FASB issued SFAS 125, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities." This statement specifies when financial assets and liabilities are to be removed from an entity's financial statements, specifies the accounting for servicing assets and liabilities, and the accounting for assets that can be contractually prepaid in such a way that the holder would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment.    Under SFAS 125, an entity recognizes only assets it controls and liabilities it has incurred, derecognizes assets only when control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities only when they have been extinguished. SFAS 125 requires that the selling entity continue to carry retained interests, including servicing assets, in assets it has derecognized. Such retained interests are based on their relative fair values at the date of transfer. Transfers not meeting the criteria for sale recognition are accounted for as a secured borrowing with pledge of collateral. Under SFAS 125 certain collateralized borrowings may result in asset derecognition when the assets provided as collateral may be derecognized based on whether the secured party takes control over the collateral and whether the secured party is: (1) permitted to repledge or sell the collateral; and (2) the debtor does not have the right to redeem the collateral on short notice. Extinguishments of liabilities are recognized only when the debtor pays the creditor and is relieved of its obligation for the liability or when the debtor is legally released from being the primary obligor under the liability, either judicially, or by the creditor.    SFAS 125 requires an entity to recognize its obligation to service financial assets, that are retained in a transfer of assets, in the form of a servicing asset or liability. The servicing asset or liability is to be amortized in proportion to and over the period of net servicing income or loss. Servicing assets and liabilities are to be assessed for impairment based on their fair value.    SFAS 125 modifies the accounting for interest-only strips or retained interests in securitizations, such as capitalized servicing fees receivable, that can contractually be prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the holder would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment, to require their classification as available for sale or as trading securities. Interest-only strips and retained interests are to be recorded at market value. Changes in market value are included in stockholders' equity as unrealized holding gains or losses net of the related tax effect.    SFAS 125 is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after December 31, 1996, and is required to be applied prospectively. The Association enters into transactions covered by SFAS 125, including sales of securities under agreements to repurchase, collateralized borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank and others. The Association does not anticipate a material impact on transactions covered by SFAS 125.                                        52   ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
