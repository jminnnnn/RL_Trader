ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  General    At June 30, 2000 the Company had total assets of $1.2 billion, total deposits of $808.2 million and stockholders' equity of $88.0 million compared to total assets of $1.0 billion, total deposits of $677.8 million and stockholders' equity of $81.3 million at June 30, 1999. These changes represent a 18.60% increase in total assets and a 8.28% increase in stockholders' equity during fiscal 2000.    The southern California economy and real estate markets in the Company's lending area have remained strong during the year. The Company's level of nonperforming assets declined from June 30, 1999, both in total dollar amount and as a percentage of total assets. The Company currently includes nonaccrual loans 60 or more days past due (less any specific allowances on these loans), troubled debt restructured loans and REO in determining its level of nonperforming assets. At June 30, 2000, the Company reported $4.4 million in nonperforming assets compared to $7.5 million and $9.8 million at June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2000 compared to $1.7 million and $1.5 million for the years ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. See "Business--Allowances for Loan and Real Estate Losses."  Results of Operations    General. The Company reported net earnings of $11.8 million, $2.23 per share diluted, for the year ended June 30, 2000, compared to net earnings of $9.6 million, $1.70 per share diluted, and $6.6 million, $1.14 per share diluted, for the years ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. This increase in earnings for fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income partially offset by an increase in other expenses. Net earnings for fiscal 2000 also includes $400,000 of recaptured accrued taxes as a result of a favorable tax audit ruling. Without this tax recapture, net earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 would have been $11.4 million, $2.15 per share diluted, representing a 26% increase in earnings per share over the previous year. The increase in earnings in fiscal 1999 over 1998 was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income and an increase in noninterest income due primarily to the one-time gain on sale of securities, partially offset by an increase in total other expense.    Interest Income. Interest income was $84.5 million, $71.9 million and $64.9 million for the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. The $12.6 million increase in interest income in 2000 compared to 1999 resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $168.1 million while the average yield on interest-earnings assets decreased 0.08% to 7.87%. The $7.0 million increase in interest income in 1999 compared to 1998 resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $83.1 million while the average yield on interest earning assets increased 0.05 to 7.95%.    Interest Expense. Interest expense was $48.9 million, $40.3 million, and $39.1 million for the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. The $8.6 million increase in 2000 compared to 1999 resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $160.3 million and an increase in the average cost on interest-bearing liabilities of 0.07% to 5.04%. The $1.2 million increase in 1999 compared to 1998 resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $70.2 million and partially offset by a decrease in the average cost on interest-bearing liabilities of 0.32% to 4.97%.    Net Interest Income Before Provision for Loan Losses. Net interest income before provision for loan losses was $35.6 million, $31.6 million, and $25.8 million for the years ended June 30, 2000,                                        42   1999, and 1998, respectively. The increase in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily a result of the increase in interest-earning assets relative to interest-bearing liabilities during the year partially offset by the decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets and an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in 1999 compared to 1998 was primarily a result of the increase in interest-earning assets relative to interest-bearing liabilities, as well as a decrease in the cost of interest- bearing liabilities.    Provision for Loan Losses. During fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998 the Company established $1.6 million, $1.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of provisions for losses on loans. The slight decrease in the provision for 2000 is primarily a result of the continued decrease in nonperforming assets during the year. The slight increase in the provision for fiscal 1999 compared to 1998 was primarily a result of the overall growth in the loan portfolio as compared to the prior year, specifically in commercial real estate. In addition, certain one-to-four family loans purchased during fiscal 1999 were considered by the Company to have higher risk characteristics because they are loans outside of California, which has historically been considered the Company's primary market area for one-to-four family loans. Management considers the level of nonperforming assets, the regional economic conditions and relevant real estate values and other factors when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The southern California economy and real estate markets in the Company's primary lending area continued to be strong during fiscal 2000, and management considers the level of allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2000 to be adequate. However, even though the local economy and real estate markets were strong during fiscal 2000, there can be no assurance that nonperforming assets will not increase and that the Company will not have to establish additional loss provisions based upon future events.    Other Income. Other income increased slightly in 2000 to $4.7 million compared to $4.6 million in 1999. Deposit fees increased to $1.6 million for 2000 compared to $1.1 million for 1999, a 47.84% increase as a result of a continued program, that began in the second quarter of fiscal 1998, with efforts to attract checking accounts as well as a larger deposit base. In addition, other income for fiscal 1999 reflected gains on sale of securities of $616,000 compared to none in fiscal 2000. Other income increased by $1.3 million in fiscal 1999 as compared to fiscal 1998. This increase was due to the $616,000 gain on sale of securities as well as transactional fee income for deposits and loans increasing due to a larger deposit and loan base and prepayment fees on loans increased due to a higher level of loans paying off in order to refinance in the lower rate environment during that time period.    Other Expense. Other expense increased $1.2 million, or 6.62%, from $17.5 million in fiscal 1999 to $18.7 million in fiscal 2000. This increase in other expense is primarily due to an increase in compensation and employee benefits and occupancy expense. These increases during fiscal 2000 are primarily a result of three retail banking branches opened during the year and the purchase of a branch facility and its deposits from another financial institution. Included in compensation and employee benefits are expenses related to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP"). Companies that established an ESOP after 1992 are required to account for the expense of the ESOP at the fair value of the related shares released. The expense related to the ESOP was $1.0 million, $1.0 million, and $1.1 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.    Other expense increased $1.8 million, or 11.40%, from $15.7 million in fiscal 1998 to $17.5 million in fiscal 1999. The increase was primarily due to the opening of additional retail banking branches during February 1998, the relocation of an existing branch to a larger more accessible location in August 1998 and additional staffing in the income property lending department of the Company.                                        43     The following is a summary of other general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended:                                                                     June 30,                                                            --------------------                                                             2000   1999   1998                                                            ------ ------ ------                                                               (In thousands)             Professional fees...................................... $  290 $  246 $  260    Bank service charges...................................    324    305    234    Miscellaneous loan expenses............................    175    316    486    Other..................................................  1,811  1,397  1,159                                                            ------ ------ ------                                                            $2,600 $2,264 $2,139                                                            ====== ====== ======     Income Taxes. Income taxes increased by $865,000 from $7.5 million in fiscal 1999 to $8.3 million in fiscal 2000. Income taxes increased by $2.2 million from $5.3 million in fiscal 1998 to $7.5 million in fiscal 1999. The effective tax rate was 41.48%, 43.89% and 44.49% for the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2000 as compared to 1999 is primarily a result of a $400,000 recapture of accrued taxes due to a favorable tax audit ruling. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 1999 as compared to 1998 is primarily a result of ESOP expense as a percentage of net earnings before income taxes being lower in fiscal 1999 due to the increase in net earnings before income taxes.    Extraordinary Item and Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, the Company prepaid approximately $8.0 million of its higher cost borrowings and replaced the funds with less expensive borrowings and retail deposits. In association with the debt prepayment, the Company paid a prepayment fee of $61,000, after tax. The prepayment fee is disclosed as an extraordinary item on the statement of earnings. The Company implemented SFAS No. 133 effective July 1, 1998. Upon implementation, approximately $78.0 million in MBS were reclassified from held to maturity to available for sale. The Company has accounted for the gains or losses on the sale of any such reclassified MBS sold within 90 days of the reclassification date as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Any gains or losses recorded on such reclassified securities sold 90 days or more after the reclassification date have been recorded as gain or losses on sale of securities available for sale. In the first quarter of 1999, the Company sold $29.6 million of these reclassified MBS for a gain after tax of $162,000.  Financial Condition    The Company's consolidated assets totaled $1.2 billion at June 30, 2000, compared to $1.0 billion at June 30, 1999. Stockholders' equity totaled $88.0 million at June 30, 2000 compared to $81.3 million at June 30, 1999. The increase in assets is primarily attributable to the implementation of the Company's growth strategies and was primarily funded by deposit growth and FHLB advances.    Loans and MBS (including assets held or available for sale) increased to $1.1 billion at June 30, 2000, from $938.1 million at June 30, 1999. Loans originated and purchased for investment were $299.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2000, compared to $276.4 million for the same period the previous year. MBS purchased for investment decreased to $12.0 million at June 30, 2000, from $70.6 million for the same period the previous year.    At June 30, 2000, the Company's multifamily loan portfolio totaled $505.4 million, or 49.20% of total loans, an increase of 29.07% as compared to $391.6 million at June 30, 1999, and its commercial loan portfolio totaled $196.5 million, or 19.13% of total loans, an increase of 39.92% as compared to $140.4 million at June 30, 1999. Of the Company's $139,000 of charge-offs in fiscal 2000, $125,000 or 81.93% were for one-to-four family loans and none were multifamily or for commercial real estate loans. The Company's commercial loan portfolio increased significantly during the past fiscal year,                                        44   increasing by approximately 39.92%. Both because the size of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased significantly and most of the loans comprising the portfolio are unseasoned, having been originated within the last three fiscal years, the Company's past loss experience with respect to its commercial loan portfolio may not be representative of the risk of loss in such portfolio in the future. See "Business--Allowances for Loan and Real Estate Losses." Multifamily and commercial real estate loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk and to be more vulnerable to deteriorating economic conditions than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. These loans typically involve higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of such loans generally depend on the income produced by the operation or sale of the property being sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. Even though the southern California real estate market was healthy in fiscal 2000, recessionary economic conditions of the type that have prevailed in recent years in the Company's lending market area tend to result in higher vacancy and reduced rental rates and net operating incomes from multifamily and commercial real estate properties. See "Business--Lending Activities--Multifamily Lending" and "--Commercial Real Estate Lending."    Loan sales decreased to $48.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2000, compared to $64.0 million for the same period ended June 30, 1999. The decrease in loan sales is primarily a result of a decrease in funding of fixed-rate loans during a period of higher interest rates during fiscal 2000 compared to 1999. These fixed rate loans were generally held for sale during this period. Loans serviced for others increased to $299.1 million at June 30, 2000 from $284.2 million at June 30, 1999 primarily due to a lower rate of loan prepayments in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999.  Capital Resources and Liquidity   Regulatory Capital Requirements    FIRREA and implementing OTS capital regulations require the Bank to maintain certain minimum tangible, core and risk-based regulatory capital levels. The minimum core capital requirement is 4% for all but the highest rated savings associations. See "Business--Regulation and Supervision--Regulatory Capital Requirements."    The following table summarizes the regulatory capital requirements for the Bank at June 30, 2000. As indicated in the table, the Bank's capital levels exceed all three of the currently applicable minimum capital requirements.

Under FDICIA, the OTS issued regulations establishing five separate capital categories: "well capitalized." "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized," and "critically undercapitalized," differentiated by core capital ratio, level of core capital to risk-weighted assets and risk-based capital ratio. See "Business-- Regulation and Supervision--Prompt Corrective Action Requirements."    An institution is treated as "well capitalized" if its core capital ratio to adjusted total assets is at least 5%, its ratio of core capital to risk- weighted assets is at least 6% and its total capital to risk-                                        45   weighted assets ratio is at least 10%. The following table summarizes the capital ratios of the "well capitalized" category and the Bank's regulatory capital at June 30, 2000 as compared to such ratios. As indicated in the table, the Bank's capital levels exceeded the three minimum capital ratios of the "well capitalized" category.

Up to 270,000 additional shares could be repurchased in the future under current board authorization.   Sources of Funds and Liquidity    Sources of capital and liquidity for the Company on a stand-alone basis include distributions from the Bank. Dividends and other capital distributions from the Bank are subject to regulatory restrictions. See "Business-- Regulation and Supervision--Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation-- Payment of Dividends and Other Capital Distributions by Bank" and "Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters."    The Bank's primary sources of funds in fiscal 2000 were deposits, FHLB advances, principal and interest payments on loans and proceeds from the sale of loans. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The Bank also has other potential sources of liquidity, such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase and liquidating existing short-term assets.    The Bank has continued to maintain the required minimum levels of liquid assets as defined by OTS regulations. This requirement, which may be varied at the direction of the OTS depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows, is based upon a percentage of deposits and short-term borrowings. The required ratio is currently 4%. The Bank's average liquidity ratios were 4.33%, 4.49%, and 4.12%, at June 30, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Management currently attempts to maintain a liquidity ratio as close to the minimum as possible. Liquidity levels reflect management's strategy to invest excess liquidity in higher yielding interest-earning assets such as loans or MBS.    The Company's cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows used by investing activities and financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities consisted primarily of cash flows from the sale of loans held for sale which totaled $48.9 million, $64.0 million, and $34.3 million for fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. The Company originated loans for sale of $53.0 million, $73.7 million, and $41.3 million during fiscal years 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Net cash used by investing activities consisted primarily of loan originations, loan purchases and investment purchases, offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from principal reductions on MBS and maturities of other investment securities. Loans originated and purchased for investment were $299.2 million, $276.4 million, and $143.4 million for fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Proceeds from principal repayments on loans were                                        46   $127.3 million, $145.6 million and $91.8 million for fiscal years ended 2000, 1999, and 1998. Proceeds from maturities and principal payments of investment securities were $2.9 million, $9.1 million, and $31.6 million for fiscal years ended 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Net cash used by financing activities consisting primarily of net activity in deposit accounts and proceeds from funding and repayments of FHLB advances. The net change in deposits was an increase of $130.4 million, $96.9 million, and $27.7 million for fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. During the second quarter of fiscal 2000 the Bank purchased a retail branch office and its $45.9 million of deposits from another financial institution. This branch is located in Rowland Heights, California. The Bank also opened three "in-store" branches in Wal- Mart stores, the nation's largest retailer, during the second half of fiscal 2000. A fourth Wal-Mart in-store branch was opened in August 2000 with plans to open, at least, two additional Wal-Mart "in-store" branches later in fiscal 2001. All of the Bank's existing and planned Wal-Mart "in-store" branches are located in the southern California area. In addition, while the vast majority of the Bank's deposits are retail in nature, the Bank accepted $55 million in time deposits from a political subdivision during fiscal 2000. The Bank considers these funds to be wholesale deposits and an alternative borrowing source rather than a customer relationship and their levels are determined by management's decision as to the most economic funding sources. The net proceeds from FHLB advances were $55.6 million, $18.7 million, and $53.3 million for fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.    Due to the Company's growth strategies and increased competition for retail deposits in fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, the Company's use of FHLB advances increased. At June 30, 2000, the Company had $290.3 million (26.06% of total liabilities) in advances outstanding from the FHLB compared to $234.7 million (25.18% of total liabilities) at June 30, 1999. The maximum amount of advances that the Company had outstanding at any month-end was $312.1 million. Management anticipates increased borrowing from the FHLB again in fiscal 2001. See "Business--Sources and Funds--Borrowings."    The Company's most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets are dependent on the Company's operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At June 30, 2000, cash and short-term investments totaled $14.1 million, a decrease of 57.40% from $33.1 million at June 30, 1999.    At June 30, 2000, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $15.0 million and no commitments to purchase loans. At June 30, 2000, the Company had $25.5 million of approved undisbursed lines of credit. The Company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination and purchase commitments. Certificates of deposits which have contractual maturities in one year or less from June 30, 2000, totaled $511.2 million. If a significant portion of the maturing certificates are not renewed at maturity, the Company's other sources of liquidity include FHLB advances, principal and interest payments on loans, proceeds from loan sales and other borrowings, such as repurchase transactions. The Company could also choose to pay higher rates to maintain maturing deposits, which could result in increased cost of funds. Historically, the Company has maintained a significant portion of maturing deposits. While management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the current competitive rate environment, these are not expected to have a material impact on the long-term liquidity position of the Company.  Asset/Liability Management    The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are "interest rate sensitive" and by monitoring an institution's interest-rate sensitivity "gap." An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest- earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time                                        47   period and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets. During a period of falling interest rates therefore, the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap theoretically may be adversely affected due to its interest-earning assets repricing to a greater extent than its interest- bearing liabilities. Conversely, during a period of rising interest rates, theoretically, the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap position may increase as it is able to invest in higher yielding interest-earning assets at a more rapid rate than its interest-bearing liabilities reprice. In addition, a positive gap may not protect an institution with a large portfolio of ARM loans from increases in interest rates for extended time periods as such instruments generally have periodic and lifetime interest rate caps. Additionally, the Company's ARM loans are predominantly tied to COFI, a lagging market index, and rapid increases in interest rates could have a negative impact on the Company's earnings. Accordingly, interest rates and the resulting cost of funds increases in a rapidly increasing rate environment could exceed the cap levels on these instruments and negatively impact net interest income. Declining interest rates have, in general, benefited the Company primarily due to the effect of the lagging market index which has resulted in interest income declining at a slower rate than interest expense.    At June 30, 2000, the Company's total interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within one year exceeded its total interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing in the same time by $60.6 million, representing a one year cumulative positive gap ratio of 5.04%. This compares to $4.3 million at June 30, 1999, which represented a positive GAP ratio of 0.42%.  This increase in the one year cumulative GAP ratio is primarily a result of the following:     .  a significant amount of financing activity during the fiscal year in       adjustable rate loans.     .  The extension of the assumed repricing period of the Company's money       market deposit accounts. This is consistent with the Company's actual       experience with these accounts over the past fiscal year.  The Company manages the resulting interest rate risk by extending the maturities of various liabilities such as FHLB advances and retail certificates of deposit.    The Company closely monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies. The Bank's Board of Directors has established an Asset/Liability Committee, responsible for reviewing its asset/liability policies and interest rate risk position, which generally meets weekly and reports to the Board of Directors on interest rate risk and trends on a quarterly basis. The Company's cumulative gap position is at a level satisfactory to management. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to maintain its positive gap position or that its strategies will not result in a negative gap position in the future. The level of the movement of interest rates, up or down, is an uncertainty and could have a negative impact on the earnings of the Company.    The Company does not currently engage in the use of trading activities, high risk derivatives and synthetic instruments or hedging activities in controlling its interest rate risk. Such uses are permitted at the recommendation of the Asset/Liability Committee with the approval of the Board of Directors, however, the Company does not anticipate engaging in such practices in the immediate future.    The following table sets forth the amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at June 30, 2000, which are anticipated by the Company, based upon certain assumptions, to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability. Specifically, the Company assumed a prepayment rate ranging from 6% to 18% on ARM                                        48   loans, and 6% to 15% on fixed rate loans. Additionally, the Company utilized deposit decay rate assumptions of 50% for passbook accounts, 15.8% for checking accounts and 10% to 50% for money market deposit accounts in the one year or less category. The range of decay rates for money market deposit accounts is due to the market rate sensitivity of various money market checking accounts. These decay rates are based upon the Company's historical experience, but there is no assurance that the assumed rates will correspond to future rates.

For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as ARM loans, have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their ARM loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase.  Average Balance Sheet    The following table sets forth certain information relating to the Company for the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999, and 1998. The yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown except where noted otherwise. Average balances are derived from average month-end balances. Management does not believe that the use of average monthly balances instead of average daily balances has caused any material differences in the information presented. The average balance of loans receivable includes loans on which the Company has discontinued accruing interest. The yields and costs include fees which are considered adjustments to yields.                                        51                                                                        Year

The Company's Year 2000 program included the preparation of a plan and a contingency plan as required by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council as well as the testing and replacement of information technology assets ("IT assets"), such as computer hardware, software and systems, and non-IT assets.    As of the date of this report, the Company has experienced no material disruption in the operation of its business as a result of the transition from 1999 to 2000. However, it is possible that the full impact of Year 2000 issues has not been fully recognized, and no assurances can be given that Year 2000 problems will not emerge.    The total cost of the Company's Year 2000 program was approximately $1.5 million, including approximately $330,000 incurred in the year ended June 30, 2000. Program costs consisted primarily of costs for acquiring equipment and software, which are being depreciated over their useful lives, and personnel and consulting costs, which were expensed as incurred. The Company has funded these Year 2000 expenditures primarily through operating cash flow.                                        53   Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices    The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the Company's operations. Unlike industrial companies, nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company's performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services. See "Market Risk" and "--Asset/Liability Management."  Impact of New Accounting Standards    In March 2000, the FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation. This Interpretation clarifies certain issues relating to APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. FASB Interpretation No. 44 contains information relating to (a) the definition of employee for purposes of applying Opinion 25, (b) the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non-compensatory plan, (c) the accounting consequence of various modifications to the term of a previously fixed stock option or award, and (d) the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination. FASB Interpretation No. 44 is effective July 1, 2000. The effects of applying this Interpretation are recognized on a prospective basis from July 1, 2000.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The Company's market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities. To that end, management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure. The Company does not currently engage in trading activities.                                        54     The Company's profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely impact the Company's earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent, or on the same basis. The Company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income using several tools. One measure of the Company's exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is shown in the Company's Maturity and Rate Sensitivity Analysis under the caption "MD&A--Asset/Liability Management." Another measure, required to be performed by OTS-regulated institutions, is the test specified by OTS Thrift Bulletin No. 13a, "Interest Rate Risk Management." This test measures the impact on net interest income and on net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in 100 basis point increments. Net portfolio value is defined as the net present value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. Following are the estimated impacts of immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels at June 30, 2000, calculated in compliance with Thrift Bulletin No. 13a:                                                   Percentage Change In:                                    ---------------------------------------------      Change in Interest Rates        (In Basis Points)           Net Interest Income(1) Net Portfolio Value(2)      ------------------------      ---------------------- ----------------------                +300......................           -4%                   -44%         +200......................           -2                    -27         +100......................            0                    -11         -100......................            2                      4         -200......................            1                     12         -300......................            0                     11  - -------- (1) The percentage change in this column represents net interest income for 12     months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest     income in the various rate scenarios.  (2) The percentage change in this column represents net portfolio value of the     Bank in a stable interest rate environment versus the net portfolio value     in the various rate scenarios.    The Company's primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the Company's net interest income and capital, while structuring the Company's asset-liability structure to obtain the maximum yield-cost spread on that structure. The Company relies primarily on its asset-liability structure to control interest rate risk.    The Company continually evaluates interest rate risk management opportunities, including the use of derivative financial instruments. Management has focused its efforts on increasing the Company's yield-cost spread through wholesale and retail growth opportunities.                                        55     The following table shows the Company's financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, categorized by expected maturity, and the total balance of expected maturities and principal repayments and the instruments' fair values at June 30, 2000. Market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as on- and off-balance sheet derivatives and other financial instruments.

(2) Total balance equals the notional amount of off-balance sheet items and     interest rates are the weighted average interest rates of the underlying     loans.    Expected maturities are contractual maturities adjusted for prepayments of principal. The Company uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities. For assets, expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity, projected repayments and prepayments of principal. The prepayment experience reflected herein is based on the Company's historical experience. The Company's average Constant Prepayment Rate ("CPR") on its total fixed-rate portfolio ranges from 6% to 15% and on its adjustable rate portfolio from 6% to 18% for interest-earning assets (excluding investment securities, which do not have prepayment features). For deposit liabilities, in accordance with standard industry practice and the Company's own historical experience, "decay factors," were used to estimate deposit runoff of 50%, 15.8%, and between 10% to 50% for passbook, checking and money market deposit accounts, respectively. The actual maturities of these instruments could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from the Company's historical experience.                                        56   ITEM 8.
