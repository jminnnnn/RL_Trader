ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about us and our industry. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, as more fully described in the "Risk Factors" section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.  Overview       We design, develop, manufacture and market a wide range of analog and mixed-signal semiconductors for commercial and military applications. Our products are sold principally to customers in the computer, communications and industrial markets. Computer market applications include desktop computers, servers, workstations, laptop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and computer add-on cards. Products within the communications market include local area networks, wide area networks, cellular phones and base-stations. Industrial applications include automated test equipment (ATE), medical devices and factory automation systems. Our focus on these commercial applications over the past several years represents a substantial transition from our historical business, which was predominantly military and aerospace applications.       Sales to customers are made on the basis of individual customer purchase orders. Many large commercial customers, particularly in the personal computer industry, include terms in their purchase orders, which provide liberal cancellation provisions. Recent trends within the industry toward shorter lead- times and "just-in-time" deliveries have resulted in our reduced ability to predict future shipments. As a result, we expect the percentage of turns-fill business (orders received and shipped within the same quarter) to increase as a percentage of net sales.       One of our strategies is to expand our business through strategic acquisitions. Over the past five years, we have made several small acquisitions in order to increase our pool of skilled technical personnel and penetrate new market segments such as high performance, advanced communications, and human interface and system management devices. These acquisitions include: USAR Systems Incorporated; Practical Sciences, Inc.; Acapella Limited and Edge Semiconductor. The acquisitions of USAR, Acapella and Edge were accounted for as poolings of interests.       The results of operations described below give effect to our two-for-one stock splits in the form of 100 percent stock dividends that were paid on September 26, 2000 and September 14, 1999.   Market Update       The semiconductor and electronics industries have experienced very weak market conditions so far in calendar year 2001. Excess inventory levels and slowing end-market demand have adversely affected macro conditions within the semiconductor industry. Industry sources have forecasted that worldwide year- over-year sales of semiconductors                                         17   could be down as much as 20 percent in calendar year 2001. Many of our customers and competitors have forecasted their results will be down dramatically in calendar year 2001 in comparison to the prior year.       Consistent with these trends, we have revised our forecast as a result of weak demand from the communications infrastructure and ATE markets. We had received a limited amount of turns-filled-orders from the communications market during the first quarter, and had to cancel backlog for many communications customers. Additionally, a significant amount of backlog for the ATE market was rescheduled to reflect customers' revised forecasts. Finally, demand from the computer market was relatively stable. Ultimately, we believe our new product developments and strategic focus should allow us to remain well positioned within the marketplace.   Results of Operations       Fiscal Year 2001 Compared With Fiscal Year 2000       Net Sales. We generally recognized product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. Net sales for fiscal year 2001 were $256.7 million, compared to $173.8 million for fiscal year 2000, a 48 percent increase. This increase was due in part to favorable market conditions in the overall semiconductor industry and the growth in sales into the communications and industrial end market.       Gross Profit. Gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of sales. Our cost of sales includes materials, direct labor and overhead. Cost of inventory is determined by the first-in, first-out method. Gross profit for fiscal year 2001 was $144.9 million, compared to $91.0 million for the comparable period in the prior year, a 59 percent increase. Our gross margins (defined as gross profit as a percentage of net sales) are generally affected by price changes over the life of the products and the overall mix of products sold. Higher gross margins are generally expected from new products and improved production efficiencies as a result of increased utilization. Conversely, prices for existing products generally will continue to decrease over their respective life cycles. Our gross margin was 56 percent for fiscal year 2001. This compared to a gross margin of 52 percent for fiscal year 2000. The improvement is attributed to increased operating efficiencies associated with higher shipment levels, higher revenue contribution from products introduced in the last eighteen months, and a favorable shift in product mix toward higher margin product lines.       Operating Costs and Expenses. Operating costs and expenses generally consist of selling, general and administrative (SG&A), product development and engineering costs (R&D), costs associated with acquisitions, and other operating related charges. Operating costs and expenses were $68.2 million, or 27 percent of net sales, for fiscal year 2001. Operating costs and expenses for fiscal year 2000 were $48.1 million, or 28 percent of net sales. Operating costs and expenses, as a percentage of net sales, are lower for fiscal year 2001 than previous levels due to higher shipment rates and greater efficiencies.       SG&A expenses for fiscal year 2001 were $36.2 million, or 14 percent of net sales, compared to $27.2 million, or 16 percent of net sales for fiscal year 2000. The increase in expenditures was due primarily to the overall growth of our business, while the decrease in percentage of net sales reflects higher revenues and greater efficiencies.       R&D expenses were relatively consistent, as a percentage of net sales, at $32.0 million, or 12 percent of net sales in fiscal year 2001, up 57 percent from $20.3 million, or 12 percent of net sales in fiscal year 2000. We continue to invest heavily in areas deemed critical for developing and marketing new products, which are generally targeted at broadening our customer base, product lines and end-product applications.       Operating costs and expenses for fiscal year 2000 include one-time costs of $531,000 associated with the December 1999 acquisition of USAR Systems.       Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income of $9.3 million was realized in fiscal year 2001, up dramatically from interest and other income of $1.1 million in fiscal year 2000. Interest and other income in fiscal year 2001 is made up primarily of interest income. For fiscal year 2000, interest and other income and expenses was primarily interest income. The significant increase in interest and other income in fiscal year 2001 over the prior year was income attributable to cash provided by the February 2000 issuance of $400.0 million in convertible subordinated debentures. Interest income from investments made with the debenture proceeds far exceed the fixed interest expense paid to bond holders.                                         18        Provision for Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $25.8 million in fiscal year 2001, an effective tax rate of 30 percent. Provision for income taxes was $14.7 million in fiscal year 2000, an effective tax rate of 33 percent. The decline is due to increased sales through foreign-based subsidiaries that are in lower tax jurisdictions.  Fiscal Year 2000 Compared With Fiscal Year 1999       Net Sales. We generally recognized product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. Net sales for fiscal year 2000 were $173.8 million, compared to $114.5 million for fiscal year 1999, a 52 percent increase. This increase was due in part to favorable market conditions in the overall semiconductor industry and the growth in sales into the communications end market.       Gross Profit. Gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of sales. Our cost of sales includes materials, direct labor and overhead. Cost of inventory is determined by the first-in, first-out method. Gross profit for fiscal year 2000 was $91.0 million, compared to $54.3 million for the comparable period in the prior year, a 68 percent increase. Our gross margins (defined as gross profit as a percentage of net sales) are generally affected by price changes over the life of the products and the overall mix of products sold. Higher gross margins are generally expected from new products and improved production efficiencies as a result of increased utilization. Conversely, prices for existing products generally will continue to decrease over their respective life cycles. Our gross margin was 52 percent for fiscal year 2000. This compared to a gross margin of 47 percent for fiscal year 1999. The improvement is attributed to increased operating efficiencies associated with higher shipment levels, higher revenue contribution from products introduced in the last year, and a favorable shift in product mix toward higher margin product lines. Gross profit for fiscal year 1999 was adversely effected by one-time charges of $1.2 million for write-offs of discontinued inventory associated with restructuring our Corpus Christi facility.       Operating Costs and Expenses. Operating costs and expenses generally consist of selling, general and administrative (SG&A), product development and engineering costs (R&D), costs associated with acquisitions, and other operating related charges. Operating costs and expenses were $48.1 million, or 28 percent of net sales, for fiscal year 2000. Operating costs and expenses for fiscal year 1999 were $35.7 million, or 31 percent of net sales. Operating costs and expenses, as a percentage of net sales, are lower for fiscal year 2000 than previous levels due to higher shipment rates and greater efficiencies.       SG&A expenses for fiscal year 2000 were $27.2 million, or 16 percent of net sales, compared to $20.1 million, or 18 percent of net sales for fiscal year 1999. The increase in expenditures was due primarily to the overall growth of our business, while the decrease in percentage of net sales reflects higher revenue contributions from newer products. R&D expenses were relatively consistent at $20.3 million, or 12 percent of net sales, for fiscal year 2000, compared to $14.0 million, or 12 percent of net sales, for fiscal year 1999. We continue to invest heavily in areas deemed critical for developing and marketing new products, which are generally targeted at broadening our customer base, product lines and end-product applications.       Operating costs and expenses for fiscal year 2000 include one-time costs of $531,000 associated with the December 1999 acquisition of USAR Systems. Operating costs and expenses for fiscal year 1999 include one-time costs of $255,000 associated with the April 1998 acquisition of Acapella Limited. Additionally, a one-time restructuring charge of $1.3 million was taken in the same period in connection with the consolidation of manufacturing capacity and the write-down of impaired assets at our Corpus Christi, Texas facility.       Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income of $1.1 million was realized in fiscal year 2000. For fiscal year 1999, interest and other income was $786,000. Interest and other income for both periods is primarily interest income.       Provision for Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $14.7 million in fiscal year 2000, compared to $6.5 million in fiscal year 1999. The effective tax rate for fiscal years 2000 and 1999 remained constant at 33 percent.   Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)       The following tables set forth our unaudited consolidated statements of income data for each of the eight quarterly periods ended January 28, 2001, as well as that data expressed as a percentage of our net sales for the quarters presented.

Liquidity and Capital Resources       On February 14, 2000, we completed a private offering of $400.0 million principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures that pay interest semiannually at a rate of 4 1/2 percent and are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of $42.23 per share. The notes are due in seven years from the date of issuance and callable by the Company after three years. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, expansion of sales, marketing and customer service capabilities, and product development. In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products.       On January 28, 2001, we had working capital of $531.0 million, compared with $96.7 million at January 30, 2000. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities at January 28, 2001 was 16.3 to 1, compared to 5.1 to 1 at January 30, 2000. A majority of the increase was due to cash generated by the issuance of the convertible subordinated debentures.       Cash provided by operating activities was $86.0 million for the fiscal year 2001, compared to $36.6 million for fiscal year 2000. Net income for fiscal year 2001 was reduced by non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization                                         20   of $8.8 million. Net operating cash flows were favorably impacted by net income of $60.2 million compared to $29.4 million in the prior year. Net operating activities for fiscal year 2001 were positively impacted by an increase in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and the impact of the tax benefit from stock option exercises. These items were partially offset by increases in receivables, inventories, income taxes refundable, and other assets as well as a reduction in income taxes payable and other liabilities.       Investing activities used $212.4 million in fiscal year 2001 compared to $31.4 million in fiscal year 2000. Investing activities in fiscal year 2001 consists of increases in temporary investments, investments with maturities in excess of 1 year and capital expenditures of $130.5 million, $59.2 million and $22.7 million, respectively. Cash used in investing activities for the comparable prior year period reflects a $15.0 million addition to property, plant and equipment and $16.4 million increase in temporary investments.       Our financing activities provided positive cash flows of $404.5 million during fiscal year 2001 and used $1.0 million in the prior year. Financing activities for fiscal year 2001 reflect the proceeds, net of related fees, from the issuance of $400.0 million of convertible subordinated debentures, cash provided by stock option exercises, offset by the repurchase of treasury stock. Financing activities for the comparable prior year period represented cash from stock option exercises, cash used and proceeds from the repurchase and reissuance of treasury stock, and the cash effects of a pooling of interests.       We had a credit arrangement with a financial institution for borrowings up to $20.0 million at an interest rate of the 30 day commercial paper plus 2.2 percent. Our credit arrangement expired in August 2000, and we did not extend or renew this credit facility. Through our foreign subsidiary, we maintain an overdraft credit line in the amount of 300,000 pounds sterling. As of January 28, 2001, we had no borrowings outstanding under any credit facility.       In order to develop, design and manufacture new products, we had to make significant expenditures during the past five years. These investments aimed at developing new products, including the hiring of many design and applications engineers and related purchase of equipment, will continue. We fully intend to continue to invest in those areas that have shown potential for viable and profitable market opportunities. Certain of these expenditures, particularly the addition of design engineers, do not generate significant payback in the short- term. We plan to finance these expenditures with cash generated by operations and cash on-hand.       Purchases of new capital equipment were made primarily to improve internal computer systems and expand manufacturing capacity. Funding for these purchases was made from our operating cash flows and cash reserves. We have made significant investments in product and process technology. We believe that sales generating cash flows, together with the proceeds of the debt offering, cash reserves and existing credit facilities, are sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.   Inflation       Inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years. A significant increase in inflation would affect our future performance.   Recently Issued Accounting Standards       In June 1998 and June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative Investments and Hedging Activities," and SFAS No. 137, which delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 133. In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, which provides additional guidance for the application of SFAS No. 133 for certain transactions.  We will adopt the statement in fiscal year 2002 and do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.       In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," and as amended.  SAB 101 summarizes certain of the SEC's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. We have applied the provisions of SAB 101 in the consolidated financial statements. The adoption of SAB 101 did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.       In March 2000, the FASB issued interpretation No. 44 (FIN 44), "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25." FIN 44 clarifies the application of APB No. 25 for                                         21   certain issues, including the definition of an employee, the treatment of the acceleration of stock options and the accounting treatment for options assumed in business combinations. FIN 44 became effective on July 1, 2000, but is applicable for certain transactions dating back to December 1998. The adoption of FIN 44 did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.   FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS       In addition to historical information, this Form 10-K contains statements relating to our future results. These statements include certain projections and business trends which are "forward-looking" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this Form 10-K.

ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS            -----------------------------------------------------------  Foreign Currency Risk       As a global enterprise, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates.  Our foreign currency exposures may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon financial results.                                         22        Certain of our assets, including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable, exist in nondollar-denominated currencies, which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The nondollar-denominated currencies are principally German Deutschmarks, British Pounds Sterling and French Francs. Additionally, certain of our current and long-term liabilities are denominated principally in British Pounds Sterling currencies, which are also sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.       Because of the relatively small size of each individual currency exposure, we do not employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currency exposures. Likewise, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses.  Interest Rate Risk       As of January 28, 2001, we had $400.0 million in long-term debt outstanding at a fixed interest rate of 4 1/2 percent. We do not currently hedge any potential interest rate exposure.                                         23   ITEM 8.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
