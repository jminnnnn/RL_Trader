ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with "Selected Consolidated Financial Data" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the discussion in this Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements due to factors, including but not limited to, those set forth under "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We assume no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 10-K.   Overview  We design, produce and market a broad range of products that are sold principally to customers in the computer, communications and industrial markets. Our products are designed into a wide variety of end applications, including notebook and desktop computers, computer gaming systems, personal digital assistants (PDAs), cellular phones, wireline networks, wireless base stations and automated test equipment (ATE). Products within the communications market include products for local area networks, metro and wide area networks, cellular phones and base-stations. Industrial applications include ATE, medical devices and factory automation systems. Our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers, including Acer, Agilent, Cisco, Compaq, Dell, First International, IBM, Intel, Microstar, Motorola, Samsung and Sony.  We recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, receipt by the customer has been confirmed, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. Product design and engineering revenue is recognized during the period in which services are performed. We defer revenue recognition on shipment of certain products to distributors where return privileges exist until the products are sold through to end users. Gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of sales. Our cost of sales includes materials, direct labor and overhead. We determine the cost of inventory by the first-in, first-out method. Our operating costs and expenses generally consist of selling, general and administrative (SG&A), product development and engineering costs (R&D), costs associated with acquisitions, and other operating related charges.  Most of our sales to customers are made on the basis of individual customer purchase orders. Many large commercial customers include terms in their purchase orders which provide liberal cancellation provisions. Trends within the industry toward shorter lead-times and "just-in-time" deliveries have resulted in our reduced ability to predict future shipments. As a result we rely on orders received and shipped within the same quarter. Sales made directly to original equipment manufacturers during fiscal year 2002 were 70% of net sales. The remaining 30% of net sales were made through independent distributors.  We divide and operate our business based on three reportable segments: Standard Semiconductor Products, Rectifier and Assembly Products, and Other Products. We evaluate segment performance based on net sales and operating income of each segment. We do not track segment data or evaluate segment performance on additional financial information. As such, there are no separately identifiable segment assets nor are there any separately identifiable statements of income data (below operating income). The Standard Semiconductor Products segment makes up the vast majority of overall sales and includes our power management, protection, high-performance, advanced communications and human input/system management product lines. The Rectifier and Assembly Products segment includes our line of assembly and rectifier devices which are the remaining products from our original founding as a                                         17   supplier into the military and aerospace market. The Other Products segment is made up of other custom integrated circuit (IC) and foundry sales.  Our business involves reliance on foreign-based entities. Several of our outside subcontractors and suppliers, including third-party foundries that supply silicon wafers, are located in foreign countries, including China, Malaysia, the Philippines and Germany. For the fiscal year ended January 27, 2002, approximately 28% of our silicon was manufactured in China. During fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, foreign sales constituted 62%, 58%, and 64%, respectively, of our net sales. Approximately three-fourths of foreign sales are to customers located in the Asia-Pacific region. The remaining are to customers in Europe.  One of our strategies is to expand our business through strategic acquisitions. Over the past several years, we have made several small acquisitions in order to increase our pool of skilled technical personnel and penetrate new market segments, such as high performance, advanced communications and system management devices. These acquisitions include: USAR Systems Incorporated; Practical Sciences, Inc.; Acapella Limited; and Edge Semiconductor. The acquisitions of USAR, Acapella and Edge were accounted for as poolings of interests.   Results of Operations       Fiscal Year 2002 Compared With Fiscal Year 2001  Net Sales. Net sales for fiscal year 2002 were $191.2 million, a decline of 26% compared to $256.7 million for fiscal year 2001. Overall semiconductor industry conditions were very weak during fiscal year 2002, as were the end markets that we serve. The weakest end markets for fiscal year 2002 were the industrial market and the wireline portion of the communications market. Sales of our Standard Semiconductor Products segment shrank 24% in fiscal year 2002. Rectifier and Assembly Products' sales declined 26% and our Other Products segment declined 53% in fiscal year 2002.  Standard Semiconductor Products represented about 92% of net sales in fiscal year 2002. The decline in sales in this segment was due to both weak industry conditions and weak demand from customers. Only the power management product line within the Standard Semiconductor Products segment grew in the year, while all other product lines in the segment declined. The power management product line benefited from strength in computer and wireless applications. The largest absolute dollar declines in net sales within the segment were in our protection and high performance product lines. The protection product line was hurt by weakness in the wireline segment of the communications market and price declines in portable applications. High performance product line sales were impacted by a severe downturn in the ATE portion of the industrial market.  Sales of our Rectifier and Assembly Products segment declined due to weak industry conditions and a strategic focus on proprietary products. Other Products declined as a result of a strategic de-emphasis of custom and foundry services. We plan to eventually exit the custom and foundry product offerings.  In fiscal year 2001, favorable market conditions benefited all three of our reportable segments. The Standard Products segment was most benefited by a large increase in sales of our high performance and protection product lines. On an absolute dollar basis, these two product lines had the largest impact on our increase in net sales. Sales of these two product lines were benefited by strength in the communications end market and the test equipment area of the industrial end market. Our power management product line (also part of our Standard Products segment) sales' grew only slightly in fiscal year 2001 due in part to weak demand from computer related customers.  Gross Profit. Gross profit for fiscal year 2002 was $93.3 million, compared to $144.9 million for the prior year. This decrease was due to lower sales levels in all three of our reportable segments and one-time cost of $14.0 million for the write-down of inventory and discontinuation of certain products during the second quarter. Our gross margin was 49% for fiscal year ended January 27, 2002, compared to a gross margin of 56% for fiscal year ended January 28, 2001.  The write-down of inventory and discontinuation of certain products during the second quarter was the result of a critical review we conducted during that quarter. A severe industry downturn and a related drop in demand from end customers made certain inventories excess and obsolete, and certain product lines non-strategic. Of the $14.0 million write-down of inventory and discontinuation of certain products, $13.4 million was associated with the Standard Products segment, $400,000 with the Rectifier and Assembly Products segment and $150,000 with the Other Products segment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002, we recorded a one-time gain of $68,000 on the sale of inventory of the Standard Products segment that had been reserved during the second quarter.                                         18   Operating Costs and Expenses. Operating costs and expenses were $66.3 million, or 35% of net sales, for the fiscal year 2002. Operating costs and expenses for fiscal year 2001 were $68.2 million, or 27% of net sales. The decline in absolute dollars of operating costs and expenses was the result of cost cutting measures, which included headcount reductions and declines in variable expense items. Despite an absolute drop in operating costs and expenses, these costs went up as a percent of net sales due to the much lower revenue base.  Operating costs and expenses for fiscal year 2002 include one-time costs of $2.0 million associated with an approximate 200-person reduction in headcount made in the first half of the year and one-time costs of $765,000 associated with a pending Superfund settlement. As of January 27, 2002, $231,000 of the one-time headcount reduction costs have yet to be paid out in cash.  Operating Income. Operating income was $27.0 million in fiscal year 2002, down from operating income of $76.7 million in fiscal year 2001. Operating income was impacted by a 26% decline in net sales, a drop to 49% gross margin and one-time costs of $2.7 million related to headcount reductions and a pending Superfund settlement.  We evaluate segment performance based on net sales and operating income of each segment. Operating income for the Standard Semiconductor Products segment declined 64% in fiscal year 2002. Operating income in the Standard segment was benefited by an increase in power management product line sales and was most hurt by large declines in our protection and high performance product lines. In fiscal year 2001, the high performance product line had operating margins above our consolidate average.  Operating income for the Rectifier and Assembly Products segment increased by 11%, while the Other Products segment decreased 73% in fiscal year 2002. Rectifier and Assembly Products operating income improved due to higher gross margin and lower operating expenses associated with this segment. Other Products' operating margin reflected poor efficiencies associated with a lower sales level.  Operating income for the Standard Semiconductor Products segment in fiscal year 2001 was benefited by a significant increase in our protection and high performance product line sales, which had above corporate average operating margins. Operating income for the Rectifier and Assembly Products segment increased in fiscal year 2001 due to a shift in manufacturing to our lower-cost facility in Mexico and reduced overhead. Other Products operating income decreased due to lower gross margins and underutilized overhead.  Interest and Other Income. Net interest and other income of $6.8 million was realized in fiscal year 2002. For fiscal year 2001, interest and other income was $9.3 million. Other income and expenses is primarily interest income from investments and interest expense associated with our outstanding convertible subordinated notes. The decline in interest and other income in fiscal year 2002 was mostly due to lower rates of return on our investments as compared to the prior year.  Provision for Taxes. Provision for income taxes, excluding the tax effect of extraordinary gains, was $9.5 million for fiscal year ended January 27, 2002, compared to $25.8 million in the fiscal year ended January 28, 2001. The effective tax rate for fiscal years 2002 and 2001 were 28% and 30%, respectively. The decline is due to increased sales through foreign-based subsidiaries that are in lower tax jurisdictions.  Extraordinary Gain. For fiscal year 2002, we reported an extraordinary gain on extinguishment of debt, net of tax, in the amount of $1.6 million. The gross amount of the gain was $2.3 million and the associated tax was $639,000. The gain was a result of our repurchase of 35,680 of our $1,000 face value convertible subordinated notes below their stated par value. We had no extraordinary gain in the prior fiscal year.       Fiscal Year 2001 Compared With Fiscal Year 2000  Net Sales. Net sales for fiscal year 2001 were $256.7 million, compared to $173.8 million for fiscal year 2000, a 48% increase. This increase was due in part to favorable market conditions in the overall semiconductor industry and the growth in sales into the communications and industrial end market. Sales of our Standard Semiconductor Products segment grew 52% in fiscal year 2001. Rectifier and Assembly Products' sales increased 25% and our Other Products segment grew 7% in fiscal year 2001.  Standard Semiconductor Products represented about 91% of net sales in fiscal year 2001, while Rectifier and Assembly Products' sales were 6% and our Other Products were 3% of net sales. Favorable market conditions benefited all three of our reportable segments. The Standard Products segment was most benefited by a large increase in sales of our high performance and protection product lines. On an absolute dollar basis, these two product lines had the largest impact                                         19   on our increase in net sales. Sales of these two product lines were benefited by strength in the communications end market and the test equipment area of the industrial end market. Our power management product line (also part of our Standard Products segment) sales' grew only slightly in fiscal year 2001 due in part to weak demand from computer related customers.  Gross Profit. Gross profit for fiscal year 2001 was $144.9 million, compared to $91.0 million for the comparable period in the prior year, a 59% increase. Our gross margin was 56% for fiscal year 2001. This compared to a gross margin of 52% for fiscal year 2000. The improvement is attributed to increased operating efficiencies associated with higher shipment levels, higher revenue contribution from products introduced in the eighteen months ending prior to the end of the period, and a favorable shift in product mix toward higher margin product lines.  Operating Costs and Expenses. Operating costs and expenses were $68.2 million, or 27% of net sales, for fiscal year 2001. Operating costs and expenses for fiscal year 2000 were $48.1 million, or 28% of net sales. Operating costs and expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were lower for fiscal year 2001 than previous levels due to higher shipment rates and greater efficiencies.  Operating costs and expenses for fiscal year 2000 include one-time costs of $531,000 associated with the December 1999 acquisition of USAR Systems.  Operating Income. Operating income was $76.7 million in fiscal year 2001, up from operating income of $43.0 million in fiscal year 2000. Operating income was impacted by a 48% increase in net sales and an increase to 56% gross margin from 52% in the prior year. Fiscal year 2000 operating income was impacted by a one-time acquisition cost of $531,000.  Operating income for the Standard Semiconductor Products segment in fiscal year 2001 was $71.2 million, an increase of 71% over the prior fiscal year. Operating income in the Standard segment was benefited by a significant increase in our protection and high performance product line sales, which had above our consolidated average operating margins.  Operating income for the Rectifier and Assembly Products increased to $3.4 million in fiscal year 2001, up 353% from 745,000 in fiscal year 2000. The increase was largely due to a shift in manufacturing to our lower-cost facility in Mexico and reduced overhead. Other Products operating income was $2.1 million in fiscal year 2001, up from $1.1 million in the prior year, as a result of better overhead utilization and reduced costs associated with this segment.  Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income of $9.3 million was realized in fiscal year 2001, up significantly from interest and other income of $1.1 million in fiscal year 2000. Interest and other income in fiscal year 2001 is comprised primarily of interest income. For fiscal year 2000, interest and other income and expense was primarily interest income. The significant increase in interest and other income in fiscal year 2001 over the prior year was income attributable to cash provided by the February 2000 issuance of $400.0 million of our convertible subordinated notes. Interest income from investments made with these proceeds exceeded the fixed interest expense paid to bond holders.  Provision for Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $25.8 million in fiscal year 2001, an effective tax rate of 30%. Provision for income taxes was $14.7 million in fiscal year 2000, an effective tax rate of 33%. The decline is due to increased sales through foreign-based subsidiaries that are in lower tax jurisdictions.

We do not track segment data or evaluate segment performance on additional financial information. As such, there are no separately identifiable segment assets and liabilities.  On February 14, 2000, we completed a private offering of $400.0 million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes that bear interest at the rate of 4-1/2% per annum and are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of $42.23 per share. The notes are due in 2007 and redeemable in 2003. We have used the net proceeds of the notes offering, in part, for general corporate purposes, including working capital, expansion of sales, marketing and customer service capabilities, and product development. In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from the notes offering to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products.  As of January 27, 2002, we had working capital of $403.0 million, compared with $530.7 million as of January 28, 2001. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities as of January 27, 2002 was 15.8 to 1, compared to 16.2 to 1 as of January 28, 2001. The drop in working capital as of January 27, 2002 was mostly the result of an increase in investments with maturities greater than one year.  Cash provided by operating activities was $64.7 million for fiscal year 2002, compared to $86.0 million for fiscal year 2001. Net income for fiscal year 2002 was reduced by non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of $10.3 million. Net operating cash flows were positively impacted by net income of $26.0 million and by a decrease in                                         21   receivables and inventories, tax benefit from stock option exercises, income taxes payable and other assets. These were partially offset by increases in deferred income taxes, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and other liabilities.  Investing activities used $305.7 million for fiscal year 2002 compared to $212.4 million used in fiscal year 2001. Investing activities for both periods consists of increases in temporary investments, purchases of long-term investments, and capital expenditures. Investing activities for fiscal year 2002 included proceeds of $731,000 from the sale of assets.  Our financing activities used $36.2 million during fiscal year 2002 and added $404.5 million in the prior year. Financing activities for fiscal year 2002 reflect the proceeds from stock option exercises, which were more than offset by cash used to repurchase common stock and long-term debt. Financing activities for fiscal year 2001 reflect the proceeds, net of related fees, from the issuance of $400.0 million of convertible subordinated notes and cash provided by stock option exercises and other long term financing items.  We do not have any off balance sheet financing activities and do not have any special purpose entities. As of January 27, 2002, we have approximately $8.2 million in operating lease commitments that extend over a six year period. The portion of these operating lease payments due during the coming fiscal year is less than $1.8 million. As of January 27, 2002, we had no borrowings outstanding under any credit facility.

These investments aimed at developing new products, including the hiring of many design and applications engineers and related purchase of equipment, will continue. We intend to continue to invest in those areas that have shown potential for viable and profitable market opportunities. Certain of these expenditures, particularly the addition of design engineers, do not generate significant payback in the short-term. We plan to finance these expenditures with cash generated by operations and investments.  Purchases of new capital equipment were made primarily to improve internal computer systems and expand manufacturing capacity. Funding for these purchases was made from our operating cash flows and cash reserves. We have made significant investments in product and process technology. We believe that sales generating cash flows, together with the proceeds of the notes offering and cash reserves, are sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.  Inflation  Inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years. A significant increase in inflation would affect our future performance.  Critical Accounting Policies  In response to the SEC's Release No. 33-8040, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policy," we identified the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends. We determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or objective decisions or assessments. We identified our most critical accounting policies to be related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation and use of estimates. We state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financials statements and at relevant sections in this management's discussion and analysis.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In June 1998 and June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Investments and Hedging Activities," and SFAS No. 137, which delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 133. In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, which provides additional guidance for the application of SFAS No. 133 for certain transactions. We adopted the statement                                         22   in fiscal year 2002 and the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  The FASB recently approved two statements: SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." These statements provide guidance on the accounting for business combinations, requires all future business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method, discontinue amortization of goodwill, define when and how intangible assets are amortized, and require an annual impairment test for goodwill. We have adopted these statements effective January 28, 2002. We believe that adoption of these standards will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.  In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. We plan to adopt this statement effective January 26, 2003. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 143 will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.  In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and the accounting and reporting provision of APB Opinion No. 30 "Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions", for the disposal of a business (as previously defined in that Opinion). SFAS 144 also resolves significant implementation issues related to Statement 121. We have adopted this statement effective with the fiscal year beginning January 28, 2002. We are currently reviewing these standards to determine the impact on our results of operations and financial position, however, we do not expect that the adoption of this statement will have material impact.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS  Foreign Currency Risk  As a global enterprise, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Because of the relatively small size of each individual currency exposure, we do not employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currency exposures. Likewise, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses. Our foreign currency exposures may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon our financial results.  Certain of our assets, including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable, exist in nondollar-denominated currencies, which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The nondollar-denominated currencies are principally Euro and British Pounds Sterling. Additionally, certain of our current and long-term liabilities are denominated principally in British Pounds Sterling currency, which are also sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Substantially all of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we do business could harm our business by resulting in pricing that is not competitive with prices denominated in local currencies.  Interest Rate Risk  As of January 27, 2002, we had $364.3 million in long-term debt outstanding at a fixed interest rate of 4 1/2 % per annum. We do not currently hedge any potential interest rate exposure. Interest rates affect our return on excess cash and investments. A significant decline in interest rates would reduce the amount of interest income generated from our excess cash and investments.                                         23   ITEM 8.
