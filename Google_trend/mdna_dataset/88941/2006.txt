ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Consolidated Financial Data and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.    As discussed in Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements earlier in this report, this Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements, including as a result of the risks described in the cautionary statements in Item 1A Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, in our other filings with the SEC, and in material incorporated herein and therein by reference. We undertake no duty to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.    Overview    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We design, produce and market a broad range of products that are sold principally to customers in the computer, communications and industrial markets for a wide variety of end applications. Computer end market applications include notebook and desktop computers, computer graphics, and personal digital assistants (PDAs). Products within the communications market include products for set-top boxes, local area networks, metro and wide area networks, cellular phones and base stations. Industrial and other applications include automated test equipment (ATE), power supplies, hearing aids and other medical devices, and meter reading and factory automation systems. Our end-customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers, including Alcatel, Apple, Agilent, Cisco, Compal Electronics, Dell, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Intel, LG Electronics, Motorola, Phonak, Quanta Computer, Samsung, Siemens, Sony and Unisys.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"> We recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. Product design and engineering revenue is recognized during the period in which services are performed. We defer revenue recognition on shipment of certain products to distributors where return privileges exist until the products are sold through to end-users. Gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of sales. Our cost of sales includes materials, depreciation on fixed assets used in the manufacturing process, shipping costs, direct labor and overhead. We determine the cost of inventory by the first-in, first-out method. Our operating costs and expenses generally consist of selling, general and administrative (SG&A), product development and engineering costs (R&D), costs associated with acquisitions, and other operating related charges.    Most of our sales to customers are made on the basis of individual customer purchase orders. Many customers include liberal cancellation provisions in their purchase orders. Trends within the industry toward shorter lead-times and just-in-time deliveries have resulted in our reduced ability to predict future shipments. As a result, we rely on orders received and shipped within the same quarter for a significant portion of our sales. Sales made directly to original equipment manufacturers during fiscal year 2006 were 43% of net sales. The remaining 57% of net sales were made through independent distributors.         26          We divide and operate our business based on two reportable segments: Standard Semiconductor Products and Rectifier, Assembly and Other Products. We evaluate segment performance based on net sales and operating income of each segment. We do not track segment data or evaluate segment performance on additional financial information. We do not track balance sheet items by individual reportable segments. As such, there are no separately identifiable segment assets nor are there any separately identifiable statements of income data (below operating income). The Standard Semiconductor Products segment makes up the vast majority of overall sales and includes our power management, protection, test and measurement, advanced communications and wireless and sensing product lines. The Rectifier, Assembly and Other Products segment includes our line of assembly and rectifier devices, which are the remaining products from our founding as a supplier into the military and aerospace market.    Our business involves reliance on foreign-based entities. Most of our outside subcontractors and suppliers, including third-party foundries that supply silicon wafers, are located in foreign countries, including China, Malaysia, Korea, the Philippines and Germany. For the fiscal year ended January 29, 2006, approximately 58% of our silicon, in terms of finished wafers purchased, was manufactured in China. Foreign sales for fiscal year 2006 constituted approximately 73% of our net sales. Approximately 90% of foreign sales in fiscal year 2006 were to customers located in the Asia-Pacific region. The remaining foreign sales were primarily to customers in Europe, Canada, and Mexico.    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Acquisition    On June 23, 2005, we acquired through our wholly-owned Swiss subsidiary, Semtech International AG, all of the outstanding shares of XEMICS SA (XEMICS) in a cash-for-stock transaction pursuant to a share purchase and sales agreement. Following the acquisition we changed the name of the company from XEMICS SA to Semtech Neuchatel SA (Semtech Neuchatel).    Semtech Neuchatel is a research and development intensive company based in Switzerland that applies low-power, low-voltage design expertise across its core technologies, namely sensor interfacing/data acquisition, 8-bit RISC microcontrollers, radio frequency transceivers and audio converters. These capabilities are aimed at adding value in next generation, highly integrated battery powered wireless and sensing applications. Semtech Neuchatel, which continues to operate from its Switzerland location, is also referred to as our Wireless and Sensing Products product line and is included in the Standard Semiconductor Products Segment.    We believe this acquisition strategically enhances our competitive edge in developing high-performance analog ICs. The acquired company offered proprietary technology (including patents and other exclusive IP), access to applied research, and an existing business to combine with our market presence and capital resources, existing relationships with industry leaders, and worldwide infrastructure of sales, marketing and manufacturing resources. The addition of XEMICS represents a convergence of technology between our key analog disciplines of power management and over-voltage protection and XEMICSs core capabilities in designing ultra low power building blocks. We believe that the acquisition of XEMICS broadens our capabilities and that the integration of its core functions with ours will be critical in winning new designs. Since the acquisition, we have worked to integrate Semtech Neuchatel into our organization in the areas of information systems, accounting and financial reporting, quality, and operational procedures. We have also trained our sales force on targeted applications for this product line.   In addition to the $ 43.0 million we paid to the selling shareholders of XEMICS in June 2005, the acquisition contract provides for the possibility of additional payments of up to $16.0 million if Semtech Neuchatel meets certain performance objectives during an earn-out period of approximately one year that ends on April 30, 2006. Any earn-out would be payable, at the earliest, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2007. The payment could occur in a later quarter if there is any dispute surrounding the calculations underlying the adjustment. Although the earn-out period has not yet ended, based on period-to-date performance against the targeted objectives, we do not believe any earn-out will be payable to the selling shareholders.    The former XEMICS shareholders made certain representations, warranties and covenants with respect to the financial condition of XEMICS and other matters. A portion of the purchase price was not immediately disbursed to    SIZE="1">     27          the selling shareholders but is being held in escrow for fifteen months after the closing to ensuresome funds are available in the event liability attaches to the selling shareholders as a result of a breach of the representations and warranties. Six of the selling shareholders will remain liable for five years after the closing as to certain representations related to organization, capital structure, and tax matters. The share purchase and sales agreement provides for certain conditions and limitations on the selling shareholders liability. We have not made any claims against the escrow account, but continue to monitor and assess whether there are any qualifying items in excess of the threshold for making a claim.    Consistent with purchase accounting treatment of the acquisition, we included XEMICS results of operations subsequent to the close of the transaction on June 23, 2005 in our consolidated results of operations. We also assumed the assets and liabilities of XEMICS as of the closing date.    During the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 a one-time acquisition related charge to earnings of $4.0 million was recorded for the write-off of in-process research and development. From the close date of June 23, 2005 until the end of our fiscal year 2006 on January 29, 2006, we incurred $954,000 of expense for amortization of other intangible items. The remaining $5.5 million balance of other intangible items as of end the end of fiscal year 2006 will be amortized over future periods. There are no tax-related benefits from these acquisition related costs.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"> Additional information regarding the acquisition is provided in this Item 7 under the caption  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  and in Note 18 to the financial statements included in this Form 10-K.    Insurance Settlements    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In March 2003, we announced that we resolved a customer dispute. Under the terms of the settlement, we agreed to pay the customer $12.0 million in cash in two equal annual installments, plus rebates on the future purchase of certain products by the customer through the end of March 2005. At the time of the customer settlement, we stated that we would vigorously pursue insurance coverage for the full value of the settlement. We subsequently filed lawsuits against three of our insurance companies and reached settlements with two of the three insurance companies in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. We recorded a $3.0 million gain in fiscal year 2006 for these insurance settlements. In fiscal year 2006, we also recorded $2.9 million of related legal expenses under the operating expense category of selling, general and administrative. The case against the remaining insurance company is expected to go to trial sometime in fiscal year 2007. We are unable to predict if settlement will be reached prior to trial. There is no assurance that we will prevail at trial or that the insurance company will not appeal if we do prevail. Legal fees and expenses related to pursuit of the insurance recovery have been, and will continue to be, expensed in the period incurred. If the settlement amount or amount awarded at trial is less than we seek, if we fail to prevail at trial, or if we or the insurance company appeal the decision, total legal expenses associated with the litigation may exceed the amount recovered from the insurance companies.    Additional information regarding the insurance settlements is provided in Note 12 to the financial statements included in this Form 10-K.    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"> On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and discuss with our audit committee our estimates, including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns, inventory reserves, asset impairments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, which together form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Our critical accounting policies and estimates do not vary between our two reportable segments. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.        28          We believe the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect the significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:    Accounting for Temporary and Long-Term Investments    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px"> Our temporary and long-term investments consist of government, bank and corporate obligations. Temporary investments mature within twelve months of the balance sheet date. Long-term investments have maturities in excess of one year from the date of the balance sheet. We classify our investments as available for sale because we expect to possibly sell some securities prior to maturity. We include any unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, in the comprehensive income portion of our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity.    SIZE="2">Allowance for Doubtful Accounts    We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. If we are aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we record an allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer. For all other customers, we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due, the current business environment, the size and number of certain large accounts and our historical experience. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsen, additional allowances may be required in the future.    Revenue Recognition    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px"> We recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. We defer revenue recognition on shipment of products to certain customers, principally distributors, where return privileges exist until these products are sold through to end-users or the return privilege lapses. The estimated deferred gross margin on these sales, where there are no outstanding receivables, are recorded on the balance sheet under the heading of Deferred Revenue. We record a provision for estimated sales returns in the same period as the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on historical sales returns and other known factors. Actual returns could be different from our estimates and current provisions for sales returns and allowances, resulting in future charges to earnings.    STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> Inventory Valuation    Our inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and consist of materials, labor and overhead. We determine the cost of inventory by the first-in, first-out method. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. In order to state our inventory at lower of cost or market, we maintain reserves against our inventory. If future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, a write-down of inventory may be required, and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made.    SIZE="2">Contingencies and Litigation   We are involved in various disputes and litigation matters as a claimant and as defendant. We record any amounts recovered in these matters when collection is certain. We record liabilities for claims against us when the losses are probable and estimable. Any amounts recorded are based on reviews by outside counsel, in-house counsel and management. Actual results may differ from estimates.    Stock Option Expensing    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Through fiscal year 2006, we have included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements a pro forma disclosure of the impact stock options would have on net income (loss) using the fair value stock option expense recognition method, as allowed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 and using an intrinsic value method, as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Therefore, we generally have not recognized any expense with respect to employee stock options as long as such options are granted at exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant.    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">      29          A revised standard, SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share-based payments (including stock options) at fair value, is effective beginning with a companys first interim or annual reporting period of the first fiscal year beginning on or after June 15, 2005. This means SFAS 123(R) is effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, which began on January 30, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) requires us to apply a valuation model, which includes estimates and assumptions on the rate of forfeiture and expected life of options and stock price volatility. Actual results may differ from estimates.    SIZE="2">Goodwill and Intangible Assets    The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). Goodwill is recorded at the time of an acquisition and is calculated as the difference between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired.    Accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development (IPR&D). Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. The amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization, and the amount assigned to IPR&D is expensed immediately. If the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct, or if business conditions change, purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required.    SIZE="2">Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets    In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) any future declines in our operating results, (ii) a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks, including the valuation of our common stock, (iii) a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy and the semiconductor industry or (iv) any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results. We evaluate these assets, including purchased intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives, on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. In the process of our annual impairment review, we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of the assets. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation. The estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. It is possible, however, that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analysis, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges in a future period.    The Company accounts for other purchased intangible assets, in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS 144), which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment, such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the semiconductor industry, are present. Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is impaired, based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates that there is impairment, the impaired asset is written down to fair value, which is typically calculated using: (i) quoted market prices and/or (ii) discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate consistent with the guidance provided in FASB Concepts Statement No. 7, Using Cash Flow Information and Present Value in Accounting Measurements. Impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets.    In-Process Research and Development    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In-process research and development (IPR&D) expense totaled $4.0 million during fiscal year 2006. The amount allocated to IPR&D was determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry         30          and was expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying project had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed. In accordance with SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, as clarified by FIN No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 2, amounts assigned to IPR&D meeting the above-stated criteria were charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price.   The fair value of the acquired IPR&D was determined using the income approach. Under this approach, the expected future cash flows for the project under development are estimated and discounted to their net present value at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return. Significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted-average cost of capital and return on assets, as well as the risks inherent in the development process, including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance. The unique technological innovations, the existence and reliance on core technology, the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility, and the complexity, cost and time to complete the remaining development were considered. Future cash flows were estimated based on forecasted revenue and costs, taking into account product life-cycles, market penetration and growth rates.    The following table summarizes the key assumptions of the acquired IPR&D project as of the acquisition date:                Acquired IPR&D            Development project      Wireless & sensing chips and protocols     Average estimated percent complete      23%     Average estimated time to complete      1.5 years     Estimated cost to complete (in millions)      $3.9     Risk adjusted discount rate      25%     IPR&D (in millions)      $4.0    As of the acquisition date, the cost to complete development was estimated to be $3.9 million and revenue related to the acquired IPR&D was projected to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. As a result of a shift in strategic market positioning, R&D priorities were revised and related resources were reallocated, resulting in a reduction in development activity and a delay in projected release to market of certain IPR&D related products. Current projections with respect to estimated cost and effort to complete are consistent with the original assumptions. However, the shift in priorities is expected to reduce cash flow from IPR&D related projects by approximately $1.8 million over the next three years. The assumptions consist primarily of expected completion dates, estimated cost to complete, and revenue and expense projections for the product once it enters the market.    Accounting for Income Taxes    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px"> The SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.    As part of the process of preparing our consolidated condensed financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Generally, to the extent we change the valuation allowance in a period, the change is recorded through the tax provision in the statement of operations. If a valuation allowance relates to benefits from stock option         31          exercise activity, any adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded to paid-in-capital in the period of the adjustment. Any release of a valuation allowance established against a pre-acquisition XEMICS net operating loss carryforward will be recorded to goodwill. Management continually evaluates our deferred tax assets to assess whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized.    We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax impact is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We recognize probable liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. In the current period, no change to our tax contingency reserve of $1.2 million was recorded.    Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result.    SIZE="2">In addition to the risks to the effective tax rate discussed above, the effective tax rate reflected in forward-looking statements is based on current enacted tax law. Significant changes in enacted tax law could materially affect these estimates.    On October 22, 2004 the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) was signed into law and creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings by providing an elective 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations and requirements, including adoption of a specific domestic reinvestment plan for the repatriated funds. On January 13, 2005 the U.S. Treasury published Notice 2005-10 providing guidance on the implementation of the repatriation deduction. We have not repatriated any funds under this Act.    Results of Operations    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Fiscal Year 2006 Compared With Fiscal Year 2005     Net Sales .  Net sales for fiscal year 2006 were $239.4 million, a decline of 6% from $253.6 million for fiscal year 2005. Included in net sales for fiscal year 2006 were $14.8 million of incremental sales as a result of the June 2005 acquisition of XEMICS. Net sales for fiscal year 2005 had no sales contributions from XEMICS.    Semiconductor and electronics industry conditions improved in the second half of fiscal year 2006 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2006. Fiscal year 2005 was characterized by a strong first half, but a weaker second half of fiscal year 2005. Our quarterly sales levels reflected these periods of strength and weakness. Worldwide semiconductor sales grew in calendar year 2005 according to industry sources.    Presented below is our estimate of sales by end-market. End-products in the computer end-market include notebook and desktop computers, graphics applications, PDAs and computer gaming systems. Communications end products include cellular phone handsets, wireless base stations, set-top boxes, and networking, broadband and long-haul communications infrastructure equipment. The industrial/other products category includes traditional industrial and automation equipment, power supplies, military, aerospace and medical applications.

Sales in the communications category were most impacted by a 20% decline in sales of products used in cellular handsets that was partially offset by a greater than 15% increase in networking and communications infrastructure applications. The increase in the industrial end-market category reflected a 62% decline of sales into the automated test equipment (ATE market), which was more than offset by a 96% increase in other industrial/other applications (primarily as a result of the June 2005 XEMICS acquisition).    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Standard Semiconductor Products represented 96% of net sales in fiscal year 2006, with the Rectifier, Assembly and Other Products segment contributing the remaining 4%.

SIZE="2">Sales of our Rectifier, Assembly and Other Products declined by 4% in fiscal year 2006 due to weak demand for these older technology products which are used mostly in military and certain industrial applications.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"> Gross Profit .  Gross profit for fiscal year 2006 was $134.4 million, compared to $147.9 million for the prior year. This decrease was due to a 6% decline in net sales and a lower gross margin percentage compared to fiscal year 2005. Our gross margin was 56% for fiscal year 2006, down from 58% in fiscal year 2005. Our strategy is to develop new products that offer more advanced or more complex features than the competition, which in turn generally provides for higher gross margin. However, margin improvements may be offset by price erosion due to competition and other factors tied to industry conditions.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"> In fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2005, we sold $200,000 and $507,000, respectively, of inventory of the Standard Semiconductor Products segment that had been written-down during the second quarter of fiscal year 2002.    Operating Costs and Expenses .  Operating costs and expenses were $87.0 million for the fiscal year 2006, up from $77.9 million in fiscal year 2005.

Also impacting fiscal year 2006 operating expenses were acquisition related expense items, namely $4.0 million of written-off in-process research and development (see In-Process Research and Development below) and $954,000 of amortization of intangibles, all resulting from the acquisition of XEMICS (see Acquisition above and Note 18 to the financial statements included in this Form 10-K).    Included in fiscal year 2006 operating expenses under the category of selling, general and administrative is a $3.0 million gain associated with insurance settlements and $2.9 million of related legal expenses for the year (see Insurance Settlements above and Note 12 to the financial statements included in this Form 10-K).    As a percentage of net sales, operating costs were higher in fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 due to higher absolute spending and lower sales levels.    Operating Income .  Operating income was $47.4 million in fiscal year 2006, down from operating income of $70.0 million in fiscal year 2005. Operating income was impacted by lower sales levels, lower gross margin and higher operating costs and expenses.

Operating income for the Rectifier, Assembly and Other Products declined by 39% in fiscal year 2006 due to lower sales and lower manufacturing efficiencies.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"> Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net .  Interest and other income (expense), net was income of $7.3 million for fiscal year 2006, up from income of $6.3 million in fiscal year 2005. For fiscal year 2006 and 2005, a vast majority of interest and other income was interest income from investments.    The improvement in net interest and other income and expense in fiscal year 2006 was mostly due to higher rates of return on investments, that was partially offset by a $23.7 million decline in cash and investments that generate interest income.   Provision for Taxes .  The provision for income taxes was $11.7 million for fiscal year 2006, compared to $17.4 million in fiscal year 2005. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2005 were 21% and 23%, respectively. The decline is due to increased sales by our foreign-based subsidiaries that are in lower tax jurisdictions. Specifically, in the current period, we received a favorable tax ruling in a foreign jurisdiction regarding eligibility for a sales exclusion provision. This exclusion reduced our current period tax provision by approximately $2.4 million, of which approximately $2.1 million relates to the twelve month period ending January 29, 2006 and approximately $259,000 relates to the fiscal year ending January 30, 2005.         34          Fiscal Year 2005 Compared With Fiscal Year 2004    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px"> Net Sales .  Net sales for fiscal year 2005 were $253.6 million, an increase of 32% over the $192.1 million for fiscal year 2004. Semiconductor and electronics industry conditions improved dramatically in the fiscal year, especially during the first half of the year. The significant increase in sales reflected both the strength of fiscal year 2005 and the general weakness that occurred during fiscal year 2004.    Presented below are the estimated sales by end-market. End-products in the computer end-market include notebook and desktop computers, graphics applications, PDAs and computer gaming systems. Communications include cellular phone handsets, wireless base stations, set-top boxes, and networking, broadband and long-hail communications infrastructure equipment. The end-market for industrial/other products includes traditional industrial and automation equipment, power supplies, military, aerospace and medical applications.

Sales in the communications category were most impacted by a greater than 55% increase in sales of products used in cellular handsets and a greater than 60% increase in networking and communications infrastructure applications. The increase in the industrial end-market category reflected increased sales into the automated test equipment (ATE), which was up about 12%, and a greater than 50% increase in more broad-based industrial end-market segments.    Standard Semiconductor Products represented 96% of net sales in fiscal year 2005, while 4% were represented by the Rectifier, Assembly and Other Products segment. Details on net sales by reportable segment are presented below.

Sales of our Rectifier, Assembly and Other Products increased in fiscal year 2005 due to improved demand for these older technology products which are used in military, medical and certain industrial applications.    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Gross Profit .  Gross profit for fiscal year 2005 was $147.9 million, compared to $110.7 million for the prior year. This increase was due to higher absolute sales levels in fiscal year 2005 and slightly higher gross margin on products sold. Our gross margin was 58% for fiscal year 2005, unchanged from fiscal year 2004.         35          In fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2004, we sold $507,000 and $1.4 million, respectively, of inventory of the Standard Semiconductor Products segment that had been written-down during the second quarter of fiscal year 2002.    Operating Costs and Expenses . Operating costs and expenses were $77.9 million for the fiscal year 2005, up from $67.6 million in fiscal year 2004.

They also reflect increased legal expenses and the costs associated with compliance with new SEC regulations. The increase in product development and engineering costs, also referred to as research and development (R&D), was mostly due to higher spending related to salaries, variable compensation and increased new product development efforts. As a percentage of net sales, operating costs were lower in fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 due to better efficiencies as sales levels increased.    Operating Income .  Operating income was $70.0 million in fiscal year 2005, up from operating income of $43.2 million in fiscal year 2004. Operating income was impacted by higher sales levels, a slight improvement in gross margin and better efficiencies on operating costs and expenses.

We do not track segment data or evaluate segment performance or additional financial information. As such, there are no separately identifiable segment assets and liabilities.    On February 14, 2000, we completed a private offering of $400.0 million principal amount of 4  1 / 2 %convertible subordinated notes. The notes were due in 2007 and were callable beginning in February of 2003. Through an ongoing buyback program, we had bought back and retired a portion of the convertible subordinated notes in open market transactions. On July 18, 2003, we called the remaining $165.0 million outstanding balance of the convertible subordinated notes.    As of January 29, 2006, we had working capital of $235.6 million, compared with $221.4 million as of January 30, 2005 and $216.4 million as of January 25, 2004. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities as of January 29, 2006 was 10.0 to 1, compared to 8.6 to 1 as of January 30, 2005 and 8.5 to 1 as of January 25, 2004. The increase in working capital as of January 29, 2005 compared to the prior year was most impacted by a $22.0 million increase in temporary investments. Cash and cash equivalents declined by $16.6 million during fiscal year 2006, in part as funds were invested in temporary investments. The small increase in working capital as of January 30, 2005 compared to the prior year was mostly the result of a modest $4.5 million increase in current assets, only slightly offset by a $155,000 increase in current liabilities.    Cash provided by operating activities was $65.0 million for fiscal year 2006, compared to $70.1 million for fiscal year 2005 and $35.8 million for fiscal year 2004. Net operating cash flows were impacted by non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of $11.8 million, $9.8 million and $9.0 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"> Net operating cash flows in fiscal year 2006 were positively impacted by net income of $43.0 million, a $5.5 million tax benefit from stock option exercises, an increase of $5.5 million in deferred income taxes, the add back of a $4.0 million non-cash write-off of in-process research and development, a $4.0 million decline in inventories, a $2.5 million increase in other liabilities and other smaller items. These positive operating cash flow items were only partially offset by a $4.1 decline in accrued liabilities, $2.8 million decline in income taxes payable, a $2.0 million increase in accounts receivable, a decline of $1.4 million associated with deferred revenue, a decline of $1.0 million in accounts payable and other smaller items.    Net operating cash flows in fiscal year 2005 were positively impacted by net income of $58.9 million, a $13.3 million tax benefit from stock option exercises, a decline of $5.8 million in income taxes refundable, a decline of $2.4 million in other liabilities and other smaller items. These positive operating cash flow items were only partially offset by a $15.0 million increase in other assets, a $5.2 million decline in accrued liabilities and smaller increases in receivables and inventories. Net operating cash flows in fiscal year 2004 were most positively impacted by net income of $32.5 million and by a decline in deferred income taxes, loss on extinguishment of debt, increase in accounts payable, tax benefit from stock option exercises and declines in other assets. These were partially offset by increases in receivables, inventories, income taxes refundable, other assets, and declines in accrued liabilities, income taxes payable and other liabilities.    SIZE="2">Investing activities used $45.9 million in cash in fiscal year 2006 compared to net cash used by investing activities of $58.4 million in fiscal year 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities of $164.2 million in fiscal year 2004. The largest cash outlay related to investing activities was the use of $42.4 million of cash to acquire XEMICS in June of 2005. We spent $10.5 million on capital purchases in fiscal year 2006, and the net decrease in available-for sale investments contributed $7.1 million of cash to investing activities.    In fiscal year 2005 we spent $16.5 million on capital purchases and had a net increase of $42.1 million in available-for sale investments. For fiscal year 2004, we spent $7.5 million on capital purchases and had a net decline of $171.6 million in available-for sale investments. For fiscal years 2005 and 2004, investing activity included small amounts provided by the sale of property, plant and equipment.    Our financing activities used $35.9 million in cash during fiscal year 2006, compared to financing activities using $25.8 million during fiscal year 2005 and $241.0 million in the fiscal year 2004. Financing activities in fiscal year 2006 reflect $9.5 million of proceeds from stock option exercises and $3.0 million from the reissuance of treasury stock, which were more than offset by $46.9 million of cash used to repurchase common stock and $1.4 million used         38          to payoff notes payable acquired as part of the XEMICS acquisition. Financing activities in fiscal year 2005 reflect the $11.4 million of proceeds from stock option exercises and $1.4 million from the reissuance of treasury stock, which were more than offset by $38.6 million of cash used to repurchase common stock. Financing activities in fiscal year 2004 reflect the proceeds from stock option exercises, which were more than offset by $241.6 million of cash used to retire long-term debt and $7.0 million to repurchase common stock.    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In order to develop, design and manufacture new products, we have incurred significant expenditures during the past five years. We expect to continue these investments aimed at developing new products, including the hiring of many design and applications engineers and related purchase of equipment. Our intent is to continue to invest in those areas that have shown potential for viable and profitable market opportunities. Certain of these expenditures, particularly the addition of design engineers, do not generate significant payback in the short-term. We plan to finance these expenditures with cash generated by operations and investments.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"> A meaningful portion of our capital resources, and the related liquidity they represent, are held by our foreign subsidiaries. If we needed these funds for investment in domestic operations, any repatriation could have negative tax implications.    For all periods presented, the purchases of new capital equipment were made to expand our test capacity, support other engineering functions, including product design and qualification and information technology equipment needed to run our business. These purchases were funded from our operating cash flows and cash reserves.   We believe that operating cash flows together with cash reserves are sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as those arrangements are defined by the SEC, that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.    We do not have any unconsolidated subsidiaries or affiliated entities. We have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity or market or credit risk support, engage in leasing, hedging, research and development services, or other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements.   Noted below under Contractual Obligations are various commitments we have associated with our business such as lease commitments, open purchase obligations and other items that are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet because we have not yet received the related goods or services as of January 29, 2006.

The portion of these operating lease payments due during fiscal year fiscal 2007 is approximately $2.8 million.         39          Capital purchase commitments and other open purchase commitments are for the purchase of plant, equipment, raw material, supplies and services. They are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of January 29, 2006, as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"> The XEMICS acquisition contract provides for the possibility of additional payments of up to $16.0 million if the acquired company meets certain performance objectives during an earn-out period of approximately one year that ends on April 30, 2006. Although the earn-out period has not yet ended, based on period-to-date performance against the targeted objectives, we do not believe any earn-out will be payable to the selling shareholders. For additional information, see Note 18 to the financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.    Late in fiscal year 2004, we established a deferred compensation plan for certain officers and key executives that allows participants to defer a portion of their compensation for future distribution at various times permitted by the plan. We match a portion of the employees deferral, with the match subject to a vesting period. Compensation expense under this plan totaled $744,000 in fiscal year 2006 and $161,000 in fiscal year 2005. Our liability for deferred compensation totaled $4.5 million as of January 29, 2006 and $2.4 million as of January 30, 2005, and is included in other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet and in the table above. We have purchased whole life insurance on the lives of certain of the deferred compensation plan participants. This company-owned life insurance is held in a grantor trust and is intended to cover a majority of our costs of the deferred compensation plan. The cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance was $4.5 million as of January 29, 2006 and $2.2 million as of January 30, 2005, and is included in other assets.    Inflation    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px"> Inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years. A significant increase in inflation would affect our future performance.    Recently Issued Accounting Standards    In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. The amendments made by SFAS No. 151 clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The pronouncement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years after November 23, 2004. The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, the results of operations or liquidity.    On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), which supersedes APB 25 and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure under this provision is no longer an alternative in future years.    The provisions of SFAS 123(R) are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. This means SFAS 123(R) is effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, which began on January 30, 2006. We have adopted the new standard using the modified prospective transition method. The exact impact of adopting this pronouncement cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on many factors, including the levels of share-based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted this pronouncement in prior periods, the impact of this pronouncement would approximate the impact of SFAS 123 described in the disclosure of the pro forma results in Note 1, under the heading Stock-Based Compensation in our Notes to Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We estimate that stock option expense under SFAS 123(R) for the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 would reduce earnings by $4.3 to $4.8 million, pre-tax, or approximately 4 cents per share.    SIZE="1">     40           ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    We are subject to a variety of market risks, such as the foreign exchange and interest rate risks that are detailed below. Many of the factors that can impact on our market risk are external to the company, and so we are unable to fully predict them.    STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"> Foreign Currency Risk    As a global enterprise, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and we could experience currency gains or losses. Because of the relatively small size of each individual currency exposure, we generally do not use forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exposures. Our foreign currency exposures may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon our financial results.    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Certain of our assets, including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable, exist in non U.S. dollar-denominated currencies, which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The non U.S. dollar-denominated currencies are principally the Euro, Swiss Francs and British Pounds Sterling. Additionally, certain of our current and long-term liabilities are denominated principally in British Pounds Sterling currency, which is also sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.    Substantially all of our foreign sales, which amounted to $196.7 million in fiscal year 2006, are denominated in United States dollars. Currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we do business could harm our business by resulting in pricing that is not competitive with prices denominated in local currencies.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"> For the fiscal year ended January 29, 2006, we had approximately $10.0 million of expenses that were settled in British Pound Sterling, approximately $7.0 million of expenses that were settled in Swiss Francs, $2.0 million of expenses that were settled in Euros and $2.5 million of expenses that were settled in Mexican Pesos. Had rates of these various foreign currencies been 10% higher relative to the U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2006, our costs would have increased approximately $1.0 million related to expenses settled in British Pound Sterling, approximately $700,000 related to expenses settled in Swiss Francs, $200,000 related to expenses settled in Euros and $250,000 related to expenses settled in Mexican pesos.    As of the end of fiscal year 2006, we held as part of cash and cash equivalents $3.2 million of British Pound Sterling, $2.0 million of Swiss Francs, $781,000 of Euros and $29,000 of Mexican Pesos. If rates of these foreign currencies were to move higher or lower by some percentage, it would have equal effect on the relative U.S. dollar value of the balances we hold.    In fiscal year 2004, we entered into a forward contract to purchase 2.8 million Swiss Francs in fiscal year 2005 in exchange for $2.0 million. The forward contract was entered into as a partial hedge against future tax payments in Swiss Francs and shortly after maturity was used to help settle such tax liabilities.    STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"> Interest Rate and Market Risk    As of January 29, 2006, we had no long-term debt outstanding. We do not currently hedge any potential interest rate exposure.    Interest rates affect our return on excess cash and investments. As of January 29, 2006, we had $65.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $212.6 million of temporary and long-term investments. A majority of our cash and cash equivalents and investments generate interest income based on prevailing interest rates. Investments and cash and cash equivalents generated interest income of $8.0 million in fiscal year 2006. A significant change in interest rates would impact the amount of interest income generated from our excess cash and investments. It would also impact the market value of our investments. As of January 29, 2006, we estimate that our pool of investments had an effective duration of 0.67 (245-day weighted average days to maturity), which implies that a 1% increase in the prevailing interest rate could result in approximately $1.4 million of additional unrealized loss on our investments.         41          Our investments are subject to market risk, primarily interest rate and credit risk. Our investments are managed by a limited number of outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by us. Such guidelines include security type, credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short-term maturities.         42           ITEM 8.
