ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS          OF OPERATIONS  INDUSTRY TRENDS AND OUTLOOK - ---------------------------  The Company experienced growth during fiscal year 1996 due to new products used in computer and communications applications.  The commercial semiconductor industry and the markets in which the Company's products are used are characterized by rapid changes and short product life cycles.  The market for the Company's military and aerospace products remains fiercely competitive.  The Company plans to address these issues by focusing efforts on eliminating less profitable product lines and pushing new product development.  Typical of the semiconductor industry, the Company has experienced declines in average selling prices over the life of its product lines.  Efforts to offset                                        -10-   this decline include increasing units shipped, finding new applications for existing products and introduction of new products.  Management will continue to take steps to offset the impact of declines in average selling prices, however, there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful.  The Company also derives a significant amount of revenue from the sale of foundry wafers. These wafers are generally purchased by manufacturers who package the individual silicon die in their products. Demand for these wafers can vary significantly based on demand for the manufacturer's finished product. The foundry business is also very competitive, with other foundries offering similar services. The revenue generated by this segment can vary significantly depending not only on macro trends within the semiconductor industry, but also on conditions at specific customers. As previously disclosed the Company expects that foundry revenue will decline in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 compared to levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996. Subsequent to the Company's fiscal 1996 year-end, there was a general downturn in the semiconductor industry due primarily to excess inventory in the personal computer market.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - ---------------------  Semtech posted record sales of $61.7 million in fiscal year 1996 compared with $34.6 million in fiscal 1995 and $29.4 million in 1994.  Net income was $7,531,000 in 1996 compared to $1,502,000 in 1995 and $198,000 in 1994.  The results of operations for the three years ended January 28, 1996 have been restated to reflect the pooling of ECI.  SALES - -----  Sales for fiscal year 1996 increased 78% over fiscal 1995 and 110% over fiscal year 1994.  The increase was primarily due to the increased shipment of analog semiconductor products used in commercial applications.  Increased sales of the Company's lines of linear regulators, transient voltage suppressors (TVS), and foundry wafers represented a majority of the increased revenues.  Sales of commercial semiconductors continued to increase in fiscal 1996 compared to prior periods.  Sales of devices used in computer and peripheral applications represented about 30% of total sales for the year.  Communications applications represented 9%, industrial applications 20%, and foundry customers represented 26%.  This mix is attributable to the Company's acquisition of ECI Semiconductor and the development and marketing of new products for a diverse customer base.  For the year, sales to military and aerospace customers remained relatively flat in absolute dollars and decreased to approximately 15% of total sales.  The Company expects the military market will be flat or decline slightly in fiscal year 1997.  The Company has implemented a strategy for selective participation in the military market.  The Asia-Pacific region continued to show increased demand for the Company's products in fiscal 1996.  A large portion of this demand was for devices used in computer applications.  Sales to customers located in the Asia-Pacific region were approximately 23% of the total sales for all of fiscal 1996, compared to 7% in fiscal 1995.  Sales to European customers represented 13% of fiscal 1996's total sales compared to 17% in fiscal 1995.  The Company would expect that sales to both the Asia-Pacific and European regions will grow (in absolute dollars) as added investment in computer and communications equipment is forecasted for these regions.                                        -11-   ORDERS - ------  New orders for fiscal year 1996 amounted to $68 million. The Company's book-to- bill ratio for the year was 1.10.  Semtech witnessed increases in the order rates for its lines of linear regulators and transient voltage suppressers (TVS).  The Company also experienced significant growth in the orders of foundry wafers.  Foundry wafers are fabricated wafers that are sold to customers who then use the wafer to produce their own finished products.  Linear regulators, which are used in powering applications, are designed to both regulate and drop output voltage levels.  TVS devices provide "overvoltage" protection to sensitive electronic circuits.  The Company experienced limited success in booking orders for its line of DC to DC power converters.  Orders from customers located in Asia-Pacific continued to grow in fiscal 1996. The Company was successful in identifying additional business opportunities with several suppliers of computer and telecommunications products.  Bookings from Asia-Pacific customers represented approximately 22% of the total orders received in fiscal 1996.  The entire Asia-Pacific region has become strategically important for achieving additional new customers and increased order levels.  As was planned,  Semtech opened a branch office in Taiwan to support sales and marketing effort in the region.  In 1996 the Company took steps to improve both domestic and foreign direct and distribution sales coverage by reviewing and in some cases extending agreements with key distributors.  This improved coverage is expected to help unit sales of both military and commercial products.  The Company ended fiscal year 1996 with $19.5 million in backlogged orders compared to $13.2 million and $11.6 million at the end of fiscal years 1995 and 1994, respectively.  A majority of the Company's backlog is shippable within six months.  GROSS MARGIN - ------------  The Company's gross profit margin for fiscal year 1996 improved to 42% compared to 33% in 1995 and 29% in 1994.  This increase was due to added shipments of higher margin devices, improved capacity utilization and improved production yields.  The Company's overall gross margin continued to be adversely affected by margins received on products sold to military customers.  Included in the cost of sales are certain expenditures for engineering costs and process development which the Company considers to be production related.  Gross margin improvement over time is dependent on the Company's ability to develop and introduce higher margin commercial products, more fully utilizing capacity and achieving further yield improvements.  The Company's strategic plan calls for the introduction of additional proprietary products, which tend to fetch higher margins than industry standard and custom parts.  Management also intends to continue to pursue any available steps to improve manufacturing efficiencies.  These efforts are expected to be partially offset by a decline in the Company's older product lines.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE, AND ENGINEERING - ----------------------------------------------------   Costs related to selling, general and administrative, and engineering in 1996 were $14.0 million, representing an increase of 53% over the $9.2 million in 1995 and an increase of 77% over the $7.9 million in 1994.  The rise  was due to across-the-board increases in research and development spending, the addition of                                        -12-   several strategic marketing individuals, increased commission expense and variable compensation.  Both sales and engineering costs increased due to the Company's overall efforts to increase sales long-term. The specific areas in which Semtech expended more resources were primarily sales, advertising, and engineering.  Operating expenses were 23% of net sales in 1996 versus 27% in 1995 and 27% in 1994.  Management expects expenses related to sales, general and administrative and engineering to increase (in absolute dollar terms) in fiscal year 1997 due to efforts to grow net sales.  INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE - --------------------------  In fiscal year 1996, the Company had interest expense of $99,000 compared to $160,000 in 1995 and $149,000 in 1994.  The decline in interest expense is due to a lower average daily debt balance in fiscal 1996 compared to 1995 and 1994. Semtech had net other expense of $345,000 in 1996, which included $498,000 for costs associated with the acquisition of ECI Semiconductor, $156,000 of interest income, $1,000 loss on disposition of assets and $2,000 of miscellaneous expenses. Semtech had other income of $89,000 in 1995, which included $144,000 of interest income and $5,000 of foreign currency transaction gains, partially offset by miscellaneous expense of $60,000.  In fiscal 1994, the Company incurred net other expense of $51,000, which included foreign currency transaction losses totaling $29,000, $69,000 of miscellaneous expenses that included the amortization of intangibles, $8,000 loss on disposition of assets, $108,000 in restructuring charges taken to reduce headcount in our Corpus Christi and Scotland facilities and interest income of $163,000.  The cost savings generated through the restructuring were originally estimated at $100,000 per quarter.  The actual savings have not differed materially from this original estimate.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE - ------------------  Income tax expense for fiscal 1996 was $3,812,000 compared to $526,000 and $102,000 in 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The effective tax rate was higher in 1996 than in 1995 due to increased revenues generated from California based operations and due to the utilization of R&D credit and alternative minimum tax credit carry-forwards during fiscal 1995.  The annual tax rate for fiscal 1997 is expected to approximate the rate for fiscal 1996.  As of fiscal 1996 year- end, the Company had $792,000 in deferred tax assets, which is net of related valuation reserves. The valuation reserve has been established in accordance with SFAS No. 109.  FINANCIAL CONDITION - -------------------  During fiscal year 1996, the Company  improved its financial condition. Semtech's working capital ratios, which measure the Company's ability to meet its short-term obligations are presented.                                                1996      1995      1994                                             ----      ----      ----        Working Capital: Beginning of year                          $11,475   $ 9,623    $9,142 End of year                                $17,881   $11,475    $9,623 Increase (decrease) in working capital     $ 6,406   $ 1,852    $  481 Working capital ratios                         3.4       2.9       3.1   The increase in working capital for fiscal 1996 was the result of $6,210,000 of cash generated by operations.  During fiscal 1996, the Company invested                                        -13-   approximately $4.4 million in capital equipment and approximately $2.7 million in inventory to support its commercial product lines.  Despite these investments and the repayment of debt, the Company's net cash balance increased by $2.8 million in fiscal 1996.  Semtech's working capital ratio increased to 3.4 in 1996 from 2.9 in 1995 and 3.1 in 1994.  The Company maintains a credit facility with a financial institution for working capital and equipment acquisition.  This line provides up to $7.5 million of credit and extends until August 1996.  This arrangement is collateralized by the Company's domestic assets and contains provisions regarding current ratios, debt to worth, and net worth.  During fiscal 1996, the Company borrowed $822,000 against this line, which was converted into a 3 year note. In October 1994, the Company entered into a four year term loan in the amount of $535,000.  Both loans were for the purchase of capital equipment and are collateralized by the related equipment.  The Company's foreign subsidiary also maintains an overdraft credit line in the amount of 300,000 pounds sterling with a commitment from its bank to expand this line to 1,000,000 pounds sterling. This line is based on a percentage of foreign assets and is guaranteed by the Company.  No amounts were outstanding under the line at January 28, 1996.  Efforts by the Company over the past several years to increase commercial semiconductor product sales have been effective.  New products have been introduced for such applications as computer and telecommunications equipment. In order to develop, design and manufacture new products, the Company has had to make significant investments over the past several years.  Such investments, including the addition of several design and applications engineers, aimed at developing additional new products will continue.  Semtech fully intends to continue to invest in those areas that have shown potential for viable and profitable market opportunities.  Certain of these investments, particularly the addition of design engineers, will probably not generate significant payback in the short-term.  The Company plans to finance these investments with cash generated by operations, cash on-hand, and borrowings from the Company's credit facilities.  In an on-going effort to grow the Company and improve its long-term financial position, the Company has examined potential acquisitions.  Although no agreements have been reached, the Company will continue to investigate possible acquisitions that fit with the Company's strategic plan.  If the Company does choose to enter such a transaction, several forms of financing will be examined.  The leverage ratios presented below indicate the extent to which the Company has been financed with debt.  Total debt increased by $150,000 in fiscal year 1996. This increase was the result of a borrowing to finance certain capital equipment purchases, partially offset by regular principal payments and conversion of debentures.  Existing debt services are supported by adequate cash flows from operations.                                                              1996    1995    1994                                                           ----    ----    ----        Long-term debt as a % of total capitalization(1)          4.2%    5.5%    7.6%  Total debt as a % of total capitalization (1)             5.9%    8.8%   11.0%  (1) Total capitalization is defined as the sum of long-     term debt and shareholders' equity.   During fiscal year 1996, Semtech purchases of new capital equipment were $4,427,000.  These additions were made primarily to expand manufacturing                                        -14-   capacity and improve efficiency.  Funding for these purchases was made from the Company's operating cash flows, cash reserves, and debt obligations.  Management plans to make capital expenditures in fiscal 1997 to increase test, assembly and wafer fabrication capacity.  As of January 28, 1996, the Company had approximately $537,000 of outstanding commitments for machinery and equipment purchases.  The Company believes that current internal cash flows together with cash reserves and existing credit facilities are sufficient to support these capital expenditures.  Accounts receivable days sales outstanding, calculated by annualizing fourth quarter results for 1996 and 1995, improved to forty-one days as of January 28, 1996 from forty-seven days as of January 29, 1995.  Days sales outstanding are impacted by sales within Europe at standard terms of sixty to ninety days. Inventory turns increased to 4.1 as of January 28, 1996 from 3.7 as of January 29, 1995.  This increase was primarily due to the Company's new products inventory which turned at a faster rate than the military inventory.  All inventory which is obsolete or in excess of one year's demand is fully reserved.  INFLATION - ---------  Inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on the Company's performance over the past three fiscal years.  A significant increase in inflation would affect the Company's future performance.                                        -15-   ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
