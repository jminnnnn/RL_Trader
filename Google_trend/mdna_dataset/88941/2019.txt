Business General  We are a leading global supplier of high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductors and advanced algorithms and were incorporated in Delaware in 1960. We design, develop, manufacture and market a wide range of products for commercial applications, the majority of which are sold into the enterprise computing, communications, high-end consumer and industrial end-markets.  Enterprise Computing : data centers, passive optical networks, desktops, notebooks, servers, monitors, printers and other computer peripherals.  Communications : base stations, optical networks, carrier networks, switches and routers, cable modems, wireless LAN and other communication infrastructure equipment.  High-End Consumer : handheld products, smartphones, wireless charging, set-top boxes, digital televisions, monitors and displays, tablets, wearables, digital video recorders and other consumer equipment.  Industrial : analog and digital video broadcast equipment, video-over-IP solutions, automated meter reading, Internet of Things ("IoT"), smart grid, wireless charging, military and aerospace, medical, security systems, automotive, industrial and home automation and other industrial equipment.  Our end-customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and their suppliers. Overview of the Semiconductor Industry  The semiconductor industry is broadly divided into analog and digital semiconductor products. Analog semiconductors condition and regulate "real world" functions such as temperature, speed, sound and electrical current. Digital semiconductors process binary information, such as that used by computers. Mixed-signal devices incorporate both analog and digital functions into a single chip and provide the ability for digital electronics to interface with the outside world.  The market for analog and mixed-signal semiconductors differs from the market for digital semiconductors. The analog and mixed-signal industry is typically characterized by longer product life cycles than the digital industry. In addition, analog semiconductor manufacturers tend to have lower capital investment requirements for manufacturing because their facilities tend to be less dependent than digital producers on state-of-the-art production equipment to manufacture leading edge process technologies. The end-product markets for analog and mixed-signal semiconductors are more varied and more specialized than the relatively standardized digital semiconductor product markets.  Another difference between the analog and digital markets is the amount of available talented labor. The analog industry relies more heavily than the digital industry on design and applications talent to distinguish its products from one another. Digital expertise is extensively taught in universities due to its overall market size, while analog and mixed-signal expertise tends to be learned over time based on experience and hands-on training. Consequently, personnel with analog training are scarcer than digital trained engineers. This has historically made it more difficult for new suppliers in the analog market to quickly develop products and gain significant market share.  Advancements in digital signal processing technology typically drive the need for corresponding advancements in analog and mixed-signal solutions. We believe that the diversity of our applications allows us to take advantage of areas of relative market strength and reduces our vulnerability to competitive pressure in any one area.  Business Strategy  Our objective is to be a leading supplier of high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductors and advanced algorithms to the fastest growing segments of our target markets. We intend to leverage our pool of skilled technical personnel to develop new products or, where appropriate, use strategic acquisitions or small strategic investments to either accelerate our position in the fastest growing areas or to gain entry into these areas. In order to capitalize on our strengths in analog and mixed-signal processing design, development and marketing, we intend to pursue the following strategies:  Leverage our rare analog and mixed-signal design expertise   We have developed a strategy to invest heavily in human resources needed to define, design and market high-performance analog and mixed-signal platform products. We have built a team of experienced engineers who combine industry expertise with advanced semiconductor design expertise to meet customer requirements and enable our customers to get their products to market rapidly. We intend to leverage this strategy to achieve new levels of integration, power reduction and performance, enabling our customers to achieve differentiation in their end systems.  5 Continue to release proprietary new products, achieve new design wins, and cross-sell products   We are focused on developing unique, new, and proprietary products that bring value to our target customers in our target markets. These products are typically differentiated in performance but are priced competitively. We also focus on achieving design wins for our products with current and future customers. Design wins are indications by the customer that they intend to incorporate our products into their product designs. Although we believe that a design win is an indicator of future potential growth, it does not inevitably result in us being awarded business or receiving a purchase commitment. Our technical talent works closely with our customers in securing design wins, defining new products and in implementing and integrating our products into their systems. We also focus on selling our complete portfolio of products to our existing customers, as we believe the technical expertise of our marketing and sales teams allows us to identify and capitalize on cross-selling opportunities.  Focus on fast-growing market segments and regions   We have chosen to target the analog and mixed-signal sub-segments of some of the most exciting and fastest growing end-markets. We participate in these markets by focusing on specific product areas within the analog and mixed-signal market, including products for enterprise computing equipment, communications infrastructure, high-end consumer equipment and certain broad-based industrial markets. All of these markets are characterized by their need for leading-edge, high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductor technologies.  The enterprise computing, communications, high-end consumer, and industrial end-markets we supply are characterized by several trends that we believe drive demand for our products. The key trends that we believe are significant for our future growth include:  • Increasing bandwidth over high-speed networks, fueling growth in high speed multimedia transmission; • Increasing electronic system requirements for smaller, lighter, more highly integrated and feature-rich mobile devices; • Increasing need for more efficient energy management in the home and in industrial environments and the proliferation of "green" standards; and  • Increasing demands for Internet connectivity to low power sensors. Our products address these market trends by providing solutions that are ultra-low power thereby extending battery life, small form factor enabling smaller more mobile devices, highly integrated enabling more functionality within devices, and high-performance enabling product differentiation within our customer base. Additionally, as communications functions are increasingly integrated into a range of systems and devices, these products require analog sensing, processing and control capabilities, which increases the number and size of our targeted end-markets.  Leverage outsourced semiconductor fabrication capacity   We outsource most of our manufacturing in order to focus more of our resources on designing, developing and marketing our products. Our primary outside wafer foundries are bas ed in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Israel, and the United States. We  believe that outsourcing provides us numerous benefits including, capital efficiency, the flexibility to adopt and leverage emerging process technologies without significant investment risk, and a more variable cost of goods, which provides us with greater operating flexibility.  Products and Technology  We design, develop, manufacture and market high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductors and advanced algorithms. We currently operate and account for results in one reportable segment through three product lines: Signal Integrity, Protection, and Wireless and Sensing. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, we restructured and combined the Power and High-Reliability Products Group with the Wireless and Sensing Products Group. Signal Integrity Products.   We design, develop and market a portfolio of optical data communications and video transport products used in a wide variety of enterprise computing, communications, and industrial applications. Our comprehensive portfolio of integrated circuits ("ICs") for data centers, enterprise networks, passive optical networks ("PON"), and wireless base station optical transceivers and high-speed interfaces ranges from 100Mbps to 400Gbps and supports key industry standards such as Fibre Channel, Infiniband, Ethernet, PON and synchronous optical networks. Our video products offer advanced solutions for next generation high-definition broadcast applications, as well as highly differentiated video-over-IP technology for professional audio video ("Pro AV") applications. Protection Products.   We design, develop and market high-performance protection devices, which are often referred to as transient voltage suppressors ("TVS"). TVS devices provide protection for electronic systems where voltage spikes (called transients), such as electrostatic discharge, electrical over stress or secondary lightning surge energy, can permanently damage sensitive ICs. Our portfolio of protection solutions include filter and termination devices that are integrated with the TVS device. Our products provide robust protection while preserving signal integrity in high-speed communications, networking  6 and video interfaces. These products also operate at very low voltage. Our protection products can be found in a broad range of applications including smart phones, LCD and organic light-emitting diode TVs, set-top boxes, monitors and displays, tablets, computers, notebooks, base stations, routers, automobile and industrial instruments. Wireless and Sensing Products.   We design, develop and market a portfolio of specialized radio frequency products used in a wide variety of industrial, medical and communications applications, and specialized sensing products used in industrial and consumer applications. Our wireless products, which include our LoRa® devices and wireless radio frequency technology ("LoRa Technology"), feature industry leading and longest range industrial, scientific and medical radio, enabling a lower total cost of ownership and increased reliability in all environments. This makes these products particularly suitable for machine to machine and IoT applications. Our unique sensing technology enables smart proximity sensing and advanced user interface solutions for our mobile and consumer products. Our wireless and sensing products can be found in a broad range of applications in the industrial, medical, and consumer markets. We also design, develop, and market power product devices that control, alter, regulate, and condition the power within electronic systems focused on the LoRa and IoT infrastructure segment. The highest volume product types within this category are switching voltage regulators, combination switching and linear regulators, smart regulators, isolated switches, and wireless charging. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we had a Systems Innovation Products Group that combined the analog and mixed-signal design competencies from our Sierra Monolithics, Inc. ("SMI") and Gennum Corporation ("Gennum") acquisitions and was chartered with developing innovative analog and mixed-signal intellectual property for emerging systems.  On August 5, 2016, we completed the divestiture of the remaining assets in the Systems Innovation Products Group ("Snowbush IP") to Rambus Inc. ("Rambus") for $32.0 million in cash along with the opportunity to receive additional payments through 2022 based upon a percentage of sales by Rambus of new products expected to be developed by them from the Snowbush IP. In fiscal year 2017, we recorded a gain of $25.5 million on the disposition of the Snowbush IP. Other than this gain, the divestiture did not and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Following the divestiture, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we no longer had a Systems Innovation Products Group. Our sales by product line are as follows:   Fiscal Years (in thousands) 2019   2018   2017 Signal Integrity $ 276,040   $ 263,015   $ 258,824 Wireless and Sensing 190,589   164,569   140,774 Protection 182,068   176,482   149,865 Systems Innovation —   —   205 Other: Warrant Shares  (1) (21,501 )   (16,219 )   (5,396 ) Total $ 627,196   $ 587,847   $ 544,272 (1) On October 5, 2016, we issued a warrant (the "Warrant") to Comcast Cable Communications Management LLC ("Comcast") to purchase up to 1,086,957 shares of our common stock. The Warrant was issued in connection with an agreement between the parties regarding the intended trial deployment by Comcast of a low-power wide-area Network ("LPWAN") in the U.S., based on our LoRa Technology. As of January 27, 2019, the Warrant was fully vested and exercisable for a total of 869,565 shares, with no additional costs to be recognized in future periods. The Warrant was fully exercised and no longer outstanding as of March 15, 2019. Recent Acquisitions On December 11, 2018, the Company, through its subsidiary Semtech (International) AG, a Swiss corporation, completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of Trackio International AG, a Swiss corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively, "TrackNet"), for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $8.5 million. TrackNet is a provider of LoRa-based end-to-end solutions for the IoT and provides expertise and intellectual property that will be integrated into the Company's business to support its goal of enabling the growing ecosystem around the Company's LoRa Technology. On May 2, 2018, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of IC Interconnect, Inc. (“ICI”) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $7.4 million. The addition of ICI is intended to enhance the Company’s U.S. research and development capabilities for its next-generation Z-Pak™ platform.  On July 1, 2017, the Company acquired AptoVision Technologies Inc. ("AptoVision"), a privately-held provider of uncompressed, zero-frame latency, video-over-IP solutions addressing the Pro AV market. The unique combination of AptoVision's advanced algorithms for real-time, full bandwidth video transmission over IP networks, and Semtech's industry leading high-speed signal integrity and chip development expertise is expected to enable the adoption of Software Defined Video over Ethernet ("SDVoE") and accelerate this natural progression in the evolution of video transport. This transaction expanded the portfolio of our Signal Integrity Products Group. 7 S emtech End-Markets  Our products are sold primarily to customers in the enterprise computing, industrial, high-end consumer, and communications end-markets. Our estimate of sales by major end-market is detailed below:    Fiscal Years (percentage of sales) 2019   2018  (1)   2017  (1) Enterprise Computing 32  %   33  %   34  % Industrial 32  %   29  %   29  % High-End Consumer  27  %   29  %   24  % Communications 12  %   12  %   14  % Other: Warrant Shares (3 )%   (3 )%   (1 )% Total 100  %   100  %   100  % ( 1) Reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current classification. We believe that our diversity in end-markets provides stability to our business and opportunity for growth. The following table depicts our main product lines and their end-market and product applications:   Typical End-Product Applications Product Groups Enterprise Computing    Communications    High-End Consumer    Industrial Signal Integrity Optical Transceiver Module IC’s supporting 100Mb/s to 400Gb/s for Ethernet, Fibre Channel, CPRI protocols in data center and PON applications      Optical Transceiver Module IC's for 4G/5G/LTE base stations Optical Transceiver Module IC’s supporting 100Mb/s to 100Gb/s for Telecom applications, Backplane CDR's and signal conditioners         Serial Digital Interconnect interface IC’s for Broadcast Video, Video over IP technology for Pro AV applications                 Protection Servers, workstations, desktop PC/ notebooks, ultrabooks, optical modules, printers, copiers    4G/5G/LTE base stations, 1/10 Gb/s Ethernet    Smartphones, tablets, wearables cameras, TVs, set top boxes    Industrial automation, measurement & instrumentation, automotive, IoT                 Wireless and Sensing      4G/5G/LTE wireless base stations    Smartphones, media players, tablets, digital/still video cameras    Automated meter readers, industrial automation, IoT, keyless entry, hearing aids Seasonality Historically, our results have reflected some seasonality, with demand levels generally being slightly lower in the industrial and high-end consumer products end-markets during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year in comparison to the second and third quarters. Intellectual Capital and Product Development The development of intellectual property ("IP") and the resulting proprietary products is a critical success factor for us. Recruiting and retaining key technical talent is the foundation for designing, developing, and marketing our IP in the form of new proprietary products in the global marketplace. Our ability to recruit and retain our engineering talent is one of the keys to maintaining our competitive advantage. Historically, we have been successful in retaining our key engineering staff and recruiting new talent. One of our strategies to recruit talent is the establishment of multiple design center locations. As a result, we have design centers throughout the world. 8 Circuit design engineers, layout engineers, product and test engineers, application engineers, and field application engineers are our most valuable employees. Together they perform the critical tasks of design and layout of ICs, turning these circuits into silicon devices, and conferring with customers about designing these devices into their applications. The majority of our engineers fit into one of these categories. Most of these engineers have many years of experience in the design, development,  and layout of circuits targeted for use in protection, advanced communications and power management, multimedia and data communications, and wireless and sensing applications. We also employ a number of software engineers and systems engineers that specialize in the development of software and systems architecture, who enable us to develop systems oriented products in select markets. In fiscal year  2019 , we incurred  $109.9 million  of product development and engineering expense, which represents  18%  of net sales. Product development and engineering expense for fiscal years  2018  and  2017  were   $104.8 million  and  $102.5 million , respectively, or  18%  and  19%  of net sales,  respectively. We occasionally enter into agreements with customers that allow us to recover certain costs associated with product design and engineering services. Any recovery for these services is typically recognized upon completion of services, which historically lags behind the period in which we recognize the related expense. This difference in recognition timing can create volatility in our reported product development and engineering expenses. Sales and Marketing Net sales made directly to custome rs during fiscal years  2019 ,  2018  and  2017 , were approximately  32% ,  34%  and  35%  of total net sales, respectively. The remaining  68% ,  66%  and  65%  of net sales were made through independent distributors. The decline in direct sales is primarily related to growth in our industrial end-market sales, which includes our LoRa Technology products, as these products are predominantly sold through our distributors.   We have direct sales personnel located throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia who manage the sales activities of independent sales representative firms and independent distributors. We expense our advertising costs as they are incurred. We operate internationally through our foreign subsidiaries. Semtech (International) AG serves the European and Asian markets from its headquarters in Rapperswil, Switzerland, and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") and Japan. Semtech (International) AG also maintains branch offices, either directly or through one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, in multiple countries including China, Taiwan, and South Korea. Semtech Canada Corporation serves the Canadian market for most of the products from our Signal Integrity Products Group, from its headquarters in Burlington, Ontario. Independent representatives and distributors are also used to serve customers throughout the world. Some of our distributors and sales representatives also offer products from our competitors, as is customary in the industry.

The majority of our backlog is typically requested for delivery within six months. In markets where the end system life cycles are relatively short, customers typically request delivery in four to eight weeks. A backlog analysis at any given time gives little indication of our future business except on a short-term basis, principally within the next 45 days. We do not have any significant backlog with deliveries beyond 18 months. Manufacturing Capabilities Our strategy is to outsource most of our manufacturing functions to third-party foundries and assembly and test contractors. The third-party foundries fabricate silicon wafers, while the assembly and test contractors package and test our products. We believe this outsourcing permits us to take advantage of the best available technology, leverage the capital investment of others, and reduce our operating costs associated with manufacturing assets. 10 We perform a limited amount of internal probe and final test activities at our facilities in Camarillo, Irvine, and San Diego in California; Neuchâtel in Switzerland; and Reynosa in Mexico. These activities accommodate situations in which tight coupling with product design is desirable or where there are unique requirements. A majority of our very small form factor protection devices are packaged at our facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Our packaged discrete rectifier products are packaged and tested in-house in Reynosa, Mexico. Almost all of our other products are packaged and tested by outside subcontractors. In keeping with our mostly "fabless" business model, we have no wafer fabrication facilities except for our operation in Reynosa, Mexico. For fiscal year  2019 , the Reynosa facility provided almost all of the silicon for our packaged discrete rectifier products, which were approxim ately  2%  of our end product net sales. The remaining end products representing  98%  of our net sales were supported with finished silicon wafers purchased from third-party wafer foundries in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Israel and the U.S.  We anticipate that substantially all the silicon wafers we require will come from third-party foundries in fiscal year  2020 . Despite our use of third-party wafer foundries for sourcing a majority of our silicon needs, we do maintain internal process development capabilities. Our process engineers work closely with our third-party foundries on the improvement and development of process capabilities. In fiscal year  2019 , we purchased the vast majority of our wafers from approximately five different third-party wafer foundries and used various manufacturing processes, including Bipolar, CMOS, RF-CMOS and Silicon Germanium ("SiGe") BiCMOS processes. While we do have some redundancy of fabrication processes by using multiple third-party foundries, any interruption of supply by one or more of these foundries could materially impact us. As a result, we maintain some amount of business interruption insurance in part to help reduce the financial risk associated with a wafer supply interruption, but we are not fully insured against this risk. Although our products are made from basic materials (principally silicon, metals and plastics), all of which are available from a number of suppliers, capacity at wafer foundries sometimes becomes constrained. The limited availability of certain materials, such as silicon wafer substrates, may impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand needs or impact the price we are charged. The prices of certain other basic materials, such as metals, gases and chemicals used in the production of ICs can exhibit price volatility depending on the changes in demand for these basic commodities. In most cases we do not procure these materials ourselves, but we are nevertheless reliant on these materials for producing our products because our third-party foundry and package and test subcontractors must procure them. To help minimize risks associated with constrained capacity, we use multiple foundries and have taken other steps to prevent supply interruptions at certain foundries and subcontractors. In fiscal years  2019 ,  2018 , and  2017 , a Chinese foundry provid ed  16% ,  20%  and  25%  of our total silicon requirements in terms of cost of wafers purchased, respectively. In addition to our development and production facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which provides assembly services for a majority of our very small form factor protection devices, we use third-party subcontractors to perform almost all of our other assembly and test operations. A majority of our offshore assembly and test activity is conducted by third-party subcontractors based in China, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines. We have operations offices located in the Philippines, Malaysia and China that support and coordinate some of the worldwide shipment of products. We have installed our own test equipment at some of our packaging and testing subcontractors in order to ensure a certain level of capacity, assuming the subcontractor has ample employees to operate the equipment. Our arrangements with both third-party wafer foundries and package and test subcontractors are designed to provide some assurance of capacity but are not expected to assure access to all the manufacturing capacity we may need in the future. Competition The analog and mixed-signal semiconductor and advanced algorithms industries are highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures to continue. Our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit and retain key engineering talent, our ability to execute on new product developments, and our ability to persuade customers to design these new products into their applications.  Our industry is characterized by decreasing average unit selling prices over the life of a product as the volumes typically increase. However, price decreases can sometimes be quite rapid and faster than the rate of increase of the associated product volumes. We believe we compete effectively based upon our ability to capitalize on efficiencies and economies of scale in production and sales, and our ability to maintain or improve our productivity and product yields to reduce manufacturing costs. We are in direct and active competition, with respect to one or more of our product lines, with numerous manufacturers of varying size, technical capability and financial strength. A number of these competitors are dependent on semiconductor products as their principal source of income, and some are much larger and better resourced than we are. The number of competitors has grown due to expansion of the market segments in which we participate. Additionally, there has been a trend toward consolidation in our industry as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry.  11 Such consolidations may make it more difficult for us to compete effectively, including on the basis of price, sales and marketing programs, channel coverage, technology or product functionality. Intellectual Property and Licenses We have been granted  201  U.S. patents and  152  foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending with respect to our products and to technologies associated with our business. The expiration dates of issued patents range from 2019 to 2038. Although we consider patents to be helpful in maintaining a competitive advantage, we do not believe they create definitive competitive barriers to entry. There can be no assurance that our patent applications will lead to issued patents, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies, or that our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by others.  We have no revenue from patents that expire in calendar year 2019 and no material revenue associated with patents that expire in 2020 or 2021. We have registered many of our trademarks in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. Registration generally provides rights in addition to basic trademark protections and is typically renewable upon proof of continued use. We have registered, or are in the process of registering, our SEMTECH trademark in many jurisdictions. In one location use of this trademark is prohibited, but we are permitted to use our Semtech International trade name. This restriction has not had a material impact on our business to date and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in the future. We also have registered certain materials in which we have copyright ownership, which provides additional protection for this intellectual property. Employees As of  January 27, 2019 , we had 1,335 full-time employees. There were 509 employees in research and development, 260 in sales, marketing and field services, and 192 in general, administrative and finance. The remaining employees support operational activities, including product and test engineering, assembly, manufacturing, distribution and quality functions. We have not had a work stoppage in the last decade and the only unionized employees are approximately 167 Mexican nationals who work at our  manufacturing facility in Reynosa, Mexico. Our employee relations during the last fiscal year have been, and remain, satisfactory. We adjust our workforce from time to time to meet the changing needs of our business. Competition for key design engineering talent globally is significant. Government Regulations and Environmental Matters We are required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with numerous government regulations that are normal and customary to businesses in our industry and that operate in our markets and operating locations. Our sales that serve the military and aerospace markets primarily consist of high-reliability products that are offered within our Wireless and Sensing product line that have been qualified to be sold in these markets by the U.S. Department of Defense ("DOD"). In order to maintain these qualifications, we must comply with certain specifications promulgated by the DOD. As part of maintaining these qualifications, we are routinely audited by the DOD. Based on current specifications, we believe we can maintain our qualifications for the foreseeable future. However, these specifications could be modified by the DOD in the future or we could become subject to other government requirements, which could make the manufacturing of these products more difficult and thus could adversely impact our profitability in the Wireless and Sensing Product Group. In fiscal year  2019 , our sales that serve military and aerospace markets made up 2% of net sales. The U.S. State Department has determined that a small number of special assemblies from the Wireless and Sensing product line are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR"). We have a Technical Assistance Agreement in place that permits us to assemble certain of these products in Mexico. International shipments of products subject to ITAR require a State Department license.

Risk Factors You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the risk factors listed below. The risks described below are not the only ones facing our Company. Additional risks not now known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business could be materially harmed. If our business is harmed, the trading price of our common stock could decline. As discussed earlier in "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements," this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of such risks and uncertainties and certain factors including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, information under the section "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and additional factors that accompany the related forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in the Company's other filings with the SEC, and in material incorporated herein and therein by reference.  In light of the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking information included herein that may cause actual performance and results to differ materially from those predicted, any such forward-looking information should not be regarded as representations or guarantees by the Company of future performance or results, or that its objectives or plans will be achieved or that any of its operating expectations or financial forecasts will be realized. Reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking information contained herein, which reflect management's analysis only as of the date hereof. Except as required by law, the Company assumes no obligation to publicly release the results of any update or revision to any forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect new information, events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated or future events, or otherwise. Risks Relating to General Business Conditions   Our future results may fluctuate, fail to match past performance or fail to meet expectations. Our results may fluctuate in the future, may fail to match our past performance or fail to meet our expectations and the expectations of analysts and investors. Our results and related ratios, such as gross margin, operating income percentage and effective tax rate may fluctuate as a result of:  • general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products; • seasonality and variability in the computer market and our other end-markets; • the timing of new product introductions by us, our customers and our competitors; • product obsolescence; • the scheduling, rescheduling or cancellation of orders by our customers; • the cyclical nature of demand for our customers’ products; • our ability to predict and meet evolving industry standards and consumer preferences; • our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production; • our ability to integrate and realize synergies from recent acquisitions; • changes in manufacturing yields; • capacity utilization; • product mix and pricing; • movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates; • the availability of adequate supply commitments from our outside suppliers; • the manufacturing and delivery capabilities of our subcontractors; and • litigation and regulatory matters. As a result of these factors, our past financial results are not necessarily indicative of our future results.  13 Downturns in the business cycle could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, which are characterized by reduced product demand, production overcapacity, increased levels of inventory, industry-wide fluctuations in the demand for semiconductors and the significant erosion of average selling prices. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may cause us to experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in our operating results. The growth rate of the global economy is one of the factors affecting demand for semiconductor components. Many factors could adversely affect regional or global economic growth including increased price inflation for goods, services or materials, rising interest rates in the U.S. and the rest of the world, or tight credit markets. In addition, economic slowdowns may also affect our customers’ ability to pay for our products. Accordingly, economic slowdowns may harm our business.  The average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased rapidly and will likely do so in the future, which could harm our revenue and gross margins. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, the average selling price of a particular product has historically declined significantly over the life of the product. In the past, we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors. We expect that we will have to similarly reduce prices in the future for older generations of products. Reductions in our average selling prices to one customer could also impact our average selling prices to all customers. A decline in average selling prices would harm our gross margins for a particular product. If not offset by sales of other products with higher gross margins, our overall gross margins may be adversely affected. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes, reducing our costs and developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis, with higher selling prices or gross margins. Current global economic conditions and the potential changes in global economic policy could reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Uncertainty about global economic conditions can pose a risk to the overall economy by causing fluctuations to and reductions in consumer and commercial spending. Demand for our products could be different from our expectations due to many factors including changes in business and economic conditions, conditions in the credit market that affect consumer confidence, customer acceptance of our products, changes in customer order patterns, including order cancellations, and changes in the level of inventory held by vendors. In particular, in fiscal year  2019 , sales to customers in China comprised  55%  of our net sales. The recent economic slowdown in China could adversely affect our sales to customers in China and consequently, our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, changes in U.S. and global social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment could adversely affect our business.  Changes in government trade policies could have an adverse impact on our business or the business of our customers, which may materially adversely affect our business operations, sales or gross margins. The U.S. government has recently made statements and taken certain actions that have led to, and may lead to, further changes to U.S. and international trade policies, including recently imposed tariffs affecting certain products exported by a number of U.S. trading partners, including China. For example, during 2018, the U.S. and China each imposed new tariffs, and announced further proposed tariffs, on various products imported from China and the U.S., respectively. Between July 2018 and September 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (“USTR”) imposed tariffs of 10% and 25% on three product lists totaling approximately $250 billion in Chinese imports. In particular, in September 2018, the USTR imposed its third round of 10% tariffs on more than 5,700 categories of products imported from China with a value of approximately $200 billion, including parts and materials used in semiconductor manufacturing, which were scheduled to increase to a rate of 25% on March 2, 2019 but have been postponed depending on negotiations between the countries. In response, many of those trading partners, including China, have imposed or proposed new or higher tariffs on U.S. products. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the U.S. and other countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict exactly how, and to what extent, such actions may impact our business, or the business of our customers, partners or vendors. Any unfavorable government policies on international trade, such as capital controls or tariffs, may affect the demand for our products, increase the cost of components, delay production, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Any resulting trade wars could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and could adversely impact our revenues, gross margins and business operations. Business interruptions such as natural disasters could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our corporate headquarters, a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines. We do not maintain earthquake insurance and our business  14 could be harmed in the event of a major earthquake. We generally do not maintain flood coverage, including for our Asian locations where certain of our operations support and sales offices are located. Such flood coverage has become very expensive; as a result we have elected not to purchase this coverage. If one of these locations were to experience a major flood, our business may be harmed.  Our business could be harmed if natural disasters interfere with production of wafers by our suppliers, with assembly and testing of products by our subcontractors, or with our distribution network. We maintain some business interruption insurance to help reduce the effect of such business interruptions, but we are not fully insured against such risks. Likewise, our business could be adversely impacted if a natural disaster were to shut down or significantly curtail production by one or more of our end customers. Any such loss of revenue due to a slowdown or cessation of end customer demand is uninsured.  When natural disasters such as an earthquake or other causes result in wide-spread destruction, the impact on our business may not be readily apparent. This is especially true when trying to assess the impact of the disaster on our end customers, who themselves may not fully understand the impact of the event on their businesses. The full extent and scope of natural disaster impacts, both in terms of direct impact on us and our supply chain, as well as on our end customers (to include their own supply chain issues as well as end-market issues), may not be known for a considerable period of time following the disaster. When any such natural disaster occurs, there can be no assurance that our operating results may not be materially affected as a result of the impact of the disaster on us or on our end customers.  We may experience other causes of business interruptions that may affect our operations and we may not have sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. We rely on third party freight firms for nearly all of our shipments from vendors to assembly and test sites, primarily in Asia, and for shipments of our final product to customers. This includes ground and air transportation. Any significant disruption of such freight business globally or in certain parts of the world, particularly where our operations are concentrated, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. Business interruption insurance may not provide enough protection to compensate us for losses that may occur. Accordingly, any of these disruptions could significantly harm our business.  Terrorist attacks, wars and other acts of violence, or any other national or international crisis, calamity or emergency, may result in interruption to the business activities of many entities, business losses and overall disruption of the economy at many levels. These events may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our customers and suppliers. Additionally, these events or armed conflicts may cause some of our customers or potential customers to reduce the level of expenditures on their services and products that ultimately may reduce our revenue. The consequences of these reductions are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, as a result of these events, insurance premiums for businesses may increase and the scope of coverage may be decreased. Consequently, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for our business and properties. To the extent that these disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, a general decrease in corporate spending, or our inability to effectively market our services and products, our business and operating results could be harmed.  We operate a manufacturing facility in Reynosa, Mexico. Historically, certain regions in Mexico have experienced high levels of violence. Any significant disruption of our operations at this facility could materially affect our ability to generate revenues for certain products within our Wireless and Sensing products line. Some of the products that we produce at this facility require certification by the Defense Contract Audit Agency ("DCAA"). Failure to secure or maintain the required certification, either directly through the DCAA or through a qualifying third party would materially affect our authorization to manufacture applicable products at this facility, and our revenue for certain products within our Wireless and Sensing products line could materially decline.  Risks Relating to Production Operations   We obtain many essential components and materials and certain critical manufacturing services from a limited number of suppliers and subcontractors, most of which are foreign-based entities. Our reliance on a limited number of subcontractors and suppliers for wafers, packaging, testing and certain other processes involves several risks, including potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over the price, timely delivery, reliability and quality of components. These risks are attributable to several factors, including limitations on resources, labor problems, equipment failures or the occurrence of natural disasters. The good working relationships we have established with our suppliers and subcontractors could be disrupted, and our supply chain could suffer, if a supplier or subcontractor were to experience a change in control. There can be no assurance that problems will not occur in the future with suppliers or subcontractors. Disruption or termination of our supply sources or subcontractors could significantly delay our shipments and harm our business. Delays could also damage relationships with current and prospective customers. Any prolonged inability to obtain timely deliveries or quality manufacturing or any other circumstances that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture or package certain components internally could limit our growth and harm our business.  15 We are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials, particularly gold, that are incorporated into our end products or used by our suppliers to process our end products. Increased commodity prices are passed on to us in the form of higher prices from our suppliers, either in the form of general price increases or commodity surcharges. Although we generally deal with our suppliers on a purchase order basis rather than on a long-term contract basis, we generally attempt to obtain firm pricing for volumes consistent with planned production. Our gross margins may decline if we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies to offset the increased cost. We do not enter into formal hedging arrangements to mitigate against commodity risk.  Most of our third-party subcontractors and suppliers, including foundries that supply silicon wafers, are located in foreign countries, including China, Taiwan, South Korea and Israel. For fiscal year  2019 , approximately  16%  of our silicon in terms of cost of wafers, was supplied by a third-party foundry in China, and this percentage could be even higher in future periods. For fiscal years  2018  and  2017 , approximately  20%  and  25%  of our silicon in terms of cost of wafers was supplied by this third-party foundry in China, respectively. While our utilization of multiple third-party foundries does create some redundancy of fabrication processes, any interruption of supply by one or more of these foundries could materially impact us. We maintain some amount of business interruption insurance to help reduce the risk of wafer supply interruption, but we are not fully insured against such risk. In addition, the U.S. government has recently announced import tariffs on goods manufactured in China. See the risk factor captioned "Changes in government trade policies could have an adverse impact on our business or the business of our customers, which may materially adversely affect our business operations, sales or gross margins" above. These tariffs, depending upon their ultimate scope, duration and how they are implemented, could negatively impact our business by continuing to increase our costs and by making our products less competitive. We may not be able to pass such increased costs to our customers. In addition, any relocation of manufacturing facilities or to using suppliers outside of China may increase our costs and could impact the global competitiveness of our products. A majority of our package and test operations are performed by third-party contractors based in China, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the Philippines. Our international business activities, in general, are subject to a variety of potential risks resulting from political and economic uncertainties. Any political turmoil or trade restrictions in these countries, particularly China, could limit our ability to obtain goods and services from these suppliers and subcontractors. The effect of an economic crisis or political turmoil on our suppliers located in these countries may impact our ability to meet the demands of our customers. If we find it necessary to transition the goods and services received from our existing suppliers or subcontractors to other firms, we would likely experience an increase in production costs and a delay in production associated with such a transition, both of which could have a significant negative effect on our operating results, as these risks are substantially uninsured.  Our products may be found to be defective, product liability claims may be asserted against us and we may not have sufficient liability insurance. Manufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process, requiring production in a tightly controlled, clean environment. Minute impurities in our manufacturing materials, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, manufacturing equipment failures, and other defects can cause our products to be non-compliant with customer requirements or otherwise nonfunctional. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage (or both). Since a defect or failure in our product could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them (and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved. Our general warranty policy provides for repair or replacement of defective parts. In some cases, a refund of the purchase price is offered. In certain instances, we have agreed to other warranty terms, including some indemnification provisions, which could prove to be significantly more costly than repair, replacement or refund.  We attempt to limit our liability through our standard terms and conditions and negotiation of sale and other customer contracts, but there is no assurance that such limitations will be accepted or effective. While we maintain some insurance for such events, a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage, if any, and established reserves, or a requirement that we participate in a product recall, would have adverse effects (that could be material) on our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, in the event that our products fail to perform as expected, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The life cycles of some of our products depend heavily upon the life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. End-market products with short life cycles require us to manage closely our production and inventory levels. Inventory may also become obsolete because of adverse changes in end-market demand. We may in the future be adversely affected by obsolete or excess inventories, which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for our  16 products or the estimated life cycles of the end-products into which our products are designed. In addition, some customers restrict how far back the date of manufacture for our products can be and certain customers may stop ordering products from us and go out of business due to adverse economic conditions; therefore, some of our product inventory may become obsolete and, thus, adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Risks Relating to Research and Development, Engineering, Intellectual Property and New Technologies   We may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products, which is central to our objective of maintaining and expanding our business.  We operate in a dynamic environment characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, and design and other technological obsolescence. Our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and cost-effective manner by designing, developing, manufacturing, marketing and providing support for our own new products and technologies. A failure to achieve design wins, to introduce these new products in a timely manner, or to achieve market acceptance for these products on commercially reasonable terms could harm our business. The introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of product sales. The success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of long-term market demand and future technological developments, as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors, including: • timely and efficient completion of technology, product and process design and development; • timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing, assembly, and test processes; • the ability to secure and effectively utilize fabrication capacity in different geometries; • product performance; • product quality and reliability; and • effective marketing, sales and service Even if we are able to develop products and achieve design wins, the design wins may never generate revenues if end-customer projects are unsuccessful in the marketplace or the end-customer terminates the project, which may occur for a variety of reasons. Mergers and consolidations among customers may lead to termination of certain projects before the associated design win generates revenue. If design wins do generate revenue, the time lag between the design win and meaningful revenue can be uncertain and could be significant. If we fail to develop products with required features or performance standards or experience even a short delay in bringing a new product to market, or if our customers fail to achieve market acceptance of their products, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely impacted. Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of product sales. Prior to purchasing our products, our customers require that our products undergo an extensive qualification process, which involves testing of the products in the customer's system as well as rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process may continue for six months or longer. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not ensure any sales of the product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to the product or software, changes in the manufacturing process or the selection of a new supplier by us may require a new qualification process, which may result in delays and in us holding excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it can take an additional six months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, toward qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales of such product to the customer, which may impede our growth and cause our business to suffer. Our products may fail to meet new industry standards or requirements and the efforts to meet such industry standards or requirements could be costly . Many of our products are based on industry standards that are continually evolving. Our ability to compete in the future will depend in part on our ability to anticipate, identify and ensure compatibility or compliance with these evolving industry standards. The emergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by our customers and potential customers. As a result, we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards or requirements, we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial conditions. 17 We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights. We pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies, but we rely primarily on trade secret protections through a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty, to protect our know-how and processes. We intend to continue protecting our proprietary technology, including through trademark and copyright registrations and patents. Despite this intention, we may not be successful in achieving adequate protection. Our failure to adequately protect our material know-how and processes could harm our business. There can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights, that our patent applications will lead to issued patents, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies, or that our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by others. Furthermore, the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the U.S.  We may suffer losses and business interruption if our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others. The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Due to the number of competitors, intellectual property infringement is an ongoing risk since other companies in our industry could have intellectual property rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims. Any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management’s resources. If one of our products is found to infringe on a third party’s rights, we may have liability for past infringement and may need to seek a license to use such intellectual property going forward. If a license is not available or if we are unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the product.  We must commit resources to product production prior to receipt of purchase commitments and could lose some or all of the associated investment. Sales are made primarily on a current delivery basis, pursuant to purchase orders that may be revised or cancelled by our customers without penalty, rather than pursuant to long-term contracts. Some contracts require that we maintain inventories of certain products at levels above the anticipated needs of our customers. As a result, we must commit resources to the production of products without binding purchase commitments from customers. Our inability to sell products after we devote significant resources to them could harm our business.  Risks Relating to International Operations   We sell and trade with foreign customers, which subjects our business to increased risks. Sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately  89%  of net sales in the fiscal year ended  January 27, 2019 . Sales to our customers located in China (including Hong Kong), South Korea and Vietnam constituted  55% ,  5%  and  5% , respectively, of net sales for fiscal year  2019 . International sales are subject to certain risks, including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers, political and economic instability, difficulties in accounts receivable collection, difficulties in managing distributors and representatives, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations and potentially adverse tax consequences. Other risks include local business and cultural factors that may differ from our domestic standards and practices, including business practices from which we are prohibited from engaging by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, laws of certain foreign countries that may not protect our products, assets or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws, and difficulties enforcing contracts in such foreign countries generally. These factors may harm our business. Our use of the Semtech name may be prohibited or restricted in some countries, which may negatively impact our sales efforts. In addition, substantially all of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S. Dollars and currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we do business could harm us by resulting in pricing that is not competitive with prices denominated in local currencies.  Our foreign currency exposures may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon financial results.  As a global enterprise, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Certain of our assets, including certain bank accounts, exist in non-U.S. Dollar-denominated currencies, which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The non-U.S. Dollar-denominated currencies are principally the Swiss Franc, Euro, Canadian Dollar, Mexican Peso, Japanese Yen and Great British Pound. We also have a significant number of employees that are paid in foreign currency, the largest groups being United Kingdom-based employees who are paid in Great British Pound, Switzerland-based employees who are paid in Swiss Francs, Canada-based employees who are paid in Canadian Dollars, China-based employees who are paid in Chinese Renminbi and Mexican nationals who are paid in Mexican Pesos.  If the value of the U.S. Dollar weakens relative to these specific currencies, as it has done in recent years, the cost of doing business in terms of U.S. Dollars rises. Whereas if the value of the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to these specific currencies,  18 it could make the pricing of our products less competitive and affect demand for our products. With the growth of our international business, our foreign currency exposures may grow and under certain circumstances, could harm our business.  As a means of managing our foreign exchange exposure, we routinely convert U.S. Dollars into foreign currency in advance of the expected payment. We regularly assess whether or not to hedge foreign exchange exposure. Any future use of forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange exposure may be required to be marked-to-market each quarter and can create volatility in net income not directly tied to our operating results.  We may be subject to increased tax liabilities and an increased effective tax rate if we need to remit funds held by our foreign subsidiaries. As of  January 27, 2019 , our foreign subsidiaries held $676.0 million of unremitted foreign earnings. With the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), all post-1986 previously unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued were subject to U.S. tax. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we have determined that  $516.0 million  of foreign earnings (“Reinvested Funds”) will continue to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the U.S. As a result, we have not recorded a provisional income tax expense for these amounts because we believe that we currently have the ability to keep those earnings indefinitely invested and we have specific plans for reinvestment of these undistributed foreign earnings. In connection with the enactment of the Tax Act, we have determined that we will remit approximately $240.0 million of foreign earnings, of which $80.0 million was remitted during fiscal year 2019, in the foreseeable future, and as a result, we have established a deferred income tax liability for the withholding tax that will be due upon distribution of these earnings. If we needed to remit all or a portion of our Reinvested Funds to the U.S. for investment in our domestic operations, any such remittance could result in increased tax liabilities and a higher effective tax rate. For more information, see Note  12  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are subject to export restrictions and laws affecting trade and investments. As a global company headquartered in the U.S., we are subject to U.S. laws and regulations that limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including, in certain cases, dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with these laws has not significantly limited our operations or our sales in the recent past, but could significantly limit them in the future. We maintain an export compliance program but there are risks that the compliance controls could be circumvented, exposing us to legal liabilities. We must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments. Although these restrictions and laws have not significantly restricted our operations in the recent past, there is a risk that they could do so in the future. For example, on March 8, 2016, the U.S. Department of Commerce published a final rule in the Federal Register that amended the Export Administration Regulations by adding ZTE Corporation ("ZTE") and three of its affiliates to the “Entity List” for actions contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the U.S. This rule imposed new export licensing requirements on exports, re-exports, and in-country transfers of all U.S.-regulated products, software and technology to the designated ZTE entities, which prevented sales of Semtech's U.S. regulated products to ZTE since license requests were subject to a general policy of denial. On March 24, 2016, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a temporary general license authorizing most exports to ZTE and one of its designated affiliates through June 30, 2016, thereby enabling us to resume sales to ZTE. The temporary license was repeatedly extended until the Bureau of Industry and Security removed ZTE from the Entity List on March 29, 2017, after ZTE entered a guilty plea and agreed to pay a combined penalty of up to $1.19 billion to settle civil and criminal allegations against it. However, part of this plea deal included the imposition of a Denial Order against ZTE and one of its affiliates, which was initially suspended, but later imposed on April 15, 2018, leading to restrictions on export, re-export or transfer of any items subject to U.S. regulations to ZTE and the listed affiliate. This again impacted our ability to sell certain items to ZTE until the Denial Order was terminated on July 13, 2018. ZTE is still subject to the terms of its settlement agreement that includes the potential for re-imposition of the Denial Order. This or future regulatory activity may materially interfere with our ability to make sales to ZTE or other customers, such as Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., which was recently indicted by the U.S. government for violating U.S. sanctions and bank and wire fraud, among other charges, and could potentially be subject to export restrictions in the future. In addition, our association with customers that are or become subject to U.S. regulatory scrutiny or export restrictions could subject us to actual or perceived reputational harm among current or prospective investors, suppliers or customers, customers of our customers, other parties doing business with us, or the general public. Any such reputational harm could result in the loss of investors, suppliers or customers, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects.  Risks Relating to Sales, Marketing and Competition   We compete against larger, more established entities and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively. 19 The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, and design and other technological obsolescence. We compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products.  We expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants in the semiconductor market. Our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving area of integrated circuit technology depends on several factors, including:  • success in designing and manufacturing new products that implement new technologies; • protection of our processes, trade secrets and know-how; • maintaining high product quality and reliability; • pricing policies of our competitors; • performance of competitors’ products; • ability to deliver in large volume on a timely basis; • marketing, manufacturing and distribution capability; and • financial strength. To the extent that our products achieve market success, competitors typically seek to offer competitive products or lower prices; if they are successful, they could harm our business.  Industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results.  There has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our industry as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. Some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they individually had offered. Such consolidations or strategic partnerships may continue in the future. The companies or alliances resulting from these possible consolidations may create more compelling bundled products as well as being able to offer greater pricing flexibility, making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, including on the basis of price, sales and marketing programs, channel coverage, technology or product functionality. Continued industry consolidation may adversely impact customers' perceptions of the viability of smaller and even medium-sized semiconductor companies such as ourselves and, consequently, customers' willingness to purchase from us. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors, with more efficient cost structures that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for our end-customers. This could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We receive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and the loss of any one of these customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our business. Our largest customers have varied from year to year. Historically, we have had significant customers that individually accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenues in certain quarters or years or represented 10% or more of net accounts receivables at any given date. Sales to our customers are generally made on open account, subject to credit limits we may impose, and the receivables are subject to the risk of being uncollectible.  The volatility of customer demand limits our ability to predict future levels of sales and profitability.  We primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-term contracts. The loss of any significant customer, any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers, the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s significant program or product could harm our business. Semiconductor suppliers can rapidly increase production output in response to slight increases in demand, leading to a sudden oversupply situation and a subsequent reduction in order rates and revenues as customers adjust their inventories to account for shorter lead times. Conversely, when circumstances create longer lead times customers may order in excess of what they need to ensure availability, then cancel orders if lead times are reduced. A rapid and sudden decline in customer demand for products or cancellation of orders can result in excess quantities of certain products relative to demand. Should this occur, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of charges to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to the estimated demand level or market price. Our quarterly revenues are highly dependent upon turns fill orders (orders booked and shipped in the same quarter). The short-term and volatile nature of customer demand makes it extremely difficult to accurately predict near term revenues and profits. 20 Most of our authorized distributors, which collectively represent more than half of our net sales, can terminate their contract with us with little or no notice. The termination of a distributor could negatively impact our business, including net sales and accounts receivable. In fiscal year  2019 , authorized distributors accounted for approximately  68%  of our net sales. We generally do not have long-term contracts with our distributors and most can terminate their agreement with us with little or no notice. For fiscal year  2019 , our two largest distributors were based in Asia.  The termination of any of our distributor relationships could impact our net sales and limit our access to certain end-customers. It could also result in the return of excess inventory of our product held by that distributor. Since many distributors simply resell finished products, they generally operate on very thin profit margins. If a distributor were to terminate an agreement with us or go out of business, our accounts receivable from the particular distributor would be subject to significant collection risk. Our reliance on distributors also subjects us to a number of additional risks, including: • write-downs in inventories associated with stock rotation rights and increases in provisions for price adjustments granted to certain distributors; • potential reduction or discontinuation of sales of our products by distributors; • failure to devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices, in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect; • dependence upon the continued viability and financial resources of these distributors, some of which are small organizations with limited working capital and all of which depend on general economic conditions and conditions within the semiconductor industry; • dependence on the timeliness and accuracy of shipment forecasts and resale reports from our distributors; and • management of relationships with distributors, which can deteriorate as a result of conflicts with efforts to sell directly to our end customers. If any significant distributor becomes unable or unwilling to promote and sell our products, or if we are not able to renew our contracts with the distributors on acceptable terms, we may not be able to find a replacement distributor on reasonable terms or at all and our business could be harmed. Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors. From time to time, it's possible our products could be diverted from our authorized distribution channels and customers may purchase products from the unauthorized "gray market." Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impacts our margins. In addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because when products are purchased outside of our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are buying products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new. Risks Relating to Governmental Regulations, including Taxes, Financial Reporting Rules and Regulations, and Environmental Regulations   Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and an annual report by our independent registered public accounting firm opining on our internal controls over financial reporting. Management is similarly required to review disclosure controls, which are controls established to ensure that information required to be disclosed in SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting.  Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. As a result, any failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 on a timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. 21 We   are subject to government regulations and other standards that impose operational and reporting requirements. We, our suppliers, and our customers are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, foreign, state and local governmental laws, rules and regulations, including laws, rules and regulations governing data privacy protections for personal information, and corrupt practices/anti-bribery prohibitions, impact our business in terms of ongoing monitoring of compliance. Legislation and related regulations in the United Kingdom under that country’s Bribery Act could have extra-territorial application of compliance standards that may be inconsistent with comparable U.S. law, requiring us to re-evaluate and amend our compliance programs, policies and initiatives. The General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") is a comprehensive update to the data protection regime in the European Economic Area that became effective as of May 25, 2018. The cost of compliance with the GDPR and the potential for fines and penalties in the event of a breach of the GDPR may have an adverse effect on our operations. The SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") have revised, and continue to revise, their regulations and listing standards. These developments have increased, and may continue to increase, our legal compliance and financial reporting costs. These developments also may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. This, in turn, could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, or qualified executive officers.  Failure to comply with present or future laws, rules and regulations of any kind that govern our business could result in suspension of all or a portion of production, cessation of all or a portion of operations, or the imposition of significant regulatory, administrative, civil, or criminal penalties or sanctions, any of which could harm our business.  Economic conditions and regulatory changes leading up to and following the United Kingdom’s likely exit from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In June 2016, voters in the U.K. approved the country’s exit from the European Union, and the U.K. government has commenced the legal process of leaving the European Union, typically referred to as Brexit. While the full effects of Brexit will not be known for some time, Brexit could cause disruptions to, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business and results of operations. The most immediate effect has been significant volatility in global equity and debt markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Ongoing global market volatility and a deterioration in economic conditions due to uncertainty surrounding Brexit could significantly disrupt the markets in which we operate and lead our customers to closely monitor their costs and delay capital spending decisions. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to E.U. markets, either during a transitional period or more permanently. The measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose customers and employees. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences, including fines, suspension of production, excess inventory, sales limitations, and criminal and civil liabilities.  We are subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment, including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of those products and those related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals and the incorporation of such substances into products available for sale. If we or our suppliers were to incur substantial additional expenses to acquire equipment or otherwise comply with environmental regulations, product costs could significantly increase, thus harming our business.  Although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations. If we violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, liabilities under various statutes for the cleanup of pollutants at locations we have operated and at third-party disposal and recycling sites we have used.  Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor packaging. There is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of lead-free products may be less favorable compared to lead-based products or that the transition to lead-free products may produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory.  22 Future environmental legal requirements may become more stringent or costly and our compliance costs and potential liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances may harm our business and our reputation.  Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to comply with their codes of conduct, which may include certain restrictions that may substantially increase our cost of doing business as well as have an adverse effect on our operating efficiencies, operating results and financial condition .  Certain of our customers and suppliers require us to agree to comply with their codes of conduct, which may include detailed provisions on labor, human rights, health and safety, environment, corporate ethics and management systems. Certain of these provisions are not requirements under the laws of the countries in which we operate and may be burdensome to comply with on a regular basis. Moreover, new provisions may be added or material changes may be made to any these codes of conduct, and we may have to promptly implement such new provisions or changes, which may substantially further increase the cost of our business, be burdensome to implement and adversely affect our operational efficiencies and operating results. If we violate any such codes of conduct, we may lose further business with the customer or supplier and, in addition, we may be subject to fines from the customer or supplier. While we believe that we are currently in compliance with our customers and suppliers’ codes of conduct, there can be no assurance that, from time to time, if any one of our customers and suppliers audits our compliance with such code of conduct, we would be found to be in full compliance. A loss of business from these customers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities, or by material differences between our forecasted annual effective tax rates and actual tax rates. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in applicable tax laws or their interpretation. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service of the U.S. ("IRS") and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S., Canada or Switzerland, or if the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected. See the risk factor captioned "We may be subject to increased tax liabilities and an increased effective tax rate if we need to remit funds held by our foreign subsidiaries" above. In October 2015, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international association of 34 countries, including the U.S., released the final reports from its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ("BEPS") Action Plans. The BEPS recommendations covered a number of issues, including country-by-country reporting, permanent establishment rules, transfer pricing rules and tax treaties. Although the BEPS recommendations are not themselves changes in tax law, this guidance has resulted in unilateral action by several member countries and is also prompting possible amendment of other countries’ tax laws and regulations on a prospective and potentially retroactive basis. In October 2015, the European Commission concluded that certain member countries had granted unlawful rulings that artificially reduced tax burdens and has ordered the recovery of the unpaid taxes. Future tax law changes resulting from these developments may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. In addition, due to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision, we have hired independent tax advisors to assist us. Significant judgment is required in the calculation of our tax provision and the resulting tax liabilities as well as determination of our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Our estimates of future taxable income and the regional mix of this income can change as new information becomes available. Any such changes in our estimates or assumptions can significantly impact our tax provision in a given period by, for example, requiring us to impair existing deferred tax assets. Such required changes could result in us having to restate our consolidated financial statements. Restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our operating results or have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock. We may be subject to taxation and review of our compliance with income, value-added and other sales-type tax regulations in other jurisdictions which could negatively affect our operations. As a global organization, we may be subject to a variety of transfer pricing or permanent establishment challenges by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. If certain of our non-U.S. activities were treated as carrying on business as a permanent establishment and therefore, subject to income tax in such jurisdiction, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.  We are required to comply with rules regarding value-added taxes and other sales-type taxes in various jurisdictions. If these taxes are not properly collected and paid, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. 23 We have limited experience with government contracting, which entails differentiated business risks.  Although such contracts have not constituted a material portion of our revenue in the past, we may from time-to-time derive revenue from contracts and subcontracts with agencies of, or prime or secondary contractors to, the U.S. government, including U.S. military agencies. Consequently, we are subject to certain business risks that are particular to companies that contract with U.S. government agencies. These risks include the ability of the U.S. government or related contractors to unilaterally: • terminate contracts at its convenience;  • terminate, modify or reduce the value of existing contracts, if there are budgetary constraints or needed changes;  • cancel multi-year contracts and related orders, if funds become unavailable;  • adjust contract costs and fees on the basis of audits performed by U.S. government agencies;  • control and potentially prohibit the export of our products;  • require that we continue to supply products despite the expiration of a contract under certain circumstances;  • require that we fill certain types of rated orders for the U.S. government prior to filling any orders for other customers; and  • suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of any alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations.  In addition, because we may enter into defense industry contracts with respect to products that are sold both within and outside of the U.S., we are subject to the following additional risks in connection with government contracts: • the need to bid on programs prior to completing the necessary design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties, delays and/or cost overruns;  • the difficulty in forecasting long-term costs and schedules and the potential obsolescence of products related to long-term fixed price contracts; and  • the need to transfer and obtain security clearances and export licenses, as appropriate. Government investigations and inquiries from regulatory agencies could lead to enforcement actions, fines, restatement of our financial statements or other penalties and could result in litigation against us.  In the past, we have been subject to government investigations and inquiries from regulatory agencies such as the SEC and we have had to restate our historical financial statements in connection with such inquiry related to our historical stock option practices. We may be subject to government investigations and receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future, which may lead to enforcement actions, fines or other penalties.  In addition, litigation has often been brought against a company in connection with the announcement of a government investigation or inquiry from a regulatory agency. Such lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations, which could harm our business. In addition, the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation, a ruling against us, or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results.  If such government investigations or inquiries result in a restatement of our financial statements, this could delay the filing of our subsequent SEC reports which, in turn, might result in the delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq for failure to meet continued listing requirements.  Risks Relating to our Business Strategies, Personnel and Other Operations   The loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could impair our ability to grow our business. Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, marketing and managerial personnel. We are dependent on a relatively small group of key technical personnel with analog and mixed-signal expertise. Personnel with highly skilled managerial capabilities, and analog and mixed-signal design expertise, are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain key employees or that we will be successful in attracting, integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel in the future. If we are unable to retain the services of key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees, our business could be harmed.  24 We face risks associated with companies we have acquired in the past and may acquire in the future. We have expanded our operations through strategic acquisitions, such as the acquisition of SMI in December 2009, Gennum in March 2012, select assets from EnVerv, Inc. in January 2015, Triune Systems, L.L.C. in March 2015, AptoVision in 2017, and ICI and TrackNet in 2018, and we may continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions. Acquisitions may divert management attention and resources from other business objectives. Acquisitions have used and could use in the future a significant portion of our available liquid assets or we could incur debt or issue equity securities to fund acquisitions. Issuance of equity securities could be dilutive to existing shareholders. Debt financing could subject us to restrictive covenants that could have an adverse effect on our business. Although we undertake detailed reviews of proposed acquisition candidates and attempt to negotiate acquisition terms favorable to us, we may encounter difficulties or incur liabilities for which we have no recourse. We cannot provide any assurance that any acquisition will have a positive impact on our future performance.  If we are unsuccessful in integrating acquired companies into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated, then we may not achieve anticipated cost savings or synergies and may experience disruptions that could harm our business. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies include those associated with:  • conforming the acquired company’s standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations; • coordinating new product and process development, especially with respect to highly complex technologies; • assuring acquired products meet our quality standards; • loss of key employees or customers of the acquired company; • hiring additional management and other critical personnel; • increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations; • consolidation of facilities and functions; • the geographic distance between the companies; and • disparate corporate cultures. Acquisitions could have a negative impact on our future earnings by way of poor performance by the acquired company or, if we later conclude we are unable to use or sell an acquired product or technology, we could be required to write down the related intangible assets and goodwill.  We may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in the future which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. We assess our goodwill, other intangible assets and our long-lived assets on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of our assets may not be recoverable, and as and when required by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP") to determine whether they are impaired. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $30.0 million, which represented the entire carrying value of our investment in Multiphy Ltd. ("Multiphy"). Future restructuring or appraisal of our business impacting fair value of our assets or changes in estimates of our future cash flows could affect our impairment analysis in future periods and cause us to record either an additional expense for impairment of assets previously determined to be partially impaired or record an expense for impairment of other assets. Depending on future circumstances, we may never realize the full value of intangible assets. Any future determination or impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill and other intangibles could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. We have investments in entities that we do not control. Losses in the value of such investments could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. We have investments in entities that we do not control, including equity and cost method investments. Our interests in such entities do not provide us with control over the business strategy, financial goals, development roadmaps or other operational aspects of these entities. We cannot provide assurance that these entities will operate in a manner that will increase or maintain the value of our investment, that our proportionate share of income or loss from these investments will continue at the current level in the future or that we will not incur losses from the holding of such investments.    To the extent that we have any interest in an entity for which we are required to consolidate, we would need to rely on those entities to timely deliver important financial information to us. In the event that the financial information is inaccurate, incomplete, or not timely, we may not be able to meet our financial reporting obligations as required by the SEC. To the extent we create such arrangements for which we would be required to consolidate and the financial statements of such entities are not prepared by us, we will not have direct control over their financial statement preparation. As a result, we will,  25 for our financial reporting, depend on what these entities report to us, which could result in us adding monitoring and audit processes, which could increase the difficulty of implementing and maintaining adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. This may be particularly true when such entities do not have sophisticated financial accounting processes in place, or where we are entering into new relationships at a rapid pace, straining our integration capacity. Additionally, if we do not receive the information from the variable interest entity on a timely basis, this could cause delays in our external reporting obligations as required by the SEC. Our   ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to service our debt obligations or to obtain additional financing depends on many factors beyond our control.  As of  January 27, 2019 , we had  $212.3 million   of outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured first lien credit facility ("Credit Facility").   Our ability to make payments on amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility, and to fund our operations, will depend on our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow. Our cash flow generation will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.  Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and, if we cannot service our debt, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments, selling assets, or seeking additional equity capital. We may not be able to, if required, effect these actions on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Because of these and other factors beyond our control, we may be unable to pay the interest on or other amounts in respect of our indebtedness.  Restrictive covenants in the credit agreement ("Credit Agreement") governing the Credit Facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.  The Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. The Credit Agreement includes covenants restricting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to:  • incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred stock;  • pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock; • make certain investments and acquisitions; • create liens on our or our subsidiaries’ assets; • enter into transactions with affiliates; • merge or consolidate with another person or sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all of our assets; • make certain payments in respect of other material indebtedness; • alter the business that we conduct; and • make certain capital expenditures. Under the Credit Agreement, we are required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio and an interest expense coverage ratio. Our ability to meet such financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet such ratios. The Credit Agreement also contains various covenants and restrictions and a breach of any covenant or restriction could result in a default under our Credit Agreement. If any such default occurs, the lenders may elect (after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods) to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. Further, following an event of default under the Credit Facility, the lenders will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt. If the debt under the Credit Facility were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that debt that may become due as a result of that acceleration.  26 We rely on certain critical information systems for the operation of our business and a disruption in our information systems, including those related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect our business operations. We maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. These information systems include telecommunications, the Internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications, and e-mail. These information systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers or third parties. These information systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines and networking equipment. To the extent that these information systems are under our control, we have implemented security procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to address the outlined risks; however, security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business. Additionally, any compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, including potential theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets (including our proprietary technology) or the unauthorized release of customer, supplier or employee data and result in a violation of privacy or other laws, thus exposing us to litigation or damage to our reputation. To the extent that our business is interrupted or data or proprietary technology is lost, destroyed or inappropriately used or disclosed, such disruption could adversely affect our competitive position, relationship with customers, suppliers or employees or our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against or repair the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. The costs associated with our indemnification of certain customers, distributors, and other parties could be higher in future periods. In the normal course of our business, we indemnify other parties, including customers, distributors, and lessors, with respect to certain matters. These obligations typically arise pursuant to contracts under which we agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants related to certain matters, such as acts or omissions of our employees, infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, and certain environmental matters. We have not incurred any significant expense as a result of agreements of this type in at least a decade, but there can be no assurances that we will not incur expense under these indemnification provisions in the future.  We have also entered into agreements with our current and former directors and certain of our current and former executives indemnifying them against certain liabilities incurred in connection with their duties. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations with respect to our current and former directors and employees, as does the California Labor Code. We cannot estimate the amount of potential future payments, if any, that we might be required to make as a result of these agreements.  Our stock price could be subject to extreme price fluctuations, and stockholders could have difficulty trading shares. Historically, the market for semiconductor companies has been volatile, and the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations. Fluctuations could be in response to items such as operating results, announcements of technological innovations, or market conditions for semiconductor stocks in general. Additionally, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These market fluctuations, as well as general economic conditions, may adversely affect the price of our common stock.  In addition, the future sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock by us or by our existing stockholders or option holders (including directors, officers, and employees, some of whom hold stock options that are approaching their expiration date) may have an adverse impact on the market price of the shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that the trading price of our common stock will remain at or near its current level.   If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, the trading price of our common stock could decline. The market price of our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. There is no guarantee that these analysts will understand our business and results, or that their reports will be accurate or correctly predict our operating results or prospects. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the market price of our common stock or its trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our common stock or if our operating results or prospects do not meet their expectations, the market price of our common shares could decline significantly . 27 Anti-takeover provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. Certain provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include: • the ability of our board of directors to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of our preferred shares and to issue the preferred shares without stockholder approval; • advance notice requirements for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at  stockholder meetings; and • the inability of stockholders to call a special meeting. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if the third-party's offer may be considered beneficial by many stockholders. As a result, stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares. We are subject to litigation risks which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and could adversely affect our business and financial condition. All industries, including the semiconductor industry, are subject to legal claims, with and without merit, which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general. From time to time in the ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in various claims, litigation, and other legal actions that are normal to the nature of its business, including with respect to IP, contract, product liability, employment, and environmental matters. We believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results or cash flows. However, defense and settlement costs can be substantial, even with respect to claims that we believe have no merit. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. From time to time, we have been, or may in the future be, involved in securities litigation or litigation arising from our acquisitions. We can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any such litigation matter in which we are a party. These types of matters are costly to defend and even if resolved in our favor, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. Such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities or other litigation could harm our ability to obtain credit and financing for our operations and to compete in the marketplace. Because the price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, we can provide no assurance that securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future. In addition, we can provide no assurance that our past or future acquisitions will not subject us to additional litigation. 28 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties Our corporate headquarters is located in Camarillo, California where we own an approximately 88,000 square foot facility. The parcel on which our headquarters is located can accommodate substantial expansion.  As of March 1, 2019, we owned or leased multiple properties. The locations and primary functions of significant properties are summarized in the following table: (1)   Our corporate headquarters have been pledged to secure our obligations under the Credit Facility.     In addition to the properties listed in the above table, we also lease Sales and Marketing, Research and Development, and Administrative offices at various locations in the U.S. and internationally under operating leases, none of which are material to our future cash flows. Our leases expire at various dates through  2027.   We believe that our existing leased and owned space is more than adequate for our current operations, and that suitable replacement and additional space will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms as circumstances warrant. 29 Item 3. Legal Proceedings The descriptions of the legal proceedings in Note  13  to the Consolidated Financial Statements are incorporated by reference into this Item 3. Item 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. 30 PART II Item 5.  Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information Our common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "SMTC."  Holders As of  March 15, 2019 , we had  187 hold ers of record of our common stock. Dividends The payment of dividends on our common stock is within the discretion of our Board of Directors. Currently, we intend to retain earnings to finance the growth of our business. We did not pay cash dividends on our common stock during fiscal year 2019, and our Board of Directors has not indicated an intent to declare a cash dividend on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The credit agreement governing our senior secured first lien credit facilities includes covenants limiting our ability to pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock. Purchases of Equity We maintain a stock repurchase program that was initially approved by our Board of Directors and announced by us in March 2008. The stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and our Board of Directors has authorized expansion of the program over the years. During fiscal year  2019 , we repurchased  $116.2 million  in shares of our common stock. As of  January 27, 2019 , we have repurchased  $267.6 million  in shares of our common stock under the program since its inception and the current remaining authorization under our stock repurchase program is  $180.8 million . Under the program, we may repurchase our common stock at any time or from time to time, without prior notice, subject to market conditions and other considerations. Our repurchases may be made through Rule 10b5-1 and/or Rule 10b-18 or other trading plans, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchases or other transactions. We intend to fund repurchases under the program from cash on hand. We have no obligation to repurchase any shares under the program and may suspend or discontinue it at any time.

(2)   We have realigned resources and infrastructure, resulting in restructuring expense of $0.7 million, $6.3 million, $2.3 million, $4.5 million, and $1.3 million in fiscal years 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, included in selling, general and administrative. (3) Effective January 29, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606) which resulted in increases to net sales of $9.8 million, cost of sales of $2.2 million and provision for income taxes of $1.6 million as compared with the guidance that was in effect before the change. 33 Item 7.   Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results should be read in conjunction with Item 6 "Selected Consolidated Financial Data" and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, based on our current expectations, estimates and projections about our operations, industry, financial condition, performance, operating results, and liquidity. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements of current condition and relate to matters such as future financial performance, future operational performance, the anticipated impact of specific items on future earnings, and our plans, objectives and expectations. Statements containing words such as "may," "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "project," "estimate," "should," "will," "designed to," "projections," or "business outlook," or other similar expressions constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected. Please see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. 34 Overview We are a leading global supplier of high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductors and advanced algorithms and were incorporated in Delaware in 1960. We design, develop, manufacture, and market a broad range of products that are sold principally into applications within the enterprise computing, communications, high-end consumer, and industrial end-markets. Enterprise computing end-markets include data center related equipment, passive optical networks, storage networks, desktops, notebooks, servers, printers, monitors, and computer peripherals. Communications end-market applications include wireless base stations, long-haul optical networks, carrier networks, switches and routers, cable modems, backplane signal conditioners, wireless LAN, and other communication infrastructure equipment. The high-end consumer end-market includes handheld devices, smartphones, tablets, wireless charging, set-top boxes, digital televisions, digital video recorders, thunderbolt cables and other consumer equipment. Applications for the industrial market include analog and digital video broadcast studio equipment, video-over-IP solutions, automated meter reading, smart grid, wireless charging, military and aerospace, medical, security systems, automotive, IoT, industrial and home automation, and other industrial equipment. Our end-customers are primarily OEMs and their suppliers. We report results on the basis of 52 and 53 week periods and our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in January. The fiscal years ended  January 27, 2019 ,  January 28, 2018 , and  January 29, 2017 , each  consisted of  52  weeks. On December 11, 2018, we, through our subsidiary Semtech (International) AG, a Swiss corporation, completed our previously announced acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of TrackNet, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $8.5 million. TrackNet is a provider of LoRa®-based end-to-end solutions for the IoT and provides expertise and intellectual property that will be integrated into our business to support our goal of enabling the growing ecosystem around our LoRa Technology. $4.3 million of the purchase price was attributed to goodwill, and $3.0 million and $0.3 million of the purchase price was attributed to the estimated fair values of the intangible and tangible net assets acquired, respectively. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. Net revenues, earnings and pro forma results of operations have not been presented because they are not material to our consolidated financial statements. We are still in the process of determining the final purchase price allocation. For more information, refer to Note  8  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On May 2, 2018, we acquired substantially all the assets of ICI for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $7.4 million. The addition of ICI is aimed at further enhancing our U.S. research and development capabilities for our next-generation Z-Pak™ platform. $4.9 million of the purchase price was attributed to goodwill and $2.5 million of the purchase price was attributed to the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. Net revenues, earnings and pro forma results of operations have not been presented because they are not material to our consolidated financial statements. For more information, refer to Note  8  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On July 1, 2017, we acquired AptoVision, a privately-held provider of uncompressed, zero-frame latency, video-over-IP solutions addressing the professional audio visual market. The unique combination of AptoVision's advanced algorithms for real-time, full bandwidth video transmission over IP networks, and our industry leading high-speed signal integrity and chip development expertise is expected to enable the adoption of SDVoE accelerating this natural progression in the evolution of video transport.  Under the terms of the share purchase agreement with AptoVision, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interest in AptoVision for a cash payment of $17.6 million at closing, net of acquired cash, and a commitment to pay additional contingent consideration of up to a maximum of $47.0 million over three years if certain goals are achieved in each of the earn-out periods. The fair value of the additional contingent consideration (the "AptoVision Earn-out") as of  January 27, 2019  was $2.2 million, of which $1.3 million is presented within "Accrued liabilities" and $0.9 million is presented within "Other long-term liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Acquisition-related transaction costs of $1.6 million were accounted for as an expense in the period in which the costs were incurred and were presented within "Selling, general and administrative" expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note  3  and Note  13  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We operate and account for results in one reportable segment. See Note  14  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we restructured and combined the Power and High-Reliability operating segment with the Wireless and Sensing operating segment to better align resources with our LoRa-based initiatives. This resulted in having  three  operating segments compared to previously having  four  operating segments. The three operating segments: Signal Integrity, Protection, and Wireless and Sensing, all have similar economic characteristics and have been aggregated into  one  reportable segment identified in the table below as the "Semiconductor Products Group". On August 5, 2016, we completed the divestiture of the remaining assets in the Snowbush IP, now a legacy operating segment, to Rambus for a purchase price of $32.0 million in cash along with the opportunity to receive additional payments through 2022 based upon a percentage of sales by Rambus of new products expected to be developed by them from the Snowbush IP. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we  35 no longer had a Systems Innovation Products Group or an “All others” category, and therefore we have only three operating segments that aggregate into one reportable segment, the Semiconductor Products Group.  Most of our sales to customers are made on the basis of individual customer purchase orders. Many customers include cancellation provisions in their purchase orders. Trends within the industry toward shorter lead-times and "just-in-time" deliveries have resulted in our reduced ability to predict future shipments. As a result, we rely on orders received and shipped within the same quarter for a significant portion of our sales. Sales made directly to customers during fiscal year  2019  were  32%  of net sales. The remaining  68%  of net sales were made through independent distributors. Our business relies on foreign-based entities. Most of our subcontractors and suppliers, including third-party foundries that supply silicon waf ers, are located in foreign countries, including China, Taiwan, South Korea and Israel. For the fiscal year ended  January 27, 2019 , approximately  16%  of our silicon, in terms of cost of wafers purchased, was manufactured in China. Foreign sales for fiscal year  2019  constituted appro ximately  89%  of our net sales. Approximately  76%  of foreign sales in fiscal year  2019  were to customers located in the Asia-Pacific region.   The remaining foreign sales were primarily to customers in   Europe, Canada and Mexico. We use several metrics as indicators of future potential growth. The indicators that we believe best correlate to potential future revenue growth are design wins and new product releases. There are many factors that may cause a design win or new product release to not result in revenue, including a customer decision not to go to system production, a change in a customer’s perspective regarding a product’s value or a customer’s product failing in the end-market. As a result, although a design win or new product introduction is an important step towards generating future revenue, it does not inevitably result in us being awarded business or receiving a purchase commitment. 36 Results of Operations Fiscal Year  2019  Compared with Fiscal Year  2018   All periods presented in the following summary of sales by major end-market reflect our current classification methodology:   Fiscal Years     (in thousands, except percentages) 2019   2018  (1)       Net Sales   % Net Sales   Net Sales   % Net Sales   Change Enterprise Computing $ 203,692   32  %   $ 194,645   33  %   5  % Industrial 201,832   32  %   167,891   29  %   20  % High-End Consumer 169,822   27  %   171,885   29  %   (1 )% Communications 73,351   12  %   69,645   12  %   5  % Other: Warrant Shares (21,501 )   (3 )%   (16,219 )   (3 )%   33  % Total $ 627,196   100  %   $ 587,847   100  %   7  % ( 1) Reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current classification. Net Sales.  Net sales for fiscal year  2019  were  $627.2 million , an  increase  of  7%  compared to  $587.8 million  for fiscal year  2018 . During fiscal year  2019 , our industrial end-market growth benefited from growing demand for our LoRa Technology, which is increasingly becoming the defacto standard for LPWANs. Growth in our Enterprise Computing products benefited from continued data center build outs by cloud and hyper-scale data center customers and on-going demand for our PON solutions. Additionally, fiscal year 2019 reflects a $9.8 million benefit from the adoption of ASC 606. As we enter fiscal year  2020 , the broader macro concerns and extremely soft demand from China is expected to result in first quarter net sales in the range of $125.0 million to $135.0 million.   Gross Profit.  Gross profit was  $377.0 million  and  $352.0 million  in fiscal years  2019  and  2018 , respectively. Our gross margin was  60.1%  for fiscal year  2019 , compa rable with  59.9%  in fiscal year  2018 . Fiscal year  2019  performance benefited from  a more favorable mix of products from the industrial end-market which have a higher gross profit profile.   We expect overall gross margins for fiscal year  2020  to remain consistent with our fiscal year  2019  performance. Operating Costs and Expenses .   Fiscal Years     (in thousands, except percentages) 2019   2018       Cost/Exp.   % Net Sales   Cost/Exp.   % Net Sales   Change Selling, general and administrative $ 151,397   24  %   $ 146,303   27 %   3  % Product development and engineering 109,918   18  %   104,798   19 %   5  % Intangible amortization 26,649   4  %   27,867   5 %   (4 )% Loss on disposition of business operations —   —  %   375   — %   —  % Changes in the fair value of contingent earn-out obligations (9,419 )   (2 )%   3,892   1 %   (342 )% Total operating costs and expenses  $ 278,545   44  %   $ 283,235   52 %   (2 )% Selling, General & Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for fiscal year  2019   increase d by  $5.1 million  as a result of a $20.6 million increase in share-based compensation offset by lower restructuring expenses and the $8.0 million recovery from the settlement of the lawsuit we filed against HiLight Semiconductor Limited and related individual defendants ("HiLight Settlement").  The higher levels of share-based compensation expense in fiscal year 2019 primarily resulted from higher levels of performance achievement for awards with performance-based vesting conditions and the impact of increases in our stock price, and the related fair value re-measurement, of awards accounted for as a liability rather than equity. The levels of selling, general and administrative expenses reported in a fiscal period can be significantly impacted, and therefore experience period over period volatility, by share-based compensation which is substantially influenced by movements in our stock price and assumptions regarding performance vesting conditions. 37 Product Development and Engineering Expenses Product development and engineering expenses for fiscal years  2019  and  2018  were  $109.9 million  and  $104.8 million , respectively, or an  increase  of  5% . The  increase  was primarily a result of higher variable compensation expense and the timing of development activities.  The levels of product development and engineering expenses reported in a fiscal period can be significantly impacted, and therefore experience period over period volatility, by the number of new product tape-outs and by the timing of recoveries from non-recurring engineering services which are recorded as a reduction to product development and engineering expense. Intangible Amortization Intangible amortization was  $26.6 million  and  $27.9 million  in fiscal years  2019  and  2018 , respectively. The decrease is related to the full amortization of finite-lived intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of Gennum Corporation and Cycleo SAS ("Cycleo"). Changes in the Fair Value of Contingent Earn-out Obligations Changes in the fair value of contingent earn-out expense reflects the impact of changes in the estimated probability of achievement of AptoVision Earn-out targets. We measure contingent earn-out liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We use a Monte Carlo valuation method as a valuation technique to determine the value of the earn-out liability. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are revenue projections over the earn-out period, and the probability outcome percentages assigned to each scenario. Significant increases or decreases to either of these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower liability, with a higher liability capped by the  contractual maximum of the contingent earn-out obligation. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate and amount paid will be recorded in earnings.  Interest Expense Interest expense was  $9.2 million  and  $8.0 million  for fiscal years  2019  and  2018 , respectively. The  $1.2 million   increase  is  primarily related to higher interest rates, partially offset by the improvement in our consolidated leverage ratio. Interest on loans made under the Credit Agreement (as defined below) accrues at a rate based in part on our consolidated leverage ratio, which is the ratio of our indebtedness to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, on a consolidated basis. As our sales performance improved, we ended fiscal year 2018 with a consolidated leverage ratio of approximately 1.20. At the end of fiscal year 2019, our consolidated leverage ratio was 1.02 as we continued to benefit from increasing sales and lower debt levels.  We expect our consolidated leverage ratio to continue to improve in fiscal year 2020. The impact of the benefit of improvements to our consolidated leverage ratio on our total interest costs is being more than offset by increases in the 30-day LIBOR rate. If the 30-day LIBOR rate increases 100 basis points, our interest costs for fiscal year  2020  will increase by approximately $2.1 million. Investment Impairments In fiscal year 2019, we fully impaired our investment in Multiphy resulting in a $30.0 million charge compared to a $4.3 million impairment on a cost method investment in fiscal year 2018. (Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes The benefit for income taxes was  $0.1 million  for fiscal year  2019  compared to a provision of  $23.2 million  for fiscal year  2018 . The effective tax rates for fiscal years  2019  and  2018  were a tax benefit of  (0.1%)  and a provision of  38.9% , respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 was primarily driven by a partial release of the valuation allowance that was previously recorded against U.S. deferred tax assets. Specifically, due to the impact of the Tax Act, and based on the weight of all available evidence, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the benefit of certain U.S. deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% primarily due to our regional mix of income and a partial release of the valuation allowance that was previously recorded against our U.S. deferred tax assets. We receive a tax benefit from a tax holiday that was granted in Switzerland. The tax holiday commenced on January 30, 2017, and is effective for five years (“Initial Term”) and can be extended for an additional five years, subject to meeting certain staffing targets. The ability to meet the requirements to extend the ruling is within our control and we do not anticipate any issues meeting the established targets. The maximum benefit under this tax holiday is CHF 500.0 million. Depending on the operational performance of our Swiss operations, it is possible that we could utilize the maximum benefit during the Initial Term.  Once the term of the tax holiday expires or we achieve the maximum benefit, our effective tax rate could be negatively impacted if we are unable to negotiate an extension or expansion of the tax holiday.  38 As a global organization, we are subject to audit by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. To the extent that an audit, or the closure of a statute of limitations results in adjusting our reserves for uncertain tax positions, our effective tax rate could experience extreme volatility since any adjustment would be recorded as a discrete item in the period of adjustment. For further information on the effective tax rate and Tax Act’s impact, see Note  12  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fiscal Year  2018  Compared with Fiscal Year  2017   All periods presented in the following summary of sales by major end-market reflect our current classification methodology:   Fiscal Years     (in thousands, except percentages) 2018  (1)   2017  (1)       Net Sales   % Net Sales   Net Sales   % Net Sales   Change Enterprise Computing $ 194,645   33  %   $ 183,732   34  %   6  % High-End Consumer 171,885   29  %   133,337   24  %   29  % Industrial 167,891   29  %   157,550   29  %   7  % Communications 69,645   12  %   75,049   14  %   (7 )% Other: Warrant Shares (16,219 )   (3 )%   (5,396 )   (1 )%   201  % Total $ 587,847   100  %   $ 544,272   100  %   8  % ( 1) Reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current classification. Net Sales.  Net sales for fiscal year  2018  were  $587.8 million , an  increase  of  8%  compared to  $544.3 million  for fiscal year  2017 . During fiscal year 2018, our revenues within the high-end consumer end-market increased as a result of expanded use of our proximity sensing solutions and protection products across a broader range of phones and other devices. Our enterprise computing end-market benefited from strong demand for our optical products, which are well positioned for the current cycle of data center upgrades and increased PON deployments. The escalating adoption of our LoRa Technology continued to drive growth in the industrial end-market. The decline in our communications end-market was driven by lower demand in surveillance systems and base station markets.    Gross Profit.  Gross profit was  $352.0 million  and  $324.9 million  in fiscal years  2018  and  2017 , respectively. Our gross margin was  59.9%  for fiscal year  2018 , comparable with  59.7%  in fiscal year  2017 . Fiscal year  2018  performance benefited from  a more favorable mix of higher margin product sales, the benefit of which was offset by a $16.2 million charge (2.8% of net sales) related to the Comcast Warrant, which was reported as a reduction to revenue. In fiscal year 2017, the charge related to the Comcast Warrant was $5.4 million (1% of net sales). Operating Costs and Expenses .   Fiscal Years     (in thousands, except percentages) 2018   2017       Cost/Exp.   % Net Sales   Cost/Exp.   % Net Sales   Change Selling, general and administrative $ 146,303   27 %   $ 138,708   25  %   5  % Product development and engineering 104,798   19 %   102,500   19  %   2  % Intangible amortization 27,867   5 %   25,301   5  %   10  % Loss (gain) on disposition of business operations 375   — %   (25,513 )   (5 )%   (101 )% Changes in the fair value of contingent earn-out obligations 3,892   1 %   (215 )   —  %   (1,910 )% Total operating costs and expenses  $ 283,235   52 %   $ 240,781   44  %   18  % Selling, General & Administrative Expenses SG&A expenses for fiscal year  2018   increase d by  $7.6 million   as a result of a $6.3 million increase in share-based compensation and higher restructuring costs of $6.3 million compared to $2.3 million in fiscal year 2017. The higher levels of share-based compensation expense primarily resulted from much higher levels of anticipated performance achievement for awards with performance-based vesting conditions, and the impact of increases in our stock price and the related fair value re-measurement of awards accounted for as a liability rather than equity. Product Development and Engineering Expenses Product development and engineering expenses for fiscal years  2018  and  2017  were  $104.8 million  and  $102.5 million , respectively or an  increase  of  2% . The  increase  was primarily a result of lower recoveries for non-recurring engineering  39 services and incremental spending associated with the development of SDVoE, partially offset by the benefit of lower spending compared with the higher expense associated with our actions in fiscal year 2017 to reduce our investment in the defense and microwave communications markets and the sale of the Snowbush IP to Rambus. The levels of product development and engineering expenses reported in a fiscal period can be significantly impacted, and therefore experience period over period volatility, by the number of new product tape-outs and by the timing of recoveries from non-recurring engineering services which are recorded as a reduction to product development and engineering expense. Intangible Amortization Intangible amortization was  $27.9 million  and  $25.3 million  in fiscal years  2018  and  2017 , respectively. The increase is related to the amortization of intangible assets that were established as part of the purchase price allocation for AptoVision. Gain on Disposition of Business Operations In the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we completed our divestiture of the Snowbush IP to Rambus. As a result, we recognized a gain of $25.5 million on the disposition of this business. Changes in the Fair Value of Contingent Earn-out Obligations The contingent earn-out expense increased by  $4.1 million  in fiscal year  2018  primarily as a result of  the change in our estimated probability of projected net revenue and adjusted earnings associated with the AptoVision Earn-out. We measure contingent earn-out liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We use a Monte Carlo valuation method as a valuation technique to determine the value of the earn-out liability. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are revenue projections over the earn-out period, and the probability outcome percentages assigned to each scenario. Significant increases or decreases to either of these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower liability, with a higher liability capped by the  contractual maximum of the contingent earn-out obligation. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate and amount paid will be recorded in earnings.  Interest Expense Interest expense was  $8.0 million  and  $9.3 million  for fiscal years  2018  and  2017 , respectively. The  $1.3 million   decrease  is  primarily related to the non-reoccurrence of debt issuance costs and the write-off of historical debt issuance costs resulting from the debt modification that was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. Primarily as a result of declining revenue, our consolidated leverage ratio exceeded 2.50 at the beginning of fiscal year 2017, which resulted in our applicable margin increasing to 2.25%. As our sales performance improved, we ended fiscal year 2017 with a consolidated leverage ratio of approximately 1.69. At the end of fiscal year 2018, our consolidated leverage ratio was 1.23 as we continued to benefit from increasing sales.  (Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was  $23.2 million  for fiscal year  2018  compared to  $18.4 million  for fiscal year  2017 . The effective tax rates for fiscal years  2018  and  2017  were a tax provision of  38.9%  and  25.2% , respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of the one-time provisional impact of the Tax Act. We do not expect the Tax Act to have a material impact on our future overall effective tax rate since U.S. based activities have historically generated operating losses for tax purposes. We have established a valuation allowance against these operating losses and, given our current assessment of operations, we expect to continue to establish valuation allowances against future generated operating losses. We will continue to assess the impact of, and opportunities presented by, the Tax Act on our operations.  We receive a tax benefit from a tax holiday that was granted in Switzerland. The tax holiday is effective for the Initial Term and can be extended for an additional five years, subject to meeting certain staffing targets. The ability to meet the requirements to extend the ruling is within our control and we do not anticipate any issues meeting the established targets. The maximum benefit under this tax holiday is CHF 500.0 million. Depending on the operational performance of our Swiss operations, it is possible that we could utilize the maximum benefit during the Initial Term.  Once the term of the tax holiday expires or we achieve the maximum benefit, our effective tax rate could be negatively impacted if we are unable to negotiate an extension or expansion of the tax holiday.  For further information on the effective tax rate and Tax Act’s impact, see Note  12  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 40 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our capital requirements depend on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, the rate of increase or decrease in our existing business base; the success, timing and amount of investment required to bring new products to market; revenue growth or decline; and potential acquisitions. We believe that we have the financial resources necessary to meet business requirements for the next 12 months, including funds needed for working capital requirements.   As of  January 27, 2019 , our total stockholders’ equity was  $682.7 million . At that date, we also had approximately  $312.1 million  in cash and cash equivalents and  $211.1 million  of borrowings, net of debt discount, outstanding.   We incur significant expenditures in order to fund the development, design, and manufacture of new products. We intend to continue to focus on those areas that have shown potential for viable and profitable market opportunities, which may require additional investment in equipment and the hiring of additional design and application engineers aimed at developing new products. Certain of these expenditures, particularly the addition of design engineers, do not generate significant payback in the short-term. We plan to finance these expenditures with cash generated by our operations and our existing cash balances. A meaningful portion of our capital resources, and the liquidity they represent, are held by our foreign subsidiaries. As of  January 27, 2019 , our foreign subsidiaries held approximately  $253.1 million  of cash and cash equivalents compared to  $215.1 million  at  January 28, 2018 . In connection with the enactment of the Tax Act, all historic and current foreign earnings are taxed in the U.S. and are subject to a 5% withholding tax, if repatriated. We have determined that we will remit approximately $240.0 million of foreign earnings of which $80.0 million was remitted during fiscal year 2019. As of  January 27, 2019 , our foreign subsidiaries had  $516.0 million  of unremitted earnings for which no Federal or state taxes have been provided. Those historical earnings have been and are expected to continue to be permanently reinvested. One of our primary goals is to improve the cash flows from our existing business activities. Additionally, we will continue to seek to maintain or improve our existing business performance and deploy our accumulated cash balances in the most effective manner through alternatives such as capital expenditures, and potentially, acquisitions and other investments that support achievement of our business strategies. Acquisitions may be made for either cash or stock consideration, or a combination of both. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to net income adjusted for non-cash items plus fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities. In fiscal year 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $183.6 million, up 64.7% compared to fiscal year 2018. Operating cash flows for fiscal years  2019  and  2018  were impacted by several significant non-cash transaction related items including, for fiscal  2019 , depreciation and amortization expense of  $49.6 million , the impairment of our investment in Multiphy of $30.0 million and share-based compensation expense of  $73.9 million . The significant non-cash transactions for fiscal  2018  included depreciation and amortization expense of  $49.0 million  and share-based compensation expense of  $47.9 million . Proceeds from the HiLight Settlement of $8.0 million contributed to the cash transaction related items for fiscal year 2019, in addition to the gains from sale of cost method investments. Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities is primarily attributable to capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, and proceeds from sales of investments. Investing activities are also impacted by acquisitions, net of any cash received. Capital expenditures were  $17.1 million  and  $35.5 million  in fiscal years  2019  and  2018 , respectively. In fiscal year  2019 , we increased capital expenditures to support our business growth and the release of new products. In fiscal year  2020 , we expect our capital expenditures to be flat compared to our fiscal year 2019 levels. If product demand were to increase significantly beyond current projections, we would expect to increase capital spending to accommodate the growth. Similarly, to the extent practical, we would expect to decrease capital spending to address market contractions. On August 17, 2018, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of TrackNet for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  $8.5 million . On May 2, 2018, we acquired substantially all the assets of ICI for approximately $7.4 million. We funded the purchase price using cash on hand. On July 1, 2017, we acquired AptoVision for an upfront cash payment of $17.6 million at closing, net of acquired cash, and a commitment to pay an additional contingent consideration of up to a maximum of $47.0 million over three years if certain goals are achieved in each of the earn out periods. We expect to fund any obligations associated with the additional cash consideration with cash generated by our operations and our existing cash balances. 41 In fiscal year  2019 , we invested  $9.3 million  in companies that are enabling the ecosystem based on the LoRaWAN TM  protocol and developing technologies to support the requirements of our customers. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities is primarily attributable to principal payments related to our long-term debt and repurchase of outstanding common stock, offset by borrowings under our Credit Agreement (as defined below). On November 15, 2016 (the "Closing Date"), we, with certain of our domestic subsidiaries as guarantors, entered into an amended and restated credit agreement ("Credit Agreement") with the lenders party thereto (the "Lenders") and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as administrative agent, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer (the "Administrative Agent"). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Lenders provided us with senior secured first lien credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million (the "Credit Facility"), consisting of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million (the "Term Loans") and revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million (the "Revolving Loans"). Up to $40.0 million of the Revolving Loans may be used to obtain letters of credit, up to $25.0 million of the Revolving Loans may be used to obtain swing line loans, and up to $40.0 million of the Revolving Loans may be used to obtain revolving loans and letters of credit in certain currencies other than U.S. Dollars ("Alternative Currencies"). The Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on November 12, 2021.  All of the proceeds of the Term Loans were used to repay in full all of the obligations outstanding under our then existing senior secured first lien credit facility and to pay  transaction costs in connection with such refinancing.  We accounted for the Credit Agreement as a debt modification. As of  January 27, 2019 , we have  $115.3 million   outstanding under our Term Loa ns and  $97.0 million   outstanding under our Revolving Loans.  As of  January 27, 2019 ,  $153.0 million  of t he Revolving Loans were undrawn. The proceeds of the Revolving Loans may be used by us for capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, permitted dividends, working capital and general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement provides that, subject to certain conditions, we may request, at any time and from time to time, the establishment of one or more additional term loan facilities and/or increases to the Revolving Loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the sum of (a) $150.0 million and (b) the aggregate principal amount of all voluntary prepayments of Term Loans made prior to the date of incurrence of such additional term loan facilities and/or increases to the Revolving Loans; however, the Lenders are not required to provide such increase upon our request. Interest on loans made under the Credit Agreement in U.S. Dollars accrues, at our option, at a rate per annum equal to (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.25% depending upon our consolidated leverage ratio or (2) LIBOR (determined with respect to deposits in U.S. Dollars) for an interest period to be selected by us plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.25% depending upon our consolidated leverage ratio (such margin, the "Applicable Margin"). The "Base Rate" is equal to a fluctuating rate equal to the highest of (a) the prime rate of the Administrative Agent, (b) ½ of 1% above the federal funds effective rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and (c) one-month LIBOR (determined with respect to deposits in U.S. Dollars) plus 1.00%.  Interest on loans made under the Credit Agreement in Alternative Currencies accrues at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR (determined with respect to deposits in the applicable Alternative Currency) (other than loans made in Canadian Dollars, for which a special reference rate for Canadian Dollars applies) for an interest period to be selected by us plus the Applicable Margin.  The outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans is subject to repayment in equal quarterly installments in an amount equal to 10.0% per annum of the original principal amount of the Term Loans on the Closing Date in the first two years after such date, 12.5% per annum in years three and four after such date, and 15.0% per annum in year five after such date, with the balance being due at maturity on November 12, 2021. No amortization is required with respect to the Revolving Loans. We may voluntarily prepay borrowings under the Credit Facility at any time and from time to time, without premium or penalty, other than customary "breakage costs" and fees for LIBOR-based loans. The Term Loans must be mandatorily prepaid using the proceeds of certain dispositions of assets and receipt of insurance proceeds, subject to agreed upon thresholds and exceptions and customary reinvestment rights. In fiscal year 2019, we settled the AptoVision Earn-out for the performance period ended July 29, 2018. Of the total earn-out distribution for this performance period, $8.5 million was attributable to the original acquisition fair value and therefore presented as a Financing Activity. We currently have in effect a stock repurchase program that was initially approved by our Board of Directors in March 2008. This program represents one of our principal efforts to return value to our stockholders. During fiscal years  2019  and  2018 , we repurchased shares of common stock under this program for  $116.2 million  and  $14.8 million , respectively. As of  January 27,  42 2019 , we had repurchased  $267.6 million  in shares of our common stock under the program since inception and the current remaining authorization under the program is  $180.8 million . In fiscal year  2019 , we received  $16.3 million  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options compared to  $6.7 million  in fiscal year  2018 . We do not directly control the timing of the exercise of stock options. Such exercises are independent decisions made by grantees and are influenced most directly by the stock price and the expiration dates of stock option awards. Such proceeds are difficult to forecast, resulting from several factors which are outside our control. We believe that such proceeds will remain a nominal source of cash in the future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as those arrangements are defined by the SEC, that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, operating results, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. We do not have any unconsolidated subsidiaries or affiliated entities. We have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity or market or credit risk support. We do not engage in leasing, hedging, research and development services, or other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Noted below under "Contractual Obligations" are various commitments we have associated with our business, such as lease commitments and open purchase obligations, which are not recorded as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets because we have  not  yet received the related goods or services as of  January 27, 2019 . Contractual Obligations Presented below is a summary of our contractual obligations as of  January 27, 2019 . (in thousands) Less than 1 year   1-3 years   4-5 years   After 5 years   Total Long-term debt $ 18,750   $ 96,562   $ —   $ —   $ 115,312 Operating leases 5,049    5,845    1,859    1,273    14,026 Open capital purchase commitments 7,749    —    —    —    7,749 Other open purchase commitments 51,362    6,223    —    —    57,585 Deferred compensation 2,203    1,778    1,068    24,405    29,454 Cycleo-deferred compensation 1,978   2,536   —   —   4,514 AptoVision Earn-out 1,298   863   —   —   2,161 Share-based compensation —    9,214    —    —    9,214 Swiss plan  (1) 2,000   3,446   3,276   8,333   17,055 Total contractual cash obligations $ 90,389    $ 126,467    $ 6,203    $ 34,011    $ 257,070 (1) Amounts include expected payments under the current defined benefit pension plan for the employees of our Swiss subsidiary  through 2027. The table above includes the interest payments we owe on our long-term debt. We have assumed no additional borrowings or repayments under our Revolving Loans. For debt that has variable rate interest, we have calculated future interest obligations based on the interest rate for that debt as of  January 27, 2019 . Capital purchase commitments and other open purchase commitments are for the purchase of plant, equipment, raw material, supplies and services. They are not recorded as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of  January 27, 2019 , as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. As part of our acquisition of AptoVision and Cycleo, we have agreed to pay consideration if certain revenue and operating income targets are achieved in each of the measurement periods. See Note  13  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We maintain a deferred compensation plan for certain officers and key executives that allow participants to defer a portion of their compensation for future distribution at various times permitted by the plan. Our liability for deferred compensation under this plan was  $29.5 million  and  $30.5 million  as of  January 27, 2019  and  January 28, 2018 , respectively, and is included in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the table above. The plan provides for a discretionary Company match up to a defined portion of the employee’s deferral, with any match subject to a vesting period. We have purchased whole life insurance on the lives of some of our current and former deferred compensation plan participants. This Company-owned life insurance is held in a grantor trust and is intended to cover a majority of the costs of our  43 deferred compensation plan. The cash surrender value of our Company-owned life insurance was  $20.4 million  and  $22.3 million  as of  January 27, 2019  and  January 28, 2018 , respectively. Inflation Inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years. A significant increase in inflation would affect our future performance if we were unable to pass these higher costs on to our customers. 44 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"). In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We consider an accounting policy to be a "critical accounting policy and estimate" if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the judgment was made, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate was made. Refer to Note  2  to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting estimates and policies, which are as follows: • Inventories  - Inventoried product reflected at the lower of cost or market value considering future demand and market conditions; evaluation of inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence utilizing an analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand; • Business combinations  - the assumptions used to allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions; • Property, plant and equipment  - the useful life determination and the related timing of when depreciation begins; • Long-lived assets  - the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment of property, plant and equipment, identified intangibles, and goodwill, including the determination of asset groupings and the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting units; • Revenue recognition -   the criteria used to recognize revenue. Adjustments to net sales due to offset by the cost of the Warrant issued to Comcast over the respective performance period (since the Warrant was issued to our customer in exchange for services) are further discussed in "Note  11 : Share-Based Compensation".  Since the computation of the Warrant cost is based on the level of performance completed and the then current fair value of the unvested Warrant milestones, rather than unit sales, net sales can experience variability that is unrelated to the recognition of revenue.  • Income taxes -  the identification and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the provisional estimates associated with applicable tax laws; and • Contingencies  - the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable; measurement of contingent earn-out liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. New Accounting Standards New accounting standards are discussed in Note  2  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 45 Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to a variety of market risks, including commodity risk and the risks related to foreign currency, interest rates and market performance that are detailed below. Many of the factors that can have an impact on our market risk are external to us, and so we are unable to fully predict them. Market Conditions A deterioration of global economic conditions can impact demand for our products which could result in changes in customer order patterns, including order cancellations, and changes in the level of inventory held by vendors. Commodity Risk We are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials, particularly gold, that are incorporated into our end products or used by our suppliers to process our end products. Increased commodity prices are passed on to us in the form of higher prices from our suppliers, either in the form of general price increases or a commodity surcharge. Although we generally deal with our suppliers on a purchase order basis rather than on a long-term contract basis, we generally attempt to obtain firm pricing for volumes consistent with planned production. Our gross margins may decline if we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies to offset the increased cost. We do not enter into formal hedging arrangements to mitigate against commodity risk. Foreign Currency Risk Our foreign operations expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against our functional currency (the U.S. Dollar) and we may economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contracts (such as currency forward contracts). Gains or losses on these non-U.S.-currency balances are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments. As of  January 27, 2019 , our largest foreign currency exposures were from the Canadian Dollar, Swiss Franc, and Great British Pound. We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These reasonably possible adverse changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currency as of  January 27, 2019 , to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had (after taking into account balance sheet hedges only) on our income before taxes, to show an impact of $2.2 million. Interest Rate and Credit Risk We do not engage in the trading of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate our risk related to interest rates. In the event interest rates were to increase 100 basis points and holding all other variables constant, annual net income and cash flows for the following year would decrease by approximately $2.1 million as a result of our variable-rate debt. The effect of the 100 basis points increase would not be expected to significantly impact the fair value of our variable-rate debt. Interest rates affect our return on excess cash and investments. As of  January 27, 2019 , we had  $312.1 million  of cash and cash equivalents. A majority of our cash and cash equivalents generate interest income based on prevailing interest rates. Investments and cash and cash equivalents generated interest income of $2.8 million in fiscal year  2019 . A significant change in interest rates would impact the amount of interest income generated from our cash and investments. It would also impact the market value of our investments. Our investments are primarily subject to credit risk. Our investments are managed by a limited number of outside professional managers following investment guidelines set by us. Such guidelines prescribe credit quality, permissible investments, diversification, and duration restrictions. These restrictions are intended to limit risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short-term durations. Our investment strategy limits investment of new funds and maturing securities to U.S. Treasury, Federal agency securities, high quality money market funds and time deposits with our principal commercial banks. 46 Item 8.
