Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results          -----------------------------------------------------------------------          of Operations          -------------  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Dollars are in millions, except share and per share amounts.  GENERAL During 1998 the Company completed the following acquisitions and dispositions:    On June 24, 1998, the Company acquired assets of the OrePrep minerals processing product line ("OrePrep") from Baker Petrolite Corporation for approximately $9.0. OrePrep supplies mineral processing reagents and services to the mining industry. The acquired product line was integrated into the Company's existing mining chemicals product line.    On July 31, 1998, the Company completed the purchase from Dyno Industrier ASA of Oslo, Norway, of Dyno's global amino coating resins business (the "Dyno Business"), which consisted primarily of Dyno's 50% interest in Dyno-Cytec, a European joint venture, for approximately $55.7. Payment of the purchase price was funded under the Company's revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility"). The acquired business produces and sells crosslinking resins for coating applications primarily in Europe from a single manufacturing plant in Lillestrom, Norway. The acquired business was integrated into the Company's existing specialty resins product line.                                         19     On October 9, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of The American Materials & Technologies Corporation ("AMT") in a stock transaction designed to qualify as a tax-free reorganization. Under the terms of the transaction, each AMT share was converted into the right to receive 0.3098 of a share of Cytec common stock. In the transaction, the Company issued from Treasury 1,248,620 shares of common stock. In addition, outstanding options and warrants to acquire AMT stock were converted into a total of 259,308 incentive and nonqualified stock options at a weighted average exercise price of $10.07 per share and 75,901 warrants that allow the holders to purchase the Company's common stock at a weighted average price of $25.14 per share. The cost of the acquisition was approximately $26.8, including the shares issued, options and warrants converted and previous shares acquired, plus the assumption of approximately $5.4 in debt. AMT manufactures and markets advanced composite materials for customers in the aerospace, defense, transportation and other industries. The acquired business was integrated into the Company's existing specialty materials product line. On October 26, 1998, the Company sold the assets of the AMT graphite golf shaft business for approximately $6.2.   All three acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.    On November 23, 1998, the Company completed the sale of its bulk molding compounds product line to Bulk Molding Compounds, Inc. of West Chicago, Illinois for $17.0 in cash, resulting in a pretax gain of $4.4. The business acquired by Bulk Molding Compounds, Inc. included Cytec's manufacturing, laboratory and sales facility located at Perrysburg, Ohio. Sales for this product line in 1998, 1997 and 1996 were $24.9, $26.6 and $26.4, respectively, and are included in the Specialty Materials operating segment.   During 1997 the Company completed the following acquisition and disposition:    On September 30, 1997, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Fiberite, Inc. ("Fiberite"). The assets and liabilities were acquired for $344.0 from Stamford FHI Acquisition Corp., which purchased Fiberite on August 29, 1997. The assets acquired included all of Fiberite's business except its satellite materials business. The Fiberite operations have been integrated into the Company's specialty materials product line. The Fiberite acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.    On January 31, 1997, the Company completed the sale of its acrylic fibers product line to a subsidiary of Sterling Chemicals, Inc. The assets transferred included the Company's plant located near Pensacola, Florida. The Company received approximately $94.8 in cash and received certain other consideration, including the assumption by Sterling of certain contingent and other liabilities with a value of approximately $15.0. The Company recorded a pretax gain of approximately $22.3 from this transaction.    In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). This statement, which becomes effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2000, establishes accounting and operating standards for hedging activities and derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts. The Company is reviewing the potential impact, if any, of SFAS 133 on its consolidated results of operation, financial position or cash flows.    In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information"("SFAS 131"). The statement became effective for the Company beginning January 1, 1998. SFAS 131 requires disclosure of certain information about operating segments, geographic areas of operation and major customers. The Company has adopted SFAS 131 in 1998 and has restated the information for 1997 and 1996 in order to conform to the 1998 presentation. SFAS 131 has no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company has four reportable segments (Water and Industrial Process Chemicals, Performance Products, Specialty Materials and Building Block Chemicals).    The Water and Industrial Process Chemicals segment produces paper, water, mining and phosphine chemicals that are mainly used in water and wastewater treatment, paper manufacturing and mineral processing and separation. The principal markets for these products are global, with approximately 48% of sales in the United States.    The Performance Products segment produces specialty resins, polymer additives, surfactants and specialty monomers that are used in serving the coatings, adhesives and plastics markets. The principal markets for these products are global with approximately 59% of sales in the United States.    The Specialty Materials segment manufactures and sells aerospace materials that are mainly used in commercial and military aviation and launch vehicles, automobiles, recreational products, satellites and aircraft brakes. Net sales for this business segment are approximately 72% U.S. based. For 1997 and 1998 the segment also included the Bulk and Engineered Molding Compounds businesses which, except for one minor product line, have since been divested.                                         20     The Building Block Chemicals segment manufactures acrylonitrile, acrylamide, ammonia, hydrocyanic acid, melamine, methanol and sulfuric acid. Approximately one-third of the Company's total production of building block chemicals are used in the manufacture of many of the Company's other products with the remainder sold to third parties.    See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and further discussions in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation for more information on the Company's segments.                                         21   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth the percentage relationship that certain items in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income bear to net sales:   YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                   1998    1997    1996 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------        Net sales                                                 100.0%  100.0%  100.0% Manufacturing cost of sales                                69.7    72.1    71.3 Gross profit                                               30.3    27.9    28.7 Selling and technical services                             10.6    11.3    11.2 Research and process development                            3.0     3.5     3.2 Administrative and general                                  3.2     3.7     3.5 Amortization of acquisition intangibles                     0.7     0.2     0.1  Earnings from operations(1)                                12.8     9.2    10.7 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net earnings(2)                                             8.6     8.8     7.9   (1) Percentages in 1997 include the effect of restructuring and other charges of (3.3%).  (2) 1997 includes an after-tax gain of 1.1% primarily relating to the divestiture of the acrylic fibers product line and the effect of a reversal of a tax valuation allowance of 1.9%.  NET SALES BY BUSINESS SEGMENT The Company's net sales by business segment are set forth below:   YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,                           1998      1997      1996     - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------        Water and Industrial Process Chemicals           $  349.4  $  351.3  $  340.9   Performance Products                                403.4     395.1     386.3   Specialty Materials(1)                              492.2     264.3     159.2   Building Block Chemicals(2)                         199.3     265.3     194.4   Other(3)                                              0.2      14.6     178.8   - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  $1,444.5  $1,290.6  $1,259.6     (1) On November 23, 1998, the Company completed the sale of its bulk molding compounds product line, which had sales of $24.9, $26.6 and $26.4 in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. On January 21, 1999, the Company completed the sale of its remaining molding compounds product line, which had sales of $14.1 and $3.3, in 1998 and 1997, respectively.  (2) Approximately one-third of the Company's 1998 and 1997 production of building block chemicals was used internally in the manufacture of other Company products. In 1996 more than one-half of such production was used internally. Such internal usage is not reflected in Building Block Chemicals net sales. The decrease in internal usage is the result of the sale of the acrylic fibers product line in January 1997. Sales of acrylonitrile to the purchaser of the acrylic fibers product line are included above in net sales of Building Block Chemicals for 1998 and 1997. In prior years, these sales were recorded as internal transfers.  (3) 1997 and 1996 includes acrylic fibers sales of $11.9 and $136.1, respectively. The acrylic fibers product line was sold on January 31, 1997.    The Company has a 50% interest in each of four unconsolidated associated companies: CYRO Industries, Criterion Catalyst, Mitsui-Cytec and AC Molding Compounds and had a 50% interest in the former Dyno-Cytec joint venture through July 31, 1998. The aggregate net sales of unconsolidated associated companies was $583.0 in 1998, $596.5 in 1997 and $600.7 in 1996.   YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997    Net sales for 1998 were $1,444.5, which were approximately 11.9% higher in comparison with 1997 net sales of $1,290.6. The increase is mainly attributable to sales generated as a result of the acquisitions of Fiberite, the OrePrep product line and the Dyno Business. Included in 1997 are sales of $11.9 from the acrylic fibers product line that was divested on January 31, 1997. Sales outside of the United States for the full year 1998 were 38.3% of total sales, a decrease of 1.0% when compared with 1997 international sales. This was primarily a result of the inclusion of Fiberite sales, which are principally U.S. based.    Sales in the Asia/Pacific region were down 5.5% for the year. The decrease was mainly due to the region's financial crisis and to the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations. Overall sales to this region were about 9.3% of total Cytec sales.    Water and Industrial Process Chemicals net sales decreased $1.9 or 0.5%. Sales volumes were up 1.8%, while selling prices and exchange rates were down 0.5% and 1.7%, respectively. The increase in international sales volumes was partially offset by a decrease in paper and water treating chemical U.S. sales volumes.    Performance Products net sales increased $8.3 or 2.1%. Excluding sales as a result of the purchase of the Dyno Business acquisition, sales were down $6.4 or 1.6%. The decrease was mainly attributable to polymer additives. Lower prices in the United States and Europe and lower volumes in Asia were primarily responsible for the polymer additives decrease.                                         22     Specialty Materials net sales increased $227.9 or 86.2%. This was primarily due to sales generated as a result of the Fiberite acquisition. Including pro forma Fiberite sales in 1997, sales increased $27.4 or 5.9%. The pro forma sales increase was primarily due to higher build rates in the commercial aircraft sector. The Company's largest Specialty Materials customer has experienced delays and cancellations of commercial aircraft orders as a result of the financial crisis in the Asia/Pacific region. However, the Company expects the decrease in sales to its largest customer to be offset by an increase in sales to other customers and sales generated as a result of the AMT acquisition.    Building Block Chemicals net sales decreased $66.0 or 24.9%. Selling prices and volumes were down 13.4% and 11.3%, respectively. Selling prices for acrylonitrile and methanol continued downward, and are expected to remain at these low levels well into 1999. Acrylonitrile volumes remain depressed due to a combination of high supply and weak demand, primarily in Asia. The acrylonitrile plant is operating at a reduced rate and will continue production at the lower rate until market conditions improve. Costs for propylene, the key raw material for production of acrylonitrile, are down, substantially offsetting the impact of lower selling prices. The methanol market remains weak, and on March 1, 1999, the plant was shut down for market related reasons.    Manufacturing cost of sales for the full year decreased from 72.1% of sales to 69.7%. Included in 1997 were the unfavorable effects of restructuring and other charges totaling $34.6 relating primarily to manufacturing sites at Fortier, Louisiana; Willow Island, West Virginia; Botlek, The Netherlands; and Linden, New Jersey. Excluding the restructuring and other charges in 1997, the manufacturing cost of sales increased 0.3% in 1998 due to a decrease in operating capacity resulting from severe weather conditions primarily at the Building Block Chemicals Fortier facility in Louisiana, and to adverse exchange rate fluctuations, which affected all segments. In addition, the startup of the Performance Products benzotriazole light stabilizer plant increased expenses. Partially offsetting this was a reduction of retiree medical expenses and stock based employee compensation of $7.8.    Selling and technical service expenses increased $8.0 or 5.5%. Included in 1997 are restructuring and other charges of $3.2 relating to sales force and customer service restructuring and costs associated with the integration of Fiberite. Excluding these charges, selling and technical service expenses increased 7.9%, reflecting the impact of the acquisitions made during the year. Partially offsetting this was a reduction of retiree medical expenses and stock based employee compensation of $2.3.    Research and process development expenses for 1998 decreased $1.8 or 4.0%. Included in 1997 are restructuring and other charges of $2.0 of which $1.0 related to the reduction of corporate research and development overhead and $1.0 related to the write-off of in-process research and development acquired from Fiberite. Excluding these charges, research and development expenses increased 0.5%. Included in research and development is a reduction of retiree medical expenses and stock based employee compensation of $1.9.    Administrative and general expenses decreased $1.1 or 2.3%. Included in 1997 are restructuring and other charges of $2.6 relating to corporate headquarters restructuring and costs for reorganizing the legal entity structure in Europe. Excluding these charges, administrative and general expenses increased 3.3%, primarily reflecting the acquisitions. Included in administrative and general in 1998 is a reduction of retiree medical expenses and stock based employee compensation of $4.2.    Amortization of acquisition intangibles increased $6.8 due to intangibles resulting from the acquisitions made during the year and in the latter part of 1997.    Other income, net, decreased $9.4. Included in 1998 is a gain of $4.4 related to the sale of the bulk molding compounds product line. Included in 1997 was a $22.3 gain related to divested product lines and charges of $9.0 for reducing the carrying amount of the Company's subsidiary CONAP, Inc. to net realizable value and expected losses on certain other assets being held for sale. Excluding these items other income in 1998 was comparable to 1997.    Equity in earnings of associated companies, all of which are 50% owned, represents the Company's before-tax share of its associates' earnings. Such earnings increased $8.0 mainly due to higher sales and improved operations for Criterion Catalyst partially offset by lower earnings from CYRO Industries and the result of consolidating the operating results of the Dyno-Cytec joint venture effective August 1, 1998.    Interest expense, net, increased as a result of the increase in long-term debt associated with the acquisition of Fiberite, stock repurchases and the acquisition of the Dyno Business. Net interest expense for 1998 was $22.4 compared with $5.7 in 1997.    The income tax provision in 1998 was 37%, compared with 39% (excluding the impact of nonrecurring items) in 1997. This was primarily due to improved tax planning for foreign and state taxes as well as benefits from increased sales through the Company's foreign sales corporation.                                         23     Net earnings for 1998 were $124.7, or $2.68 per diluted common share, compared with $113.6, or $2.39 per diluted common share, for 1997. Included in 1998 is a gain of $4.4 ($2.8 after-tax, or $0.06 per diluted common share), relating to the sale of the bulk molding compounds product line. Excluding this gain, the diluted earnings per share for 1998 was $2.62. Included in 1997 is a favorable tax valuation allowance reversal of $24.4, or $0.51 per diluted common share, an after-tax gain primarily related to the sale of the acrylic fibers product line of $13.6, or $0.29 per diluted common share and an unfavorable after-tax charge relating to restructuring and other charges of $34.3, or $0.72 per diluted common share. Excluding these items, the diluted earnings per share for 1997 was $2.31. After adjusting 1998 and 1997 for the effects of these items net earnings increased $0.31 per diluted common share or 13.4%, and reflects the positive effects of the acquisitions made during the year, the reduced tax rate and the effect of the Company's common stock repurchase program.                                         24    YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996    Net sales for 1997 were $1,290.6, which was 2.5% higher in comparison with 1996 net sales of $1,259.6. Included in 1996 are sales from the divested acrylic fibers and aluminum sulfate product lines and the discontinued technical chemicals product line. Included in 1997 are sales of acrylonitrile to the purchaser of the acrylic fibers line and sales of $66.9 generated as a result of the purchase of Fiberite as of September 30, 1997. Excluding the above from 1996 and 1997 results, sales increased 7.2%. Sales outside of the United States for the full year 1997 were 39%, which was flat compared with 1996 international sales. This was primarily a result of the acrylic fibers divestiture and the inclusion in the fourth quarter of Fiberite sales, which are principally U.S. based. Excluding Fiberite, sales outside of the United States were 41% with the growth primarily in European and Latin American regions.    Sales in the Asia/Pacific region, excluding the effect of divested businesses, were up 8% for the year, but down slightly in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter results were partly due to the region's financial crisis and to the effect of unusual weather that caused certain customers' mines to be shut down. Overall sales to this region were about 11% of total Cytec sales with approximately half of these sales at risk to currency fluctuations.    Water and Industrial Process Chemicals net sales increased $10.4 or 3.1%. Sales volumes were up 6.6%, while selling prices and exchange rates were down 0.5% and 2.8%, respectively. Sales volume increased in all product lines with mining and water treatment chemicals having the largest increase. Paper chemicals had a 3.7% sales volume increase with the largest increase in the Asia/Pacific region.    Performance Products net sales increased $8.8 or 2.3%. Sales volumes were up 5.0%, while selling prices and exchange rates were down 1.1% and 1.8%, respectively. All product lines experienced increased sales volumes with the exception of CONAP, which had lower sales to distributors. Polymer additives experienced the largest sales volume increase principally as a result of increased sales in Asia.    Specialty Materials net sales increased $105.1 or 66.0%. Sales rose principally due to the acquisition of Fiberite and the strong performance of aerospace materials products in the commercial aircraft sector.    Building Block Chemicals net sales increased $70.9 or 36.5%. Included in 1997 were acrylonitrile sales of $47.6 to the purchaser of the acrylic fibers product line that were treated as internal transfers prior to the divestiture. Excluding these sales, the net increase for the year was 12.0%. Both acrylonitrile and methanol sales volumes were higher. The methanol facility was shut down in January 1996 due to high natural gas costs and during the second quarter of 1996 for mechanical repairs to the reactor.    Restructuring charges of $38.4 were recorded in 1997. The Company does not charge these costs to its operating segments but accumulates them on a corporate basis. The breakdown of these costs by segment is as follows:                                                   SPECIALTY CHEMICALS                                                                                 BUILDING                                     WATER & INDUSTRIAL  PERFORMANCE  SPECIALTY    BLOCK                                     PROCESS CHEMICALS    PRODUCTS    MATERIALS  CHEMICALS  TOTAL            - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Manufacturing cost of sales                      $13.2        $15.9       $0.7       $2.8  $32.6 Selling and technical services                     1.0          1.0        0.2       --      2.2 Research and process development                   0.5          0.5        --        --      1.0 Administrative and general                         1.3          1.3        --        --      2.6 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Total                                            $16.0        $18.7       $0.9       $2.8  $38.4     Manufacturing cost of sales for the full year increased from 71.3% of sales to 72.1%. Included in 1997 were the unfavorable effects of restructuring and other charges totaling $34.6 relating primarily to manufacturing sites at Fortier, Louisiana; Willow Island, West Virginia; Botlek, The Netherlands; and Linden, New Jersey. Excluding the total restructuring and other charges of $34.6 in 1997, the cost of sales improved to 69.4%. This was the result of an improved product sales mix, the effect of improving plant efficiency and continuing cost reduction programs. Partially offsetting these were higher costs for raw materials and the adverse impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.    Selling and technical service expenses increased $4.5 or 3.2%. Included in 1997 are restructuring and other charges of $3.2 relating to sales force and customer service restructuring and costs relating to the integration of Fiberite. Excluding these charges, selling and technical service expenses increased 1.0%, reflecting increased sales efforts in international markets and the support of domestic sales growth in the Specialty Chemical segments.    Research and process development expenses for the full year 1997 increased $4.5 or 11.2%. Included in 1997 are restructuring and other charges of $2.0 of which $1.0 related to the reduction of corporate research and development overhead and $1.0 related to the write-off of in-process research and development acquired from Fiberite. Excluding these charges, research and development expenses increased 6.2%, reflecting continued effort in technical programs in the Specialty Chemical segments.                                         25     Administrative and general expenses increased $3.4 or 7.8%. Included in 1997 are restructuring and other charges of $2.6 relating to corporate headquarters restructuring and costs for reorganizing the legal entity structure in Europe. Excluding these charges, administrative and general expenses increased 1.8%.    Amortization of acquisition intangibles increased $1.8 due to intangibles associated with the Fiberite acquisition.    Other income, net, improved $14.9. Included in 1997 was a $22.3 gain related to divested product lines and charges of $9.0 for reducing the carrying amount of the Company's subsidiary CONAP, Inc. to net realizable value and expected losses on certain other assets being held for sale.    Equity in earnings of associated companies, all of which are 50% owned, represents the Company's before-tax share of its associates' earnings. Such earnings decreased $12.5 mainly due to a decline in earnings at Criterion Catalyst resulting from a less favorable product mix, lower selling prices and operating inefficiencies.    Interest expense, net, increased as a result of long-term debt associated with the acquisition of Fiberite. Also included is a charge of $1.0 for up-front costs to fund the acquisition of Fiberite.    The income tax provision in 1997 includes a favorable reversal of the tax valuation allowance of $24.4. The effective tax rate for the year also includes the impact of a portion of the restructuring and other charges for which no tax benefit was attributable. In 1996 the rate included a one-time benefit related to a noncash transaction in the fourth quarter. Excluding these nonrecurring items for each year, the effective tax rate was 39% in 1997, compared with 41% in 1996. This reduction was due to improved tax planning and increased sales by the Company's foreign sales corporation.    Net earnings for the full year 1997 were $113.6, or $2.39 per diluted common share, compared with $100.1, or $2.03 per diluted common share, for the comparable period of 1996. Included in 1997 net earnings was an unfavorable after-tax charge of $34.3, or $0.72 per diluted common share, relating to restructuring and other charges explained in the line item analysis above. Also included in 1997 was the favorable reversal of the tax valuation allowance of $24.4, or $0.51 per diluted common share, and an after-tax gain from the first quarter of 1997 of $13.6, or $0.29 per diluted common share, primarily relating to the acrylic fibers product line divestiture. Excluding these items, the diluted earnings per share for 1997 was $2.31. This represents an increase of $0.28 per diluted common share, compared with the full year 1996, and reflects higher earnings and the effect of the Company's common stock repurchase program.  LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION At December 31, 1998, the Company's cash balance was $1.7, a decrease of $4.7 from year-end 1997.    Net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $152.3 for the year ended December 31, 1998, compared with $131.7 in the same period of 1997. Significant factors in this increase were higher earnings and the Company's decision to prefund $25.0 of its postretirement benefits liability in 1997, compared with $4.0 of such prefunding payments in 1998, through contributions to its Voluntary Employee Benefit Association (VEBA) Trust accounts by utilizing some of the proceeds from the sale of the acrylic fibers product line. Payments against restructuring reserves were $12.9 in 1998, as compared with $8.4 in 1997. At December 31, 1998, the liability to be paid was $17.6, essentially all of which is for employee-related costs. The spending is expected to be substantially completed by  the end of 1999 with the exception of certain long- term payouts for employee severance.    Environmental remediation spending for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, was $23.8, $26.1 and $26.8, respectively. The Company expects similar levels in 1999, though there can be no assurances that the Company's annual cash expenditures will not be higher in the future.    While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending environmental suits and claims, it is reasonably possible that there will be a necessity for future provisions for environmental costs which, in management's opinion, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company, but could be material to the consolidated results of operations of the Company in any one accounting period. The Company cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amount. Moreover, environmental liabilities are paid over an extended period, and the timing of such payments cannot be predicted with any confidence. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to environmental matters.    The Company is also a party to various other claims and routine litigation arising in the normal course of its business. Based on the advice of counsel, management believes that the resolution of such claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company, but could be material to the consolidated  results of operations of the Company in any one accounting period.                                         26     Net cash flows used for investing activities totaled $146.9, compared with $337.6 in 1997. Included in 1997 was funding for the Fiberite acquisition of $344.0, which was partially offset by proceeds of $94.8 associated with the sale of the acrylic fibers products line. Included in 1998 was funding of $55.7 for acquisition of the Dyno Business. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 1998, of $103.8 were higher than for the corresponding period in 1997 due primarily to certain large construction projects in the Performance Products segment, such as the benzotriazole light stabilizer plant in Botlek, The Netherlands, and the expansion of the surfactants plant in Willow Island, West Virginia. Capital expenditures for the year 1999 are expected to be in the range of $80.0 to $85.0.    The Company believes that, based on internal cash generation and current levels of liquid assets, it will be able to fund operating cash requirements and planned capital expenditures in 1999.    Net cash flows used for financing activities totaled $10.5, compared with $194.2 provided by financing activities in 1997. Long-term debt increased primarily due to the purchase of treasury stock and the acquisitions of the OrePrep product line and the Dyno Business. In 1998 the Company purchased a total of 3,561,950 shares of treasury stock at a cost of $113.4. This completed the 10% stock repurchase program authorized in February 1997. In 1997, 1,234,250 shares were repurchased at a cost of $47.8. In connection with the Company's stock repurchase program, the Company sold put options to an institutional investor in a series of private placements exempt from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. The put options entitled the holder to sell an aggregate of 400,000 shares of the Company's common stock to the Company on certain dates at specified prices, subject to the Company's right, in lieu of purchasing such shares, to pay the holder of the put the excess of the strike price over the then market price of the shares in either cash or additional shares of the Company's common stock. The Company received premiums of approximately $1.0 on the sale of such options. During the year, 200,000 of the put options expired unexercised, and the Company purchased the remaining 200,000 shares of the Company's common stock subject to the options for an aggregate of $11.0.    The Company signed an agreement on April 8, 1997, with American Cyanamid Company ("Cyanamid"), a subsidiary of American Home Products Corporation, to revise certain of the financial covenants contained in its Series C Cumulative Preferred Stock. Under the revised terms, the Company must maintain a debt-to- equity ratio of no more than 2-to-1 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 3-to-1 for the average of the fixed charge coverage ratios for the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended and must not incur more than $150.0 of debt unless the Company's equity is in excess of $200.0. If the Company has more than $200.0 in equity, then it may incur additional debt as long as its ratio of debt-to-equity is not more than 1.5-to-1. At December 31, 1998, the Company had $429.8 of debt and $430.9 in equity as defined in the Series C Stock covenants and, under the revised terms, would have had the ability to incur up to an additional $216.6 in debt.    The Company on January 22, 1999, signed an agreement with Cyanamid providing that Cyanamid would irrevocably waive certain financial covenants contained in the Series C Cumulative Preferred Stock so that, in addition to restricted payments otherwise permitted under the Series C Cumulative Preferred Stock, which at December 31, 1998, were limited to $17.7, Cytec may make up to $100.0 in special restricted payments solely for the purpose of repurchasing Cytec's common stock. On January 25, 1999, the Company's Board of Directors approved a program to spend up to $100.0 to repurchase shares of outstanding common stock. The repurchases will be made from time to time on the open market or in private transactions and will be utilized for stock option plans, benefit plans and other corporate purposes.    On August 21, 1998, the Company amended and restated its Credit Facility, primarily to add a new lender to its existing bank group. At December 31, 1998, the Company's Credit Facility provided for unsecured revolving loans ("Revolving Loans") of up to $200.0. The Revolving Loans are available for the general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, for purposes of making acquisitions permitted under the Credit Facility. There was $100.0 of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 1998. The Credit Facility, which is scheduled to mature on July 28, 2002, contains covenants customary for such facilities. The Company was in compliance with all terms, covenants and conditions of the Credit Facility at December 31, 1998. On August 21, 1998, the Company replaced its $200.0, 364-Day Fiberite Acquisition Facility with a new $200.0, 364-Day Facility (the "364-Day Facility"). The 364-Day Facility, which provides for unsecured revolving loans for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, for purposes of making acquisitions, matures on August 20, 1999, and contains a two-year term- out option. The interest rate on funds borrowed under the Credit Facility and the 364-Day Facility floats based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 1998, there were no outstanding borrowings under the 364-Day Facility.                                         27     The Company sold an aggregate of $320.0 principal amount of senior debt securities in public offerings in the first six months of 1998, consisting of (i) $100.0 principal amount of 6.50% Notes due March 15, 2003, (ii) $100.0 principal amount of 6.75% Notes due March 15, 2008 and (iii) $120.0 principal amount of 6.846% MOPPRSSM due May 11, 2025. The securities were offered under the Company's shelf registration statement that has now been fully utilized. The Company received an aggregate of approximately $322.0 in proceeds from the sales before deducting expenses associated with the sales. The proceeds were used to (1) repay $160.0 of indebtedness under the Fiberite Acquisition Facility, (2) repay $141.5 of indebtedness under the Credit Facility and (3) the remainder was used for general corporate purposes.    In connection with the Fiberite Acquisition and in contemplation of the offering of long-term debt securities, the Company entered into a series of rate lock agreements (the "Rate Lock Agreements") with several banks commencing in September 1997. Pursuant to the Rate Lock Agreements, the Company hedged against the risk of an increase in treasury rates above the rates on the dates it entered into the Rate Lock Agreements on an aggregate of $300.0 in debt for periods of up to 30 years. The Company made payments aggregating approximately $11.2 to settle Rate Lock Agreements ($9.6 of which was paid during the first half of 1998 and the remainder in 1997), which payments will be amortized or recognized over the life of the 6.50% Notes, 6.75% Notes and 6.846% MOPPRS as an increase in interest expense of such Notes.    During 1998 and 1997 the Company made contributions to its VEBA Trust accounts to fund certain employee and retiree health care benefits. The balance in the VEBA Trust accounts at December 31, 1998, and 1997 was $51.0 and $47.9, respectively.    The impact of inflation on the Company is considered insignificant since the rate of inflation has remained relatively low in recent years and investments in areas of the world where inflation poses a risk have been significantly hedged to mitigate the effects of inflation.  OTHER Year 2000.  The Company has conducted a comprehensive review of its information technology systems ("IT Systems") and its process control and other systems that use micro-controllers ("Non-IT Systems") to identify the systems that could be affected by the "Year 2000" issue. The Year 2000 issue results from computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year. Any of the Company's systems that have time-sensitive software features may recognize a date using "00" in the last two places as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000. If not addressed, this could result in a system failure or miscalculations, and in the case of Non-IT systems that are noncompliant, could have a material adverse impact on the integrity and safety of the Company's chemical manufacturing processes.  The Company has developed a phased program to address its Year 2000 issues. The first phase, which consisted of identifying the Company's IT and Non-IT Systems, has been completed. The second phase consisted of determining whether those systems were Year 2000 compliant, primarily based on certifications from the vendors of such systems, and developing cost estimates to remediate noncompliant systems. The second phase is also complete. The Company's current estimate is that it will incur external costs in the range of $6.0 to $7.0 to remediate noncompliant systems, of which $2.1 has been spent to date, and of which the remaining funds mostly consist of: (i) funds committed but not yet spent; (ii) the cost of non-mission critical systems and equipment; and (iii) the cost of testing. This estimate may change materially as the Company reviews the results of its work in the first two phases on a plant-by-plant basis using both internal and external resources and as the Company continues to implement required remediation. The Company does not track its internal costs in connection with Year 2000 issues, but does not believe they are material. The third phase of the Company's program is ongoing and consists of remediating noncompliant systems that are critical to the Company's operations. The Company's goal is to largely complete the third phase by the end of the first quarter of 1999. The Company then plans to test critical systems and to remediate, if appropriate, noncritical systems by the end of the second quarter of 1999.    The Company has not yet developed any contingency plans for addressing any problems in completing implementation of all necessary remediation by the year 2000, but plans to commence development of such plans in the first quarter of 1999. The Company has begun to address the Year 2000 status of its material customers and suppliers by seeking verification that their systems and processes are, or by December 31, 1999, will be, Year 2000 compliant.  These efforts may need to be refined as more information becomes available. The Company also is reviewing the Year 2000 compliance efforts of the four associated companies in which it has a 50% equity interest.                                         28     Failure to complete any necessary remediation by the Year 2000 may have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operations of the Company. Failure of third parties, such as customers, suppliers or government agencies to remediate Year 2000 problems in their IT and Non-IT Systems (which cannot be controlled or corrected by the Company) or any general economic slowdown due to Year 2000 problems could also have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operations of the Company. Possible consequences as a result of the Company, customers, suppliers or government agencies not being fully Year 2000 compliant include temporary plant closings, delays in the delivery of finished products, delays in the receipt of raw materials and invoice and collection errors. These consequences could have a material adverse impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. As part of its contingency plan, the Company plans to address these potential consequences and mitigate the adverse effect any such disruptions may have on the Company's operations.    Euro Conversion.  On January 1, 1999, 11 of the 15 member countries of the European Union (the "participating countries") established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies (the "legacy currencies") and the euro. The participating countries have agreed to adopt the euro as their common legal currency on that date. As of January 1, 1999, a newly created European Central Bank has begun to control monetary policy, including money supply and interest rates for the participating countries. The legacy currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender in the participating countries as denominations of the euro between January 1, 1999, and January 1, 2002 (the "transition period"). During the transition period, public and private parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or the participating country's legacy currency on a "no compulsion, no prohibition" basis. The Company's principal plants in Europe are in The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Norway and Germany, and the Company has sales offices and generates sales throughout Europe. The Netherlands and Germany are participating countries, whereas the United Kingdom and Norway are not currently participating countries.    Effective January 1, 1999, the Company is in a position to trade in euros. The Company has initiated and is evaluating on an ongoing basis the effects, if any, of the euro conversion upon its business. Factors being considered include, but are not limited to: the possible impact of the euro conversion on revenues, expenses and income from continuing operations; the impact on cash management and treasury management functions; the competitive implications of increased price transparency; the ability to adapt information technology to accommodate euro-denominated transactions; the market risks with respect to financial instruments; the continuity of material contracts; and the potential tax consequences.    The Company does not believe that the initial remeasurement of the euro as the functional currency for those operations within the participating countries will result in any gains or losses since conversion rates to the euro for participating countries have been irrevocably fixed as of January 1, 1999. The Company believes that some information systems modifications are required in order for them to be euro compliant. The Company, however, does not currently believe that the euro conversion will have a material operational or financial impact.                                         29   Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk           ----------------------------------------------------------  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about the Company's potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward-looking analysis. The Company's exposure to market risk from equity price changes was immaterial at December 31, 1998.    Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings.    In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to various market risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates. To manage the exposure related to these risks, the Company may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with Company-established policies. The Company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes. Moreover, the Company enters into financial instrument transactions either through regulated future exchanges or with major financial institutions, thereby limiting exposure to credit- and performance-related risks.  Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The risk of adverse exchange rate fluctuations is mitigated by the fact that there is no concentration of foreign currency exposure. In addition, the Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in foreign currencies. At December 31, 1998, the principal transactions hedged were short-term intercompany loans and intercompany trade accounts receivable and payable. The maturity dates of the foreign exchange contracts are less than six months and strongly correlate to the maturity date of the underlying transaction. The foreign exchange gains or losses and the offsetting losses or gains of the hedged transaction are marked to market and reflected in net earnings.    At December 31, 1998, the Company had net foreign exchange contracts to purchase various currencies, principally British pounds and Dutch guilders, for $21.4 and to sell various currencies, principally Dutch guilders and German marks for $11.3. The differences between fair value of all outstanding contracts at year-end and the contract amounts were immaterial. Assuming that year-end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical 10%, the change in the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year-end would be a decrease of approximately $2.8. However, since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged.    At December 31, 1998, non-derivative financial instruments subject to foreign exchange rate risk consisted primarily of $10.3 in foreign currency denominated short-term debt. Assuming that year-end exchange rates were to adversely change by a hypothetical 10%, the increase in the fair value would be approximately $1.0.  Commodity Price Risk Occasionally, the Company utilizes futures contracts, predominantly involving natural gas, to manage its exposure to price risk associated with the production of ammonia, methanol and other building block chemical products. The maturity of these contracts correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity. The contracts are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that the Company pays for the underlying commodity. Accordingly, while these contracts limit the Company's exposure to increases in commodity prices, they also limit the potential benefit the Company might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices.    At December 31, 1998, the Company had $4.6 net natural gas futures contracts with January, February and March 1999 delivery dates outstanding. Based on year- end prices, the Company had a net unrealized loss of $1.0. Assuming that year- end prices were to adversely change by a hypothetical 10%, the incremental increase in cost of goods sold would be approximately $0.4.  Interest Rate Risk  At December 31, 1998, the financial liabilities of the Company exposed to changes in interest rates consisted mainly of $10.3 in foreign currency denominated short-term borrowings and $100.0 variable rate borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. The Company is also party to an interest rate swap agreement that converts $20.0 of variable rate interest obligations on the Company's Credit Facility to fixed rate interest obligations. Assuming that a hypothetical increase of 1% in interest rates and all other variables, i.e., foreign exchange rates and debt levels, were to remain constant, interest expense would increase $0.9 per year. Included in long-term debt is also $319.5 of fixed rate public debt, which is not subject to interest rate risk.                                         30   Item 8.
