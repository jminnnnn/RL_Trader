Item 7.    MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the description of our business and risk factors contained in Part I of this report. Currency amounts are in millions, except per share amounts. Percentages are approximate.   GENERAL       We are a global specialty materials and chemicals company focused on developing, manufacturing and selling value-added products. Our products serve adiverse range of end markets including aerospace and industrial materials, mining and plastics. Sales price and volume by region and the impact of exchange rates on our reporting segments are important measures that are analyzed by management andare provided in our segment analysis.    We report net sales in four geographic regions: North America, Latin America, Asia/Pacific andEurope/Middle East/Africa. The destination of the sale determines the region under which it is reported consistent with managements view of the business. North America consists of the United States and Canada. Latin America includes Mexico,Central America, South America and the Caribbean Islands. Asia/Pacific is comprised of Asia, Australia and the islands of the South Pacific Rim.   Selling price changes and raw material cost changes year on year are an important factor in profitability especially in years of high volatility.Discussion of the year to year impact of raw materials and energy is provided in our segment discussion. In addition, higher global demand levels and, occasionally, operating difficulties at suppliers, have limited the availability of certain of ourraw materials.    Acquisitions   Umeco plc    On July 20, 2012, wecompleted the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Umeco plc (Umeco), an international provider of composite and process materials, in an all-cash transaction at a cost of approximately $423.8. To fund the transaction, we usedapproximately $170.0 from the draw-down of our existing $400.0 revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) with the balance funded by cash on hand. The acquisition is intended to strengthen our position as a leadingmanufacturer of composite materials, while offering significant opportunities for growth and value creation, particularly in industrial composites and process materials. The acquired Umeco business is being reported as a separate segment. See Note 2of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.    Star Orechem International Private Limited   On March 30, 2012, we acquired the manufacturing assets of Star Orechem International Private Limited (SOIL), in Nagpur, Central India, in a cashtransaction. The acquisition is expected to increase our global capacity for our Metal Extraction Product line of our In Process Separation segment by approximately 25%, and provides the ability to further expand production at the site. We are inthe process of completing and upgrading the capabilities of the acquired plant to meet appropriate safety and operating standards. Our expectation is that this work will be completed and we will begin production of our mining chemical products inthe first half of 2014. The results of operations of the acquired business have been included in our In Process Separation segment since April 1, 2012. The acquisition was funded from our cash on hand and has been accounted for as anacquisition of a business. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.    Discontinued Operations   Coating Resins    Theresults of operations of the former Coating Resins segment are reported as discontinued operations, and are therefore excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. The results of the PSA product line areincluded in discontinued operations up through its sale on July 31, 2012. All previously reported financial information has been revised to conform to the current presentation.    On July 31, 2012, we completed the sale of the PSA product line of the Coating Resins segment to Henkel AG & Co. (Henkel) for approximately $105.0, including working capital ofapproximately $15.0, subject to post-closing working capital adjustments. In August, we received cash consideration of $112.8 from the sale. We recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of $8.6 in 2012, which is included in Net (loss) gain on sale ofdiscontinued operations, net of tax in the consolidated statements of income.    On October 9, 2012, we entered into a definitive agreementto divest our remaining Coating Resins business to Advent International, a global private equity firm for $1,032.0 plus assumed liabilities of $118.0 bringing the total value to $1,150.0. The sale      -20-        is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013, following the satisfaction of regulatory requirements and other customary closing conditions. As a result, we recorded cumulative after-taxcharges of $25.2 in 2012 to adjust our carrying value of the disposal group to its fair value less cost to sell, based on the terms of the definitive agreement. The charge is included in Net (loss) gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of taxin the consolidated statements of income.    Building Block Chemicals    On February 28, 2011, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of our Building Block Chemicals business (the Business) to Cornerstone ChemicalCompany, an affiliate of HIG Capital, LLC (the Purchaser), pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Agreement) dated January 28, 2011, between the Company and the Purchaser. The total consideration received from thesale was $175.7, including cash consideration of $160.7 that we received at closing and a promissory note for $15.0. A cash payment of $6.6 was made to the Purchaser in July 2011 as final settlement of the agreed upon working capital transferred,resulting in net realized consideration of $169.1. Accordingly, the business was treated as discontinued operations and excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.   Segment realignment    We regularly reviewour segment reporting and classifications and may periodically change our reportable segments to align with strategic and operational changes. In the first quarter of 2012, we announced that we had retained an advisor to help us explore thepotential separation of our Coating Resins segment, along with the PSA product line and certain methyl acrylamide (NMA) product groups. In light of this potential separation, we realigned our segment reporting (internal and external) andmanagement structure accordingly. PSA and NMA, which previously were included in our Engineered Materials and Additive Technologies segments, respectively, became a part of the Coating Resins segment. Concurrently, to align the segments with ourrevised management structure and operating model, we moved the formulated resins business out of the Engineered Materials segment into the Additive Technologies segment. As noted above, in October 2012 we signed an agreement for the sale of theCoating Resins business to Advent International.    As discussed above, the former Coating Resins and Building Block Chemicals segments arereported as discontinued operations for all periods presented, and the acquired Umeco business is reported as a separate segment and includes results of operations since we acquired it on July 20, 2012.   In 2013, we plan to report separately the aerospace and industrial materials from the Engineered Materials and Umeco segments into two new segments,Aerospace Materials and Industrial Materials. They will be managed and reported separately to properly align our resources, assets, and strategy with target end-markets. Manufacturing assets and processes are similar although supply chains aredissimilar. We believe this is a more appropriate way to reflect how we anticipate managing the business going forward, and follows our strategy of focusing on aerospace and industrial markets separately. The new segment reporting is expected to bein effect the first quarter of 2013 and we believe is more transparent and understandable to investors.

International net sales were $913.1, $729.7 and $665.5, or 53%, 52%, and 54% of total net sales, for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   We have four reportable business segments: Engineered Materials, Umeco, In Process Separation, and Additive Technologies. The Engineered Materialssegment principally includes advanced composites, carbon fiber, and structural film adhesives. The Umeco segment includes advanced composites and process materials, primarily for the aerospace and defense, wind energy, automotive, recreationand other industrial segments. The In Process Separation segment includes mining chemicals and phosphines. The Additive Technologies segment includes polymer additives, specialty additives and formulated resins.  For more information on our segments, refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and further discussions under SegmentResults below.    YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011       Consolidated Results   Net sales for 2012 were $1,708.1, compared with $1,415.9 for 2011. Overall, net sales increased 21%, of which 11% was attributable to sales from the newlyacquired Umeco segment since July 20, 2012, 6% was due to net volume increases in the existing three segments, and 4% related to selling price increases. Net sales for Engineered Materials and In Process Separation improved by 14% and 13%,respectively, over 2011, due to improved volumes and selling price increases. Net sales for Additive Technologies decreased by 6% compared to 2011, as its selling price increases were not sufficient to offset the lower sales volume and negativeimpact of changes in foreign exchange rates. For a detailed discussion on sales, refer to the Segment Results section below.   Manufacturing cost of sales was $1,181.5, or 69.2% of sales, for 2012 compared with $992.2, or 70.1% of sales, for 2011. The increase in manufacturingcost of sales of $189.3 compared to 2011 is due mostly to the addition of costs of sales of $120.0 related to Umeco, which includes $5.6 related to the step-up of acquired inventory to fair value at the acquisition date. Also, we incurred $46.3 ofhigher period costs, mostly labor, primarily to meet increased production demand for Engineered Materials, $33.7 of higher variable costs, primarily raw materials, from increased volumes in the Engineered Materials and In Process Separationsegments, increased freight costs of $4.5, and higher raw materials prices of $1.9. Restructuring charges were higher by $2.6 in 2012, primarily related to mitigation of continuing costs following the future separation of Coating Resins and plans torealign the supporting structure of our Umeco segment as we take advantage of synergies from the acquisition. These increases in manufacturing costs of sales were partially offset by the impact of      -22-        foreign exchange rate changes, which decreased costs by $12.3, and favorable fixed cost absorption into inventory of $7.4.    Selling and technical services expenses were $147.8 for 2012 versus $127.2 for 2011. Research and process development expenses in 2012 were $52.9 versus $45.0 in the prior year. Administrative and generalexpenses were $136.6 versus $96.1 in the prior year. Overall operating expenses increased by $69.0 including operating expenses of the new Umeco segment of $23.4. The remaining increase is primarily due to higher restructuring costs of $17.8 in 2012related to our effort to mitigate continuing costs following the expected separation of Coating Resins and plans to realign the supporting structure of our Umeco segment as we take advantage of synergies from the acquisition, higher costs ofapproximately $18.6 to support increased commercial activity and investment in technical services and research and development in our Engineered Materials and In Process Separation businesses, $8.4 of costs related to the acquisition of Umeco priorto the acquisition date, and $2.5 for accelerated depreciation related to the sale-leaseback of our Stamford research labs treated as a financing transaction. These increases were mitigated by a favorable impact from changes in exchange rates of$4.8.    Amortization of acquisition intangibles was $9.0 for 2012 versus $3.2 for 2011. The increase is due to the amortization of intangibleassets acquired from the Umeco acquisition completed on July 20, 2012.    Net (loss) gain on sale of assets of $(16.7) in 2012 consists ofthe loss from the sale of our research facility in Stamford, CT. We sold the facility in September 2011, and lease back a portion of the facility. However, we were precluded from recognizing the sale at the time of the original transaction due toour continuing environmental obligation at the site, and we recorded the transaction as a financing transaction at the time. Upon satisfactory completion of our obligation in the fourth quarter of 2012, we recognized the loss for the remainingexcess carrying value. Net (loss) gain on sale of assets of $3.3 in 2011 includes a gain on the sale of a former manufacturing site in Bogota, Colombia in the first quarter of 2011.    Other expense, net was $1.7 for 2012 versus $5.1 for 2011. Included in 2012 is an expense of $1.1 for a foreign exchange loss on an acquired Umeco intercompany loan that was settled during the thirdquarter. Included in 2011 are environmental accrual charges related to inactive locations totaling $5.2, and a charge of $1.2 related to the settlement of an existing pension plan in an international jurisdiction. These expenses were partiallyoffset by transaction exchange gains of $4.0 during the year.    The loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2012 was $0.2, compared to a loss of$0.3 in 2011.    Equity in earnings (loss) of associated companies was $(0.2) in 2012 versus $0.0 in 2011.  Interest expense, net was $30.1 for 2012 compared with $35.8 for 2011. The $5.7 decrease is primarily due to higher capitalized interest of $7.3 as aresult of restarting the carbon fiber expansion project in 2012 and the phosphine capacity expansion project, which was partially offset by higher interest expense of $1.0, mostly on the partial drawdown of the Revolving Credit Facility in thesecond quarter of 2012, and lower interest income of $0.8.    The effective income tax rate for 2012 was a tax provision of 28.4% ($37.3)compared to a tax provision of 24.7% ($28.3) for 2011. For 2012, the rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $11.6 attributable to the reversal of certain tax reserves due to the completion of U.S. tax audits for the years ended 2004 through2008, and the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain international tax jurisdictions. It was unfavorably impacted by net tax expenses of $10.6 related to managements intention to no longer permanently reinvest un-repatriatedearnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. Included in the $10.6 is a tax expense of $3.1 attributable to the repatriation of certain earnings in 2012 and an estimated $7.5 expected to be incurred on the future repatriation of other earningssubsequent to the sale of Coating Resins.    The  American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012  (2012 Tax Relief Act), as signed into law on January2, 2013 extended a host of expired and expiring tax incentives for businesses. These business tax incentives retroactively reinstated and extended through 2013, include, but are not limited to, the research and development credit as well as thefavorable look-through treatment of payments between related controlled foreign corporations. Although this legislation reinstated these favorable tax laws retroactive to January 1, 2012, accounting rules require that the tax impact of such changes,which we estimate to be $2.7, be reflected in the period the law is enacted. We also expect there to be a change to the liability recorded with respect to the unremitted earnings that are anticipated to be repatriated subsequent to the CoatingResins divestiture related not only to this tax law change but also related to the expected divestiture in 2013.    Net earnings from continuingoperations for 2012 was $94.1 ($2.01 per diluted share), an increase of $8.1 from $86.0 ($1.75 per diluted share) reported for the same period in 2011. Included in continuing operations for 2012 were after-tax restructuring charges of $14.6 ($0.31per diluted share) across corporate functions to mitigate continuing costs       -23-        following the anticipated sale of Coating Resins and personnel reductions in the acquired Umeco business; an after-tax loss on the sale of assets at our Stamford facility of $10.5 ($0.23 perdiluted share); after-tax charges of $8.2 ($0.18 per diluted share) related to costs incurred for the acquisition of Umeco; after-tax charges of $3.8 ($0.08 per diluted share) related to the step-up of Umeco inventory to fair value as of theacquisition date; accelerated depreciation of $1.5 after-tax ($0.03 per diluted share) for the sale-leaseback of our Stamford facility treated as a financing transaction prior to recognizing the sale, and an after-tax foreign exchange loss of $0.7($0.01 per diluted share) on the settlement of an acquired intercompany loan from the Umeco transaction. Also included in 2012 is a tax benefit of $11.6 ($0.25 per diluted share) attributable to the reversal of certain tax reserves due to thecompletion of U.S. tax audits for the years ended 2004 through 2008, and the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain international tax jurisdictions; an income tax provision of $7.5 ($0.16 per diluted share) related to the establishmentof a liability for un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which we can no longer consider permanently reinvested in those entities, due to the anticipated sale of Coating Resins; and $3.1 of income tax expense ($0.07 per diluted share)related to the 2012 repatriation of earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries associated with the sale process of our Coating Resins segment. Included in continuing operations for 2011 was $0.5 of after-tax restructuring costs, after-tax charges of$3.6 for increases to environmental accruals mainly at inactive sites in the U.S. for updated estimated remediation costs, an after-tax gain of $2.1 on the sale of the former manufacturing site in Bogota, Colombia, and an after tax charge of $0.4,for the accelerated depreciation of the Stamford research and development facility we sold in 2011, but were required to maintain on our books until our environmental obligation was satisfied. For 2012 and 2011, net earnings from continuingoperations included pre-tax charges previously allocated to the operations of our discontinued Coating Resins segment of $66.5 and $66.0, respectively, and $1.0 in 2011 for costs previously allocated to the operations of our former Building BlockChemicals segment.    Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, were $96.0 for 2012 compared to $124.9 for the comparable period in2011. The earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax for 2012 reflect the following after-tax amounts: the earnings from operations of our former Coatings segment of $112.6, the realized gain of $8.6 on the sale of our PSA product line whichwas part of the former Coatings segment, and a charge of $25.2 to adjust to the carrying value of the net assets held for sale at December 31, 2012 to their fair value less costs to sell. This charge was based on new information received aboutthe carrying value as determined by our agreement to sell the remaining portion of our former Coatings segment that we entered into in October 2012. For 2012, earnings from operations of our former Coatings segment included the following after-taxitems: charges of $16.9 related to costs associated with the sale of Coating Resins, $7.6 of income tax expense related to the requirement of establishing a tax liability on a portion of the un-repatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries tobe sold as part of the sale of Coating Resins, a charge of $1.1 related to an increase in the environmental liability at a certain site for new remedial design requirements, and $1.2 of restructuring charges.   The 2011 earnings reflect the results of our former Coating Resins segment and our former Building Block Chemicals segment, prior to its sale in the firstquarter of 2011. The results for 2011 also include the net after-tax gain of $34.6 resulting from the completion of the sale of our former Building Block Chemicals segment in the first quarter of 2011.   Net income for 2012 was $188.0, or $4.02 per diluted share, compared with net income in 2011 of $207.8, or $4.24 per diluted share.       Segment Results (Sales to external customers)   Year-to-year comparisons and analyses of changes in net sales by segment and geographic region are set forth below:   Engineered Materials                                                                               % Change Due to             2012         2011         Total % Change        Price        Volume/Mix        Currency        North America      $  557.6          $  514.5             8  %         3  %         5  %         0  %      Latin America         4.7             3.8             24  %         2  %         22  %         0  %      Asia/Pacific         59.1             42.3             40  %         4  %         36  %         0  %      Europe/Middle East/Africa         282.1             228.6             23  %         5  %         18  %         0  %      Total      $  903.5          $  789.2             14  %         3  %         11  %         0  %        -24-        Overall, net sales increased 14% primarily due to increased selling volumes of 11%. The higher sellingvolumes in 2012 were primarily attributable to the continued ramp up of new large commercial transport programs and increased build rates of existing large commercial transport models. In addition, we also experienced higher sales volumes as aresult of build rate increases across the military, civil rotorcraft and certain segments within the business jet market. Selling prices increases across all product lines resulted in higher sales of 3%. Changes in exchange rates did notsignificantly impact net sales.    Earnings from operations were $165.3, or 18% of net sales, in 2012, compared with $124.9, or 16% of net sales,in 2011. The $40.4 increase in earnings was driven by increased marginal income of $49.1 due to higher sales volumes, higher selling prices of $28.1, the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates of $6.2, favorable fixed cost absorption of $3.4due to higher production levels in 2012, and $1.2 of other benefits which include reductions in manufacturing waste and raw material costs. These positive impacts were partially offset by higher manufacturing period costs of $35.5 to meet increasedproduction demands, $9.1 of higher operating expenses due to continued investments in research and development and technical services in support of new growth, higher sales incentives, higher corporate charges, a bad debt provision and $3.0 ofhigher freight expenses due to increased sales.        Umeco (fromJuly 21, 2012 through December 31, 2012)                                                                                % Change Due to             2012         2011         Total % Change (1)         Price         Volume/Mix         Currency        North America      $  51.0          $      -             -             -             -             -         Latin America         6.5             -             -             -             -             -         Asia/Pacific         6.0             -             -             -             -             -         Europe/Middle East/Africa         86.5             -             -             -             -             -         Total      $  150.0          $  -             -             -             -             -             (1)  Sales prior to July 21, 2012 were not attributable to Cytec. Therefore, percentage changes are not meaningful.       Net sales in 2012 represent the period from July 21, 2012 throughDecember 31, 2012. Structural materials (advanced composites) sales in Europe were impacted by the economic slowdown, particularly in high-end automotive and motorsports, while sales in North America were negatively impacted by reduced sales ofprocess materials (vacuum bagging materials) to the wind sector.    Earnings from operations were $1.0, or 1% of net sales in2012. Earnings from operations for Umeco in 2012 include a $5.6 charge for inventory written up to fair value as a result of purchase accounting for the acquisition.       In Process Separation                                                                              % Change Due to             2012         2011         Total % Change        Price        Volume/Mix        Currency        North America      $  103.5          $  97.6             6  %         10  %         (4  %)         0  %      Latin America         113.0             105.6             7  %         5  %         2  %         0  %      Asia/Pacific         85.6             80.3             7  %         3  %         3  %         1  %      Europe/Middle East/Africa         82.1             56.0             47  %         11  %         37  %         (1  %)      Total      $  384.2          $  339.5             13  %         7  %         6  %         0  %         Overall, net sales were up 13% in 2012 due to priceincreases of 7% and increased selling volumes of 6%. Selling prices increased across most product lines to more than offset higher raw material costs. The volume increase reflects strong demand for mining products in copper markets, particularly fornew mine startups in Europe/Middle East/Africa region, increased demand for our new products, and strong demand for phosphine gases and derivative products. This was partially offset by a softening alumina market.   Earnings from operations were $91.8, or 24% of net sales, in 2012, compared with $69.7, or 21% of net sales, in 2011. The $22.1 increase in earningsis the result of increased selling prices of $23.0, increased marginal income of $15.0 due to higher volumes, a favorable impact from changes in exchange rates of $3.2, and favorable fixed cost      -25-        absorption $3.0 on higher production levels to support increased volumes. This was partially offset by higher commercial and other operating expenses of $10.0 caused by increased headcountrelated to the segments growth initiatives, increased manufacturing period costs of $7.6, higher freight costs of $2.5 due to increased volumes and higher rates, and higher raw material costs of $1.9.       Additive Technologies                                                                              % Change Due to             2012         2011         Total % Change        Price        Volume/Mix        Currency        North America      $  118.7          $  121.1             (2  %)         4  %         (6  %)         0  %      Latin America         22.1             24.2             (9  %)         12  %         (15  %)         (6  %)      Asia/Pacific         67.6             66.2             2  %         (1  %)         3  %         0  %      Europe/Middle East/Africa         62.0             75.7             (18  %)         4  %         (16  %)         (6  %)      Total      $  270.4          $  287.2             (6  %)         3  %         (7  %)         (2  %)         Overall, net sales decreased 6%, as lower sellingvolumes of 7% were partially offset by price increases of 3%. Lower selling volumes relate principally to specialty additives products, which were partially offset by higher volumes for polymer additive products. In Europe, a slowing economy reduceddemand for both specialty additives and polymer additives products. Lower demand for specialty additives in North America was partially offset by strong demand for polymer additives in the region. The impact of changes in exchange rates loweredsales by 2%.    Earnings from operations were $37.9, or 14% of net sales, for 2012, compared with $39.4, or 14% of net sales, in 2011. The$1.5 decrease in earnings is due to reduced marginal income of $10.2 on lower volumes, increased manufacturing period costs of $2.8 due to wage inflation, benefits, and depreciation, higher raw material costs of $1.2, higher commercial andadministration costs of $0.5 related to wage inflation and benefits, and a net unfavorable impact of $0.2 from changes in exchange rates. The negative effects were partially offset by $10.3 of selling price increases, lower freight costs of $2.0 dueto lower volumes, and favorable fixed cost absorption of $1.1.    YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010       Consolidated Results   Net sales for 2011 were $1,415.9, compared with $1,223.4 for 2010. Overall, net sales increased 16%, driven by volume increases of 11%, afavorable impact from changes in exchange rates of 1%, and price increases of 4%. Higher selling prices improved sales in all segments in 2011 compared to 2010. Engineered Materials and In Process Separation improved their selling volumes by 17% and9%, respectively, compared to the 2010 period. Additive Technologies sales were impacted by 1% lower volumes compared to 2010. For a detailed discussion on sales, refer to the Segment Results section below.   Manufacturing cost of sales was $992.2, or 70.1% of sales, for 2011 compared with $861.6, or 70.4% of sales, for 2010. The increase in manufacturing costof sales of $130.6 compared to 2010 is due primarily to $49.8 of increased costs due to higher net sales volume in 2011, primarily related to Engineered Materials, higher raw material costs of $42.5, higher period costs of $42.5 mostly due toincreased costs from higher production demand and volume in the Engineered Materials segment, and the unfavorable impact of changes in exchange rates of $8.8. These increases were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption of $8.5 and $4.4of lower restructuring charges in 2011. Approximately $0.9 of restructuring charges are included in manufacturing cost of sales in 2011, representing net adjustments of prior year restructuring accruals. Restructuring charges in cost of sales in2010 were $5.3, primarily related to the exit of a phosphorus product at our Mt. Pleasant manufacturing facility.    Selling and technicalservices expenses were $127.2 for 2011 versus $113.4 for 2010. Research and process development expenses in 2011 were $45.0 versus $38.1 in the prior year. Administrative and general expenses were $96.1 versus $93.6 in the prior year. Overalloperating expenses increased by $23.2. This increase is primarily related to higher 2011 operating costs of $18.7 primarily related to increased spending to support growth initiatives in Engineered Materials and In Process Separation, theunfavorable impact of changes in exchange rates of $4.6, and higher restructuring charges in 2011 of $0.7.    Amortization of acquisitionintangibles was $3.2 both for 2011 and 2010.       -26-        Net gain on sale of assets of $3.3 in 2011 includes a gain from the sale of a former manufacturing site inBogota, Colombia in the first quarter of 2011.    Other expense, net was $5.1 for 2011 versus $5.9 for 2010. Included in 2011 are environmentalaccrual charges related to inactive locations totaling $5.2, and a charge of $1.2 related to the settlement of an existing pension plan in an international jurisdiction. These expenses were partially offset by transaction exchange gains of $4.0during the year. Included in 2010 are environmental accruals related to inactive locations totaling $8.3 and losses on cross currency swaps of $3.0. Also included in 2010 are a gain on the sale of a parcel of land of $2.3, a gain from the settlementof a legal claim of $2.4, and transaction exchange gains of $1.7.    The loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2011 was $0.3 compared to a lossof $0.8 in 2010, due to early repurchases of $5.5 and $16.5 in 2011 and 2010, respectively, of our notes due in 2013.    Interest expense, netwas $35.8 for 2011 compared with $33.2 for 2010. The $2.6 increase is primarily due to the $7.3 reduction in the benefits of the interest differential on the five year cross currency swaps, which settled on October 1, 2010, and on the ten yearcross currency swaps, which were re-designated as a net investment hedge on October 1, 2010. The increase was partially offset by higher interest income of $2.3 on cash balances and the note receivable from the sale of our former Building BlockChemicals segment, higher capitalized interest of $1.2, and the 2010 redemption of our 5.5% notes which reduced interest by $0.6.    Theeffective income tax rate for 2011 was a tax provision of 24.7% ($28.3) compared to a tax provision of 9.0% ($6.6) for 2010. The 2011 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by tax benefits of $2.0 attributable to several tax rate changes incertain tax jurisdictions.    Net earnings from continuing operations for 2011 was $86.0 ($1.75 per diluted share), an increase of $19.0 from$67.0 ($1.35 per diluted share) reported for the same period in 2010. Included in continuing operations for 2011 was $0.5 of after-tax restructuring costs, after-tax charges of $3.6 for increases to environmental accruals mainly at inactive sites inthe U.S. for updated estimated remediation costs, an after-tax gain of $2.1 on the sale of the former manufacturing site in Bogota, Colombia, and an after tax charge of $0.4, for the accelerated depreciation of the Stamford research and developmentfacility we sold in 2011, but were required to maintain on our books until our environmental obligation was satisfied. Included in 2010 was an after-tax charge of $3.4 primarily related to the exit of certain phosphorus derivative products at ourMt. Pleasant, TN facility. Our 2010 results also include an after-tax charge of $2.9 related to an increase in environmental liabilities at two inactive locations for a change in estimate for operating and maintenance costs, a tax charge of$8.3 related to the impact of health care legislation, and a tax benefit of $11.8 related to a valuation allowance reversal in international jurisdictions. For 2011 and 2010, net earnings from continuing operations included pre-tax chargespreviously allocated to the operations of our discontinued Coating Resins segment of $66.0 and $6.3, respectively, and $1.0 and $61.4, respectively, for costs previously allocated to the operations of our former Building Block Chemicals segment.   Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax was $124.9 in 2011 compared with $108.1 in 2010 and reflects the results of our formerBuilding Block Chemicals segment. The results in 2011 include the net after tax gain of $34.6 resulting from the sale of the business in the first quarter of 2011.    Net income for 2011 was $207.8, or $4.24 per diluted share, compared with net income in 2010 of $172.3, or $3.46 per diluted share.       Segment Results (Sales to external customers)   Year-to-year comparisons and analyses of changes in net sales by segment and geographic region are set forth below:   Engineered Materials                                                                               % Change Due to             2011         2010         Total % Change        Price        Volume/Mix        Currency        North America      $  514.5          $  432.3             19  %         3  %         16  %         0  %      Latin America (1)         3.8             2.6             -            -            -            -         Asia/Pacific         42.3             32.5             30  %         2  %         28  %         0  %      Europe/Middle East/Africa         228.6             192.8             19  %         3  %         15  %         1  %      Total      $  789.2          $  660.2             20  %         3  %         17  %         0  %          (1)  Due to the level of sales in this geographic region, percentage comparisons are not meaningful.          -27-        Overall, net sales increased 20% primarily due to increased selling volumes of 17%. The higher sellingvolumes in 2011 are due to the continued ramp up of new large commercial transport programs, build rate increases for existing large commercial transport programs, and the general recovery of the civil aircraft market. These volume increases werepartially offset by lower sales volumes to the military sector related to the sunset of the C-17 and F-22 programs. Selling prices across all product lines increased net sales by 3%, while changes in exchange rates were not significant.   Earnings from operations were $124.9, or 16% of net sales, in 2011, compared with $107.1, or 16% of net sales, in 2010. The $17.8 increase inearnings was driven by increased marginal income of $63.7 due to higher sales volumes, higher selling prices of $20.2, and favorable absorption of $5.5 due to increased production levels in 2011. These positive impacts were partially offset byhigher manufacturing and freight costs of $35.7 in support of increased production volumes and preparations for expected further volume increases in the near future, $19.2 of cost escalations driven primarily by higher raw material costs, $14.0 ofhigher operating expenses due to continued investments in selling and technology in support of new growth, and the unfavorable impact of changes in exchange rates of $2.7.       In Process Separation                                                                              % Change Due to             2011         2010         Total % Change        Price        Volume/Mix        Currency        North America      $  97.6          $  76.8             27  %         12  %         15  %         0  %      Latin America         105.6             90.1             17  %         7  %         10  %         0  %      Asia/Pacific         80.3             66.1             21  %         (1  %)         18  %         4  %      Europe/Middle East/Africa         56.0             59.2             (5  %)         4  %         (9  %)         0  %      Total      $  339.5          $  292.2             16  %         6  %         9  %         1  %         Overall, net sales were up 16%, primarily due toincreased selling volumes of 9% based on strong demand for mining products in the alumina and copper markets and phosphine products in North America. Selling prices increased by 6%, with increases in both the mining and phosphines businesses. Theseprice increases reflect our efforts to offset higher raw material costs. Changes in exchange rates favorably impacted net sales by 1%.   Earnings from operations were $69.7, or 21% of net sales, in 2011, compared with $55.2, or 19% of net sales, in 2010. The $14.5 increase in earningsis the result of increased marginal income of $22.7 due to higher volumes, increased selling prices of $17.3, and favorable absorption $1.6 due to higher sales demand. This is partially offset by higher raw material costs of $12.9, higher operatingexpenses of $9.5 caused by increased headcount related to the segments growth initiatives, higher freight costs of $1.5 due to increased volumes, additional period costs of $1.1 due to maintenance activities, and an unfavorable impact fromchanges in exchange rates of $2.1.        Additive Technologies                                                                              % Change Due to             2011         2010         Total % Change        Price        Volume/Mix        Currency        North America      $  121.1          $  115.3             5  %         6  %         (1  %)         0  %      Latin America         24.2             21.8             11  %         5  %         4  %         2  %      Asia/Pacific         66.2             66.5             0  %         2  %         (5  %)         3  %      Europe/Middle East/Africa         75.7             67.4             12  %         7  %         (1  %)         6  %      Total      $  287.2          $  271.0             6  %         5  %         (1  %)         2  %         Overall, net sales increased 6%, of which 5%pertains to selling price increases, especially for the specialty additives business. These price increases reflect our efforts to recover the higher raw materials costs. Selling volumes decreased by 1%, primarily due to lower demand for products inthe polymer additives business. Additionally, changes in exchange rates improved net sales by 2%.    Earnings from operations were $39.4, or 14%of net sales, for 2011, compared with $40.3, or 15% of net sales, in 2010. The $0.9 decrease in earnings is due to higher raw material costs of $10.4, reduced marginal income of $1.9 on lower volumes, and higher period and operating expenses of$7.1 due to salary inflation factors and higher plant maintenance costs, and a $0.8 bad debt provision       -28-        for a polymer additives customer in Spain. The negative effects are essentially offset by $14.8 of selling price increases, favorable production absorption of $1.6 reflecting higher productionlevels through the third quarter, a net favorable impact from changes in exchange rates of $2.6, and lower freight costs of $0.3 due to lower volumes.    RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES        In accordance with our accounting policy, restructuring costs are included in our corporate unallocated operating results for segment reporting purposes consistent with managements view of itsbusinesses.    Details of our 2012 restructuring initiatives are as follows:    In the third quarter of 2012, we approved plans to realign the supporting structure of our Umeco segment as we take advantage of synergies from the acquisition. These plans resulted in a restructuringcharge of $6.6 related to the severance costs and other benefits of 28 positions. The initiatives are expected to be substantially completed in 2013 and paid by the end of 2015.    In the second quarter of 2012, we launched initiatives in our corporate functions across sales, marketing, manufacturing, supply chain, research and development, and administrative functions to mitigatecontinuing costs following the anticipated sale of Coating Resins. These initiatives resulted in charges related to severance and employee benefits of $14.7 associated with the elimination of 177 positions. These initiatives are expected to besubstantially completed and paid by the end of by 2014.    We realized an estimated $3.6 of cost savings in 2012 related to these initiatives andexpect to realize an estimated $19.2, $4.3 and $2.1 of incremental pre-tax savings in 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively.    The remaining reserverelating to the 2012 restructuring initiatives at December 31, 2012 is $13.2.    Details of our 2010 restructuring initiatives are asfollows:    In May 2010, we approved plans to exit the production of certain phosphorus derivative products at our Mt. Pleasant, Tennesseefacility. These plans resulted in a restructuring charge of $5.5, of which $0.4 relates to the severance of 10 positions, $1.7 relates to asset write-offs, and $3.4 relates to decommissioning activities, all of which related to our In ProcessSeparation segment.    We realized an estimated $1.4 and $3.1 of cost savings in 2010 and 2011 respectively, related to these initiatives. During2012 we recorded a net favorable adjustment of $0.2. The aforementioned initiatives were substantially completed in 2011and all costs have been paid in full as of December 31, 2012.    See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further summary of the restructuring charges.    LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION        At December 31, 2012, our cash balance was $179.3, compared with $415.8 at year-end 2011. As of December 31, 2012, $17.8 of our cash was in the U.S. and $161.5 was held by our subsidiariesoutside the U.S.    Net cash provided by continuing operations    Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for 2012 was $167.7 compared with $61.6 for 2011. Inventory increased $17.6 due to higher production lead times resulting from theincreased demand in Engineered Materials and In Process Separation. Inventory days on hand were at 78 days at the end of 2012, which is up compared to 68 days at the end of 2011. Trade accounts receivable increased $9.0 due to higher sales with daysoutstanding of 49 days for 2012, which is slightly above the 2011 amount of 48 days. Accounts payable decreased by $1.7, while 2012 accounts payable days outstanding were 53 days, which is higher than 2011 of 50 days. Accrued expenses increased by$23.3, due to overall higher accruals for costs connected with the Coatings separation and Umeco acquisition, higher employee compensation and benefits accruals, as well as restructuring charges incurred during the year. In the fourth quarter of2012, we deferred a tax payment of $21.0 to the first quarter of 2013 resulting from the U.S. governments decision to provide tax relief for taxpayers in the federally declared disaster areas on the East Coast struck by Hurricane Sandy. Otherliabilities decreased by $28.5 primarily due to contributions of $37.8 and $13.5 to our pension and postretirement plans, respectively.    Netcash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $594.6 in 2012 compared to $75.5 in 2011. In 2012, we used $420.8 in cash to acquire Umeco and $28.5 to purchase a business in India to increase our manufacturing capacity in our InProcess Separation segment, as discussed in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2011, we received proceeds of $3.4 from sales of certain real estate and facilities of a former site.      -29-        Capital spending for 2012 was $145.3 compared to $78.9 in 2011. Capital spending in 2012 is primarily attributable to investments for the strategic expansion of our growth businesses within theEngineered Materials and In Process Separation segments, in addition to maintenance of business capital across the Company. In the second quarter of 2012, we restarted the carbon fiber expansion project that had been put on hold since the firstquarter of 2009, to support the growing demand for carbon fiber materials in the aerospace industry. The projects construction is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2014, with industrial fiber production expected in 2015 andaerospace qualified fiber production expected in 2016. We have also commenced production on a new prepreg manufacturing expansion project, with commercial production expected to occur in 2015. In 2012, we also began expansion of our phosphine plantin Canada for our In Process Separation segment, expected to be completed in 2014. Our total capital spending for 2013 is expected to increase to approximately $300.0 for continuing operations.   Net cash used in financing activities was $44.0 in 2012 compared with $211.5 in 2011. During 2012, we repurchased $99.9 of treasury stock and paid cashdividends of $25.9. These cash outflows were partially offset by net cash proceeds of $49.2 from the use of our short and long term borrowings. This was primarily related to the net borrowings of $62.0 from our Revolving Credit Facility, which wasdrawn down by $170.0 for the purpose of funding the Umeco acquisition in July 2012, most of which was repaid by December 31, 2012, and for use in our expanded share repurchase program that began in the fourth quarter of 2012. We also received$28.0 of proceeds from stock option exercises, and had $5.9 of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments in 2012. In 2011, we repurchased $196.1 of treasury stock, we paid cash dividends of $27.1, and we had net debt repayments of $8.7.The cash outflows were partly offset by $11.0 of proceeds received from the sale-leaseback transaction of our research and development facilities in Stamford, Connecticut, that originally was treated as a financing transaction, $8.1 of proceeds fromthe exercise of stock options and $1.5 of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments.    Share repurchases   In 2012, we repurchased 1,455,111 shares of common stock for $99.9 under our stock buyback program. As of December 31, 2012, approximately $550.1remained available from the $650.0 authorization announced on October 9, 2012. Pursuant to our stock buyback program, shares can be repurchased in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions at our discretion.   Dividends    During 2012, we paid fourquarterly cash dividends of $0.125 per common share, which aggregated to $22.9. On January 31, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share, payable on February 25, 2013 to stockholders ofrecord as of February 11, 2013. Also during 2012, our majority owned subsidiary paid cash dividends to their minority shareholders which aggregated to $3.0.    Net cash provided by discontinued operations    Net cash provided by operating activities ofdiscontinued operations for 2012 was $146.0, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations of $150.2 for 2011. For 2012 and 2011, these cash flows consisted primarily of the net earnings from discontinuedoperations of our former Coating Resins segment, and also included the net earnings of our former Building Block Chemicals segment for 2011. In 2011, cash used includes a tax payment of $13.3 related to the gain on the sale of Building BlockChemicals.    Net cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations was $84.7 in 2012, compared with net cash provided byinvesting activities of discontinued operations of $117.8 in 2011. For 2012, we received net proceeds of $112.8 from the sale of the PSA product line in the third quarter of 2012 and proceeds of $5.0 from the sale of assets, which were offset by$31.9 of capital expenditures in the Coating Resins business. In 2011, we received cash proceeds of $152.2, net of transaction costs, related to the sale of our former Building Block Chemicals segment, which were offset by capital spending of $2.4for the business prior to the sale, and $37.6 of capital spending for the former Coating Resins segment. Also in 2011 we received $5.5 in proceeds from the sale of assets.    Credit facility    There was $62.0 outstanding under the $400.0 unsecured five-year revolvingcredit facility at December 31, 2012. On June 21, 2011, we amended and restated our existing Five Year Credit Agreement (the Agreement). The material terms and conditions of the Agreement remain substantially similar to theprior agreement except as set forth below. As the result of the amendment and restatement, the maximum amount we may borrow under the Agreement continues to be $400.0, but now also includes a $25.0 swing line,      -30-        and the term of the Agreement was extended to June 21, 2016. Subject to the consent of the lenders, we have the ability under certain circumstances to extend the term of the Agreementthrough June 21, 2019 and to increase the maximum amount we may borrow under the Agreement to up to $500.0. This facility contains covenants that are customary for such facilities, including two financial covenants: the ratio of consolidatedtotal debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense. We are in compliance with these covenants and expect to be incompliance for the foreseeable future.    Funding of future cash requirements    We believe that we have the ability to fund our operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, planned stock repurchases, as well as the ability to meet our debt service requirements for theforeseeable future from existing cash, from internal cash generation, from the substantial cash we expect to receive upon closing of the Coating Resins transaction, and, when appropriate, through utilization of our existing credit line. From time totime, based on such factors as local tax regulations, prevailing interest rates and our plans for capital investment or other investments, it may make economic sense to utilize our existing credit lines in order to meet our cash requirements, whichmay include debt-service related disbursements. We are required to meet financial ratios under our $400.0 five-year revolving credit agreement, including a maximum permitted ratio of Total Consolidated Debt (as defined) to Consolidated EBITDA (asdefined) and a minimum consolidated EBITDA (as defined) to interest expense ratio. Complying with these ratios could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict ourfinancing activities. Our ability to comply with the covenants will depend on our future operating performance. If we fail to comply with those covenants and terms, we will be in default. In this case, we would be required to obtain waivers from ourlenders in order to maintain compliance. If we were unable to obtain any necessary waivers, the amounts outstanding under this agreement could be accelerated, and become immediately due and payable, and we would not be able to borrow any additionalfunds under the agreement while such default continued. We are in compliance with these covenants and expect to be in compliance for the foreseeable future. We have $62.0 of borrowings outstanding under the agreement as of December 31, 2012.Our ability to fully utilize our revolving credit agreement can be limited by our actual calculated Debt Covenant Ratio as compared to the maximum Debt Covenant Ratio permitted under the agreement. At December 31, 2012, $338.0 of the facilityis available to us, and we expect that the full amount will continue to be available based on our current forecasts.    Use of cash   We have generated a significant amount of cash in recent years. Going into 2013, our use of cash priority will be to invest in the typicalmaintenance of business capital spending projects and pension contributions. This is followed by expansion/cost reduction capital in our growth product lines and fast payback/margin improvement capital in our cash product lines. In addition, ifavailable at a reasonable price, we will pursue bolt-on acquisitions for our growth product lines. We will continue to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We have approximately $550.1 of buyback authorized asof December 31, 2012. Our expectation is to complete the buyback with proceeds received from the anticipated sale of Coating Resins.    Wehave not guaranteed any indebtedness of our unconsolidated associated company.    Inflation at this time is not considered significant althoughhigher costs for energy and commodities could impact our future operating expenses and capital spending. The impact of increasing raw material costs is discussed earlier in Item 1, BUSINESS  Customers and Suppliers.   We estimate that pension and postretirement plan funding will be approximately $67.6 in 2013 compared to $51.3 in 2012. Approximately $50.0 ofthe 2013 funding is expected to be provided by proceeds from the anticipated sale of Coating Resins.       -31-        Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments   The following table sets forth our contractual obligations under long-term agreements as of December 31, 2012:                              (In Millions)      Payments Due by Period      Contractual Obligations      Total         Less Than 1 Year         1-3 Years         3-5 Years         More than 5 Years        Long-term debt      $  705.1          $  136.0          $  250.4          $  312.4          $  6.3         Interest payments (1)         163.6             43.8             74.6             44.7             0.5         Operating leases         39.7             9.6             13.8             9.8             6.5         Capital lease         17.6             2.8             5.9             6.4             2.5         Pension and postretirement plans obligations (2)         67.6             67.6             0.0             0.0             0.0         Purchase obligations         46.5             42.0             2.6             0.6             1.3         Environmental liabilities (2)         9.7             9.7             -             -             -         Other noncurrent liabilities (3)         -             -             -             -             -         Total      $  1,049.8          $  311.5          $  347.3          $  373.9          $  17.1             (1)  Based on the Euro exchange rate at December 31, 2012.         (2)  Expected cash flows for our pension and postretirement plans obligations and environmental liabilities for years beyond 2013 were excluded as specific payment datescould not be reasonably estimated. Amounts reflected to be paid in less than one year are based on our budget and actual amounts paid in 2012 and may vary significantly for pension. See Note 12 (Environmental, Contingencies andCommitments) and Note 14 (Employee Benefit Plans) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these liabilities.        (3)  Included in other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012, were $49.8 of contingent liabilities (principally asbestos relatedliabilities) and $15.9 of asset retirement obligations. As specific payment dates for these items are unknown, the related balances have not been reflected in the Payments Due by Period section of the table above.       As of December 31, 2012, the amount of unrecognizedtax benefits was $19.7. As specific payment dates cannot be reasonably estimated, the related balances have not been reflected under the Payments Due by Period section of the table above.   At December 31, 2012, we had net contractual commitments under currency forward contracts in U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts of $438.9, thatall settle in less than one year. (Refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, as well as Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).   We had $35.9 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees at December 31, 2012 that are issued on our behalf in the ordinarycourse of business to support certain of our performance obligations and commitments. The instruments are typically renewed on an annual basis.   We do not have any unconsolidated limited purpose entities or any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities.      -32-        Item 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    The following discussionprovides forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates. Actual results could differ materially from those projectedin this forward-looking analysis. Currencies are in millions.    Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in thevalue of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings.    In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to various market risks, including fluctuations in currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates. To manage the exposure related to these risks, wemay engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with our established policies. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Moreover, we enter into financial instrument transactions with either majorfinancial institutions or highly-rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties, thereby limiting exposure to credit-related and performance-related risks.   Currency Risk : We periodically enter into currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated incurrencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity. At December 31, 2012, the principal transactions hedged involved accounts receivable and accounts payable. When hedging currency exposures, our practice is to hedge suchexposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure, and therefore, the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value, cash flows or futureearnings of the hedged item or transaction.        At December 31, 2012,the currency and net notional amounts of forward contracts outstanding translated into U.S. dollar equivalent amounts were as follows:                                                         December 31, 2012     Buy      Sell     U.S. Dollar        Euro        Canadian Dollar        Australian Dollar        Thai Baht        Chilean Peso        Mexican Peso        Malaysian Ringgit        Colombian Peso        Pound Sterling        Norwegian Krone        U.S. Dollar        0.0         $  73.3         $  66.9            0.0         $  8.7         $  20.2         $  17.3         $  3.0         $  1.0         $  0.1            0.0         Euro        0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0         $  1.6         Pound Sterling        0.0         $  152.9            0.0         $  46.6         $  15.5            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0         Chinese Yuan     $  20.3            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0         Brazilian Real     $  3.5            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0         Japanese Yen     $  0.3         $  7.7            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            0.0            The net favorable fair value of currency contracts,based on exchange rates at December 31, 2012, was $1.7. Assuming that year-end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical 10%, thefair value of all outstanding contracts at year-end would decrease by approximately $42.2. However, since these contracts hedge specific transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying valueof the transaction being hedged.    Interest Rate Risk : At December 31, 2012, our outstanding borrowings consisted of $3.0 ofshort-term variable rate borrowings, $62.0 of long-term floating rate debt, and $641.5 of long-term fixed rate debt. Our total long-term debt had a carrying value of $703.5, a face value of $705.1, and a fair value of $787.9. The fair value is basedon a discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates the contractual terms of the notes and observable market-based inputs that include time value, interest rate curves, and credit spreads.    Assuming other factors are held constant, a hypothetical increase/decrease of 1% in the weighted-average prevailing interest rate on our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2012,interest expense would increase/decrease by approximately $0.1 for the next fiscal year and the fair value of the fixed rate long-term debt would decrease/increase by approximately $18.0.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates andassumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and changes in theestimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition.       -33-        Share-Based Compensation    U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires recognition of compensation cost in an amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments. Compensation cost for performancestock is recorded based on the market value on the original date of grant (which is the fair value). Compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in cash (cash-settled SARS) is recognized based on the fair value of the awardat the end of each period through the date of settlement. Compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in shares (stock-settled SARS) and stock options is recognized over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value onthe date of the grant.    GAAP also requires that we estimate a forfeiture rate for all share-based awards. We monitor share option exercise andemployee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates within the valuation model. The estimated fair values are based on assumptions, including estimated lives of the instruments, historical and implied volatility, dividend yield on our commonstock, and risk-free interest rates. We also consider the probability that the options and stock-settled SARS will be exercised prior to the end of their contractual lives and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder. Theseassumptions are based on reasonable facts but are subject to change based on a variety of external factors. Changes in assumptions from period to period may materially affect the amount of share-based compensation cost we recognize in income.   Environmental and Other Contingent Liabilities    Accruals for environmental remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation and other contingent liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has beenincurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are recorded at managements best estimate of the ultimate expected liabilities, without any discount to reflect the time value of money. These accruals are reviewedperiodically and adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes available.    The amount accrued for environmental remediationreflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature and cost of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the numberand financial viability of other potentially responsible parties.    Included in other contingent liabilities are workers compensation,product liability and toxic tort claims. The amount accrued for other contingent liabilities reflects our assumptions about the incidence, severity, indemnity costs and dismissal rates for existing and future claims.   Our asbestos related contingent liabilities and related insurance receivables are based on a study which is prepared every three years by a third party.During the third quarter of 2012, we completed an actuarial study of our asbestos related contingent liabilities and related insurance receivables, which updated our last study prepared in the third quarter of 2009. The study is based on, amongother things, the incidence and nature of historical claims data through June 30, 2012, the incidence of malignancy claims, the severity of indemnity payments for malignancy and non-malignancy claims, dismissal rates by claim type, estimatedfuture claim frequency, settlement values and reserves, and expected average insurance recovery rates by claim type.    As a result of thefindings, we recorded a decrease of $2.1 to our self-insured and insured contingent liabilities for indemnity costs for pending and anticipated probable future claims and recorded a decrease of $1.0 related to receivables for probable insurancerecoveries for these pending and future claims. The reserve decrease is attributable to significantly lower projected claim filings offset by more severe malignancy rates and settlement value projections. The decrease in the receivable is a resultof the lower gross liability and a shift in the types of future claims expected. Overall, we expect to recover approximately 48% of our future indemnity costs. We have completed Coverage-In-Place-Agreements with most of our larger insurancecarriers.    Although these estimates and assumptions are based on reasonable facts, they are subject to change based on the actual outcome and avariety of external factors. A sustained 1% change in the annual number of future asbestos claims filed against us will increase or decrease the liability and related receivable by $0.4 and $0.2, respectively. A sustained 1% change in the averagevalue of asbestos claims paid will increase or decrease the liability and related receivable by $0.4 and $0.2, respectively.    Accruals forenvironmental remediation and other contingent liabilities can change substantially if our assumptions are not realized or due to actions by governmental agencies or private parties. We cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of lossin excess of the recorded amounts. Moreover, environmental and other contingent liabilities are paid over an extended period, and the timing of such payments cannot be predicted with any certainty. Accruals for environmental and other      -34-        contingent liabilities are recorded as other noncurrent liabilities with any amounts expected to be paid out in the next twelve months classified as accrued expenses.   Probable insurance recoveries for past and probable future indemnity costs are recorded at managements best estimate of the ultimate expectedreceipts without discounting to reflect the time value of money and are recorded as other assets. A number of factors impact the estimates of insurance reimbursements. These factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies, themethod in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies, how legal and defense costs will be covered by the insurance policies, the interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and theirinterrelationships, and historical recovery rates over the past ten years.    Defense and processing costs are expensed as incurred. Insurancerecoveries for defense and processing costs are recognized when the recovery is probable and related costs are incurred and are recorded as other assets.    Retirement Plans    We sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefitplans. The postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements. Our most significant pension plans are in the U.S., and constituted over 84% of our consolidated pension assetsand 85% of projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2012. The calculation of our pension expense and pension liability associated with our defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in theseassumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions. We believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, andhealthcare cost trend rates. Our U.S. salaried pension plan was frozen on December 31, 2007.    At the end of each year, we determine thediscount rate to be used for pension liabilities. In estimating this rate, we look at the yields on high quality, long-term corporate bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. Future expected actuariallydetermined cash flows of our major U.S. plans are matched against a yield curve encompassing such bonds to arrive at a single discount rate by plan. We discounted our U.S. future pension and postretirement medical liabilities using a rate of 3.9%and 3.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2012. The discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities has a significant effect on expense. A 1% increase to the discount rate for our U.S. pension plans would decrease our 2013 expectedannual expense by $7.9 and decrease our liability by $102.7. A 1% decrease to the discount rate for our U.S. pension plans would increase our 2013 expected annual expense by $9.0 and increase our liability by $126.6. A 1% increase to the discountrate for our U.S. postretirement medical plan would decrease our 2013 expected annual expense by $0.7 and decrease our liability by $16.4. A 1% decrease to the discount rate for our U.S. postretirement medical plan would increase our 2013 expectedannual expense by $0.8 and increase our liability by $19.3.    In order to reduce the volatility of our pension plan assets relative to pensionliabilities, we have gradually implemented a liability-driven investment (LDI) strategy for our U.S., U.K. and Canadian defined benefit pension plans. As part of the strategy, we have transitioned some of our equity allocation tolonger-term fixed income assets with an emphasis on high quality corporate bonds. As the funded status of the plans improves, we expect to further decrease equity investments and increase fixed income investments. As a result of thesechanges, the expected rates of return have been adjusted downward, as appropriate, to reflect the new allocations. The expected rate of return on our U.S. plan assets, which was 6.75% for 2012, reflects the long-term average rate of return expectedon funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability. We establish the expected rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to us at thattime, including the historical returns of major asset classes, the expected investment mix of the plans assets, and estimates of future long-term investment returns. A 1% change to the expected rate of return on plan assets of our U.S. pensionplans would increase or decrease our 2013 expected pension expense by $7.0; the 2013 expected postretirement medical expense would increase or decrease by $0.3. The U.S. pension plans investment mix at December 31, 2012 approximated 24%equities and 76% fixed income securities. Any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss. The unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss is amortized into pension expense inaccordance with GAAP.    The assumed rate of future increases in the per capita cost of healthcare benefits (healthcare cost trend rate) is 7.5%in 2012, decreasing to ultimate trend of 5.0% in 2016. The healthcare cost trend       -35-        rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and related expense. A 1% decrease to the assumed healthcare cost trendrate for our postretirement benefit plans would decrease our expense by $0.6 and decrease our postretirement benefit obligation by $12.1. A 1% increase to the assumed healthcare cost trend rate for our postretirement benefit plans would increase ourexpense by $0.6 and increase our postretirement benefit obligation by $13.4.    As a result of the use of our LDI strategy and the increase inthe funded levels of our pension plans, we are in the process of reviewing our pension and postretirement benefit accounting policies to determine if mark-to-market accounting would be a preferred method. Under mark-to-market accountingactuarial gains and losses would be recognized on the income statement in the year incurred rather than amortizing them over future periods. A mark-to-market adjustment would be made in the fourth quarter of each year reflecting that yearsactuarial gains or losses. These gains or losses result from changes in discount rates and other actuarial assumptions, actual returns on plan assets versus expectations, and other differences between actual experience and assumptions. Certaincomponents of expense would be charged at the business segment level, while others, including the annual mark-to-market adjustments, would be charged to Corporate and Unallocated.    We have engaged our actuaries to assist in this process. If we do decide that this change is appropriate, we would apply this change to our continuing pension and postretirement plans on aretrospective basis and restate prior periods accordingly. The impact of this change to our earnings in any period could be material. We expect to reach a decision by the end of the first quarter of 2013.   Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets    We have defined our segments as our reporting units. Our four business segments are Engineered Materials, Umeco, In Process Separation, and Additive Technologies. Engineered Materials and Umeco serveprincipally aerospace and industrial markets. In Process Separation and Additive Technologies serve large, global industrial markets. The segments above reflect how we run our Company, manage the assets, and view our customers.   We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis. Goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual tests if events occur orcircumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. For our 2012 goodwill impairment test, we applied the provision of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Intangibles  Goodwill   and Other , that allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (i.e.  greater than50% probability) that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of the facts and circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit isless than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. If we determined otherwise, we would be required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. For our qualitative assessment of the reporting unit, weconsidered all relevant facts and circumstances, including the excess fair value from the most recent fair value calculation; circumstances that could cause significant changes to the most recent carrying value calculation; the overall financialperformance of the reporting unit compared to previous projections; the estimated financial performance projected in the near and long term, such as EBITDA and cash flows; industry and market conditions, including overall market-multiple metrics,competitive environment and demand for our products; overall macroeconomic conditions including our ability to access capital; and changes in management, key personnel or strategy for the reporting unit. More weight was placed on events orcircumstances that most affect a reporting units fair value or carrying amount of its net assets. As a result of this qualitative assessment, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceededtheir carrying values, and performing the two-step impairment test was not required. These evaluations involve amounts that are based on managements best estimates and judgments. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actualresults may differ from these estimates. We are not aware of reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being estimated that would have a material impact on these assessments for impairment.   Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amountof an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets or asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by theasset or asset group. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be      -36-        charged to earnings. Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives.    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed    Long-lived assets,including those to be disposed, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured bya comparison of the carrying amount of the assets or asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized ismeasured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be charged to earnings. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell.   Depreciation    EffectiveJanuary 1, 2012, we changed our method of depreciation for the majority of our North American fixed assets from straight line composite depreciation to straight line by individual asset.    Historically, we had used the composite depreciation method for the Plants, Equipment and Facilities at the majority of our North American facilities. Under this method, all similar assets acrossthese locations were combined into common pools and depreciated under composite depreciation rates. Recent business divestitures and sales of assets had significantly reduced our composite asset base, and during 2011, we performed a fullphysical inventory of fixed assets at our composite locations. As part of this analysis, where appropriate, we made changes to certain asset records in our fixed assets system effective January 1, 2012 to segregate individual assets thathad been installed together and had previously been combined into one item. We also reviewed the estimated useful lives of our assets at this more specific level.    We believe that the straight line depreciation method for individual assets is preferable to the composite method because it is a more precise method of allocating historical cost and results in aconsistent depreciation policy for all of our locations.    As a result, the useful lives of our assets are now generally estimated to range from5 to 30 years for equipment and from 10 to 38 years for buildings. This change in the method of depreciation is considered a change in accounting estimate inseparable from a change in accounting principle, and resulted in changes to our depreciationexpense prospectively from the effective date.    Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to current operating expenses.Acquisitions, additions and betterments, either to provide necessary capacity, improve the efficiency of production units, modernize or replace older facilities or to install equipment for protection of the environment, are capitalized. Wecapitalize interest costs incurred during the period of construction of plants and equipment.    Income Taxes   Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future taxconsequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided whenit is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which thosetemporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.   We intend to primarily reinvest the unremitted earnings of those international subsidiaries that are independent of the Coating Resinsdivestiture. Accounting rules require establishing a tax liability on the unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries if it is management`s intention to no longer permanently reinvest such earnings. As a result of the intended sale ofCoatings Resins, management`s intentions changed with regard to a portion of the unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. Therefore, included in income tax expense is $3.1 of tax expense incurred due to the repatriation of certainearnings during 2012 and an estimated $7.5 to be incurred on the future repatriation of other earnings, subsequent to the sale of Coating Resins. With the exception of the unremitted earnings of those international subsidiaries that are relatedto the Coating Resins divestiture, no provision has been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes with respect to these earnings. In the event of repatriation to the U.S., such earnings would be subject to U.S. income taxes in mostcases. Foreign tax credits would be available to substantially reduce the amount of U.S. tax otherwise payable in future years.    Ourannual effective tax rate is based on expected income, statutory tax rates and tax planning       -37-        opportunities available in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions.   We establish accruals for tax contingencies when, notwithstanding the reasonable belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, webelieve that certain filing positions are likely to be challenged and moreover, that such filing positions may not be fully sustained. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax positionwill be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We continually evaluate our uncertain tax positions and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances including but notlimited to emerging case law, tax legislation, rulings by relevant tax authorities, and the progress of ongoing tax audits. Settlement of a given tax contingency could impact the income tax provision in the period of resolution. Ouraccruals for gross uncertain tax positions are presented in the balance sheet within income taxes payable and other noncurrent liabilities.   Derivative Financial Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities    We use derivative instruments in accordance with our established policies to manage exposure to fluctuations in currency rates, interest rates and, when appropriate, natural gas prices in North America.We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly-rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts todiversify transactions among counterparties, thereby limiting exposure to credit-related and performance-related risks.    Foreign CurrencyRisk:  We use currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps to manage our exposure to fluctuations in currency rates on third party and intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legalentity. We hedge such exposures with currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps denominated in the same currency and with similar terms as the underlying exposure, and therefore, the instruments are effective at generating offsettingchanges in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item or transaction. All derivative contracts used to manage foreign currency risk are measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. Changes in fair value arereported in earnings or deferred, depending on the nature and effectiveness of the hedging relationship. Ineffectiveness, if any, in a hedging relationship is recognized immediately into earnings. If the hedging relationship is not highly effectivein generating offsetting cash flows or changes in fair value, we would recognize the change in the fair value of the currency forward contract in other income (expense), net. There was no ineffectiveness in 2012, 2011, or 2010.   Fair Value Measurements    We have certainassets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements, for which we determine the appropriate level in the fair value input hierarchy for each fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchyprioritizes the inputs, which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, into three levels. It gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets orliabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair valuemeasurement in its entirety. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted priceswithin Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, interest rates, exchange rates, and yield curves observable at commonly quotedintervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.    Derivatives   All of our derivatives are valued based on Level 2 inputs. Our currency forwards are valued based on readily available published indices for currencyexchange rates.    Pension     Thefair values of our Level 1 pension assets are determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets. The fair values of our Level 2 pension assets are based on the net asset values of the funds, which are based on quotedmarket prices of the underlying investments. Our Level 3 assets include an insurance contract and a real estate fund. The fair value of the insurance contract held by one of our non-U.S. plans is based on the contractual terms of the arrangementwith the insurance company. The fair value of the real estate fund is based on the net asset value of shares held at year end.       -38-        ITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA    CYTEC INDUSTRIES
