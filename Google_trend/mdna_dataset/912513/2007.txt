Item 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the description of our business and risk factors contained in Part I of this report. Currency amounts are in millions, except per share amounts. Percentages are approximate.  GENERAL  We are a global specialty chemicals and materials company and sell our products to diverse major markets for aerospace, adhesives, automotive and industrial coatings, chemical intermediates, inks, mining and plastics. Sales price and volume by region and the impact of exchange rates on our reporting segments are important measures that are analyzed by management and are provided in our segment analysis.  In the course of our ongoing operations, a number of strategic product line acquisitions and dispositions have been made. The results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included in our consolidated results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. On February 28, 2005, we acquired the Surface Specialties business of UCB in a transaction valued at $1,789.6. In addition, on October 2, 2006, we completed the initial closing on the sale of our water treatment chemicals and acrylamide product lines for $208.0. A further discussion of acquisitions and dispositions can be found in Notes 2 and 3 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein.  We also report net sales in four geographic regions: North America, Latin America, Asia/Pacific and Europe/Middle East/Africa. The destination of the sale determines the region under which it is reported consistent with management's view of the business. North America consists of the United States and Canada. Latin America includes Mexico, Central America, South America and the Caribbean Islands. Asia/Pacific is comprised of Asia, Australia and the islands of the South Pacific Rim.  Raw material cost changes year on year are an important factor in profitability especially in years of high volatility. Global oil and natural gas costs in certain countries are highly volatile and many of our raw materials are derived from these two commodities. Discussion of the year to year impact of raw materials and energy is provided in our segment discussion. In addition, higher global demand levels and, occasionally, operating difficulties at suppliers, have limited the availability of certain of our raw materials.  On January 1, 2006 we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"). For further details see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table sets forth the percentage relationship that certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income bear to net sales:  Years Ended December 31,                         2006       2005        2004 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Net sales                                       100.0%      100.0%      100.0% Manufacturing cost of sales                      80.2        79.1        75.7 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gross profit                                     19.8        20.9        24.3 Selling and technical services                    6.5         7.3         8.1 Research and process development                  2.2         3.6         2.3 Administrative and general                        3.1         3.5         3.8 Amortization of acquisition intangibles           1.1         1.0         0.3 Gain on sale of assets                            2.3          -           - - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Earnings from operations                          9.2         5.5         9.8 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net earnings available to common stockholders     5.9         2.0         7.0 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                         20    NET SALES BY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA                                                                                              Europe/                                       North          Latin         Asia/      Middle East/ Net Sales                            America        America       Pacific        Africa         Total - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2006   Cytec Performance Chemicals            $324.1         $128.8       $127.9          $284.3       $865.1   Cytec Surface Specialties               366.7           60.3        260.6           835.8      1,523.4   Cytec Engineered Materials              378.2            1.2         44.7           177.7        601.8   Building Block Chemicals                177.6            4.7         26.9           130.0        339.2                                    ----------------------------------------------------------------------     Total                              $1,246.6         $195.0       $460.1        $1,427.8     $3,329.5                                    ----------------------------------------------------------------------  2005   Cytec Performance Chemicals            $340.8         $126.8       $118.5          $269.7       $855.8   Cytec Surface Specialties               329.6           50.7        202.9           660.9      1,244.1   Cytec Engineered Materials              349.2            1.5         30.0           160.9        541.6   Building Block Chemicals                149.2            4.9         50.3            79.8        284.2                                    ----------------------------------------------------------------------     Total                              $1,168.8         $183.9       $401.7        $1,171.3     $2,925.7                                    ----------------------------------------------------------------------  2004   Cytec Performance Chemicals            $293.8         $104.0       $106.7          $208.2       $712.7   Cytec Surface Specialties               122.4           16.2         56.7            65.7        261.0   Cytec Engineered Materials              322.4            1.7         21.5           141.4        487.0   Building Block Chemicals                126.6            3.3         77.0            53.7        260.6                                    ----------------------------------------------------------------------     Total                                $865.2         $125.2       $261.9          $469.0     $1,721.3                                    ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Net sales in the United States were $1,162.3, $1,095.3, and $802.4 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. International net sales were $2,167.2, $1,830.4, and $918.9, or 65%, 63% and 53% of total net sales, for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  For more information on our segments, refer to Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and further discussions in "Segment Results" below.  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005  Consolidated Results  Net sales for 2006 were $3,329.5 compared with $2,925.7 for 2005, up 14%, of which 7% was due to the inclusion of sales from Surface Specialties for a full year (acquired on February 28, 2005). The divestiture of the water treatment and acrylamide product lines on October 1, 2006 decreased sales 2%. Excluding these two factors, selling volumes were up 6%, selling prices increased 2% and changes in exchange rates increased sales 1%. Cytec Performance Chemicals experienced a net increase in sales which resulted primarily from higher selling volumes, the addition of sales of the acquired pressure sensitive adhesives and polyurethanes product lines of Surface Specialties as well as from selling price increases. This was partially offset by decreased sales due to the divestiture of the water treatment chemicals product line. Cytec Surface Specialties experienced a net increase in sales which resulted primarily from the addition of sales related to the acquired product lines of Surface Specialties for a full year and higher selling volumes. The Cytec Engineered Materials sales increase was principally volume related, primarily from increased sales to the large commercial transport and commercial rotorcraft sectors. Building Block Chemicals sales increased from higher selling volumes and selling prices, partially offset by decreased sales due to the divestiture of the acrylamide product line. Net sales and operating results for the Building Blocks segment in 2005 were significantly impacted by the effects of hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the U.S. gulf coast.  For a detailed discussion on revenues refer to the Segment Results section below.  Manufacturing cost of sales was $2,670.1 compared with $2,313.7 for 2005. Most of the increase is associated with higher selling volumes, the inclusion of expenses for a full year relating to Surface Specialties, higher raw material costs of $60.3, unfavorable currency exchange on raw materials and energy of $12.5, partially offset by reduction in manufacturing cost of sales due to the October 1, 2006 divestiture of the water treatment chemicals and acrylamide product lines. The results for 2006 also include an impairment and restructuring charge of $22.1 related to the Polymer Additives product line, an impairment and restructuring charge of $20.9 for an unprofitable manufacturing facility in France, a charge of $1.0 for restructuring of a manufacturing site in the U.S.,                                         21   a $2.2 net increase in asbestos related contingent liabilities, a $2.6 charge related to a change in employee benefit plans in the U.K., and a charge of $2.0 related to stock options and stock-settled SARS due to the application of SFAS 123R. These were partially offset by a net restructuring charge reversal of $0.7. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail of the net restructuring and impairment charges. The 2005 results include $20.8 of amortization of the excess of the fair value of the finished goods inventory for the acquired Surface Specialties business over normal manufacturing cost.  Pension expense increased $20.8 principally as a result of a full year of expense for the additional plans and employees acquired upon the Surface Specialties acquisition in 2005, curtailments and settlements, and to a lesser extent, the lowering of the discount rate at the beginning of 2006 in the U.S. by 0.15% to reflect current market rates on fixed income securities. Pension expense is primarily reported in manufacturing cost of sales.  Selling and technical services was $215.4 in 2006 versus $213.6 in the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of expenses for a full year relating to Surface Specialties and charges related to stock options and stock-settled SARS due to the application of SFAS 123R of $3.2. Partially offsetting this was a reduction in costs due to the divestiture of the water treatment chemicals and acrylamide product lines. Also included in 2006 are net restructuring charges of $1.1 and a benefit plan curtailment charge as described above of $0.4. Included in amounts for 2005 was $3.5 for employee severance costs.  Research and process development was $73.9 in 2006 versus $68.5 in the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of expenses for a full year relating to Surface Specialties and charges related to stock options and stock-settled SARS due to the application of SFAS 123R of $0.6. Partially offsetting this was a reduction in costs due to divestiture of the water treatment chemicals and acrylamide product lines. Also included in 2006 are restructuring charges of $1.0. Included in amounts for 2005 are restructuring charges of $0.8.  Administrative and general expenses were $102.9 in 2006 versus $102.1 in the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of expenses for a full year relating to Surface Specialties and charges related to stock options and stock-settled SARS due to the application of SFAS 123R of $4.6. Also included in 2006 are integration expenses of $1.4 associated with transitioning away from UCB's information technology system infrastructure, a benefit plan curtailment charge of $0.2 as described above and restructuring charges of $1.8. Included in amounts for 2005 are employee severance costs of $7.3 and a charge of $2.4 related to the settlement of a litigation matter.  Amortization of acquisition intangibles was $37.8 in 2006 versus $30.3 in the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of amortization expense for a full year relating to Surface Specialties, the write-off of $1.4 related to impaired intangibles related to an unprofitable product line manufactured in Europe and $0.6 of higher amortization of certain Radcure trademarks due to a change in their estimated useful lives.  The write-off of acquired in-process research and development of $37.0 in the prior year was related to the Surface Specialties acquisition.  The divestiture gain of $75.5 is attributable to the phase one closing of the water treatment and acrylamide product lines. See Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  Other income (expense), net was income of $12.7 in 2006 compared with expense of $44.9 in the prior year. Included in 2006 is a gain of $15.7 in connection with proceeds collected in an arbitration award in settlement of the commercial dispute as discussed in Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. Included in 2005 is a loss of $44.2 related to derivative contracts entered to hedge currency and interest rate exposure associated with the acquisition of Surface Specialties and a charge of $4.4 for a settlement to resolve a dispute over an environmental matter.  Equity in earnings of associated companies was $3.2 versus $7.9 in the prior year. On June 1, 2005, we sold our 50% ownership stake in CYRO Industries ("CYRO") to our joint venture partner Degussa Specialty Polymers, a company of Degussa AG, which subsequently reduced our equity earnings.  Interest expense, net was $55.5 in 2006 compared with $80.0 in the prior year. The amount for 2005 includes $21.0 of interest charges and $1.0 of unamortized put premiums and rate lock agreements related to the optional redemption of the Mandatory Par Put Remarketed Securities (MOPPRS) in May 2005. Excluding these 2005 charges, interest expense is down due to the reduction in the outstanding weighted-average debt balance during 2006 as we used our free cash flow and proceeds from the divestiture to pay down debt.  The effective income tax rate for 2006 was a tax provision of 26.1% ($69.2) compared to a tax benefit of 33% ($14.4) for 2005. The 2006 effective rate was positively impacted by an arbitration award in settlement of a commercial dispute, a portion of which was recorded in a lower tax entity resulting in an effective rate of 20%. Also favorably impacting the rate was a 21% tax rate                                         22   associated with the gain on the divestiture of the water treatment and acrylamide product lines and a $3.5 reduction of tax expense as a result of the completion of prior years U.S. tax audits. The rate was also favorably impacted by the change in statutory tax rates with respect to deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded in certain countries. These results were partially offset by a reduction of earnings of divested product lines in lower tax jurisdictions, the zero tax benefit on a French restructuring charge due to insufficient earnings to realize its net deferred tax asset, a tax benefit from a restructuring charge recorded at 29.6% and a $1.7 tax charge associated with a capital reduction with respect to a foreign subsidiary. Excluding these items, the underlying annual effective tax rate for 2006 was 26.8%.  The 2005 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by hedging losses incurred in the U.S. in connection with the Surface Specialties acquisition, the MOPPRS redemption, and reduction in tax expense of $12.2 due to partial resolution of a tax audit in Norway and a reduction in income tax expense of $16.2 related to final approval of the Internal Revenue Service's examination of our tax returns for the years 1999 through 2001. The rate was unfavorably impacted by the write-off of acquired in-process research and development expenses related to the Surface Specialties acquisition, for which there is no tax benefit. Excluding these items, the underlying annual effective tax rate for 2005 would have been 26%.  Earnings from discontinued operations were $1.2 in 2005 and reflect the results of Surface Specialties amino resins ("SSAR") product line. SSAR was divested on August 31, 2005.  The adoption of SFAS 123R was recorded as of January 1, 2006 and resulted in a non-cash charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $1.2, net of tax benefit of $0.7.  Net earnings for 2006 were $194.9 ($4.01 per diluted share) compared with net earnings for 2005 of $59.1 ($1.27 per diluted share). Included in the 2006 results are an after-tax gain of $59.6 ($1.23 per diluted share) related to the first phase of the sale of the Water Treatment and acrylamide product lines, after-tax net restructuring and impairment charges of $40.6 ($0.84 per diluted share), an after-tax charge of $1.6 ($0.03 per diluted share) related to completion of a detailed update of our asbestos contingent liability, net of insurance recoveries, after-tax costs of $1.3 ($0.03 per diluted share) related to Surface Specialties integration, an after-tax gain of $12.4 ($0.26 per diluted share) related to a favorable resolution of a legal dispute, an after-tax charge of $1.9 ($0.04 per diluted share) related to a change in employee benefit plans in the U.K. and the cumulative effect of an accounting change after-tax charge of $1.2 ($0.02 per diluted share) related to the adoption of SFAS 123R. The improvement in net earnings is primarily related to the net effect of the aforementioned special items, higher selling volumes, increased selling prices, inclusion of a full year of earnings from Surface Specialties, increased production levels and the benefits of the our recent restructuring initiatives partially offset by higher raw material costs.  Net earnings for 2005 included the write-off of $37.0 ($0.80 per diluted share) of in-process research and development costs; a $15.2 ($0.33 per diluted share) after-tax amortization charge from the write-up to fair value of the acquired inventory that was subsequently sold; $0.1 after-tax integration costs related to the acquired business; a charge of $1.8 ($0.04 per diluted share) after-tax for settlement of a certain litigation matter; $12.4 ($0.27 per diluted share) after-tax employee restructuring costs; a $3.2 ($0.07 per diluted share) settlement to resolve a dispute over an environmental matter; $14.0 ($0.30 per diluted share) after-tax interest charges and unamortized put premiums related to the redemption of the MOPPRS prior to their final maturity; a $28.1 ($0.61 per diluted share) after-tax charge related to currency and interest rate derivative transactions associated with the Surface Specialties acquisition, all of which were partially offset by the higher overall sales attributable to the acquisition; and an income tax benefit of $28.4 ($0.61 per diluted share) reflecting favorable resolution of tax audits with respect to prior year tax returns.  Segment Results (Sales to external customers)  Year-to-year comparisons and analyses of changes in net sales by segment and region are set forth below.

This was partially offset by decreased selling volumes primarily in the specialty urethanes product line due to competitive price pressure. The inclusion of full year sales attributable to pressure sensitive adhesives and polyurethane product lines of Surface Specialties added 2% to sales and the divestiture of the water treatment chemicals product line decreased sales 5%. On a regional basis, North America sales volumes declined primarily in water treatment chemicals due to low demand from the paper sector and our decision to reduce sales on low profit accounts and in urethane specialties due to a technology shift in the market that affected our customer. The sales volume increase in Asia/Pacific is primarily in mining chemicals and phosphines mostly due to higher demand levels. Sales volume in Europe/Middle East/Africa increased 11% as a result of overall improved demand.  Earnings from operations were $68.4, or 8% of sales, compared with $56.6 or 7% of sales in 2005. The increase in earnings is primarily attributable to increased selling volumes, slightly higher selling prices, benefits of restructuring initiatives and the inclusion of the full year Surface Specialties product lines. Partially offsetting these were higher raw material costs of $28.1, the divestiture of the water treatment chemicals product line and expense of $3.6 for stock options and stock-settled SARS related to SFAS 123R. 2005 results also included $2.6 for the excess of the fair value of the finished goods inventory over normal manufacturing cost related to the Surface Specialties acquisition and $7.0 of in-process research and development cost write-offs related to the Surface Specialties acquisition.

The inclusion of full year sales attributable to Surface Specialties added $192.0 to sales. In North America volumes declined due to reduced demand levels from the automotive and architectural sectors in the liquid coating resins product line. In Asia/Pacific and Europe/Middle East/Africa volumes increased 19% and 7%, respectively, due to improved demand and new business. Selling prices declined in Asia primarily due to price competition in lower technology products.  Earnings from operations were $95.5, or 6% of sales, compared with earnings from operations of $22.0, or 2% of sales in 2005. The increase in earnings is primarily attributable to the increased selling volumes, the benefits of restructuring initiatives and the inclusion of a full year results from Surface Specialties. Partially offsetting these are higher raw material costs of $7.8 which were not offset by selling price increases and expense of $3.2 for stock options and stock-settled SARS related to SFAS 123R. 2005 results include the write-off of in-process research and development costs of $30.1 and a charge of $18.2 for the excess of the fair value of the finished goods inventory over normal manufacturing cost related to the Surface Specialties acquisition.

Overall selling volumes increased 9% primarily from higher sales to the large commercial aircraft, rotorcraft and business jet sector partially offset by lower sales in the high performance auto sector due to the completion of a program in early 2006 and lower sales to the launch vehicle sector. Net selling prices increased 2% due to price increases in all regions and across a number of markets. North America, Europe, and Asia/Pacific sales volumes increased 6%, 8%, and 45%, respectively, with the increases coming primarily from the large commercial aircraft and military sectors due to increased aircraft build rates.  Earnings from operations were $106.0, or 18% of sales, compared with $103.0, or 19% of sales, in 2005. The impact of the increased sales volume and prices on operating earnings was partially offset by increased raw material costs of $9.7, increased costs in manufacturing to support the higher production volumes, some plant inefficiencies, planned higher technical service and research expenses, lower production rates in one of our carbon fiber plants due to trial runs of new product and costs to startup a carbon fiber manufacturing line that was                                         24  previously idled. Also included is expense of $2.4 for stock options and stock-settled SARS related to SFAS 123R and a $2.4 pension curtailment charge due to a change from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution pension plan in the U.K.   Building Block Chemicals                                                                                                     % Change Due to                                                                     ---------------------------------------------------                                                             Total                                     2006         2005     % Change     Price    Volume/Mix   Divestiture   Currency - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- North America                    $  177.6     $  149.2         19%      7%         14%           -2%          - Latin America(1)                      4.7          4.9          -       -           -             -           - Asia/Pacific                         26.9         50.3        -46%      3%        -49%            -           - Europe/Middle East/Africa           130.0         79.8         63%     17%         58%          -13%          1%                                 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                            $  339.2     $  284.2         19%      9%         15%           -5%          - - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1)  Due to the level of sales in this geographic region, percentage comparisons are not meaningful.   Overall sales volumes are 10% higher and selling prices are 9% higher, both primarily related to acrylonitrile. The divestiture of the acrylamide product line on October 1, 2006 reduced sales 5% but was more than fully offset by increased sales of acrylonitrile to the purchaser of the acrylamide product line. Acrylonitrile is the key raw material to make acrylamide and prior to the divestiture our internal uses of acrylonitrile to make acrylamide were treated as internal transfers, and our internal uses of acrylamide to make certain of our divested water treating chemicals were treated as intersegment sales. After the divestiture, acrylonitrile used to make acrylamide is now a third party sale and for the year this added 7% to sales. After excluding the above, selling volumes increased 8% from the prior year when volumes were adversely impacted due to plant shutdowns as a result of the hurricanes in the US gulf coast in the third quarter of 2005. On a regional basis selling volumes in Asia/Pacific were down due to sluggish demand for acrylonitrile for use in upgrading to acrylic fiber. Selling volumes in Europe/Middle East/Africa improved due to increased demand for imported acrylonitrile as a result of reduced regional supply. Selling prices were up overall due to acrylonitrile and acrylamide as they trended with increases in raw material costs.  Earnings from operations were $19.3, or 5% of sales, compared with $5.7, or 2% of sales, in 2005. The increase in earnings reflects the higher selling volumes (some due to the impact of the aforementioned hurricanes in 2005) and higher selling prices. This was partially offset by higher raw material costs of $14.7 million, inefficiencies on lower melamine production, difficulties in our sulfuric acid plant operations and higher costs due to a two week scheduled acrylonitrile plant outage in the first quarter of 2006. Also included is expense of $1.2 for stock options and stock-settled SARS related to SFAS 123R.  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004  Consolidated Results  Net sales for 2005 were $2,925.7 compared with $1,721.3 for 2004, up 70% of which 62% was due to the inclusion of sales from Surface Specialties which was acquired on February 28, 2005, selling prices increased 6%, exchange rates increased sales 1% and selling volumes were up 1%. Cytec Performance Chemicals experienced a net increase in sales which resulted primarily from the addition of sales of the acquired pressure sensitive adhesives and polyurethanes product lines of Surface Specialties as well as from selling price increases. Cytec Surface Specialties experienced a net increase in sales which resulted primarily from the addition of sales related to the remainder of the acquired product lines of Surface Specialties. Cytec Engineered Materials sales increase was primarily volume related, primarily from increased sales to the large commercial transport and commercial rotorcraft sectors. Building Block Chemicals sales increased from higher selling prices, while volumes decreased. Net sales and operating results for the Building Blocks segment were significantly impacted by the effects of hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the U.S. gulf coast.  For a detailed discussion on revenues refer to the Segment Results section below.  Manufacturing cost of sales was $2,313.7 compared with $1,303.1 during 2004. This increase was primarily attributable to the following items: the inclusion of the acquired Surface Specialties business; higher raw material and energy costs of $98.4; a charge of $20.8 representing the excess of the fair value of the finished goods inventory of the acquired business over normal manufacturing cost and the direct impact from the hurricanes of $6.3 for maintenance and repair costs, extra labor and related expenses, energy and start up costs. Also included was approximately $5.0 of employee severance costs related to a restructuring that occurred during the second half of 2005.  Pension expense increased $15.7 principally as a result of additional plans acquired upon acquisition and to a lesser extent, the lowering of the discount                                         25   rate in the U.S. by 0.50% to reflect current market rates on fixed income securities. Pension expense is primarily reported in manufacturing cost of sales.  Selling and technical services was $213.6 versus $139.8 in the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to the following items: the inclusion of the acquired Surface Specialties business; $3.5 of employee severance costs; $1.2 of unfavorable exchange rate changes; and $4.4 from increased investments in people and qualification work on a number of new aircraft platforms for our customers in the Cytec Engineered Materials segment.  Research and process development was $68.5 versus $40.0 in the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the acquired Surface Specialties business and $0.8 related to restructuring charges.  The write-off of acquired in-process research and development of $37.0 was the result of the Surface Specialties acquisition.  Administrative and general expenses were $102.1 versus $65.1 in the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to the following items: the inclusion of the acquired Surface Specialties business; a charge of $2.4 related to the settlement of a litigation matter and employee severance costs of $7.3. Included in administrative expenses for the prior year period is a charge of $8.0 related to the settlement of a federal carbon fiber class action lawsuit and several other minor litigation matters.  Amortization of acquisition intangibles was $30.3 versus $5.6 in the prior year due to the amortization of intangibles related to the acquired Surface Specialties business.  Other income (expense), net was expense of $44.9 compared with income of $16.9 in the prior year. We entered into derivative contracts to economically hedge currency and interest rate exposures associated with the Surface Specialties acquisition. These contracts were settled following completion of the acquisition and resulted in a loss of $19.2 during 2005. The foreign currency contracts have matured. In anticipation of the long-term debt that was subsequently issued in October, 2005 to refinance debt, we also entered into interest rate derivatives which resulted in the recognition of a loss of $25.0 in 2005. Also included in 2005 was a charge of $4.4 for a settlement to resolve a dispute over an environmental matter. Included in 2004 results was a net gain of $26.8 related to derivative contracts entered into during the fourth quarter to economically hedge currency and interest rate exposure associated with the pending acquisition of Surface Specialties. Also included in 2004 results were charges of $6.1 for settlement of several environmental remediation and toxic tort lawsuits and a charge of $2.0 related to the settlement of a series of disputed matters with the holder of our Series C Preferred Stock ("Series C Stock").  Equity in earnings of associated companies was $7.9 versus $5.2 in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in earnings by CYRO even though the 2005 results include only the five months of results. We sold our 50% ownership stake in CYRO on June 1, 2005.  Interest expense, net was $80.0 compared with $17.4 in the prior year. The increase resulted from higher outstanding debt balances incurred in conjunction with our acquisition of Surface Specialties and $22.0 of interest charges and unamortized put premiums and rate lock agreements related to the optional redemption of our Mandatory Par Put Remarketed Securities ("MOPPRS") in 2005.  Our 2005 effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was a tax benefit of 33%. Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was favorably impacted by a reduction in income tax expense of $12.2 related to a partial resolution of a tax audit in Norway with respect to prior year tax returns and a reduction in income tax expense of $16.2 recorded related to final approval of the Internal Revenue Service's examination of our tax returns for the years 1999 through 2001. Also favorably impacting the rate were the losses of $44.2 incurred in the U.S. on interest rate and currency derivatives entered into in connection with Surface Specialties acquisition and the $22.0 charge pertaining to the optional redemption of the MOPPRS. The tax benefit on these losses was recorded at 36.5%. Unfavorably impacting the 2005 tax rate was a charge of $37.0 for the write-off of in-process research and development expenses related to the Surface Specialties acquisition for which no tax benefit was recorded. Excluding these items, our underlying 2005 annual effective tax rate would have been 26%. The comparable effective tax rate in 2004 was 24%, which excludes acquisition related net currency and interest rate hedge gains. The increase in the underlying annual effective tax rate versus last year was primarily attributable to the addition of earnings from acquired Surface Specialties entities in countries with higher tax rates than in countries for heritage Cytec.  Earnings from discontinued operations were $1.2 in 2005, net of taxes of $0.8 and reflect the results of Surface Specialties amino resins ("SSAR") product line for the six months ended August 31, 2005, the date on which we divested SSAR.  During 2004, we redeemed our Series C Stock, which had a liquidation value of $0.1, for $10.0 in cash. The resulting charge to net earnings available to                                         26   common stockholders of $9.9 was recorded as a premium paid to redeem preferred stock during 2004.  Net earnings available to common stockholders for 2005 were $59.1 ($1.27 per diluted share) compared with $121.1 ($2.96 per diluted share). Included in the full year ended December 31, 2005 were purchase accounting related charges of $20.8 pre-tax (after-tax $15.2, or $0.33 per diluted share), related to acquired inventories from Surface Specialties being recorded at fair value which exceeded normal manufacturing cost, and $37.0 or $0.80 per diluted share related to the write-off of in-process research and development costs of Surface Specialties, a pre-tax charge of $44.2 million (after tax $28.1 or $0.61 per diluted share) related to currency and interest rate derivative transactions associated with the Surface Specialties acquisition, a pre-tax charge of $2.4 (after tax $1.8 or $0.04 per diluted share) related to an anticipated settlement of a certain litigation matter, a pre-tax charge of $22.0 (after-tax $14.0 or $0.30 per diluted share) related to the optional redemption of our MOPPRS prior to their maturity, an income tax benefit of $28.4, or $0.61 per diluted share, reflecting favorable resolution of tax audits with respect to prior year tax returns, employee restructuring costs of $16.8 (after tax net $12.4 or $0.27 per diluted share), integration costs related to the acquired business of pre-tax $0.2 (after tax $0.1) and a $4.4 settlement to resolve a dispute over an environmental matter (after tax $3.2 or $0.07 per diluted share).

On a regional basis, sales volume in North America increased 7% with acquisitions accounting for 11%. The decrease in base volumes is primarily attributable to the water treatment and polymer additive product lines which were impacted by decisions to give up low margin business and reduced demand. Sales volume in Europe/Middle East/Africa increased 23%, with acquisitions accounting for 24%, partly offset by a decrease in base selling volume of 1% principally in the polymer additives product line. Sales volumes in Asia were up 6% with the acquisition accounting for 12%. The decrease in base volumes was principally in the polymer additives product line due to decisions to give up low margin business. Sales volumes in Latin America increased 12% primarily due to improved demand for mining chemicals for copper mining applications. Selling prices increased as a result of implementation of price increase initiatives to cover significantly higher raw material and energy costs.  Earnings from operations were $56.6, or 7% of sales, compared with $57.5 or 8% of sales in 2004. Earnings declined slightly as price increases of $47.1 and the net favorable impact of exchange rate changes were offset by higher raw material and energy costs of $35.8, a write-off of acquired in-process research and development costs of $6.9, a charge of $2.5 for the excess of the fair value of the finished goods inventory of the acquired business over normal manufacturing cost and lower selling volumes compounded by reduced production levels at certain facilities in response to lower demand levels.                                         27    Cytec Surface Specialties                                                                                              % Change Due to                                                                     -------------------------------------                                                             Total               Acquisition/                                     2005         2004     % Change     Price      Volume      Currency - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- North America                    $  329.6       $122.4        169%      3%        166%            - Latin America                        50.7         16.2        213%     -1%        210%            4% Asia/Pacific                        202.9         56.7        258%      1%        256%            1% Europe/Middle East/Africa           660.9         65.7        906%      2%        903%            1%                                 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                            $1,244.1       $261.0        377%      2%        374%            1% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Selling volumes increased 374% as a result of the acquisition with base volumes decreasing slightly for heritage businesses. In North America base business declined 5% due to weak demand and Latin America, all of the volume increase is acquisition related. In Asia/Pacific, base business grew 8% while in Europe/Middle East/Africa, base volumes were down 2% due to weak demand.  Earnings from operations were $22.0, or 2% of sales, compared with earnings from operations of $28.7 or 11% of sales in 2004. The decrease in earnings is primarily attributable to the following factors: the write-off of acquired in-process research and development costs of $30.1; a charge of $18.3 for the excess of fair value of the finished goods inventory of the acquired business over normal manufacturing costs; a decline in base business selling volumes which decreased earnings by $6.5, and; higher raw material and energy costs of $12.5 which were only partially recovered by selling price increases of $4.8. Partially offsetting the above were the earnings of the acquired business of $57.8 (excluding the acquired research and development and inventory charges referred to above) and the net favorable impact of exchange rate changes.

Overall selling volumes increased 9%. Increased sales to the Europe/Middle East/Africa, North America and Asia/Pacific regions primarily related to increased volumes to the large commercial transport and commercial rotorcraft sectors primarily due to increased build rates and new business.  Earnings from operations were $103.0, or 19% of sales, compared with $83.4, or 17% of sales, in 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to increased earnings of $30.5 from higher selling volumes and price increases of $8.3 partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs of $5.6, manufacturing difficulties in Europe and increased in technical, commercial and research of $5.2 principally to support future growth initiatives.

Sales were higher overall due to higher selling prices, primarily for acrylonitrile, which were in line with the increase in raw material costs. Selling volumes decreased 7% overall. Selling volumes to the Asia/Pacific region decreased due to sluggish demand for acrylonitrile in light of higher selling prices but were partially offset by increased volumes to the Europe/Middle                                         28   East/Africa region where local production outages increased demand for imported acrylonitrile. Selling volumes in North America were impacted by reduced industrial demand and the hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf region.  Earnings from operations were $5.7, or 2% of sales, compared with $15.6, or 6% of sales, in 2004. The decrease in earnings reflects the impact from the hurricanes of about $6.3 related to maintenance and repair costs, extra labor and related expenses, energy and start up costs and the related lower production levels which reduced fixed cost absorption by approximately $3.9. Higher selling prices of $41.0 mostly offset increased raw material and energy costs of $44.6.  LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  At December 31, 2006, our cash balance was $23.6 compared with $68.6 at year end 2005.  Cash flows provided by operating activities were $201.0 compared with $227.5 for 2005. Trade accounts receivables increased $33.6 due to higher sales levels. Inventories increased $54.3 due to higher raw material costs than the year ago period, an increase to meet higher demand levels and a spike in Building Block Chemicals inventory due to weather related issues delaying shipments scheduled in December 2006 to January 2007. Accrued expenses increased $7.0 primarily due to a net increase in restructuring accruals of $4.4. Other liabilities decreased $52.8 principally due to contributions to our U.S. pension plans of $50.0.  Cash flows provided by investing activities were $104.1 for 2006 compared with cash flow used for investing activities of $1,384.6 for 2005. Capital spending for 2006 was $102.5, which compares to $105.3 in 2005. In 2006, we received $206.6, net of cash transaction costs, for the completion of the first of three phases of the sale of our water treatment chemicals and acrylamide product lines. In 2005, we used $1,459.1 of cash for the acquisition of Surface Specialties offset in part by $179.8 of proceeds from the sale of assets including SSAR and CYRO.  Net cash flows used in financing activities were $354.4 in 2006 compared with net cash flows provided by financing activities of $905.8 during 2005. The 2005 activity is primarily due to proceeds received for debt incurred related to the purchase of Surface Specialties partially offset by the redemption of the MOPPRS debt. During 2006, we had net debt repayments of $391.4, which were partially offset by proceeds received on the exercise of stock options of $45.0.  In connection with the acquisition of Surface Specialties, we suspended our stock buyback program in 2004 in order to maximize the funds available for debt service and other corporate purposes. With the divestiture of our water treatment and acrylamide business substantially completed and the net proceeds used to pay down additional debt, we announced in February 2007 the reinstatement of our stock buyback program. Approximately $69.0 remained authorized under the buyback program as of that date. We anticipate the repurchases will be made from time-to-time on the open market or in private transactions and will be utilized for share-based compensation plans and other corporate purposes.  As of December 31, 2006, our total debt of $943.6 is denominated approximately 51% in euros, 47% in dollars and the balance in various other currencies, after taking into account euro/US dollar cross currency swaps and designated forwards.  As of December 31, 2006, we may borrow up to an additional $308.0 under our $350.0 revolving credit facility (borrowing against this facility totaled $42.0 at December 31, 2006). Also at December 31, 2006, we had approximately $91.1 of other various credit facilities, with outstanding borrowings of $47.4.  During 2006, we paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per common share which aggregated $18.8. On February 9, 2007 the Board of Directors declared a $0.10 per common share cash dividend, payable on February 26, 2007 to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2007.  During the year, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was enacted in the U.S. The principal changes under this legislation relate to the way assets and liabilities are valued to determine required pension contributions. This legislation also impacts the timing and manner of required contributions to under-funded pension plans. These changes could increase the funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans. Accordingly, the amounts we might contribute to these benefit plans in the future are subject to uncertainty. We believe we have adequate liquidity to fund any increased funding requirements of our U.S. pension plans that may occur due to the Pension Protection Act.  We believe that we have the ability to fund our operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures and dividends as well as the ability to meet our debt service requirements for the foreseeable future from existing cash and from internal cash generation. However, from time to time, based on such factors as local tax regulations, prevailing interest rates and our plans for capital investment or other investments, it may make economic sense to utilize our existing credit lines in order to meet those cash requirements, which may include debt-service related disbursements.                                         29   We have not guaranteed any indebtedness of our unconsolidated associated company.  Excluding the impact of increasing raw materials costs, inflation is not considered significant since the rate of inflation has remained relatively low in recent years and investments in areas of the world where inflation poses a significant risk are limited. The impact of increasing raw material costs are discussed under "Customers and Suppliers" in "Business" in Item 1, herein.  Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  The following table sets forth our contractual obligations under long-term agreements as of December 31, 2006:                                                                          Payments Due by Period                                    -------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     Less Than                                     More than Contractual Obligations                  Total         1 Year      1-3 Years       3-5 Years        5 Years - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Long-term debt                         $ 901.8           $1.4         $102.8         $ 345.9        $ 451.7 Operating leases                          49.6           11.7           15.7             8.6           13.6 Purchase obligations                      39.1           17.7           10.2             6.4            4.8                                    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                                  $ 990.5          $30.8        $ 128.7         $ 360.9        $ 470.1 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   See Note 15 for additional information on our pension and postretirement plans obligations.  We had net contractual commitments under currency forward contracts in U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of $150.2, that all settle in less than one year. (Refer to Item 7A as well as Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein).  We had $75.1 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees at December 31, 2006 that are issued on our behalf in the ordinary course of business to support certain of our performance obligations and commitments. The instruments are typically renewed on an annual basis.  We do not have any unconsolidated limited purpose entities or any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities.                                        30   Item 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward-looking analysis. Currencies are in millions.  Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings.  In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to various market risks, including fluctuations in currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates. To manage the exposure related to these risks, we may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with our established policies. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Moreover, we enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly-rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties, thereby limiting exposure to credit-related and performance-related risks.  Currency Risk: We periodically enter into currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business. At December 31, 2006, the principal transactions hedged involved accounts receivable, accounts payable and intercompany loans. When hedging currency exposures, our practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure, and therefore, the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value, cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction.  At December 31, 2006, the currency and net contractual amounts of forward contracts outstanding translated into U.S. dollar equivalent amounts were as follows:                                                    Buy                          -------------------------------------------------------                                       Pound     Canadian  Australian     U.S.   Sell                        Euro   Sterling    Dollar     Dollar      Dollar   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------    U.S. Dollar                $91.3      $8.5      $12.0     $14.5         -   Euro                           -       6.8          -         -         -   Norwegian Krone              1.5         -          -         -         -   Japanese Yen                   -         -          -         -      $3.4   Brazilian Real                 -         -          -         -       4.7   Taiwan Dollar                  -         -          -         -       6.0   Other                        1.5         -          -         -         -   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The unfavorable fair value of currency contracts, based on exchange rates at December 31, 2006, was approximately $1.3. Assuming that year-end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical 10%, the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year-end would decrease by approximately $14.2. However, since these contracts hedge specific transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged.  In September, 2005, we entered into (euro)207.9 of five year cross currency swaps and (euro)207.9 of ten year cross currency swaps to effectively convert the 5-Year Notes and 10-Year Notes into euro-denominated liabilities. The swaps included an initial exchange of $500.0 on October 4, 2005 and will require final principal exchanges of $250.0 on each settlement date of the 5-Year and 10-Year Notes (October 1, 2010 and October 1, 2015), respectively. At the initial principal exchange, we paid US dollars to counterparties and received euros. Upon final exchange, we will provide euros to counterparties and receive US dollars. The swaps also call for a semi-annual exchange of fixed euro interest payments for fixed US dollar interest receipts. With respect to the five year swaps, we will receive 5.5% per annum and will pay 3.784% per annum on each April 1 and October 1, through the maturity date of the five year swaps. With respect to the ten year swaps, we will receive 6.0% per annum and will pay 4.5245% per annum on each April 1 and October 1, through the maturity date of the ten year swaps. The cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the changes in value of the future euro interest and principal receipts that results from changes in the US dollar to euro exchange rates on certain euro denominated intercompany receivables we have with one of our subsidiaries. The cross currency swaps plus the euro denominated bank borrowings and a portion of an intercompany Euro denominated loans payable naturally hedge our euro denominated intercompany loans receivable and, further, provide a partial hedge of our net investment in our Belgium-based subsidiary, Cytec Surface Specialties SA/NV. From time to time we also enter into designated forward euro contracts to adjust the amount of the net investment hedge. At December 31, 2006, we had designated forward contracts to purchase (euro)58.0.                                         31   At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the five and ten year swaps were $(16.9) and $(16.4), respectively. Assuming other factors are held constant, a hypothetical increase/decrease of 10% in the euro exchange rate would cause an increase/decrease of approximately $53.3 in the value of the hedging instruments referred to above.  Commodity Price Risk: We use natural gas swaps, which are financially settled, to hedge certain utility requirements. The maturities of these swaps correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that we pay for the underlying commodity. While these contracts are structured to limit our exposure to increases in commodity prices, they can also limit the potential benefit we might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices. These swaps are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value, which will be reclassified into Manufacturing cost of sales through June 2007 as these swaps are settled.  At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding natural gas swaps with a fair value loss of $(4.3). Assuming that year-end natural gas prices were to decrease by a hypothetical 10%, the value of these contracts would decrease by approximately $2.1.  Interest Rate Risk: At December 31, 2006, our outstanding borrowings consisted of $41.8 of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the current portion, which had a carrying value of $901.8, a face value of $901.9 and a fair value, based on dealer quoted values, of approximately $887.4.  Assuming other factors are held constant, a hypothetical increase/decrease of 1% in the weighted-average prevailing interest rate on our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2006, interest expense would increase/decrease by approximately $1.4 for the next fiscal year and the fair value of the fixed rate long-term debt would decrease/increase by approximately $35.4.  2007 OUTLOOK  In our February 1, 2007 press release, which was also furnished as an exhibit to a current report on Form 8-K, we set forth our assumptions and management's best estimate of the full year 2007 earnings at the time based on various assumptions set forth in our press release. We forecasted diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.60-$3.80, before any potential special items for the year. There can be no assurance that sales or earnings will develop in the manner projected. Actual results may differ materially. See "Comments on Forward Looking Statements."  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and changes in the estimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition.  Share-based Compensation  In December, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"). SFAS 123R addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. SFAS 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," ("APB No. 25") and requires companies to recognize compensation cost in an amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments, such as stock options granted to employees. On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method.  With the adoption of SFAS 123R, the compensation cost for performance stock is recorded based on the market value on the original date of grant, and not based on the price of our common stock at the end of each reporting period as formerly was required under APB No. 25. Compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in cash ("cash-settled SARS") is recognized based on the fair value of the award at the end of each period through the date of vesting, also a change from APB No. 25. Compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in shares ("stock-settled SARS") and stock options is recognized over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value on the date of the grant. SFAS 123R also requires that we estimate a forfeiture rate for all share-based awards. We monitor share option exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates within the valuation model. The estimated fair values are based on assumptions, including estimated lives, volatility, dividend yield, and risk-free interest rates. These estimates also consider the probability that the options and stock-settled SARS will be exercised prior to the end of their contractual lives and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder, which are based on reasonable facts but are subject to change based on a variety of external factors.                                         32   Environmental and Other Contingent Liabilities  Accruals for environmental remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation, and other contingent liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are recorded at management's best estimate of the ultimate expected liabilities, without any discount to reflect the time value of money. These accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes available.  The amount accrued for environment remediation reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature and cost of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties.  Included in other contingent liabilities are workers' compensation, product liability and toxic tort claims. The amount accrued for other contingent liabilities reflects our assumptions about the incidence, severity, indemnity costs and dismissal rates for existing and future claims.  Our asbestos related contingent liabilities and related insurance receivables are based on a study by the Actuarial and Analytics Practice of AON Risk Consultants ("AON"). The study estimated our gross asbestos liabilities using a frequency/severity approach. With this approach, the cost of future claim filings due to asbestos related diseases are estimated as the product of the future number of claims filed and the average value of those claims on a nominal as opposed to discounted basis. Future claim frequency has been estimated using our claims history and the Stallard/Manton Epidemiological Decay Model, a widely used industry study. The Decay model assumes that future levels of claims activity will gradually decrease from current levels by applying model-specific decay factors that project this claim activity to wind down over the next 35 to 40 years. Our current levels are estimated based on our risk profile and our historical claim experience. The estimated cost per claim is based on our historical paid claims adjusted for inflation. Although these estimates and assumptions are based on reasonable facts, they are subject to change based on the actual outcome and a variety of external factors.  Accruals for environmental remediation and other contingent liabilities can change substantially if our assumptions are not realized or due to actions by governmental agencies or private parties. We cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts. Moreover, environmental and other contingent liabilities are paid over an extended period, and the timing of such payments cannot be predicted with any certainty. Accruals for environmental and other contingent liabilities are recorded as other noncurrent liabilities with any amounts expected to be paid out in the next twelve months classified as accrued expenses.  Probable insurance recoveries for past and probable future indemnity costs are recorded at management's best estimate of the ultimate expected receipts without discounting to reflect the time value of money and are recorded as other assets. A number of factors impact the estimates of insurance reimbursements. These factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies, the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies, how legal and defense costs will be covered by the insurance policies, the interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships, and historical recovery rates over the past ten years.  Defense and processing costs are expensed as incurred. Probable insurance recoveries for defense and processing costs are recognized when the related costs are incurred and are recorded as other assets.  Retirement Plans  We sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements. Our most significant pension plans are in the U.S., and constituted over 67% of our consolidated pension assets and 66% of projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2006. The calculation of our pension expense and pension liability associated with our defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions. We believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets.  At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used for pension liabilities. In estimating this rate, we look to rates of return on high quality, long-term corporate bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. We discounted our U.S. future pension liabilities using a rate of 5.85% at December 31, 2006. The discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities has a significant effect on expense.  The expected rate of return on our U.S. plan assets, which was 8.5% for 2006,                                         33   reflects the long-term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability. We establish the expected rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to us at that time, including the historical returns of major asset classes, the expected investment mix of the plans' assets, and estimates of future long-term investment returns. The U.S. pension plan's investment mix at December 31, 2006 approximated 70% equities and 30% fixed income securities. Any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss. The unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss is amortized into pension expense in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions."  Impairment of Goodwill  We have defined our segments as our SFAS No. 142 reporting units. Our four business segments are Cytec Performance Chemicals, Cytec Surface Specialties, Cytec Engineered Materials and Building Block Chemicals. Cytec Performance Chemicals serves large, global industrial markets. Cytec Surface Specialties serves the large, global coatings market. Cytec Engineered Materials serves principally aerospace markets. Building Block Chemicals sells commodity chemical intermediates to industrial users. The segments above reflect how we run our company, manage the assets and the customer perspective.  We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis. Goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. We use a two-step process to test goodwill for impairment. First, the reporting unit's fair value is compared to its carrying value. We utilize a market multiple approach to determine fair value estimates. Due to the cyclical nature of our reporting units, values are determined utilizing a three year average. The three year period is comprised of the prior year, current year and one year projected amounts. If the market multiple approach yields a result which may indicate a possible impairment, a discounted cash flow approach is utilized to more precisely determine the reporting unit's fair value. If a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired, and the second step of the impairment test would be performed. The second step of the goodwill impairment test is used to measure the amount of the impairment loss. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.  These evaluations involve amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. We are not aware of reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being estimated that would have a material impact on these assessments for impairment.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Assets to be Disposed  Long-lived assets and intangible assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed annually for impairment. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be charged to earnings. Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell.  Income Taxes  Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.  We intend to reinvest the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes with respect to these earnings. In the event of repatriation to the U.S., such earnings would be subject to U.S. income taxes in most cases. Foreign tax credits would be available to substantially reduce the amount of U.S. tax otherwise payable in future years.                                         34  Our annual effective tax rate is based on expected income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions.  We establish accruals for tax contingencies when, notwithstanding the reasonable belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, we believe that certain filing positions are likely to be challenged and moreover, that such filing positions may not be fully sustained. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on the income tax returns we file if such tax position is probable of being sustained. We continually evaluate our tax contingency accruals and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances, including but not limited to emerging case law, tax legislation, rulings by relevant tax authorities, and the progress of ongoing tax audits. Settlement of a given tax contingency could impact the income tax provision in the period of resolution. Our tax contingency accruals are presented in the balance sheet within income taxes payable.  Acquisitions  We account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition. The cost to acquire a business, including transaction costs, is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business in proportion to their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to acquired in-process research and development are expensed at the date of acquisition.  The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. Accordingly, for significant items, we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists.  Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.  All of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our results of operations.  Derivative Financial Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities  Our established policies allow the use of derivative instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in currency rates, certain commodity (e.g., natural gas) prices, interest rates and equity prices. Derivative instruments currently utilized include currency forward contracts and swaps, natural gas swaps, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly-rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties, thereby limiting exposure to credit-related and performance-related risks.  We use currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of third party and intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business. The principal transactions hedged involve accounts receivable, accounts payable and loans. When hedging currency exposures, our practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure, and therefore, the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value, cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction. Currency forward contracts are reported as either assets or liabilities with changes in their fair value recorded in other income (expense), net together with offsetting gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability.  We use cross currency swaps to synthetically convert some of our U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge future cash flows from euro receipts on certain euro denominated intercompany receivables we have with our subsidiaries against changes in the US dollar to euro exchange rates. The cross currency swaps are recorded as either assets or liabilities. Changes in fair value include both an interest and an exchange component. The interest component is recorded in other comprehensive income while the exchange component is recorded in other income (expense), net together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged intercompany receivables.  We use natural gas swaps, which are financially settled, to hedge a portion of utility requirements at certain of our facilities. These swaps, which are highly effective at achieving offsetting cash flows of the underlying natural gas purchases, have been designated as cash flow hedges and are reported on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, with offsetting amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) on an after-tax basis. Gains and                                         35   losses are reclassified into earnings, as a component of manufacturing cost of sales in the period the hedged natural gas purchases affect earnings. The fair values of all these instruments are based on quotes from third party financial institutions.                                         36  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
