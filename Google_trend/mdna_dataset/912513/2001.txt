Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results         ----------------------------------------------------------------------- of Operations - -------------       The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Dollars are in millions, except share and per share amounts.  GENERAL       During 2000 the Company completed the following disposition transactions:       On November 1, 2000, the Company completed the sale of its paper chemicals sizing and strength business to Bayer Corporation and the direct sales portion of its retention and drainage aids and fixative products business to Ciba Specialty Chemicals Water Treatments, Inc. The Company also agreed to produce paper chemicals for Bayer Corporation under a long-term manufacturing agreement to which the Company allocated proceeds of $11.2 which were recorded as deferred revenue. This deferred revenue will be recognized over the term of the manufacturing agreement. The Company received net cash proceeds of $115.5 in connection with these transactions and recorded in other income, net, a pre-tax gain of $88.3. Included in the sale were the sales, marketing, research and development and technical services personnel and the dedicated field and laboratory equipment associated with the respective businesses. The Company retained approximately $18.1 of Paper Chemicals accounts receivable and all of its Water and Industrial Process Chemicals production facilities. Paper Chemicals sales were $97.9, $106.4 and $111.8 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Approximately $30.5 of taxes due on this divestiture will be paid in 2001.       On July 10, 2000, the Company completed the sale of two subsidiaries, which owned its 50% interest in Criterion Catalyst Company LP ("Criterion"), to its joint venture partner CRI International, Inc., a company of the Royal Dutch Shell Group, for cash consideration of $63.0. The consideration received approximated the carrying value of the Company's investment, which was included in investment in associated companies. The sale resulted in taxes paid of approximately $7.5.       During 1999 the Company completed the following acquisition and disposition transactions:       On October 29, 1999, the Company acquired the amino coatings resins business of BIP Limited (the "BIP business") for approximately $37.2 in cash plus future consideration with a value equivalent to approximately $8.3. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired by $36.7, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of up to 40 years. The acquired business has been integrated into the Company's Performance Products segment. BIP retained its manufacturing plant in Oldbury, United Kingdom, where it continues to manufacture certain amino coatings resins for Cytec under a long-term agreement.       On September 16, 1999, the Company acquired Inspec Mining Chemicals S.A. ("IMC") from Laporte plc for $25.1, net of $0.8 cash received. At the date of acquisition, the purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value of the identifiable assets acquired by $19.0. Based on valuation studies completed during 2000, the fair value of the assets acquired was revised, resulting in a $2.8 increase to goodwill. The $2.8 adjustment along with the original $19.0 excess of the purchase price over the identifiable net assets acquired is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of up to 40 years from the original date of acquisition. The acquisition, which included two manufacturing operations and a research and development center located in Chile, has been integrated into the Company's Water and Industrial Process Chemicals segment.       On August 11, 1999, the Company acquired assets of the global phosphine fumigants product line from BOC Group Inc. for $3.5. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired by $1.2. The terms of the acquisition provided for two additional payments aggregating up to $1.0 to be paid upon approval by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of certain fumigant registrations. The contingencies for these payments were met during 2000, and $1.0 was recorded as additional goodwill. The $1.0 of additional consideration, along with the original $1.2 excess of the purchase price over the identifiable net assets acquired, is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of up to 20 years from the original date of acquisition. The terms of the acquisition also provide for additional consideration to be paid if the acquired product line's net sales exceed certain targeted levels. All additional payments are payable in cash and will be recorded as additional goodwill when the contingencies for such payment have been met. The acquired business has been integrated into the Company's Water and Industrial Process Chemicals segment.       On January 25, 1999, the Company acquired assets of the Nottingham Company's industrial minerals product line for $4.0. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired by $0.5, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of up to 40 years. The acquired business has been integrated into the Company's Water and Industrial Process Chemicals segment.                                          -19-        On January 21, 1999, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of its engineered molding compounds business, excluding land, buildings and one product line, to Rogers Corporation of Manchester, Connecticut, for $4.3.       During 1998 the Company completed the following acquisition and disposition transactions:       On October 9, 1998, the Company acquired The American Materials & Technologies Corporation ("AMT"), a manufacturer of advanced composite materials, in a stock transaction designed to qualify as a tax-free reorganization. In the transaction, the Company issued from Treasury Stock 1,243,663 shares of its common stock to AMT shareholders. In addition, outstanding options and warrants to acquire AMT stock were converted into 335,209 Cytec options and warrants with a weighted average exercise price of $10.48 per share. The cost of the acquisition was approximately $26.8, including the shares issued, options and warrants converted and previous shares acquired plus the assumption of approximately $5.4 in debt. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired by $24.4, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of up to 40 years. The acquired business has been integrated into the Company's Specialty Materials segment. On October 26, 1998, the Company sold the assets of the AMT graphite golf shaft business for approximately $6.2 in cash.       On July 31, 1998, the Company purchased from Dyno Industrier ASA ("Dyno") of Oslo, Norway, Dyno's global amino coatings resin business (the "Dyno business"), which consisted primarily of Dyno's 50% interest in Dyno-Cytec, a European joint venture, for approximately $55.7 in cash. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired by $32.0, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of up to 40 years. The acquired business has been integrated into the Company's Performance Products segment.       On June 24, 1998, the Company acquired assets of the OREPREP minerals processing product line from Baker Petrolite Corporation for approximately $9.0. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired by $8.3, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of up to 40 years. The acquired product line has been integrated into the Company's Water and Industrial Process Chemicals segment.       On November 23, 1998, the Company completed the sale of its bulk molding compounds business to Bulk Molding Compounds, Inc., of West Chicago, Illinois, for $17.0 in cash, resulting in a pretax gain of $4.4. The business acquired by Bulk Molding Compounds, Inc. included Cytec's manufacturing, laboratory and sales facility located at Perrysburg, Ohio. Sales for this product line were $24.9 in 1998.       All acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting with the purchase prices allocated to the assets received and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The results of operations for the acquired businesses are included from the dates of acquisition in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts recorded as excesses of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired (i.e., goodwill) are included in Acquisition Intangibles in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Consolidated results of operations for 1999 or 1998 would not have been materially different if any of the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 1998. Accordingly, pro forma sales, net earnings and earnings per share disclosures have not been provided.       During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-10, "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs" ("EITF 00-10"), and upon adoption, the Company reclassified certain prior period comparative amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income. EITF 00-10 prohibits the netting of shipping and handling costs against shipping and handling revenues. EITF 00-10 permits companies to adopt a policy of including shipping and handling costs in manufacturing cost of sales or other income statement line items. The Company previously followed the common practice of netting shipping costs against shipping revenues as a component of net sales, while handling costs, such as warehousing expenses, were included as a component of selling and technical services expense. As a result of reclassifying shipping costs to manufacturing cost of sales, previously reported sales increased $32.0 in 1999 and $31.2 in 1998. As a result of reclassifying handling and warehousing expenses to manufacturing cost of sales, previously reported selling and technical service expenses decreased $20.8 in 1999 and $21.4 in 1998. Previously reported manufacturing costs of sales are commensurately higher. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported operating profit or net income.       In June 1998 the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). SFAS 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts. In general SFAS 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. It further provides criteria for derivative instruments to be designated as "fair value," "cash flow" or "foreign currency" hedges and establishes accounting standards for reporting changes in the fair value of derivative instruments. If a derivative is deemed to be an effective hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against changes in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized on an after-tax basis in accumulated other comprehensive                                        -20-   income within the equity section of the balance sheet until such time that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not hedges, as well as the ineffective portion of hedges, must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. In connection with the Company's risk management strategies, the Company holds certain foreign exchange, commodity and interest rate instruments that have been deemed derivatives pursuant to the criteria established in SFAS 133. Upon adoption the Company will be required to adjust certain of these derivatives to fair value in the balance sheet and recognize the offsetting gains or losses as adjustments to earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income, as appropriate. SFAS 133 will become effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2001. The Company does not believe that the implementation of SFAS 133 will have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial position.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      The following table sets forth the percentage relationship that certain items in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income bear to net sales:  Years Ended December 31,           2000              1999             1998 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net sales                          100.0%            100.0%           100.0% Manufacturing cost of sales         72.3              70.9             71.8 Gross profit                        27.7              29.1             28.2 Selling and technical services       9.3               8.9              8.9 Research and process development     2.6               3.0              2.9 Administrative and general           3.2               3.6              3.2 Amortization of     acquisition intangibles          0.8               0.8              0.6 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Earnings from operations            11.8              12.8             12.6 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net earnings                        11.9               8.4              8.5 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   NET SALES BY BUSINESS SEGMENT       The Company has four reportable segments: Water and Industrial Process Chemicals, Performance Products, Specialty Materials and Building Block Chemicals.       The Water and Industrial Process Chemicals segment produces water treating, mining and phosphine chemicals that are used mainly in water and wastewater treatment and mineral processing and separation. The segment included the Paper Chemicals business, which was substantially divested on November 1, 2000. The Performance Products segment produces specialty resins, surfactants and specialty monomers and polymer additives that are used primarily in coatings, adhesives and plastics applications. The Specialty Materials segment manufactures and sells aerospace materials that are used mainly in commercial and military aviation, satellite and launch vehicles and aircraft brakes. The segment also included the Bulk and Engineered Molding Compounds businesses, which were divested in 1997 and 1998, respectively. The Building Block Chemicals segment manufactures acrylonitrile, acrylamide, ammonia, hydrocyanic acid, melamine and sulfuric acid. Some of these products are upgraded into Specialty Chemicals (Water and Industrial Process Chemicals and Performance Products) products with the remainder sold to third parties. Internal usage is not reflected in net sales of Building Block Chemicals.                                        -21-   The Company's net sales by business segment are set forth below.  Years Ended December 31,      2000             1999              1998 - ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Water and Industrial     Process Chemicals(1)    $  403.1          $  387.5         $  363.3 Performance Products           474.0             449.8            409.7 Specialty Materials(2)         411.6             435.7            493.3 Building Block Chemicals       203.8             171.5            209.2 Other                            -                 -                0.2 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             $1,492.5          $1,444.5         $1,475.7 - ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) On November 1, 2000, the Company completed the sale of its Paper Chemicals business, which had sales of $97.9, $106.4 and $111.8 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. (2) On November 23, 1998, the Company completed the sale of its bulk molding compounds product line, which had sales of $24.9 in 1998. On January 21, 1999, the Company completed the sale of its engineered molding compounds product line, which had sales of $14.1 in 1998.       For more information on the Company's segments see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and further discussions in the Segment Results section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.       The Company has a 50% interest in each of three associated companies: CYRO Industries, Mitsui Cytec, Ltd. and AC Molding Compounds. The Company also had a 50% interest in the former Criterion Catalyst Company L.P. joint venture through July 10, 2000, and a 50% interest in the former Dyno-Cytec joint venture through July 31, 1998. The aggregate net sales of unconsolidated associated companies were $496.3 in 2000, $521.4 in 1999 and $583.0 in 1998.       On October 16, 2000, the formation of PolymerAdditives.com, LLC, a joint venture between the Company, Albemarle Corporation and GE Specialty Chemicals, Inc., an operating unit of General Electric Company, was completed. PolymerAdditives.com, LLC operates a fully functional business-to-business e-commerce Internet site and provides customers the ability to purchase a variety of polymer additives from one source. During 2000 the Company invested an aggregate of $2.5 for a one-third equity interest in the joint venture.  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999  Net sales for 2000 were $1,492.5, compared with $1,444.5 for 1999. The increase was primarily due to sales increases in the Water and Industrial Process Chemicals, Performance Products and Building Block Chemicals segments of $15.6, $24.2 and $32.3, respectively. This increase was partially offset by a sales decrease in the Specialty Materials segment of $24.1. For further information see Segment Results discussion below.       Net sales in the United States were $798.8 for 2000, compared with $816.0 for 1999. International net sales were $693.7 for 2000, or 46.5% of total net sales, compared with $628.5, or 43.5% of total net sales, for 1999.       In the North America region (i.e., United States and Canada), net sales were $866.0 for 2000, down 1.7% from the prior year. Overall, selling volumes decreased 3.4%. Selling volumes in Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 1.2%, Performance Products increased 2.3%, Specialty Materials decreased 8.3% and Building Block Chemicals decreased 11.6%. Overall, selling prices increased 2.0% with the segment breakdown as follows: Water and Industrial Process Chemicals decreased 0.7%, Performance Products decreased 0.8%, Specialty Materials increased 0.1% and Building Block Chemicals increased 21.0%. For the region overall, the adverse effect of exchange rate changes reduced sales about 0.3%.       In the Europe/Mideast/Africa region, net sales were $336.5 for 2000, up 0.7% from the prior year. Overall, selling volumes increased 8.1%. Selling volumes in Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 7.1%, Performance Products increased 16.4%, Specialty Materials increased 4.1% and Building Block Chemicals decreased 2.8%. Overall, selling prices decreased 0.5% with the segment breakdown as follows: Water and Industrial Process Chemicals decreased 5.9%, Performance Process Chemicals increased 0.4%, Specialty Materials were flat and Building Block Chemicals increased 12.0%. For the region overall, the adverse effect of exchange rate changes reduced sales approximately 6.9%.       In the Asia/Pacific region, net sales were $193.4 for 2000, up 26.5% from the prior year. Overall, selling volumes increased 13.4%. Selling volumes in Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 15.4%, Performance Products increased 20.6%, Specialty Materials increased 4.8% and Building Block Chemicals increased 3.5%. Overall, selling prices increased 13.4% with the segment breakdown as follows: Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 1.5%, Performance Products decreased 0.6%, Specialty Materials were flat and Building Block Chemicals increased 54.8%. For the region overall, the adverse effect of exchange rate changes reduced sales approximately 0.3%.                                        -22-        In the Latin America region, net sales were $96.6 for 2000, up 26.4% from the prior year. Overall, selling volumes increased 26.9%. Selling volumes in Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 28.5%, and Performance Products increased 17.3%. Sales in the Specialty Materials and Building Block Chemicals segments are relatively small in this region, hence comparisons are not meaningful. Overall, selling prices increased 2.4%. Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 3.0% and Performance Process Chemicals increased 1.7%. For the region overall, the adverse effect of exchange rate changes reduced sales approximately 2.9%.       Manufacturing cost of sales was $1,078.7 for 2000 and included net restructuring charges of $3.3 and a provision of $1.4 against receivables due to the Company from its 50% owned ammonia joint venture. Excluding these charges, manufacturing cost of sales was 72.0% of net sales for 2000. Manufacturing cost of sales was $1,023.6 for 1999 and included a net restructuring credit of $1.5. Excluding this credit, manufacturing cost of sales was 71.0% of net sales for 1999. Excluding these special items, manufacturing cost of sales as a percentage of sales was up in 2000 when compared with the prior year. The combined results of adverse exchange rate changes and higher raw material costs offset the benefits from higher selling volumes, increased selling prices and the Company's manufacturing rationalization and productivity initiative programs.       Selling and technical service expenses were $138.5 for 2000 and included a net restructuring charge of $5.4. Selling and technical service expenses were $129.2 for 1999 and included a restructuring charge of $0.3. Excluding these special items, selling and technical service expenses increased $4.2. This increase is attributable to the Performance Products segment and reflects costs from its acquisition of the BIP business in 1999.       Research and process development expenses were $38.6 for 2000 and included a net restructuring charge of $1.1. Research and process development expenses were $43.8 for 1999 and included a restructuring charge of $1.7. Excluding these special items, research and process development expenses decreased $4.6, which was due primarily to lower patent costs that tend to fluctuate depending on activity and reduced research expenses in the Performance Products segment.       Administrative and general expenses were $47.7 for 2000 and included a net restructuring charge of $0.3. Administrative and general expenses were $51.7 for 1999 and included a charge of $2.5 for external costs associated with tax planning and a net restructuring charge of $0.1. Excluding these special items, administrative and general expenses decreased $1.5, which reflects the benefits of the Company's efforts to contain costs in this area.       Amortization of acquisition intangibles was $12.4 for 2000, an increase of $1.2 from the prior year. The increase was due to the additional intangibles resulting from the acquisitions of the BOC Gases' global phosphines fumigant product line in August 1999, IMC in September 1999 and the BIP business in October 1999.       Other income, net, was $104.6 for 2000 and included several special items. Those special items were a gain of $88.3 from the sale of the Paper Chemicals business (for more information about the sale of the Paper Chemicals business, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), a gain of $13.3 from insurance settlement agreements entered into with a group of insurance carriers in an environmental coverage suit and a provision of $4.8 against receivables due from the AC Moldings Compounds joint venture. Excluding these special items, other income, net, was $7.8 and included a gain of $7.1 from the sale of real estate. Other income, net, was $9.3 for 1999 and included gains of $4.5 from the sale of real estate, $2.2 from royalty income and $1.6 from the sale of certain product lines.       Equity in earnings of associated companies, which represents the Company's before-tax share of its associates' earnings, was $15.0 for 2000, an increase of $9.4 from the prior year. The increase was primarily due to operational improvements at Criterion relative to its losses in 1999. The Company's interest in Criterion was sold on July 10, 2000. For more information about the sale of the Company's interest in Criterion, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. CYRO Industries sales were up about 10.0%, but earnings were relatively flat due to higher raw material costs, principally acetone and methanol. CYRO Industries also experienced weak demand in December 2000. CYRO Industries expects to experience weak demand and high raw material costs through the first half of 2001. PolymerAdditives.com, LLC is expected to experience a net operating loss in 2001 primarily due to start-up costs.       Interest expense, net, was $25.1 for 2000, a decrease of $1.8 from the prior year period. The decrease reflects the lower outstanding debt levels during 2000.       The income tax provision was $93.5 for 2000, which reflects an underlying effective tax rate of 34.5%. The income tax provision was $51.7 for 1999 and included a credit of $8.0 related to the utilization of prior years' tax credits. Excluding the impact of this item, the underlying effective tax rate for 1999 was 34.5%.                                        -23-        Net earnings for 2000 were $177.6, or $4.15 per diluted share. Special items included in 2000 were a gain of $88.3 ($57.8 after-tax, or $1.35 per diluted share) from the sale of the Paper Chemicals business and a gain of $13.3 ($8.7 after-tax, or $0.20 per diluted share) from the environmental remediation insurance settlements. Also included in 2000 were charges of $11.5 ($7.5 after-tax, or $0.18 per diluted share) from net restructuring and other charges and a $4.8 ($3.1 after-tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) provision against receivables due from the AC Moldings Compounds joint venture. Excluding these special items, net earnings for 2000 were $121.7, or $2.85 per diluted share. Net earnings for 1999 were $121.3, or $2.73 per diluted share. Included in 1999 was a credit of $8.0 ($0.18 per diluted share) related to the reduction in income tax expense from the utilization of prior years' tax credits, which is partially offset by a charge of $2.5 ($1.6 after-tax, or $0.04 per diluted share) for tax planning expenses. Also included in 1999 was a charge of $0.6 ($0.4 after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) related to the net effect of restructuring activities. Excluding these special items, net earnings for 1999 were $115.4, or $2.60 per diluted share. Excluding these special items for both years, the period-over-period earnings per diluted share growth was 9.6%. Earnings per diluted share were also favorably impacted by the Company's stock repurchase program.  SEGMENT RESULTS       Water and Industrial Process Chemicals: Water and Industrial Process      -------------------------------------- Chemicals sales increased 4.0% to $403.1 and earnings from operations decreased 7.6% to $40.2. For the overall segment, selling volumes increased 7.8%. This includes a 3.5% volume increase due to the acquisition of IMC in September of 1999 and a 3.5% volume decrease due to the divestiture of the Paper Chemicals business on November 1, 2000. The increase in selling volumes was partially offset by the adverse effects of exchange rate changes and lower selling prices, which reduced sales approximately 2.5% and 1.3%, respectively. The lower earnings from operations were primarily the result of higher raw material costs of petroleum derivatives, such as propylene, net unfavorable exchange rate changes, particularly in Europe, and lower selling prices which more than offset the benefits from higher selling volumes and lower operating costs.       Performance Products: Performance Products sales increased 5.4% to $474.0      -------------------- and earnings from operations increased 10.1% to $56.8. For the overall segment, selling volumes increased 8.6%, which includes a 3.4% volume increase due to the acquisition of the BIP business in October of 1999. The higher selling volumes were partially offset by the adverse effects of exchange rate changes, which reduced sales by about 2.8% and lower selling prices, which were down about 0.4%. The segment serves a broad range of end markets, and during the fourth quarter of 2000, demand in these markets began to reflect the slowing in the U.S. and Asian economies. The improved earnings from operations were primarily the result of higher selling volumes, increased manufacturing productivity and certain licensing fees, partially offset by higher raw material costs, lower selling prices and the net unfavorable exchange rate changes.       Specialty Materials: Specialty Materials sales decreased 5.5% to $411.6,      ------------------- while earnings from operations increased 1.2% to $85.9. Selling volumes decreased 3.2% primarily due to lower Boeing commercial aircraft build rates and Boeing's transition from carbon to glass fiber composites for certain aircraft interiors. The divestiture of the engineered molding compounds product line and the adverse effects of exchange rate changes reduced sales another 1.8% and 0.6%, respectively. Selling prices were up about 0.1%. During the fourth quarter of 2000, demand from the large commercial airliner market began to improve. The growth in earnings from operations were primarily the result of lower raw material costs and the benefits of the Company's manufacturing rationalization programs.       Building Block Chemicals: Building Block Chemicals sales to external      ------------------------ customers were $203.8, an increase of 18.8% from the previous year, and earnings from operations were $12.7, an increase of 108.2% from the prior year. For the overall segment, selling prices increased 26.1% and selling volumes decreased 1.6%, excluding a 3.3% volume decrease due to the divestiture of the methanol plant in December of last year. The adverse effects of exchange rate changes reduced sales another 2.4%. Sales were favorably impacted by a sharp increase in acrylonitrile and acrylamide selling prices, although higher propylene and natural gas costs more than offset the selling price increases. Earnings from operations were favorably impacted by two major factors. First, improved plant operations led to significantly higher production volumes of acrylonitrile, thereby reducing manufacturing cost per unit. This in turn improved the overall gross profit of the segment. The second factor was reduced plant spending.       During December 2000, the ammonia production facility was idled as high natural gas costs together with relatively low ammonia prices made it uneconomical to produce ammonia. The facility was started up again during the first week of February 2001 as declining gas costs made it economical to produce ammonia versus purchasing it from third parties. Due to the volatility of U.S. natural gas markets, the Company is unable to predict with certainty whether the plant will remain operational throughout 2001. See "Building Block Chemicals - Other Building Block Chemicals" in Item 1, Business.                                        -24-   YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998       Net sales for 1999 were $1,444.5, compared with $1,475.7 for 1998. The decrease was due mainly to $57.6 of lower sales in the Specialty Materials segment and $37.7 of lower sales in the Building Block Chemicals segment. This decrease was partially offset by sales increases in the Water and Industrial Process Chemicals and Performance Products segments of $24.2 and $40.1, respectively (see Segment Results discussion below).       Net sales in the United States were $816.0 for 1999, compared with $907.2 for 1998. International net sales were $628.5 for 1999, or 43.5% of total sales, compared with $568.5, or 38.5% of total sales, in 1998.       In the North America region, net sales were $880.9 for 1999, down 8.6% from the prior year. The decrease was due mainly to a 4.4% decrease in selling volumes (primarily in the Building Block Chemicals and Specialty Materials segments) and lower selling prices, which were down about 4.2%.       In the Europe/Mideast/Africa region, net sales were $334.3 for 1999, up 7.3% from the prior year. The increase was due mainly to a 12.7% increase in selling volumes. Selling volumes increased in the Performance Products and Water and Industrial Process Chemicals segments. The increase in the Performance Products segment was due mainly to the July 1998 acquisition of the Dyno business and the October 1999 acquisition of the BIP business. The increase in selling volumes was partially offset by lower selling prices, which reduced sales about 3.6%, and the adverse effect of exchange rate changes, which reduced sales by another 1.8%.       In the Asia/Pacific region, net sales were $152.9 for 1999, up 12.1% from the prior year. The increase was due mainly to a 13.4% increase in selling volumes (primarily in the Performance Products and Water and Industrial Process Chemicals segments) and the favorable effect of exchange rate changes, which increased sales another 2.1%. This increase was partially offset by lower selling prices, which were down about 3.4%.       In the Latin America region, net sales were $76.4 for 1999, up 19.6% from the prior year. The increase was due mainly to a 23.2% increase in selling volumes, of which approximately one-third was from the acquisition of IMC. The increase in selling volumes was partially offset by the adverse effect of exchange rate changes, which reduced sales about 2.5%, and lower selling prices, which reduced sales by another 1.1%.       Manufacturing cost of sales was $1,023.6 for 1999 and included a net restructuring credit of $1.5. Excluding this credit, manufacturing cost of sales was 71.0% of net sales, which as a percentage of sales was down slightly when compared with $1,059.2, or 71.8%, of net sales for 1998. Manufacturing costs as a percentage of net sales continued to benefit in 1999 from manufacturing rationalization, restructuring benefits, improved product mix, and lower raw material costs. Partially offsetting these benefits were the adverse effects of price and selling volume decreases in the Building Block Chemicals and Specialty Materials segments as well as price reductions in the Water and Industrial Process Chemicals and Performance Products segments.       Selling and technical service expenses were $129.2 for 1999 and included a restructuring charge of $0.3. Excluding this charge, selling and technical service expenses decreased $3.1, which reflects the benefits of the Company's efforts to contain costs in this area.       Research and process development expenses were $43.8 for 1999 and included a restructuring charge of $1.7. Excluding this charge, research and process development expenses decreased $0.8, primarily reflecting the Company's decentralization of research to business units and restructuring initiatives at the Stamford, Connecticut, research facility. Partially offsetting the decrease were higher patent costs for 1999.       Administrative and general expenses were $51.7 for 1999, an increase of $5.1 from 1998. Included in 1999 was a charge of $2.5 for external costs associated with tax planning, higher costs associated with certain litigation and a net restructuring charge of $0.1.       Amortization of acquisition intangibles increased $1.7 due to the additional intangibles resulting from the acquisitions of the Nottingham Company's industrial minerals product line in January 1999, the BOC Gases' global phosphine fumigants product line in August 1999, IMC in September 1999 and the BIP business in October 1999. In addition, 1999 included a full year of amortization for the Dyno business and AMT, which were acquired in July and October 1998, respectively.       Other income, net, was $9.3 for 1999, a decrease of $5.2 from 1998. Included in 1999 were gains of $4.5 from the sale of real estate, $2.2 from royalty income and $1.6 from the sale of certain product lines. In 1998, other income, net, included gains of $4.4 related to the sale of the bulk molding compounds product line, $3.0 of other investment income and $3.8 on certain investments in unaffiliated companies.                                        -25-        Equity in earnings of associated companies, which represents the Company's before-tax share of its 50% owned associates' earnings, was down $14.7 primarily due to lower sales and earnings by Criterion Catalyst. Industry over-capacity and difficult economic conditions in the refining industry affected operations at Criterion Catalyst. The result has been much lower selling prices and an adverse product mix for hydrotreating catalysts. CYRO Industries earnings were also down as selling prices and margins for certain of its products remain low. In 1998 equity earnings included $2.1, representing the former Dyno-Cytec joint venture's results prior to the purchase of the remaining 50% ownership in and subsequent consolidation of the venture in July 1998.       Interest expense, net, was $26.9 for 1999 and increased $4.5 from 1998, reflecting a full year of interest expense associated with the long-term debt securities issued during 1998.       The income tax provision was $51.7 for 1999 and included a credit of $8.0 related to the utilization of prior years' tax credits. Excluding the impact of this item, the Company reduced its underlying effective tax rate for the year to 34.5%, down from the 37.0% rate for 1998.       Net earnings for 1999 were $121.3, or $2.73 per diluted share, compared with $124.7, or $2.68 per diluted share, for 1998. Diluted earnings per share in 1999 included a credit of $0.18 per diluted share related to the reduction in income tax expense from the utilization of prior years' tax credits, which is partially offset by a charge of $0.04 per diluted share for tax planning expenses. In addition, diluted earnings per share in 1999 included a $0.01 charge related to the net effect of restructuring activities. Excluding these three items, diluted earnings per share were $2.60 for 1999. Diluted earnings per share in 1998 included a gain of $0.06 per diluted share from the sale of the bulk molding compounds business. Excluding this gain, the diluted earnings per share in 1998 were $2.62.  SEGMENT RESULTS       Water and Industrial Process Chemicals: Water and Industrial Process      -------------------------------------- Chemicals sales increased 6.7% to $387.5, and earnings from operations increased 30.0% to $43.5. The sales increase was primarily in mining chemicals. Overall, selling volumes were up 10.1%, of which approximately 3.3% were from the acquisitions of IMC and the Nottingham Company's industrial minerals product lines. The increase in selling volumes was partially offset by lower selling prices, which were down about 2.6%, and the adverse effect of exchange rate changes, which reduced sales another 0.8%. The improved earnings from operations were primarily the result of leverage from higher sales, lower raw material prices and reduced operating costs.       Performance Products: Performance Products sales increased 9.8% to $449.8,      -------------------- and earnings from operations increased 24.9% to $51.6. Overall, selling volumes were up 14.4%, of which approximately 9.5% were from amino coatings resins sales generated as a result of the July 1998 acquisition of the Dyno business and the October 1999 acquisition of the BIP business. The remaining 4.9% increase in selling volumes was due mainly to stronger sales volumes in the polymer additives product line. The increase in selling volumes was partially offset by lower selling prices, which were down about 4.4%, and the adverse effect of exchange rate changes, which reduced sales another 0.2%. The improved earnings from operations were primarily the result of higher sales volumes and to a lesser extent lower raw material prices and reduced operating costs.       Specialty Materials: Specialty Materials sales were $435.7, a decrease of      ------------------- 11.7% from the previous year. Earnings from operations, however, improved 6.3% to $84.9. Approximately 8.2% of the sales decrease was due to the divestiture of the molding compounds and certain other product lines, partially offset by the acquisition of AMT in the fourth quarter of 1998 which added approximately 3.7% to sales. Excluding the effect of acquisitions and divestitures, selling volumes were down 5.2% as a result of the decline in the commercial aircraft build rates and were partially offset by new product introductions, new applications and new qualifications for the Company's products. Selling prices decreased 1.8%, but the decrease was largely offset by lower raw material costs. Earnings from operations benefited from the rationalization of manufacturing facilities and the removal of structural costs consistent with reduced commercial aircraft build rates.       Building Block Chemicals: Building Block Chemicals sales were $171.5, an      ------------------------ 18.0% decrease. Earnings from operations were $6.1, compared with $34.3 in 1998. For the segment overall, selling prices, primarily for acrylonitrile, were down 9.4%, and volumes and exchange rates were down another 7.9% and 0.7%, respectively. Selling prices for acrylonitrile, which were weak for the first six months of 1999, began to improve during the second half of the year, driven mostly by unanticipated global acrylonitrile production outages and the growing demand from Asian acrylic fiber markets. However, costs for propylene, the key raw material for acrylonitrile, increased at a faster rate, and as a result, acrylonitrile margins remained low. In addition, lower selling prices and volumes of acrylamide and melamine, downtime at the acrylonitrile plant and other operating difficulties negatively impacted earnings. In December 1999, the Company sold to Methanex Corporation its 30% interest in the methanol manufacturing joint venture. The methanol plant had been shut down since March 1999 due to poor economics.                                        -26-   LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION       At December 31, 2000, the Company's cash balance was $56.8, an increase of $44.8 from year-end 1999.       Net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $107.6 for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared with $199.2 for the year ended December 31, 1999. The decrease in operating cash was primarily due to higher working capital levels. Trade receivables increased due to a higher mix of international sales. Other receivables increased due, in part, to the environmental insurance settlements, which were reached earlier in the year and are being paid in quarterly installments over two years. Also contributing to the higher receivables balance were swap receivables, principally related to acrylonitrile, which increased over last year. Inventory levels increased in the fourth quarter when economic slowing in some markets reduced customer demand. Included in 2000 net cash flows provided by operating activities were taxes paid of approximately $7.5 resulting from the sale of the Company's interest in Criterial Catalyst Company L.P., prefunding to the Company's Voluntary Employees Benefit Association (VEBA) Trust accounts of $10.0 over 1999 amounts, $7.3 net recovery of Paper Chemicals receivables and $11.2 of proceeds allocated from the sale of the Paper Chemicals business for the long-term manufacturing agreement with Bayer Corporation.       Payments against restructuring reserves were $4.4 in 2000, compared with $16.6 in 1999. At December 31, 2000, the restructuring liabilities to be paid were $9.9. The spending is expected to be completed by the end of 2001. Environmental remediation spending for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $15.3, $18.6 and $23.8, respectively. At December 31, 2000, the environmental reserve balance was $106.0, of which $20.0 was included in accrued expenses. Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension ("OPEB") spending for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $39.0, $27.7 and $25.2, respectively. The Company expects spending for environmental remediation and OPEB (excluding pre-funding, if any), in 2001 to be similar to 2000 levels, though there can be no assurance that the Company's annual cash expenditures for environmental remediation or OPEB will not be higher in the future (see Note 9 and Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to environmental matters and OPEB).       Net cash flows provided by investing activities totaled $97.6 for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared with net cash flows used for investing activities of $140.4 for the year ended December 31, 1999. Included in 2000 were pre-tax proceeds of $104.3 from the sale of the Paper Chemicals business, $63.0 received from the sale of the Company's interest in the Criterion Catalyst joint venture and funding of $2.5 for the Company's one-third equity interest in PolymerAdditives.com, LLC.       Included in 1999 was funding of $69.8 for the acquisitions of the Nottingham Company's industrial minerals product line ($4.0), the BOC Gases' global phosphine fumigants product line ($3.5), IMC ($25.1) and the BIP business ($37.2) and a $5.0 loan to Criterion Catalyst Company L.P. Also included in 1999 were proceeds of $5.9 received from the sale of the molding compounds product lines and $5.9 from the sale of other assets. Funding for capital additions was $76.5 for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared with $77.4 in 1999. The Company expects capital spending for the year 2001 to be approximately $80.0.       The Company believes that, based on internal cash generation and current levels of liquid assets, it will be able to fund operating cash requirements and planned capital expenditures in 2001.       Net cash flows used for financing activities totaled $158.5 for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared with $47.5 for the year ended December 31, 1999. In 2000 the Company purchased 2,161,700 shares of Treasury Stock at a cost of $63.1, while in 1999 the Company purchased 1,784,045 shares of Treasury Stock at a cost of $42.5. Also in 2000 the Company paid-down $102.9 of its long-term debt.       During November 2000 the Company completed the $100.0 share repurchase program that was announced on January 25, 1999. The Company repurchased a total of 3,784,254 shares of its outstanding common stock under this program. On November 2, 2000, the Company announced a new program to spend up to $100.0 to repurchase shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. The repurchases will be made from time to time on the open market or in private transactions and will be utilized for stock option plans, benefit plans and other corporate purposes. Through December 31, 2000, the Company had repurchased 161,491 shares at a cost of $5.5 under this new program.       In connection with the Company's stock repurchase program, during the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company sold an aggregate of 400,000 put options to two institutional investors in a series of private placements exempt from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. The put options entitled the holders to sell an aggregate of 400,000 shares of the Company's common stock to the Company at exercise prices ranging from $23.083 to $24.553 per share. Prior to December 31, 2000, the put options expired unexercised. The Company received premiums of approximately $0.6 on the sale of such put options. In January 2001 the Company sold an additional 100,000 put options that expire in July 2001 and 100,000 put options that expire in August 2001 at exercise prices of $31.528 per share and $31.347 per share, respectively. The Company has received                                        -27-   premiums of approximately $0.5 on the sale of such put options. In lieu of purchasing the shares from the put option holders, the Company has the right to elect settlement by paying the holders of the put options the excess of the strike price over the then market price of the shares in either cash or additional shares of the Company's common stock (i.e., net cash or net share settlement).       The Company must maintain certain financial covenants contained in its Series C Cumulative Preferred Stock ("Series C Stock") held by MDP Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the American Cyanamid Company ("Cyanamid"), which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of American Home Products Corporation. The Company must maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 2-to-1, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 3-to-1 for the average of the fixed charge coverage ratios for the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended and must not incur more than $150.0 of debt unless the Company's equity is in excess of $200.0. If the Company has more than $200.0 in equity, then it may incur additional debt as long as its ratio of debt-to-equity is not more than 1.5-to-1. At December 31, 2000, the Company had $320.0 of debt and $616.1 of equity as defined in the Series C Stock covenant and under the revised terms, would have the ability to incur up to an additional $604.2 in debt.       On January 22, 1999, the Company signed an agreement with Cyanamid providing that Cyanamid would irrevocably waive certain financial covenants contained in the Series C Stock so that, in addition to restricted payments otherwise permitted under the Series C Stock, the Company may make up to $100.0 in special restricted payments solely for the purpose of repurchasing its common stock. During November 2000 the Company completed the share repurchases under this agreement. The Company repurchased a total of 3,784,254 shares of its outstanding common stock under this agreement. At December 31, 2000, restricted payments permitted under the Series C Stock were limited to $109.9.       At December 31, 2000, the Company's Credit Facility provided for unsecured revolving loans ("Revolving Loans") of up to $200.0. The Revolving Loans are available for the general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, for purposes of making acquisitions permitted under the Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2000, and $103.0 of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 1999. The Credit Facility, which is scheduled to mature on July 28, 2002, contains covenants customary for such facilities. The Company was in compliance with all terms, covenants and conditions of the Credit Facility at December 31, 2000.       On July 14, 2000, the Company terminated a 364-day credit facility, dated August 20, 1999, which provided up to $200.0 in unsecured revolving loans for general corporate purposes. During its term there were no borrowings made under this credit facility.       At December 31, 2000, $10.0 was available for short-term use under an uncommitted credit facility and a U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $14.8 was available under a foreign currency denominated overdraft facility. At December 31, 1999, an aggregate of $35.0 was available for short-term use under three uncommitted credit facilities and a U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $16.0 was available under a foreign currency denominated overdraft facility. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2000 and 1999.       During 1998 the Company sold an aggregate of $320.0 principal amount of senior debt securities in public offerings, consisting of (i) $100.0 principal amount of 6.50% Notes due March 15, 2003, (ii) $100.0 principal amount of 6.75% Notes due March 15, 2008 and (iii) $120.0 principal amount of 6.846% MandatOry Par Put Remarketed SecuritiesSM (MOPPRSSM) due May 11, 2025. The Company received an aggregate of approximately $322.0 in proceeds from the sales before deducting expenses associated with the sales. The proceeds were used primarily to refinance the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Fiberite Inc.       The Company has on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission an effective shelf registration statement covering $400.0 of debt securities, which may be offered by the Company from time to time. Proceeds of any sale will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include replacement of indebtedness and other liabilities, share repurchases, additions to working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. The Company has no immediate plans to offer securities under the registration statement.       At December 31, 2000, the Company was party to four interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $80.0. Two of the swap agreements with maturity dates during 2001 have virtually offsetting terms. Another swap agreement effectively converts $20.0 of variable rate interest obligations to 6.25% fixed rate obligations. The maturity date of this swap agreement is November 1, 2001. The fourth interest rate swap agreement, which effectively converted $25.0 of the Company's 6.75% fixed rate borrowings due on March 15, 2008, to a floating rate, was terminated during January 2001. Under the terms of the termination agreement, the Company received approximately $0.5 in cash. The fair value of the interest swap agreements, which was approximately $(0.2) at December 31, 2000 and $(1.2) at December 31, 1999, is not recognized in the financial statements. Interest rate differentials paid or received under the agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. For                                        -28-   further discussion about the interest rate swap agreements and other financial instruments see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and further discussions in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.       Commencing in September 1997, the Company entered into a series of rate lock agreements to hedge against the risk of an increase in treasury rates related to the Company's offering of $300.0 in long-term debt securities. The Company made payments aggregating approximately $11.2 to settle the rate lock agreements ($9.6 of which was paid during the first half of 1998 and the remainder in 1997), which is being amortized over the life of the 6.50% Notes, 6.75% Notes and 6.846% MOPPRSSM as an increase in interest expense of such Notes. The amount of unamortized rate lock agreements included in long-term debt was $8.4 at December 31, 2000, and $9.4 at December 31, 1999.       The impact of inflation on the Company is considered insignificant since the rate of inflation has remained relatively low in recent years and investments in areas of the world where inflation poses a risk have been significantly hedged to mitigate the effects of inflation.  Item 7A  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk          ---------------------------------------------------------       The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about the Company's potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates and equity price changes. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward-looking analysis.       Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings.       In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to various market risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. To manage the exposure related to these risks, the Company may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with Company-established policies. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Moreover, the Company enters into financial instrument transactions primarily with major financial institutions or highly-rated counterparties, thereby limiting exposure to credit- and performance-related risks.       Foreign Exchange Rate Risk: The risk of adverse exchange rate fluctuations      -------------------------- is mitigated by the fact that there is no concentration of foreign currency exposure. In addition, the Company utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany loans denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the business. The maturity dates of the foreign exchange contracts are less than six months and strongly correlate to the maturity date of the underlying transaction. The foreign exchange gains or losses and the offsetting losses or gains of the hedged transaction are marked to market and reflected in net earnings.       At December 31, 2000, the Company had net foreign exchange contracts to purchase an aggregate of $32.5 of Dutch guilders, German marks and British pounds and to sell an aggregate of $2.6 of French francs and Argentine pesos for U.S. dollars. The Company also had net contracts to sell Dutch guilders with a value equivalent to $22.2 for British pounds, contracts to purchase Dutch guilders with a value equivalent to $0.5 for other currencies, contracts to purchase Norwegian krone with a value equivalent to $2.6 for other European currencies and contracts to sell euros with a value equivalent to $1.4 for British pounds. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts, based on exchange rates at December 31, 2000, exceeded contract values by approximately $0.6. Assuming that year-end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical 10%, the change in the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year-end would be a decrease of approximately $3.7. However, since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged.       Commodity Price Risk: The Company selectively utilizes natural gas      -------------------- derivative contracts, including forward contracts, which are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity and other hedging arrangements (predominantly cash-settled swap transactions) to manage its exposure to price risk associated with the production of ammonia and other building block chemical products. The maturity of these contracts correlates highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and has the effect of securing predetermined prices that the Company pays for the underlying commodity. While these contracts are structured to limit the Company's exposure to increases in commodity prices, they also limit the potential benefit the Company might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices. Realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of the contract with amounts paid or received on early termination deferred on the balance sheet until such time. At December 31, 2000, there were no natural gas derivative contracts outstanding.                                        -29-        Interest Rate Risk: At December 31, 2000, the financial liabilities of the      ------------------ Company consisted primarily of fixed rate long-term debt, which had a carrying value of $311.2 and a fair value of approximately $303.1. Additionally, the Company was party to four interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $80.0. Two of the swap agreements have virtually offsetting terms. Another swap agreement effectively converts $20.0 of variable rate interest obligations to 6.25% fixed rate obligations and has a maturity date of November 1, 2001. The fourth interest rate swap agreement, which effectively converted $25.0 of the Company's 6.75% fixed rate borrowings due on March 15, 2008, to a floating rate, was terminated during January 2001. Assuming other factors are held constant, interest rate changes generally affect the fair value of fixed rate debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows. Conversely, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair value of variable rate debt but do impact the future earnings and cash flows. The net notional value of interest rate swap agreements subject to interest rate risk at December 31, 2000, was $5.0. Assuming a hypothetical increase of 1% in interest rates and all other variables were to remain constant, the net increase in interest expense would be immaterial and the fair market value of the fixed rate long-term debt would decrease $11.3.       Equity Price Risk: In connection with the Company's stock repurchase      ----------------- program, the Company selectively utilizes freestanding put option contracts that are indexed to the Company's stock. In lieu of purchasing the shares from the put option holders, the Company has the right to elect settlement by paying the holders of the put options the excess of the strike price over the then market price of the shares in either cash or additional shares of the Company's common stock (i.e., net cash or net share settlement). The put option contracts are initially measured at fair value and reported in Stockholders' Equity. Subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized in the financial statements. At December 31, 2000, there were no put options outstanding.  OTHER       2001 Outlook: It is expected that increasing raw material prices and      ------------ slowing in parts of the U.S. and Asian economies will negatively impact some parts of the Company's business in 2001, particularly in the first quarter of 2001. As a result, the Company's sales growth and earnings per share growth objectives are not expected to be achieved in 2001. The Company has quantified its earnings expectations for the full year of 2001 to be in a range of $2.60 to $2.70 per diluted share.       In the Water and Industrial Process Chemicals segment, the Company believes that its technology, acquisitions and sales volume increases provide the opportunities to meet its growth goals in 2001. In the Performance Products segment, the Company believes that slowing economic growth will reduce sales to the plastics, automotive and industrial coatings markets. Moreover, the Company believes margins in this segment will also be reduced by the escalation of costs of natural gas and methanol derivatives, key intermediates that are used in the manufacture of many of the Company's Specialty Resins products. The Company believes that these external factors will make it difficult to achieve its 2001 profit growth goals.       In the Specialty Materials segment, the Company believes it will continue to see solid growth in demand from its military, commuter and business jet customers. There is also increasing demand for large commercial aircraft. In 2001 this segment may surpass the Company's goals for sales and profit growth. In the Building Block Chemicals segment, the Company believes that it will be significantly impacted by the rapid increase in raw material and energy costs, particularly of natural gas in the United States. A combination of slowing demand and increased competitive supply of the commodities produced by this segment has not supported adequate price increases to recover the cost increases. It is likely that this segment will generate a moderate operating loss in 2001.       Large increases in raw material costs and operational problems together with a major softening of end-market demand have led to a dramatic worsening of the financial condition of AC Molding Compounds. Due to operating losses, the Company's net investment in Ac Moldings is now valued at zero, and the Company is no longer recognizing its share of the losses of the joint venture. The Company and its joint venture partner have indicated an unwillingness to invest further in AC Molding Compounds. During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a provision of $4.8 against receivables due from the AC Molding Compounds joint venture. The Company continues to aggressively explore its strategic options for this joint venture with its partner.       LaRoche Industries Inc. and LaRoche Fortier Inc., the Company's partner in Avondale Ammonia Company, filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 during May 2000. Although LaRoche Fortier Inc. "rejected" the Avondale Ammonia Company partnership agreement and related ammonia supply agreement effective September 1, 2000, it retains a 50% interest in the assets of the partnership. The manufacturing facility was idled in December 2000 and January 2001 due to excessively high natural gas costs. The facility was restarted in February 2001. When the facility is operating the Company acts as an agent and purchases from Avondale Ammonia Company 100% of the plant's output for external needs and sales to third parties. In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a provision of $1.4 ($0.9 after-tax, or $0.02 per diluted share) against receivables due from the Avondale Ammonia Company. See "Building Block Chemicals Segment - Other Building Block Chemicals" in Item 1.                                        -30-        Euroconversion: On January 1, 19999, 11 of the 15 member countries of the      -------------- European Union (the "participating countries") established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies (the "legacy currencies") and the euro. The participating countries adopted the euro as their common legal currency on that date. Effective January 1, 1999, a newly created European Central Bank assumed control of monetary policy, including money supply and interest rates for the participating countries. The legacy currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender in the participating countries as denominations of the euro between January 1, 1999, and January 1, 2002 (the "transition period"). During the transition period, public and private parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or the participating country's legacy currency on a "no compulsion, no prohibition" basis. The Company's principal plants in Europe are in The Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Norway, and the Company has sales offices and generates sales throughout Europe,. The Netherlands is a participating country, whereas the United Kingdom and Norway are not currently participating countries.       The Company does not believe that the introduction of the euro notes and coins as well as the withdrawal of participating currency notes and coins, which is scheduled to begin January 1, 2002, will result in any gains or losses since conversion rates to the euro for participating countries were irrevocably fixed as of January 1, 1999. The Company believes that some information systems modifications are required by the end of the transition period in order for them to be euro compliant. The Company's current estimate is that it will incur system modification costs of approximately $0.3 and that the modifications will be completed by the end of 2001. The Company does not currently believe that the euro conversion will have a material operational impact.                                        -31-   Item 8.
