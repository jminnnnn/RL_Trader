Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS          OF OPERATIONS            The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Dollars are in millions, except per share amounts.  GENERAL           During 2001 the Company completed the following acquisition transactions:           On August 31, 2001, the Company acquired certain assets of the carbon fiber business of BP plc ("BP"). The BP carbon fiber business had sales for the first half of 2001 of approximately $17 of which approximately 50% were sales to Cytec Engineered Materials ("CEM"), formerly known as Cytec Fiberite. CEM uses carbon fiber to reinforce engineered resin matrices and produce composites for a diverse range of commercial and military aerospace applications and other emerging applications. The acquisition enhances CEM's ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply of certain classes of carbon fiber. The acquisition, which includes manufacturing sites in Greenville and Rock Hill, SC, is reported as part of the Company's Specialty Materials segment.           In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations," after reducing to zero the amounts that would otherwise have been assigned to certain assets acquired, the remaining "negative goodwill" was recognized as an extraordinary gain of $4.9, net of taxes, which related to the fair value of the inventories acquired less liabilities assumed. Taxes recorded related to the extraordinary gain were $2.6.           On March 30, 2001, the Company acquired the composite materials business of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company ("3M") for cash consideration of $8.2. The acquisition resulted in goodwill of $3.5, which the Company has been amortizing on a straight-line basis over a period of 25 years. The acquired business has been integrated into the Company's Specialty Materials segment.           On March 27, 2001, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in the assets of the Avondale Ammonia Company manufacturing joint venture effective as of September 1, 2000, from the Company's partner, LaRoche Industries Inc. ("LaRoche"). The Company paid cash consideration of $0.8 and released certain claims against LaRoche relating to LaRoche's rejection of the partnership agreements. No goodwill was recognized as a result of this transaction. In the second quarter of 2001, the ammonia manufacturing facility was indefinitely mothballed.           During 2000 the Company completed the following disposition transactions:           On November 1, 2000, the Company completed the sale of its paper chemicals sizing and strength business to Bayer Corporation and the direct sales portion of its retention and drainage aids and fixative products business to Ciba Specialty Chemicals Water Treatments, Inc. The Company also agreed to produce paper chemicals for Bayer Corporation under a five year manufacturing agreement to which the Company allocated proceeds of $11.2, which were recorded as deferred revenue. This deferred revenue will be recognized over the term of the manufacturing agreement. The Company received net cash proceeds of $115.5 in connection with these transactions and recorded in other income, net, a pre-tax gain of $88.3. Included in the sale were the sales, marketing, research and development and technical services personnel and the dedicated field and laboratory equipment associated with the respective businesses. The Company retained approximately $18.1 of paper chemicals' accounts receivable and all of its Water and Industrial Process Chemicals production facilities. Paper Chemicals net sales were $97.9 and $106.4 in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Taxes of approximately $26.6 were paid in 2001 related to this divestiture.           On July 10, 2000, the Company completed the sale of two subsidiaries, which owned its 50% interest in Criterion Catalyst Company LP ("Criterion"), to its joint venture partner CRI International, Inc., a company of the Royal Dutch Shell Group, for cash consideration of $63.0. The consideration received approximated the carrying value of the Company's investment, which was included in investment in associated companies. The sale resulted in taxes paid of approximately $7.5.           During 1999 the Company completed the following acquisition and disposition transactions:           On October 29, 1999, the Company acquired the amino coatings resins business of BIP Limited (the "BIP business") for approximately $37.2 in cash plus future consideration with a value equivalent to approximately $8.3. The acquisition resulted in goodwill of $36.7, which the Company has been amortizing on a straight-line basis over a period of 40 years. The acquired business has been integrated into the Company's Performance Products segment. BIP retained its manufacturing plant in Oldbury, United Kingdom, where it will continue to manufacture certain amino coatings resins for Cytec under a long-term agreement.           On September 16, 1999, the Company acquired Inspec Mining Chemicals S.A. ("IMC") from Laporte plc for $25.1, net of $0.8 cash received. The acquisition resulted in goodwill of $20.1, which the Company has been amortizing on a straight-line basis over a period of 40 years. The acquisition, which included two manufacturing operations and a research and development center located in Chile, has been integrated into the Company's Water and Industrial Process Chemicals segment.                                         -14-            On August 11, 1999, the Company acquired assets of the global phosphine fumigants product line from BOC Group Inc. for $3.5 plus two additional payments aggregating $1.0, which were paid during 2000 upon approval of certain fumigant registrations by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The acquisition resulted in goodwill of $2.2, which the Company has been amortizing on a straight-line basis over a period of 20 years from the original date of acquisition. The terms of the acquisition also provide for additional consideration to be paid if the acquired product line's net sales exceed certain targeted levels, which has not yet occurred. All additional payments are payable in cash and will be recorded as additional goodwill when the contingencies for such payment have been met. The acquired business has been integrated into the Company's Water and Industrial Process Chemicals segment.           On January 25, 1999, the Company acquired assets of the Nottingham Company's industrial minerals product line for $4.0. The acquisition resulted in goodwill of $0.3, which the Company has been amortizing on a straight-line basis over a period of 40 years. The acquired business has been integrated into the Company's Water and Industrial Process Chemicals segment.           On January 21, 1999, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of its engineered molding compounds business, excluding land, buildings and one product line, to Rogers Corporation of Manchester, Connecticut, for $4.3.           All acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting with the purchase prices allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The results of operations for the acquired businesses are included from the dates of acquisition in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts recorded as excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired (i.e., goodwill) are included in Acquisition Intangibles in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Consolidated results of operations for the years ended 2001, 2000 or 1999 would not have been materially different if any of the acquisitions had occurred on January 1 of the respective preceding years. Accordingly, pro forma sales, net earnings and earnings per share disclosures have not been provided.           In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 143, "Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143 addresses the accounting and reporting requirements for legally unavoidable obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. In general, SFAS 143 requires entities to capitalize asset retirement costs of related long-lived assets in the period in which they meet the definition of a liability and to allocate those costs to expense using a systematic and rational method. SFAS 143 will become effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2003. The Company is reviewing the potential impact of SFAS 143 on its consolidated results of operations and financial position, which is expected to be immaterial.           In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141") and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). SFAS 141 requires business combinations consummated after June 30, 2001, to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. It also specifies the criteria that intangible assets must meet to be recognized apart from goodwill. SFAS 142 requires the use of a non-amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives. Under this approach, goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are reviewed for impairments at least annually and written down only in the periods in which it is determined that the recorded value is greater than the fair value. SFAS 142 also requires that intangible assets with determinable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." SFAS 142 will become effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2002. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before July 1, 2001, have been amortized through December 31, 2001, in accordance with the appropriate pre-SFAS 141 and 142 accounting literature.           The Company has evaluated its goodwill and intangible assets using the new criteria in SFAS 141, and as a result, certain intangibles that no longer met the criteria for recognition apart from goodwill were reclassified as goodwill effective January 1, 2002. The Company has also re-evaluated the remaining useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets with determinable useful lives and has made all necessary amortization period adjustments effective January 1, 2002.                                         -15-            The Company's acquisition intangibles, net of accumulated amortization, before and after such reclassifications were as follows:  - ----------------------------------------------------------------                                Goodwill    Intangibles     Total - ---------------------------------------------------------------- Before reclassifications: Water and Industrial    Process Chemicals            $ 31.3        $ 3.8       $ 35.1 Performance Products              49.1         26.7         75.8 Specialty Materials              250.2         15.0        265.2 Building Block Chemicals           -            -            - - ---------------------------------------------------------------- Total                           $330.6        $45.5       $376.1 - ---------------------------------------------------------------- After reclassifications: Water and Industrial    Process Chemicals            $ 31.1        $ 4.0       $ 35.1 Performance Products              50.1         25.7         75.8 Specialty Materials              252.6         12.6        265.2 Building Block Chemicals           -            -            - - ---------------------------------------------------------------- Total                           $333.8        $42.3       $376.1 - ----------------------------------------------------------------           In connection with the transitional goodwill impairment test, SFAS 142 requires the Company to assess whether there is any indication that goodwill is impaired as of January 1, 2002. To accomplish this, the Company has defined its business segments as its SFAS 142 reporting units and has determined the carrying value of those reporting units as of January 1, 2002. The Company has until June 30, 2002, to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit's carrying value. If a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired, and the Company must then perform the second step of the transitional impairment test. In the second step, the Company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, to its carrying value. This second step, if required, must be completed by December 31, 2002, and any transitional impairment loss will be measured as of January 1, 2002, and recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle. Although further evaluation is still needed to complete the transitional goodwill impairment test provisions of SFAS 142, the Company does not currently believe that adoption of the new standards will result in a material charge to earnings.           Overall, these new standards will have the impact of reducing amortization expense. However, future annual impairment reviews may result in future write-downs. Amortization expense related to goodwill and intangible assets, which was $12.8, $12.4 and $11.2 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, is expected to be approximately $3.1 for the year ending December 31, 2002, based on intangible assets existing at January 1, 2002, with the segment breakdown as follows: Water and Industrial Process Chemicals, $0.4; Performance Products, $1.6 and Specialty Materials, $1.1. The change in amortization expense related to the adjustment of remaining useful lives and residual values was immaterial.           On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). In general under SFAS 133, as amended, all derivative instruments must be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. SFAS 133 also establishes accounting standards for reporting changes in the fair value of derivative instruments. If a derivative is deemed to be an effective hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative will be either offset against changes in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized on an after-tax basis in accumulated other comprehensive income within the equity section of the balance sheet until such time that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting as well as the ineffective portion of hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. Under certain exceptions, SFAS 133 permits derivative instruments to be accounted for as executory contracts because physical delivery of the underlying commodity is probable. In those circumstances, SFAS 133 does not require derivative instruments to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. See Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the impact of SFAS 133 on the Company's derivative accounting policies.           The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has issued a proposed Statement of Position ("SOP"), "Accounting for Certain Costs and Activities Related to Property, Plant and Equipment." If enacted, this SOP would, among other things, require the Company to change its method of depreciation.           The Company primarily utilizes the composite method of depreciation in the United States and Canada, applied on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of various classes of assets. Under the composite method, depreciation is taken on the class of asset as a whole rather than on an individual asset basis. Depreciation continues until the entire asset class is fully depreciated. Upon disposition or retirement, the cost of such assets plus demolition costs less amounts realized on sale or salvage, is charged or credited to the accumulated depreciation account.           The Company is evaluating the impact of the proposed SOP. If enacted, excluding any cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, it is expected that depreciation expense will decrease as depreciation on individual assets will cease as such assets are fully depreciated. On the other hand, upon disposition or retirement of assets, the net book value of such assets plus demolition costs less amounts realized from sale or salvage, will be charged or credited to earnings.                                         -16-   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS           The following table sets forth the percentage relationship that certain items in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income bear to net sales:  Years ended December 31,        2001         2000         1999 - -------------------------------------------------------------- Net sales                       100.0%      100.0%     100.0% Manufacturing cost    of sales                      77.1        72.3       70.9 Gross profit                     22.9        27.7       29.1 Selling and    technical services             8.3         9.3        8.9 Research and    process development            2.3         2.6        3.0 Administrative and general        3.2         3.2        3.6 Amortization of    acquisition intangibles        0.9         0.8        0.8 - ------------------------------------------------------------ Earnings from operations          8.1        11.8       12.8 - ------------------------------------------------------------ Net earnings                      5.1        11.9        8.4 - ------------------------------------------------------------  NET SALES BY BUSINESS SEGMENT           The Company has four reportable segments: Water and Industrial Process Chemicals, Performance Products, Specialty Materials and Building Block Chemicals.           The Water and Industrial Process Chemicals segment produces water treating, mining and phosphine chemicals that are used mainly in water and wastewater treatment and mineral processing and separation. The segment included the Paper Chemicals business, which was substantially divested on November 1, 2000. The Performance Products segment produces coatings and performance chemicals and polymer additives that are used primarily in coatings, adhesives and plastics applications. The Specialty Materials segment manufactures and sells materials that are used mainly in commercial and military aviation and launch vehicles, satellite and aircraft brakes. The Building Block Chemicals segment manufactures acrylonitrile, acrylamide, hydrocyanic acid, melamine and sulfuric acid. Some of these products are upgraded into specialty chemicals (Water and Industrial Process Chemicals and Performance Products) products with the remainder sold to third parties. Internal usage is not reflected in net sales of Building Block Chemicals.  The Company's net sales by business segment are set forth below.  Years ended December 31,         2001        2000         1999 - -------------------------------------------------------------- Water and Industrial    Process Chemicals(1)       $  335.0    $  403.1    $  387.5 Performance Products             434.7       474.0       449.8 Specialty Materials              450.2       411.6       435.7 Building Block Chemicals         167.2       203.8       171.5 - --------------------------------------------------------------                               $1,387.1    $1,492.5    $1,444.5 - --------------------------------------------------------------  (1) On November 1, 2000, the Company substantially divested its Paper Chemicals business, which had sales of $32.0, $97.9 and $106.4 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.           For more information on the Company's segments, see Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and further discussions in the Segment Results section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000           Net sales for 2001 were $1,387.1, compared with $1,492.5 for 2000. The decrease was due to sales decreases in the Water and Industrial Process Chemicals, Performance Products and Building Block Chemicals segments of $68.1, $39.3 and $36.6, respectively, that were partially offset by a sales increase in the Specialty Materials segment of $38.6. Excluding the effects of the November 1, 2000, Paper Chemicals business divestiture, sales in the Water and Industrial Process Chemicals segment decreased $2.2.           Net sales in the United States were $736.9 for 2001, compared with $798.8 for 2000. International net sales were $650.2 for 2001, or 46.9% of total net sales, compared with $693.7, or 46.5% of total net sales, for 2000.                                         -17-            In the North America region (i.e., United States and Canada), net sales were approximately $796.9 for 2001, down 8.0% from the prior year. Overall, selling volumes decreased 4.8% in the region, excluding a 4.2% volume decrease resulting from the divestiture of the Paper Chemicals business. Selling volumes in Water and Industrial Process Chemicals decreased 1.9%, excluding an 18.7% volume decrease resulting from the divestiture of the Paper Chemicals business, Performance Products decreased 14.0%, Specialty Materials increased 10.6% and Building Block Chemicals decreased 27.7%. Overall, selling prices increased 1.3% in the region with the segment breakdown as follows: Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 0.1%, Performance Products increased 2.1%, Specialty Materials increased 0.4% and Building Block Chemicals increased 3.7%. For the region overall, the adverse effect of exchange rate changes reduced sales approximately 0.3%.           In the Europe/Mideast/Africa region, net sales were $328.5 for 2001, down 2.4% from the prior year. Overall, selling volumes increased 1.6% in the region, excluding a 3.4% decrease resulting from the divestiture of the Paper Chemicals business. Selling volumes in Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 4.8%, excluding a 12.1% volume decrease resulting from the divestiture of the Paper Chemicals business, Performance Products decreased 5.1%, Specialty Materials increased 6.5% and Building Block Chemicals decreased 1.3%. Overall, selling prices increased 1.0% in the region with the segment breakdown as follows: Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 0.8%, Performance Products increased 3.6%, Specialty Materials was flat and Building Block Chemicals decreased 4.4%. For the region overall, the adverse effect of exchange rate changes reduced sales approximately 1.6%.           In the Asia/Pacific region, net sales were $170.7 for 2001, down 11.7% from the prior year. Overall, selling volumes increased 1.1% in the region, excluding a 5.6% decrease resulting from the divestiture of the Paper Chemicals business. Selling volumes in Water and Industrial Process Chemicals decreased 4.9%, excluding a 21.5% volume decrease resulting from the divestiture of the Paper Chemicals business. Performance Products decreased 1.5%, Specialty Materials increased 4.5% and Building Block Chemicals increased 8.3%. Overall, selling prices decreased 4.6% in the region with the segment breakdown as follows: Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 3.0%, Performance Products increased 1.6%, Specialty Materials was flat and Building Block Chemicals decreased 19.7%. For the region overall, the adverse effect of exchange rate changes reduced sales approximately 2.6%.           In the Latin America region, net sales were $91.0 for 2001, down 5.8% from the prior year. Overall, selling volumes increased 3.0% in the region, excluding a 7.5% decrease resulting from the divestiture of the Paper Chemicals business. Selling volumes in Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 4.0%, excluding an 11.4% volume decrease resulting from the divestiture of the Paper Chemicals business and Performance Products increased 1.4%. Sales in the Specialty Materials and Building Block Chemicals segments are relatively small in this region, hence comparisons are not meaningful. Overall, selling prices increased 4.3% in the region with the segment breakdown as follows: Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 4.3% and Performance Products increased 8.1%. For the region overall, the adverse effect of exchange rate changes reduced sales approximately 5.6%.           Manufacturing cost of sales was $1,068.8, or 77.1% of net sales, for 2001 and included a restructuring charge of $4.6 related to the mothballing of the Fortier ammonia plant and the Company's share of the related personnel reduction at the Fortier facility. Excluding these charges, manufacturing cost of sales was $1,064.2, or 76.7% of net sales, for 2001. Manufacturing cost of sales was $1,078.7, or 72.3% of net sales, for 2000 and included net restructuring charges of $3.3 and a charge of $1.4 against receivables due the Company from its 50%-owned ammonia joint venture. Excluding these charges, manufacturing cost of sales was $1,074.0, or 72.0% of net sales, for 2000. Manufacturing costs as a percentage of sales increased primarily due to lower production levels resulting from weaker demand in the Performance Products and Building Block Chemicals segments, the net adverse effects of exchange rate changes and higher raw material prices, particularly in the first quarter, partially offset by the benefits from higher selling prices.           Selling and technical services expenses decreased $22.9, research and process development expenses decreased $6.2 and administrative and general expenses decreased $2.9 primarily as a result of the divestiture of the Paper Chemicals business and the Company's continuing cost control efforts. Amortization of acquisition intangibles increased $0.4 due to the additional amortization expense resulting from the acquisition of the composite materials business of 3M on March 30, 2001. Included in selling and technical services expenses for 2001 was a restructuring charge of $0.8 related to the Company's share of the personnel reductions at the Fortier facility. Excluding this charge, selling and technical services expenses were $114.8 for 2001. Included in selling and technical service expenses for 2000 was a net restructuring charge of $5.4 primarily related to a workforce reduction and the discontinuance of a tolling operation. Excluding this charge, selling and technical services expenses were $133.1 for 2000. Excluding these items from both years, selling and technical service expenses decreased $18.3 year over year.           Other income, net, was $7.9 for 2001 and included gains of $7.0 related to the sale of reclaimed land in Florida and the favorable settlement of a royalty issue concerning mineral rights associated with a former phosphate rock mining joint venture also in Florida. Other income, net, was $104.6 for 2000 and included a gain of $88.3 from the divestiture of the Paper Chemicals business, a gain of $13.3, discounted and net of expenses, from an insurance settlement with a group of insurance carriers for an environmental remediation coverage suit and a charge of $4.8 for the write-down of receivables due from the AC Moldings Compounds joint venture. Excluding these items, other income, net, was $7.8 for 2000 and included a gain of $7.1 from the sale of real estate.                                         -18-            Equity in earnings of associated companies was $0.1 for 2001 and included a charge of $2.3 for the Company's 50% share of the CYRO Industries restructuring charges, which included $3.7 related to the shutdown of CYRO's manufacturing facility in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, and $0.8 related to CYRO's share of the infrastructure restructuring at the Company's Fortier facility. Excluding this charge, equity in earnings of associated companies was $2.4 for 2001, down $12.6 from 2000. The decrease was due to lower sales at associated companies, primarily CYRO, and the fact that 2000 included earnings of $4.2 from the Criterion Catalyst joint venture, which was divested on July 10, 2000. Associated company sales were $306.9 in 2001, compared with $496.3 in 2000. Excluding sales of the divested Criterion Catalyst joint venture, 2001 sales of associated companies decreased 15.0% from 2000. Sales at CYRO Industries, which sells acrylic sheet and molding compounds across a broad range of industrial markets, primarily in North America, where demand has been weak as a result of the soft economy, decreased 13.9%, primarily due to lower selling volumes resulting from weaker demand. For 2001, CYRO Industries posted a small loss due to the restructuring charges previously mentioned. Excluding the restructuring charges, CYRO Industries' 2001 earnings decreased 73.4% from 2000. However, earnings in the second half of 2001 improved relative to the first half of 2001 as the restructuring benefits began to be realized. For further information about the Company's associated companies, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.           Interest expense, net, was $19.6 for 2001, a decrease of $5.5 from 2000. The decrease reflects the lower outstanding debt levels during 2001.           The income tax provision was $34.9 for 2001 and $93.5 for 2000, which reflects an underlying effective tax rate of 34.5% for both years.           Earnings before extraordinary item were $66.2, or $1.59 per diluted share, for 2001, compared with $177.6, or $4.15 per diluted share, for 2000. Included in 2001 was $7.7 ($5.0 after-tax, or $0.12 per diluted share) from restructuring charges. Excluding these charges, adjusted earnings before extraordinary item for 2001 were $71.2, or $1.71 per diluted share. Included in 2000 was a gain of $88.3 ($57.8 after-tax, or $1.35 per diluted share) from the divestiture of the Paper Chemicals business and a gain of $13.3 ($8.7 after-tax, or $0.20 per diluted share) from an insurance settlement with a group of insurance carriers for an environmental remediation coverage suit. Also included in 2000 were charges of $11.5 ($7.5 after-tax, or $0.18 per diluted share) from net restructuring and other charges and a charge of $4.8 ($3.1 after-tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) for the write-down of receivables due from the AC Moldings Compounds joint venture. Excluding these items, adjusted earnings before extraordinary item for 2000 were $121.7, or $2.85 per diluted share. The adjusted year-over-year decline in earnings before extraordinary item of $50.5, or $1.14 per diluted share, was primarily due to lower sales volumes in the Performance Products and Building Block Chemicals segments, the adverse effects of unfavorable exchange rate changes and higher raw material prices, particularly in the first quarter. This was partially offset by increased sales volumes in the Specialty Materials segment, the benefits from higher selling prices in the Specialty Chemical segments (i.e., Water and Industrial Process Chemicals and Performance Products) and the favorable effect of the Company's stock repurchase program.           During 2001, the Company recognized an extraordinary gain, net of taxes, of $4.9, or $0.12 per diluted share, related to its August 31, 2001, acquisition of the BP carbon fibers business. Taxes recorded on the transaction were $2.6. For further information, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  SEGMENT RESULTS           WATER AND INDUSTRIAL PROCESS CHEMICALS: Water and Industrial Process Chemicals net sales were $335.0 in 2001, which, excluding a 16.4% decrease due to the Paper Chemicals divestiture, was a decrease of 0.5% from 2000. Selling volumes increased approximately 0.2%, excluding a 16.4% decrease related to the divestiture of the Paper Chemicals business. The adverse effects of exchange rate changes reduced sales 2.0%, while selling prices favorably affected sales 1.3%. Overall, sales in water treatment and phosphine chemicals grew, primarily due to increased selling volumes that partially offset the sales declines in mining chemicals.           Earnings from operations were $25.7, or 7.7% of net sales, in 2001, compared with $40.2, or 10.0% of net sales, in 2000. The decrease in earnings from operations was primarily the result of lower selling volumes, higher raw material costs and the net adverse effects of exchange rate changes, slightly offset by the benefits from higher selling prices and lower operating costs.           PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS: Performance Products net sales were $434.7 in 2001, a decrease of 8.3% from 2000. The effects of weak economies around the world impacted demand from the broad base of industrial markets (e.g., automotive, industrial and plastic markets) served by the Performance Products segment. As a result, selling volumes, particularly in the North America region, were down significantly. For the segment overall, selling volumes decreased 9.3%, and the adverse effects of exchange rate changes decreased sales approximately 1.7%, while increased selling prices favorably affected sales 2.7%.           Earnings from operations were $16.3, or 3.7% of net sales, in 2001, compared with $56.8, or 12.0% of net sales, in 2000. The decrease in earnings from operations reflects the impact of reduced sales and production levels resulting from weak demand, higher raw material costs and the net adverse effects of exchange rate changes, partially offset by the benefits from higher selling prices.                                         -19-            SPECIALTY MATERIALS: Specialty Materials net sales were $450.2 in 2001, an increase of 9.4% from 2000. Selling volumes increased 9.5%, of which approximately 2.2% were from sales generated as a result of the March 30, 2001, acquisition of the 3M composite materials business and the August 31, 2001, acquisition of the BP carbon fibers business (for further information on these acquisitions, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and further discussions contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis). The remaining increase in selling volumes was attributable to strong demand in aerospace applications (i.e., large commercial aircraft, regional jets and military aircraft). Selling prices increased 0.3%, while the adverse effects of exchange rate changes decreased sales 0.4%.           Earnings from operations were $95.9, or 21.3% of net sales, in 2001, compared with $85.9, or 20.9% of net sales, in 2000. The increase in earnings from operations reflects the increase in selling volumes and lower fixed costs per unit, which resulted from leveraging the segments manufacturing operations.           BUILDING BLOCK CHEMICALS: Building Block Chemicals were impacted by poor demand, particularly for acrylonitrile, and narrowing profit margins. As a result, net sales to external customers were $167.2 in 2001, a decrease of 18.0% from 2000. For the segment overall, selling volumes decreased 13.0%, selling prices decreased 4.7% and the adverse effects of exchange rate changes decreased sales 0.3%. Acrylonitrile accounted for the majority of the decline in selling volumes and price.           Losses from operations were $18.7 in 2001, compared with earnings from operations of $12.7 in 2000. Earnings (losses) from operations were negatively impacted by reduced production volumes in response to lower demand, lower selling prices, the adverse effect of exchange rate changes and reduced acrylonitrile margin spreads as declines in selling prices more than offset decreases in overall raw material costs.           In the second quarter of 2001, the Company announced a restructuring at its Fortier facility, which included the indefinite mothballing of its ammonia manufacturing facility. For further information on this restructuring charge, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and further discussions contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.           On March 27, 2001, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in the assets of the ammonia manufacturing joint venture, effective as of September 1, 2000, from the Company's partner, LaRoche Industries Inc. For further information on this acquisition, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and further discussions contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999           Net sales for 2000 were $1,492.5, compared with $1,444.5 for 1999. The increase was primarily due to sales increases in the Water and Industrial Process Chemicals, Performance Products and Building Block Chemicals segments of $15.6, $24.2 and $32.3, respectively. This increase was partially offset by a sales decrease in the Specialty Materials segment of $24.1. For further information, see Segment Results discussion below.           Net sales in the United States were $798.8 for 2000, compared with $816.0 for 1999. International net sales were $693.7 for 2000, or 46.5% of total net sales, compared with $628.5, or 43.5% of total net sales, for 1999.           In the North America region (i.e., United States and Canada), net sales were $866.0 for 2000, down 1.7% from the prior year. Overall, selling volumes decreased 3.4%. Selling volumes in Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 1.2%, Performance Products increased 2.3%, Specialty Materials decreased 8.3% and Building Block Chemicals decreased 11.6%. Overall, selling prices increased 2.0% with the segment breakdown as follows: Water and Industrial Process Chemicals decreased 0.7%, Performance Products decreased 0.8%, Specialty Materials increased 0.1% and Building Block Chemicals increased 21.0%. For the region overall, the adverse effect of exchange rate changes reduced sales about 0.3%.           In the Europe/Mideast/Africa region, net sales were $336.5 for 2000, up 0.7% from the prior year. Overall, selling volumes increased 8.1%. Selling volumes in Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 7.1%, Performance Products increased 16.4%, Specialty Materials increased 4.1% and Building Block Chemicals decreased 2.8%. Overall, selling prices decreased 0.5% with the segment breakdown as follows: Water and Industrial Process Chemicals decreased 5.9%, Performance Products increased 0.4%, Specialty Materials were flat and Building Block Chemicals increased 12.0%. For the region overall, the adverse effect of exchange rate changes reduced sales approximately 6.9%.           In the Asia/Pacific region, net sales were $193.4 for 2000, up 26.5% from the prior year. Overall, selling volumes increased 13.4%. Selling volumes in Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 15.4%, Performance Products increased 20.6%, Specialty Materials increased 4.8% and Building Block Chemicals increased 3.5%. Overall, selling prices increased 13.4% with the segment breakdown as follows: Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 1.5%, Performance Products decreased 0.6%, Specialty Materials were flat and Building Block Chemicals increased 54.8%. For the region overall, the adverse effect of exchange rate changes reduced sales approximately 0.3%.           In the Latin America region, net sales were $96.6 for 2000, up 26.4% from the prior year. Overall, selling volumes increased 26.9%. Selling volumes in Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 28.5%, and Performance Products increased 17.3%. Sales in the Specialty Materials and Building Block Chemicals segments are relatively small in this region, hence comparisons are not meaningful. Overall, selling prices increased 2.4%. Water and Industrial Process Chemicals increased 3.0%, and Performance Products increased 1.7%. For the region overall, the adverse effect of exchange rate changes reduced sales approximately 2.9%.                                         -20-            Manufacturing cost of sales was $1,078.7 for 2000 and included net restructuring charges of $3.3 and a charge of $1.4 against receivables due the Company from its 50%-owned ammonia joint venture. Excluding these charges, manufacturing cost of sales was 72.0% of net sales for 2000. Manufacturing cost of sales was $1,023.6 for 1999 and included a net restructuring credit of $1.5. Excluding this credit, manufacturing cost of sales was 71.0% of net sales for 1999. Excluding these special items, manufacturing cost of sales as a percentage of sales was up in 2000 when compared with the prior year. The combined results of adverse exchange rate changes and higher raw material costs offset the benefits from higher selling volumes, increased selling prices and the Company's manufacturing rationalization and productivity initiative programs.           Selling and technical service expenses were $138.5 for 2000 and included a net restructuring charge of $5.4. Selling and technical service expenses were $129.2 for 1999 and included a restructuring charge of $0.3. Excluding these special items, selling and technical service expenses increased $4.2. This increase is attributable to the Performance Products segment and reflects costs from the Company's acquisition of the BIP business in 1999.           Research and process development expenses were $38.6 for 2000 and included a net restructuring charge of $1.1. Research and process development expenses were $43.8 for 1999 and included a restructuring charge of $1.7. Excluding these special items, research and process development expenses decreased $4.6, which was due primarily to lower patent costs that tend to fluctuate depending on activity and reduced research expenses in the Performance Products segment.           Administrative and general expenses were $47.7 for 2000 and included a net restructuring charge of $0.3. Administrative and general expenses were $51.7 for 1999 and included a charge of $2.5 for external costs associated with tax planning and a net restructuring charge of $0.1. Excluding these special items, administrative and general expenses decreased $1.5, which reflects the benefits of the Company's efforts to contain costs in this area.           Amortization of acquisition intangibles was $12.4 for 2000, an increase of $1.2 from the prior year. The increase was due to the additional intangibles resulting from the acquisitions of the BOC Gases' global phosphines fumigant product line in August 1999, IMC in September 1999 and the BIP Business in October 1999.           Other income, net, was $104.6 for 2000 and included several special items. Those special items were a gain of $88.3 from the sale of the Paper Chemicals business, a gain of $13.3, discounted and net of expenses, received from insurance settlement agreements entered into with a group of insurance carriers in an environmental coverage suit and a provision of $4.8 against receivables due from the AC Moldings Compounds joint venture. Excluding these special items, other income, net, was $7.8 and included a gain of $7.1 from the sale of real estate. Other income, net, was $9.3 for 1999 and included gains of $4.5 from the sale of real estate, $2.2 from royalty income and $1.6 from the sale of certain product lines.           Equity in earnings of associated companies was $15.0 for 2000, an increase of $9.4 from the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the operational improvements at Criterion, relative to its losses in 1999. The Company's interest in Criterion was sold on July 10, 2000. CYRO Industries sales were up about 10.0%, but earnings were relatively flat due to higher raw material costs, principally acetone and methanol. CYRO Industries also experienced weak demand in December 2000.           Interest expense, net, was $25.1 for 2000, a decrease of $1.8 from the prior year period. The decrease reflects the lower outstanding debt levels during 2000.           The income tax provision was $93.5 for 2000, which reflects an underlying effective tax rate of 34.5%. The income tax provision was $51.7 for 1999 and included a credit of $8.0 related to the utilization of prior years' tax credits. Excluding the impact of this item, the underlying effective tax rate for 1999 was 34.5%.           Net earnings for 2000 were $177.6, or $4.15 per diluted share. Special items included in 2000 were a gain of $88.3 ($57.8 after-tax, or $1.35 per diluted share) from the sale of the Paper Chemicals business and a gain of $13.3 ($8.7 after-tax, or $0.20 per diluted share) from the environmental remediation insurance settlements. Also included in 2000 were charges of $11.5 ($7.5 after-tax, or $0.18 per diluted share) from net restructuring and other charges and a $4.8 ($3.1 after-tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) provision against receivables due from the AC Moldings Compounds joint venture. Excluding these special items, net earnings for 2000 were $121.7, or $2.85 per diluted share. Net earnings for 1999 were $121.3, or $2.73 per diluted share. Included in 1999 was a credit of $8.0, or $0.18 per diluted share, related to the reduction in income tax expense from the utilization of prior years' tax credits, which is partially offset by a charge of $2.5 ($1.6 after-tax, or $0.04 per diluted share) for tax planning expenses. Also included in 1999 was a charge of $0.6 ($0.4 after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) related to the net effect of restructuring activities. Excluding these special items, net earnings for 1999 were $115.4, or $2.60 per diluted share. Excluding these special items for both years, the period-over-period earnings per diluted share growth was 9.6%. Earnings per diluted share were also favorably impacted by the Company's stock repurchase program.                                         -21-   SEGMENT RESULTS           WATER AND INDUSTRIAL PROCESS CHEMICALS: Water and Industrial Process Chemicals sales increased 4.0% to $403.1, and earnings from operations decreased 7.6% to $40.2. For the overall segment, selling volumes increased 7.8%. This includes a 3.5% volume increase due to the acquisition of IMC in September of 1999 and a 3.5% volume decrease due to the divestiture of the Paper Chemicals business on November 1, 2000. The increase in selling volumes was partially offset by the adverse effects of exchange rate changes and lower selling prices, which reduced sales approximately 2.5% and 1.3%, respectively. The lower earnings from operations were primarily the result of higher raw material costs of petroleum derivatives, such as propylene, net unfavorable exchange rate changes, particularly in Europe, and lower selling prices which more than offset the benefits from higher selling volumes and lower operating costs.           PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS: Performance Products sales increased 5.4% to $474.0, and earnings from operations increased 10.1% to $56.8. For the overall segment, selling volumes increased 8.6%, which includes a 3.4% volume increase due to the acquisition of the BIP Business in October of 1999. The higher selling volumes were partially offset by the adverse effects of exchange rate changes, which reduced sales by about 2.8% and lower selling prices, which were down about 0.4%. The segment serves a broad range of end markets, and during the fourth quarter of 2000, demand in these markets began to reflect the slowing in the U.S. and Asian economies. The improved earnings from operations were primarily the result of higher selling volumes, increased manufacturing productivity and certain licensing fees, partially offset by higher raw material costs, lower selling prices and the net unfavorable exchange rate changes.           SPECIALTY MATERIALS: Specialty Materials sales decreased 5.5% to $411.6, while earnings from operations increased 1.2% to $85.9. Selling volumes decreased 3.2% primarily due to lower Boeing commercial aircraft build rates and Boeing's transition from carbon to glass fiber composites for certain aircraft interiors. The divestiture of the engineered molding compounds product line and the adverse effects of exchange rate changes reduced sales another 1.8% and 0.6%, respectively. Selling prices were up about 0.1%. During the fourth quarter of 2000, demand from the large commercial airliner market began to improve. The growth in earnings from operations was primarily the result of lower raw material costs and the benefits of the Company's manufacturing rationalization programs.           BUILDING BLOCK CHEMICALS: Building Block Chemicals sales to external customers were $203.8, an increase of 18.8% from the previous year, and earnings from operations were $12.7, an increase of 108.2% from the prior year. For the overall segment, selling prices increased 26.1% and selling volumes decreased 1.6%, excluding a 3.3% volume decrease due to the divestiture of the methanol plant in December of 1999. The adverse effects of exchange rate changes reduced sales another 2.4%. Sales were favorably impacted by a sharp increase in acrylonitrile and acrylamide selling prices, although higher propylene and natural gas costs more than offset the selling price increases. Earnings from operations were favorably impacted by two major factors. First, improved plant operations led to significantly higher production volumes of acrylonitrile, thereby reducing manufacturing cost per unit. This in turn improved the overall gross profit of the segment. The second factor was reduced plant spending.  LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION           At December 31, 2001, the Company's cash balance was $83.6, an increase of $26.8 from year-end 2000. Net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $142.3 for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared with $107.6 for the year ended December 31, 2000. Despite the overall slowdown of the economy and the corresponding impact on net earnings, net cash flows provided by operating activities increased $34.7, or 32.2%. Working capital reductions more than offset taxes paid of approximately $26.6 related to the gain on the divestiture of the Paper Chemicals business. Inventory levels in 2001 were reduced in line with lower production levels. Also, accounts receivable were down in 2001, particularly in the fourth quarter and in line with lower sales levels. In terms of days outstanding, inventory and accounts receivable levels remained flat with 2000. Accounts payable and accrued expenses also declined in line with lower sales and production levels. The decrease in accounts payable was compounded by exceptionally high raw material prices, particularly natural gas and propylene, reflected in the December 31, 2000, balance.           Payments against restructuring reserves for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $8.9, $4.4 and $16.6, respectively. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the restructuring liabilities to be paid were $4.4 and $9.9, respectively. The spending related to the remaining liabilities at December 31, 2001 is expected to be completed during the first half of 2002. Environmental remediation spending for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $13.7, $15.3 and $18.6, respectively. The environmental reserve balance at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $93.9 and $104.7, respectively, of which $20.0 was included in accrued expenses for both periods, with the remainder included in other noncurrent liabilities. Total cash disbursements for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension ("OPEB"), including Voluntary Employee Benefit Association (VEBA) Trust funding and Company paid benefits for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $21.5, $39.0 and $27.7, respectively. The fair value of OPEB plan assets at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $73.3 and $72.8, respectively, and the accrued OPEB liabilities at December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $277.9 and $291.8, respectively, of which $20.0 was included in accrued expenses for both periods, with the remainder included in other noncurrent liabilities. The Company expects spending for environmental remediation and OPEB in 2002 to be similar to 2001 levels, though there can be no assurance that the Company's                                         -22-   annual cash expenditures for environmental remediation or OPEB will not be higher in the future (see Note 9 and Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to environmental matters and OPEB).           Net cash flows used for investing activities totaled $71.0 for 2001, compared with net cash flows provided by investing activities of $97.6 for 2000. Included in 2001 was capital spending of $63.9, proceeds received from the sale of assets of $2.9, funding of $9.0 to acquire 3M's composite materials business, the remaining 50% interest in the assets of the ammonia manufacturing joint venture and one other minor acquisition, and an additional investment in the PolymerAdditives.com joint venture of $1.0. Included in 2000 was capital spending of $76.5, proceeds received from the sale of assets of $177.6, which included $104.3 (pre-tax) from the sale of the Paper Chemicals business and $63.0 received from the sale of the Company's interest in the Criterion Catalyst joint venture, contingency related acquisitions payments of $1.0 and funding of $2.5 for the Company's one-third equity interest in the PolymerAdditives.com joint venture. The Company currently expects capital spending to be in the range of $75.0 to $80.0 in 2002. The anticipated increase is due primarily to a multi-year project to upgrade and modernize the Stamford, Connecticut, specialty chemicals research facility.           The Company believes that, based on its expected operating results for 2002 and further reductions in working capital levels, it will be able to fund operating cash requirements and planned capital expenditures in 2002 from its internal cash generation. For further discussion on risks, see Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Significant Accounting Estimates and Comments on Forward-Looking Statements below.           Net cash flows used for financing activities totaled $42.2 for 2001, compared with $158.5 for 2000. In connection with the stock repurchase program discussed below, in 2001 the Company purchased 1,711,300 shares of Treasury Stock at a cost of $52.3, while in 2000 the Company purchased 2,161,700 shares of Treasury Stock at a cost of $63.1. Also in 2000, the Company paid-down $102.9 of its long-term debt.           During November 2000, the Company completed the $100.0 authorization to repurchase shares that was announced on January 25, 1999. The Company repurchased a total of 3,784,254 shares of its outstanding common stock under this authorization. On November 2, 2000, the Company announced an authorization of $100.0 to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock. The repurchases will be made from time to time on the open market or in private transactions and will be utilized for stock option plans, benefit plans and other corporate purposes. Through December 31, 2001, the Company had repurchased 1,872,791 shares at a cost of $57.8 under this authorization. Current and expected economic conditions will be considered in future share repurchases.           In connection with the Company's stock repurchase program, during 2001 the Company sold an aggregate of 300,000 put options to an institutional investor in a series of private placements exempt from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. The put options entitled the holder to sell an aggregate of 300,000 shares of the Company's common stock to the Company at exercise prices ranging from $31.35 to $32.49 per share. The Company received premiums of approximately $0.6 on the sale of such options. Prior to December 31, 2001, 140,000 of the put options expired unexercised, 100,000 put options were exercised and resulted in the Company buying back 100,000 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $32.49 per share and the holder elected to exercise the remaining 60,000 put options, which were settled by the Company purchasing 60,000 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $31.347 per share, which was slightly "out of the money" at the time. At December 31, 2001, no put options remained outstanding. During 2000, the Company sold an aggregate of 400,000 put options at exercise prices ranging from $23.083 to $24.553 per share. Prior to December 31, 2000, the put options expired unexercised. The Company received premiums of approximately $0.6 on the sale of such put options. In lieu of purchasing the shares from the put option holder, the Company has the right to elect settlement by paying the holder of the put options the excess of the strike price over the then market price of the shares in either cash or shares of the Company's common stock (i.e., net cash or net share settlement).           The Company must maintain certain financial covenants contained in its Series C Cumulative Preferred Stock ("Series C Stock") held by MDP Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the American Cyanamid Company ("Cyanamid"), which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of Wyeth, formerly known as American Home Products Corporation. The Company must maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 2-to-1, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 3-to-1 for the average of the fixed charge coverage ratios for the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended and must not incur more than $150.0 of debt unless the Company's equity is in excess of $200.0. If the Company has more than $200.0 in equity, then it may incur additional debt as long as its ratio of debt-to-equity is not more than 1.5-to-1. At December 31, 2001, the Company had $321.1 of debt and $636.8 of equity as defined in the Series C Stock covenant and, under the revised terms, would have the ability to incur up to an additional $634.1 in debt. Additionally, at December 31, 2001, restricted payments permitted under the Series C Stock, excluding any special restricted payments, were limited to $88.5. Restricted payments include, but are not limited to, payments of dividends on common stock, payments for the repurchase of common stock outstanding and payments on certain classes of debt.                                         -23-            At December 31, 2001, the Company's Credit Facility provided for unsecured revolving loans ("Revolving Loans") of up to $200.0. The Revolving Loans are available for the general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, for purposes of making acquisitions permitted under the Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2001 and 2000. The Credit Facility, which is scheduled to mature on July 28, 2002, contains covenants customary for such facilities. The Company was in compliance with all terms, covenants and conditions of the Credit Facility at December 31, 2001, and expects to replace the credit facility on or before its expiration. If the Company does not replace its existing credit facility, the Company expects that it will have sufficient liquidity from operating cash flows to fund the operating needs of the Company.           The Company does not guarantee the debt of its unconsolidated associated companies.           At December 31, 2001 and 2000, $10.0 was available for short-term use under an uncommitted credit facility and a U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $18.4 and $14.8, respectively, was available under foreign currency denominated overdraft facilities. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2001 and 2000.           During 1998, the Company sold an aggregate of $320.0 principal amount of senior debt securities in public offerings, consisting of (i) $100.0 principal amount of 6.50% Notes due March 15, 2003, (ii) $100.0 principal amount of 6.75% Notes due March 15, 2008 and (iii) $120.0 principal amount of 6.846% MandatOry Par Put Remarketed SecuritiesSM (MOPPRS(SM)) due May 11, 2025. The securities were offered under the Company's shelf registration statement, which has now been fully utilized. The Company received an aggregate of approximately $322.0 in proceeds from the sales before deducting expenses associated with the sales.           Except in limited circumstances, the MOPPRS(SM) will be subject to mandatory tender to Merrill Lynch, as Remarketing Dealer, at 100% of the principal amount thereof, for remarketing on May 11, 2005 (the "Remarketing Date"). The interest rate on the MOPPRS(SM) from the Remarketing Date to maturity will be 5.951% plus an applicable spread. If the Remarketing Dealer for any reason does not purchase all tendered MOPPRS(SM) on the Remarketing Date or elects not to remarket the MOPPRS(SM) the Company will be required to repurchase the MOPPRS(SM) from the beneficial owners thereof on the Remarketing Date at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any.           On December 15, 2000, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement covering $400.0 of debt securities, which may be offered by the Company from time to time. Proceeds of any sale will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include replacement of indebtedness and other liabilities, share repurchases, additions to working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. The Company has no immediate plans to offer securities under the registration statement. The registration statement became effective December 22, 2000.           At December 31, 2001, there were no interest rate swap agreements outstanding. At December 31, 2000, the Company was party to four interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $80.0. Two of the swap agreements matured during 2001 and had virtually offsetting terms. Another swap agreement, which converted $20.0 of variable rate interest obligations to 6.25% fixed rate obligations, matured on November 1, 2001. The fourth interest rate swap agreement, which converted $25.0 of the Company's 6.75% fixed rate borrowings due on March 15, 2008, to a floating rate, was terminated during January 2001. Under the terms of the termination agreement, the Company received approximately $0.5 in cash.           Commencing in September 1997, the Company entered into a series of rate lock agreements to hedge against the risk of an increase in treasury rates related to the Company's offering of $300.0 in long-term debt securities. During 1997 and 1998, the Company made payments aggregating approximately $11.2 to settle the rate lock agreements, which is being amortized over the life of the 6.50% Notes, 6.75% Notes and 6.846% MOPPRS(SM) as an increase in interest expense of such Notes. The amount of unamortized rate lock agreements included in long-term debt was $7.3 at December 31, 2001, and $8.4 at December 31, 2000.           The impact of inflation on the Company is considered insignificant since the rate of inflation has remained relatively low in recent years and investments in areas of the world where inflation poses a risk are limited.  Item 7A.  QUANTITATIVE  AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK           The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about the Company's potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates and equity price changes. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward-looking analysis.           Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings.           In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to various market risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. To manage the exposure related to these risks, the Company may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with Company-established policies. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Moreover, the Company enters into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly-rated counterparties and makes reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties, thereby limiting exposure to credit- and performance-related risks.                                         -24-            FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK: The risk of adverse exchange rate fluctuations is mitigated by the fact that there is no concentration of foreign currency exposure. In addition, the Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in foreign currencies. At December 31, 2001, the principal transactions hedged were accounts receivable, accounts payable and inter-company loans denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the business. The Company's practice is to hedge foreign currency exposures with foreign exchange forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure, and therefore, the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value, cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction. Foreign exchange forward contracts are reported as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet with changes in their fair value recorded in other income, net, together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability.           At December 31, 2001, the Company had net foreign exchange contracts to purchase an aggregate of 20.0 Euros, 10.7 British pounds and 1.2 Norwegian krone for U.S. dollars. The Company also had net contracts for the following U.S. dollar equivalent aggregate amounts: contracts to purchase 1.3 Norwegian krone for other European currencies, primarily British pounds; contracts to purchase 18.3 British pounds for Euros; contracts to purchase 10.3 Norwegian krone for Euros and contracts to sell 0.3 of other currencies for Euros. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts, based on forward exchange rates at December 31, 2001, exceeded contract values by approximately $0.6. Assuming that year-end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical 10%, the change in the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year-end would be a decrease of approximately $6.3. However, since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged.           COMMODITY PRICE RISK: The Company selectively utilizes natural gas forward contracts to hedge its exposure to price risk associated with the purchase of natural gas primarily for utility purposes. The maturity of these contracts correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that the Company pays for the underlying commodity. While these contracts are structured to limit the Company's exposure to increases in commodity prices, they can also limit the potential benefit the Company might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices. Because the Company takes actual delivery of the physical commodity, natural gas forward contracts are not required to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value, instead realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of the contract. To the extent that the Company's strategy for managing commodity price risk changes, including the use of financially settled derivative instruments, the accounting methods used to record those transactions may differ from the policies described above.           At December 31, 2001, the Company had $6.8 notional value of natural gas forward contracts with January through October, 2002, delivery dates outstanding. Based on year-end NYMEX prices, the Company had a net unrealized loss of $0.7. Assuming that year-end prices were to adversely change by a hypothetical 10%, the incremental increase in cost of goods sold would be approximately $0.6.           INTEREST RATE RISK: At December 31, 2001, the financial liabilities of the Company consisted primarily of fixed rate long-term debt, which had a carrying value of $314.7, a principal balance of $320.0 and a fair value, based on dealer quoted values, of approximately $321.9. Assuming other factors are held constant, interest rate changes generally affect the fair value of fixed rate debt, but do not impact earnings or cash flows. Accordingly, assuming a hypothetical increase of 1% in interest rates and all other variables were to remain constant, interest expense would not change, and the fair market value of the fixed rate long-term debt would decrease approximately $9.5.           EQUITY PRICE RISK: In connection with the Company's stock repurchase program, the Company selectively utilizes freestanding put option contracts that are indexed to the Company's stock and entitle the holder to sell shares of the Company's common stock to the Company at specified exercise prices. In lieu of purchasing the shares from the put option holders, the Company has the right to elect settlement by paying the holders of the put options the excess of the strike price over the then market price of the shares in either cash or shares of the Company's common stock (i.e., net cash or net share settlement). The put option contracts are initially measured at fair value and reported in Stockholders' Equity. Subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized in the financial statements. At December 31, 2001, there were no put options outstanding.  OTHER           2002 OUTLOOK: In its January 22, 2002, earnings press release, the Company set forth its assumptions and management's best current estimate of first quarter and full year 2002 earnings at that time. The Company stated that, overall it expected first quarter 2002 net earnings to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.30 per diluted share, which includes approximately $0.04 as a result of applying SFAS 141 and 142, and full year 2002 net earnings to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.70 per diluted share, which includes approximately $0.15 as a result of applying SFAS 141 and 142. Although management believes that the January 22, 2002, earnings projections, as well as the analysis on which it was based, continues to reflect the current thinking of management, there can be no assurance that sales or earnings will develop in the manner projected or if the analysis were to be redone on the date hereof there would be no change to the outlook. Actual results may differ materially.                                         -25-            Fourth quarter 2001 results reflected a global economy in recession and low levels of industrial chemicals production. Overall, the Company expects these conditions to continue in 2002 and believes some markets, such as the automotive industry, may experience further declines. In addition, it expects the U.S. dollar to continue strengthening through 2002, thereby reducing specialty chemicals (Water and Industrial Process Chemicals and Performance Products) international sales by about one percent. Furthermore, in the Specialty Materials segment, a significant reduction in airline passenger traffic has led to excess capacity and a deterioration in the financial condition of the airline industry. The Company expects a significant reduction in demand from the large commercial aircraft sector in 2002 with some continuing decline in demand for 2003, reducing sales of Specialty Materials' aerospace materials.           In the Water and Industrial Process Chemicals segment, 2002 sales are expected to be flat when compared to 2001 sales. Increased sales to the municipal and industrial markets should slightly offset lower demand for waste treatment chemicals from the paper and the oil sectors, which have reduced capacity. The Company expects demand for mining chemicals to decline in 2002, reflecting weak global economic conditions and high inventories of aluminum and copper. However, the Company expects to benefit from penetration into new mining applications and the continuing growth of the phosphine chemicals business. Lower raw material costs and new, more cost effective capacity in Europe and the United States are expected to enhance operating margins. As a result, the Company expects this segment to achieve flat sales and a single-digit percentage increase in operating earnings in 2002, compared with 2001.           In the Performance Products segment, soft economic conditions are expected to impact sales to the plastics, automotive, housing and general industrial markets. The weak economic conditions are creating downward price pressure in the polymer additives sector, particularly from global and Asian suppliers. However, lower raw material costs and operational excellence initiatives are expected to increase the operating margins of this segment. As a result, the Company expects sales to be relatively flat to slightly down in 2002 with a significant increase in operating earnings compared with 2001 results.           In the Specialty Materials segment, sales to the 100 plus passenger seat commercial airliner sector are expected to be down sharply in 2002, based on the commercial airliner delivery schedules published by Boeing and Airbus. The Company expects a smaller reduction in sales to the regional jet and aircraft brake markets. Sales to business and military aircraft, satellite and launch vehicles and high performance markets should continue to grow in 2002. Overall, 2002 sales in the Specialty Materials segment are expected to be 10% to 15% lower, with operating earnings 30% to 35% lower, compared with 2001.           In the Building Block Chemicals segment, weak economic conditions are expected to reduce demand for acrylonitrile and its co-products in 2002. The Company expects to operate its Fortier plant at a reduced utilization rate. Despite some plant shutdowns, however, the supply of acrylonitrile is expected to continue to exceed demand, continuing the trend of lower acrylonitrile selling prices partially offset by lower raw material costs, resulting in tight spreads. The Company does, however, expect the Building Block Chemicals segment to benefit from significantly lower energy and raw material costs in 2002 and to realize the full year benefits of the Fortier plant restructuring that was initiated in the second quarter of 2001. As a result, the Building Block Chemicals segment is expected to post a moderate operating loss in 2002, compared with a $18.7 operating loss in 2001.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES           Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the notes thereto. The areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of the Company's financial statements and changes in the estimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition.           ENVIRONMENTAL: It is the Company's policy to accrue, and charge against earnings, environmental cleanup costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount is reasonably estimable. As assessments and cleanups proceed, these accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes available. These accruals can change substantially due to such factors as additional information on the nature or extent of contamination, methods of remediation required, changes in the apportionment of costs among responsible parties and other actions by governmental agencies or private parties. Cash expenditures often lag behind the period in which an accrual is recorded by a number of years.           POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS: The Company sponsors postretirement benefit plans. The postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements. The accrued postretirement benefit cost at December 31, 2001 and 2000, includes $20.0 in accrued expenses and $257.9 and $271.8, respectively, in other noncurrent liabilities. The key determinants of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations ("APBO") are discount rate, expected return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rate. The healthcare cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts of APBO and related expense. For example, increasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would increase the APBO at December 31, 2001, and the 2001 aggregate service and interest cost by approximately $22.9 and $1.8, respectively, and decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would decrease the APBO at December 31, 2001 and the 2001 aggregate service and interest cost by approximately $20.8 and $1.7, respectively. For further information, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and further discussions included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.                                         -26-            IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF: Long-lived assets and intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be charged to earnings. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. Several estimates are made when reviewing for impairments such as market and revenue growth, cost estimates and technological changes. These factors are reviewed annually. For goodwill, beginning in 2002 the Company will applySFAS142, which requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairments at least annually and written down in the periods in which it is determined that the recorded value is greater than the fair value. To accomplish this, the Company has to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit's carrying value. If a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired and the Company must then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, to its carrying value.                                         -27-    Item 8.
