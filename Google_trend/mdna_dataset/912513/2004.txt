Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. Percentages are approximate.  GENERAL       Cytec Industries Inc. is a global specialty chemicals and materials company and sells its products to diverse major markets for aerospace, water treatment, mining, automotive, industrial coatings, plastics and chemical intermediates. With slightly over half of its sales outside of the U. S., sales volume by region is an important metric to management and is detailed by segment as well as the impact of changes in currency rates. The Company reports its net sales in four segments: Water and Industrial Process Chemicals, Performance Products, Specialty Materials and Building Block Chemicals. The Water and Industrial Process Chemicals and Performance Products segments are collectively referred to as Specialty Chemicals. (See Item 1. Business.) The Company also reports its net sales in four geographic regions: North America, Latin America, Asia/Pacific and Europe/Middle East/Africa. The destination of the sale determines the region under which it is reported consistent with management's view of the business. North America consists of the United States and Canada. Latin America includes Mexico, Central America, South America and the Caribbean Islands. Asia/Pacific is comprised of Asia, Australia and the islands of the South Pacific Rim.       Raw material cost changes year on year are an important factor in profitability especially in years of high volatility. Key raw materials for the Specialty Chemical and Building Block Chemicals segments are propylene, ammonia, methanol derivatives and natural gas for utilities. Discussion of the year to year impact for raw materials and energy is provided in our segment discussion.       In the course of the Company's ongoing operations, a number of strategic product line acquisitions and dispositions have been made. All acquisitions have been recorded using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in the Company's consolidated results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. (For further information about the Company's acquisitions and dispositions, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)       The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143") effective January 1, 2003, SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS 146") effective January 1, 2003 and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 (revised 2003), "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits" ("SFAS 132 Revised"). SFAS 143 addresses the accounting and reporting requirements for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets, and SFAS 146 addresses the recognition and measurement of costs associated with an exit or disposal activity. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in a net charge of $13.6 million after-tax. SFAS No. 132 Revised provides for additional financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans. In addition, the Company adopted SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141") effective July 1, 2001 and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142") effective January 1, 2002, and SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133") effective January 1, 2001. For further information on these accounting changes, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following table sets forth the percentage relationship that certain items in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income bear to net sales:  Years Ended December 31,              2003              2002            2001 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net Sales                            100.0%            100.0%          100.0% Manufacturing cost of sales           75.8              75.8            77.1 Gross profit                          24.2              24.2            22.9 Selling and technical services         8.6               9.1             8.2 Research and process development       2.4               2.5             2.3 Administrative and general             3.4               3.5             3.2 Amortization of acquisition      intangibles                       0.3               0.2             0.9                                    ----------------------------------------- Earnings from operations               9.6               8.9             8.2                                    ----------------------------------------- Net earnings                           5.3               5.9             5.1 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                           16         NET SALES BY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA   Net Sales                                                                                        Europe/                                                        North          Latin         Asia/         Middle                                                       America        America     Pacific Rim   East/Africa       Total - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------            2003   Water and Industrial Process Chemicals                  $146.6          $60.2       $ 51.2          $104.2     $  362.2   Performance Products                                     248.6           28.9         86.6           125.7        489.8   Specialty Materials                                      292.3            1.6         15.5            99.3        408.7   Building Block Chemicals                                  88.9            4.0         58.0            60.2        211.1                                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------------     Total                                                 $776.4          $94.7       $211.3          $389.4     $1,471.8                                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------------  2002   Water and Industrial Process Chemicals                  $139.9          $51.5       $ 50.1           $89.7      $ 331.2   Performance Products                                     242.9           26.2         72.3           110.9        452.3   Specialty Materials                                      290.7            1.3         14.7            88.8        395.5   Building Block Chemicals                                  68.9            3.9         60.2            34.2        167.2                                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------------     Total                                                 $742.4          $82.9       $197.3          $323.6     $1,346.2                                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------------  2001   Water and Industrial Process Chemicals                  $156.0          $57.2       $ 36.6           $85.2      $ 335.0   Performance Products                                     238.0           27.2         65.7           103.8        434.7   Specialty Materials                                      320.4            1.9         16.8           111.1        450.2   Building Block Chemicals                                  82.6            4.7         51.6            28.3        167.2                                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------------     Total                                                 $797.0          $91.0       $170.7          $328.4     $1,387.1 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------          Net sales in the United States were $719.7, $685.8 and $736.9 for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. International net sales were $752.1, $660.4, and $650.2, or 51%, 49% and 47% of total net sales, for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.       For more information on the Company's segments, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and further discussions in the Segment Results section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002  Consolidated Results       Net sales for 2003 were $1,471.8, up 9%, compared to $1,346.2 for 2002. Overall, sales volume increased 5% with acquisitions accounting for 2% of this increase, favorable changes in currency rates adding 3%, and higher selling prices adding 1%.       For a detailed discussion on sales refer to the Segment Results section below.       Manufacturing cost of sales was $1,114.9, or 75.8% of net sales, for 2003 compared to $1,020.4, or 75.9%, of net sales, for 2002. Included in 2002 is a $10.8 net restructuring charge or 1.0% of net sales for plant closure costs and expenses associated with discontinuing a product line. Additional savings related to 2002 restructuring initiative were $1.4 in 2003 which was the result of planned personnel reductions under the 2002 initiative. Manufacturing costs in 2003 were also impacted by higher raw material and energy costs of $37.4, particularly from petroleum based products globally and natural gas based products in the U. S. and currency rate changes increased cost $18.2 Freight and warehousing increased $6.6 of which $3.0 was due to currency rates changes. The remainder of the increase in freight and warehousing is due primarily to sales volume increases as well as higher freight rates and fuel surcharges. Insurance costs increased $1.7 over 2002. Partially offsetting this were lower costs as a result of the Company's operational excellence initiatives.       Pension expense increased $5.2 principally as a result of the Company lowering its discount rate in the U. S. by 0.5% to reflect current market rates on fixed income securities and by the 2003 acquisitions which increased pension expense by $0.3. This was partly offset by plan changes to the retirement medical plans in the U. S. which were instituted by the Company in 2002 and reduced expense by $0.7. Pension expense is primarily reported in manufacturing cost of sales. See Critical Accounting Policies, Retirement Plans for further discussion on how changes in discount rates and return on asset assumptions can impact annual expense.                                          17          Selling and technical services increased $4.3. Included in prior year amounts are net restructuring charges of $2.5. Additional savings related to 2002 restructuring were $1.1 in 2003 primarily as a result of planned personnel reductions. Costs associated with the acquisitions in 2003 added $2.6 and costs associated with the Company's performance stock plan increased by $1.1 due to a higher market value for the Company's common stock. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to currency rate changes.       Research and process development increased $1.5. Included in the prior year are net restructuring charges of $1.0. Costs associated with the acquisitions in 2003 added $0.5. Headcount additions and costs for outside testing in the Specialty Chemical segments accounted for the increase in costs.       Administrative expenses increased $2.7 but included in prior year amounts are net restructuring charges of $0.8 and fees of $1.7 related to a research and development tax credit filing. The Company's performance stock plan increased costs by $1.5 due to the higher stock price. The acquisitions of 2003 added $0.7 to administrative costs in 2003 and insurance premiums increased $1.1 over 2002. Currency rate changes also increased costs.       The increase in the amortization of acquisition intangibles is due to the amortization of acquisition intangibles from the 2003 acquisitions.       Other expense, net increased $6.9 from the year ago period. This resulted primarily from currency losses where certain of our international subsidiaries held dollar denominated assets when the U. S. dollar weakened. Currency rate changes increased expenses compared to 2002 by $5.3. Cleanup costs of $0.6 at an operating site related to a divested product line and royalty income of $0.8 that expired in 2002 also contributed to the increase.       Equity in earnings of associated companies increased $1.1 from the year ago period. Included in 2002 results was a restructuring charge of $0.4 representing the Company's 50% share of restructuring charges recorded by CYRO, and a charge of $1.7 to reduce to zero the carrying value of the Company's net investment in the one-third owned PA.com. In addition, the Company's share of operating losses from PA.com in 2002 totaled $0.9. CYRO had increased sales of 5% in 2003, however its product mix was less favorable and raw material and energy costs were higher than the year ago period. As a result, the Company's share of earnings in 2003 from CYRO decreased by $1.7.       Interest expense, net was $16.2, a decrease of $0.3, from the prior year period. Interest income in 2002 was favorably impacted by $2.0 received in conjunction with research and development tax credit refund. In March 2003 the Company repaid $100.0 of its existing debt with an interest rate of 6.5% per annum resulting in lower interest expense. This was largely offset by interest expense related to the $200.0 principal amount of 4.6% Notes that were issued in June 2003. The interest expense associated with this new debt was partially reduced by $0.7 as a result of interest rate swap agreements entered into in August 2003.       Income tax provision reflects a reduction in the effective tax rate from 33.5%, before the impact of prior years' tax credits, to 28.0%. This reduction was a result of the Company's continued emphasis on global tax planning and execution of those plans together with an increased level of investment and earnings in tax jurisdictions with lower rates as well as a favorable international tax ruling with respect to a legal entity restructuring that occurred in the prior year. The 2002 full year effective tax rate of 28% reflects a reduction for a tax refund of $6.0 associated with prior year's research & development tax credits.       Net earnings before the cumulative effect of the accounting change were $91.0, or $2.27 per diluted share, for 2003, compared to $79.3, or $1.96 per diluted share, in 2002. Included in 2002 was an after-tax net restructuring charge of $14.1, or $0.23 per diluted share. Also included in 2002 is a net credit of $0.15 per diluted share related to research and development tax credits discussed above (a reduction of $6.0 in income tax provision, interest income of $2.0 or $1.3 after-tax, and a charge of $1.7 or $1.1 after-tax in administrative expenses for fees related to tax planning).       On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS 143 and recorded an after-tax, non-cash charge of $13.6 ($0.34 per diluted share) reported as a cumulative effect of an accounting change.       Net earnings after the cumulative effect of the accounting change were $77.4 or $1.93 per diluted share.                                         18     Segment Results  Year-to-year comparisons and analyses of changes in net sales by product line segment and region are set forth below.

Currency rate changes increased sales 5% with acquisitions adding 4%. Base volume increased 3%, and selling prices declined 3%. North American volumes increased 7% with the 2003 acquisitions of the metal extractant and aromatic phosphines product lines of Avecia accounting for 6%. Also, the Water Treatment product line selling volume was down as the Company exited certain low profit municipal business but this was offset by increased Phosphine gas sales. In Latin America, the volume growth of 19% was primarily in the mining chemicals product line as a result of higher demand in the alumina market and acquisitions accounting for 3%. Asia/Pacific volumes decreased 2%; 2002 volume included sales for an initial fill of the Company's solvent extraction product at one of the worlds largest cobalt nickel mines. Europe volumes increased 4% primarily in the Water Treatment product line. Currency rate changes were primarily the result of the weaker U. S. dollar, except in Latin America where the U. S. dollar remained strong for the first three quarters of 2003. Selling prices decreased in North America in all product lines due to customer mix and competitive pricing. Latin America pricing increased offsetting the impact of negative currency rate changes. Asia/Pacific selling prices decreased principally in mining chemicals where pricing is linked to the U. S. dollar with an offsetting effect due to currency rate changes.       Earnings from operations were $20.3, or 6% of net sales in 2003, compared to $26.2, or 8% of net sales, in 2002. Included in 2003 are increased savings from the 2002 restructuring initiative of $1.4 million as a result of planned personnel reductions. The impact from the increase in sales and restructuring savings was more than offset by higher raw material and energy costs of $3.2, higher freight, warehousing, employee benefit and insurance costs.

Base volumes for the year were flat and selling prices were up slightly. The Company experienced strong demand in the Asia/Pacific and Latin America regions although off a smaller base but this was almost all offset by lower demand in Europe and North America due to reduced economic activity in those regions. Selling prices were up in Latin America offsetting the negative impact of currency rate changes. Prices in Asia/Pacific were down 2% primarily in Polymer Additives due to continued competitive pricing initiatives.       Earnings from operations were $37.3, or 8% of net sales, in 2003 compared to $39.6, or 9% of net sales, in 2002. Included in 2003 are increased savings from the 2002 restructuring imitative of $1.1 million as a result of planned personnel reductions. The impact from the increase in sales and restructuring savings was more than offset by higher raw material and energy costs of $9.2, increased freight, warehousing, employee benefit and insurance costs.                                         19        Specialty Materials                                                                                                     % Change Due to                                                                              Total       ----------------------------------------                                                  2003         2002          % Change      Price      Volume/Mix       Currency - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------              North America                                 $ 292.3       $ 290.7            1%           0%           1%              0% Latin America(1)                                  1.6           1.3           ---          ---           ---            --- Asia/Pacific                                     15.5          14.7            4%          -2%           6%              0% Europe/Middle East/Africa                        99.3          88.8           12%          -3%           11%             4%                                              -------------------------- Total                                         $ 408.7       $ 395.5            3%          -1%           3%              1% - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     (1) Due to the level of sales in this geographic region, percentage comparisons are not meaningful.       Selling volumes were up 3% overall. Sales to military and rotorcraft applications added 5% due to increased production levels for military aircraft and a high level of replacement parts for rotorcraft and restocking by certain customers from low 2002 year-end inventory levels. Sales to the commercial aerospace sector for large commercial aircraft, regional jets and business jets were down 2% from 2002. Sales to Boeing were down in line with the decrease in large commercial aircraft build rates but offset somewhat by increased sales to Airbus.       Earnings from operations were $66.3, or 16% of sales, in 2003 compared to $65.7, or 17% of sales, in 2002. Included in 2003 are increased savings from the 2002 restructuring initiative of $0.5 million as a result of planned personnel reductions. The impact from the increase in sales, restructuring savings and higher plant utilization was essentially offset by higher operating costs as the Company invested in its manufacturing plants and increased its selling and technical efforts.

Selling volumes increased 10% overall. North American and European acrylonitrile volumes were up due to new business. Demand in Asia/Pacific for acrylonitrile was low principally in the second quarter of the year. Selling prices were up primarily related to acyrlonitrile due to tighter supply and increased input costs.       Earnings from operations were $20.3, or 7% of net sales, in 2003 compared to $5.6, or 3% of net sales, in 2002. The increased earnings were primarily the result of higher selling volumes and prices and the favorable impact of currency rate changes. Additionally, earnings increased due to lower plant spending of $3.2 and higher plant capacity utilization. The increase was partially offset by significantly higher raw material and energy costs of $24.0 which were primarily due to the higher cost of ammonia, propylene and natural gas.                                          20      YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001  Consolidated Results       Net sales for 2002 were $1,346.2 compared to $1,387.1 for 2001 with modest declines in prices and volume. Asia/Pacific had the only sales increase, which was due to strong volume growth. The Americas were down modestly due to lower volume and Europe/Middle East/Africa was slightly below last year.       For a detailed discussion on sales refer to the Segment Results section below.       In 2002 the Company recorded an aggregate restructuring charge of $16.0, which included the elimination of 135 positions worldwide. The charge was comprised of the following initiatives: reorganization of the Specialty Chemicals segments resulting in a reduction of 65 personnel and a charge of $5.1 for employee related costs; alignment of the Specialty Materials segment in connection with reduced demand in the commercial aerospace industry, resulting in a reduction of 47 personnel and a charge of $1.6 for employee related costs; closure of the Woodbridge, NJ, facility, resulting in the elimination of 23 positions and a charge of $1.6 for employee related and decommissioning costs; and the discontinuance of a minor unprofitable product line, resulting in a charge of $7.7 for the write-down of the net book value of the fixed assets and costs of decommissioning the facility. The restructuring costs were charged to the Consolidated Statement of Income as follows: manufacturing cost of sales, $11.6; selling and technical services, $2.6; research and process development, $1.0 and administrative and general, $0.8 and were charged to corporate. At the time the restructuring was initiated, the Company expected cumulative savings of $6.3 in 2002 and $9.5 in 2003. As of December, 2002, 105 positions were eliminated resulting in actual savings through December 31, 2002 of $6.1.       In addition, during 2002 the Company recorded charges of $0.4 in equity in earnings of associated companies for its 50% share of additional restructuring charges related to CYRO's shutdown of its Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada facility in 2001.       In 2001 the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $5.4 related to the indefinite idling of the Fortier ammonia plant and the Company's share of the related personnel reduction of 67 positions at the Fortier facility. The restructuring costs were charged to the Consolidated Statement of Income as follows: manufacturing cost of sales of $4.6 and selling and technical services of $0.8 and were charged to corporate. The components of the restructuring charge included: employee severance costs, $4.3; asset write-downs, $0.9; and other costs, $0.2. During 2002 the Company reduced this restructuring accrual as a result of incurring less costs than originally estimated as a result of less than expected personnel reductions. As a result, the Company recognized a restructuring credit of $0.9 in the Consolidated Statement of Income as follows: manufacturing cost of sales, $0.8 and selling and technical services, $0.1. At the time the restructuring was initiated, the Company expected savings of $2.2 in 2001 and savings of $8.9 in 2002. The actual cumulative savings for 2001 were $2.1 and $8.5 in 2002.       In addition, during 2001 the Company recorded charges of $2.3 in equity in earnings of associated companies for its 50% share of CYRO's restructuring charges including $3.7 related to the shutdown of CYRO's manufacturing facility in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, and $0.8 related to CYRO's share of the infrastructure restructuring at the Company's Fortier facility.       Manufacturing cost of sales was $1,020.4, or 75.8% of net sales, for 2002 and included net restructuring charges of $10.8 for plant closure and employee related costs and expenses associated with discontinuing a product line. Manufacturing cost of sales was $1,069.0, or 77.1% of net sales, for 2001, and included a restructuring charge of $4.6 related to the indefinite idling of the Fortier ammonia plant and the Company's share of the related personnel reductions at the Fortier facility. Restructuring savings increased $6.4 in 2002 compared to 2001. The remaining increase in gross profit margins was due to $20.9 lower raw material and energy costs and increased production levels in the Company's Specialty Chemicals segments.       Pension expense increased $3.6 principally as a result of a decrease in the discount rate that was used to determine pension expense to reflect market rates available on fixed-income securities. The Company also lowered its long term return on assets assumption from 8.8% to 8.3%. The resulting increase in pension expense was partly offset by plan changes to the retirement medical plans adopted by the Company in 2002 which reduced expense by $2.7. See Critical Accounting Policies, Retirement Plans, below for further discussion on how changes in discount rates and return on asset assumptions can impact annual expense.       Selling and technical services expenses increased $8.3, research and process development expenses increased $1.3, and administrative and general expenses increased $2.2. Included in 2002 were net restructuring charges of $2.5, $1.0 and $0.8 in selling and technical services, research and process development and administrative and general expenses, respectively, that primarily related to employee reductions in the Specialty Chemicals and Specialty Materials segments. Restructuring savings increased $1.3 in 2002. Also included in administrative and general expenses for 2002 were charges of $1.7 for fees incurred in connection with a favorable cash settlement of prior years' research and development tax credits claim with the IRS. Included in selling and technical services expenses for 2001 was a restructuring charge of $0.8 related to the personnel reductions at the Fortier facility. Selling and technical services also increased due to head count additions in certain regions and $1.7 for severance and relocation costs, mostly in Europe and North America as the Company realigned its selling and customer service organizations and costs incurred to implement the Specialty Chemicals North American logistics network. Operating expenses also included an increase of $5.9 compared to 2001 for accruals for incentive-based compensation. Incentive compensation is performance based, and for 2002 the Company exceeded several of its 2002 annual targets, whereas in 2001 economic conditions prevented the Company from attaining several of its 2001 performance targets and incentive-based compensation expenses were reduced accordingly.        Amortization of acquisition intangibles was $3.1, down $9.7 from the prior year period, as goodwill was no longer amortized effective January 1, 2002, under SFAS 142.       Other income, net, was $1.2 for 2002 and included currency gains of $2.8. Other income, net, was $6.8 for 2001 and included gains of $7.0 related to the sale of reclaimed land in Florida and the settlement of a royalty issue concerning mineral rights associated with a former phosphate rock mining joint venture also in Florida.       Equity in earnings of associated companies was $6.1 for 2002, compared to $0.1 for 2001. Included in 2002 and 2001 were restructuring charges of $0.4 and $2.3, respectively, related to CYRO's shutdown of its Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada facility, and CYRO's share of infrastructure restructuring at the Company's Fortier facility. The increase in equity earnings of associated companies reflects higher sales and the benefits of the restructuring initiatives at CYRO. Sales at associated companies were $307.5 for 2002, an increase of 5% after excluding sales of the former AC Molding Compounds joint venture which was shut down in November 2001. Included in 2002 was a charge of $1.7 to reduce to zero the carrying value of the Company's net investment in the one-third owned PA.com joint venture. Accordingly, the Company no longer recognized its share of the joint venture's expected future losses. The terms of the joint venture agreement required the Company to make an additional contribution of $0.5 during 2002, and this required contribution was included in the amount of the charge recognized in 2002.       Interest expense, net, was $16.5 for 2002 compared to $19.6 for 2001. Included in 2002 was interest income of $2.0 received in connection with a favorable cash settlement of prior years' research and development tax credit claims with the IRS. The remainder of the decrease was due to increased interest income attributable to higher cash balances during 2002.       The income tax provision was $30.9 for 2002 and included a reduction of $6.0 in connection with a cash settlement of prior years' research and development tax credits claim.       Net earnings for 2002 were $79.3, or $1.96 per diluted share, compared to $71.1, or $1.59 per diluted share, for 2001. Included in 2002 were after-tax net restructuring charges of $9.4, or $0.23 per diluted share, and a net credit of $6.2, or $0.15 per diluted share, related to prior year's research and development tax credits broken down as follows: a reduction of $6.0, or $0.15 per diluted share, in income tax expense, after-tax interest income of $1.3, or $0.03 per diluted share, and an after-tax charge of $1.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in administrative expenses for external costs associated with such tax planning. Included in 2001 were after-tax restructuring charges of $5.0, or $0.12 per diluted share, an after-tax extraordinary gain of $4.9, or $0.12 per diluted share, related to the acquisition of the assets of the carbon fibers product line of BP, and after-tax goodwill amortization of $6.4, or $0.15 per diluted share, that is no longer required under SFAS 142   Segment Results       Year-to-year comparisons and analyses of changes in net sales by product line segment and region are set forth below.

The paper and oilfield markets reflect lower levels of economic activity. Selling volumes for mining chemicals in the North and Latin American regions were lower 11% each due to lower economic activity. In the Asia/Pacific region selling volumes for mining chemicals were up 23% due to increased demand in the copper and cobalt nickel markets, and in particular an initial fill at one of the world's largest cobalt nickel mines. In Europe Phosphine sales were $4.5 lower in Europe as a result of a certain customer experiencing reduced demand in their end market that resulted in lower purchases of the Company's products offset by growth of $6.5 in the Water Treatment product line due to new business.                                         22          Earnings from operations were $26.2, or 7.9% of net sales, in 2002, compared to $25.2, or 7.5% of net sales, in 2001. The improvement in earnings from operations was primarily the result of $4.8 lower overall raw material and energy costs, savings from restructuring of $1.8, and lower amortization expense of $1.1 from adopting SFAS No. 142, partially offset by the impact of lower sales.

In the United States, demand in the automotive and general industrial markets improved as compared to 2001. The lower selling prices were primarily in the polymer additives product line, down 7% globally.       Earnings from operations were $39.6, or 8.8% of net sales, in 2002, compared to $16.4, or 3.8% of net sales, in 2001. The improvement in earnings from operations is the result of the leverage achieved from higher selling volumes, lower raw material and energy costs of $10.0 savings from restructuring of $2.1, and lower operating costs. Also benefiting earnings was lower amortization expense of $1.2 from adopting SFAS No. 142.

The overall decrease in selling volume, which includes a 2.7% increase from acquisitions, reflects the significant decrease in demand for commercial aircraft. This affected sales in all regions and was partially offset by higher growth in the military sector, mainly North America and the high performance auto sector in Europe.       Earnings from operations were $65.7, or 16.6% of net sales, in 2002, compared to $97.2, or 21.6% of net sales, in 2001. The decline in earnings from operations reflects the decrease in selling volumes, which were partially offset by efforts to keep costs aligned with demand, savings from restructuring of $2.2, and lower amortization expense of $7.4 from adopting SFAS No. 142.

The overall decrease in selling prices was primarily due to lower acrylonitrile and acrylamide selling prices during the first half of 2002. Demand for acrylonitrile improved with the recovery of certain of the Asia/Pacific economies and acrylamide sales were higher in Europe. Most of the sales volume decline in the North America region was due to the idling of the ammonia plant in April 2001. Ammonia sales were $11.2 in 2001.                                         23          Earnings from operations were $5.6 in 2002, compared to losses from operations of $18.7 in 2001. The improvement was due to higher acrylonitrile margins driven by increased demand in the export markets for acrylonitrile, by competitors' supply disruptions, and by lower energy costs of $3.1, principally natural gas in the United States and restructuring savings of $6.5.  LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION       At December 31, 2003, the Company's cash balance was $251.1, compared to $210.0 at year end 2002.       Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $132.4 in all of 2003, compared to $211.6 in 2002.       Accounts receivable decreased $13.6 and days outstanding declined by approximately two days as more effort was put into collections in 2003. Other receivables increased $7.9 primarily from receivables for anticipated insurance and litigation recoveries. Inventories increased $12.2 and days increased by approximately four days. Much of this increase is due to production campaigning at certain of our production sites and higher levels of inventory in Asia and Latin America. Accounts payable is down $13.4 due primarily to timing of payments, compared to the end of the year in 2002. Accrued expenses decreased due primarily to higher accruals for incentive compensation cash payments for 2002 performance than the accrual for 2003 performance, thereby reducing the accrual balance by approximately $2.5, and restructuring payments of $1.9. Other liabilities decreased $44.0 due to environmental remediation spending of $9.3 and retiree medical payments, net of the accrual, of $16.4 and pension contributions, net of the accrual, of $14.6.       Net cash flows used for investing activities were $195.3 in 2003 compared to $56.4 in 2002.       In the third quarter of 2003, the Company used $101.6 to complete two previously announced acquisitions. In July, the Company acquired Avecia's MEP and I&S product lines and in September, the Company completed the dissolution of its joint venture with Mitsui Chemicals Inc. The Company now owns 100% of the former venture's existing coating resins product line and certain technology rights associated with the water treating product line in most of Asia, while Mitsui retains the former venture's existing water treating product line.       Capital spending for 2003 was $93.8 compared to $62.2 for 2002. The ongoing renovation of the Specialty Chemicals research facility and the expansion of the advanced composites manufacturing facility in Germany were the main factors in the increase in capital spending. These projects will continue into 2004. For the full year 2004, the Company expects capital spending to be approximately $90.0- $95.0.       The Company believes that, based on its expected operating results for 2004, it will be able to fund operating cash requirements and planned capital expenditures and dividends through the end of 2004 from its internal cash generation.       Net cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $85.4 for 2003 compared to a net use of $36.7 for 2002. In March 2003, the Company repaid $100.0 of its 6.50% debt then due. In June 2003, the Company sold $200.0 principal amount of 4.60% Notes due July 1, 2013. Proceeds to the Company from the sale of the notes were $198.9. Proceeds from stock option exercises totaled $14.5 in 2003 compared to $3.1 for the same period of 2002. The total number of treasury shares reissued because of option exercises was 1,079,800 for 2003 compared to 293,650 shares reissued for the same period in 2002.       In 2003 the Company announced an authorization to repurchase up to an additional $100.0 of its outstanding common stock. The repurchases are being made from time to time on the open market or in private transactions and the shares obtained under this authorization are anticipated to be utilized for stock option plans, benefit plans and other corporate purposes. During 2003, the Company repurchased 838,200 shares of stock at a cost of $27.7 that completed its previous stock repurchase authorization and included the purchase of approximately 512,000 shares at a cost of $18.1 under its new authorization.       In January, 2004, the Board of Directors approved the initiation of a common stock quarterly cash dividend program and declared a $0.10 per share cash dividend, payable on February 25, 2004 to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2004. The Company is restricted from paying dividends in excess of certain amounts determined in accordance with the terms of its Series C Cumulative Preferred Stock ("Series C Stock"). See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.       In April 2002, the Company executed a $100.0, three-year unsecured revolving credit agreement and a $100.0, 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement with a one-year term out option that was renewed in April 2003. Revolving loans under the agreements are available for the general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries, including without limitation, for purposes of making acquisitions. The credit agreements contain covenants customary for such facilities. The Company was in compliance with all terms, covenants and conditions of its credit facilities. The Company also has available U. S. dollar equivalents of approximately $6.6 under non-U. S. dollar denominated overdraft facilities. There are no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2003 or 2002.                                         24          In 2003, the Company entered into short-term loan agreements relating to the acquisition of MCY's coatings resins product line (See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), aggregating approximately 2 billion yen. The U. S. dollar equivalent debt balance outstanding under these agreements at December 31, 2003 is $9.3 and is included in short-term borrowings. In January 2004, the company cancelled one of these agreements and reduced the total amount outstanding by 1 billion yen.       At December 31, 2003 and 2002, long-term debt, including the current portion, consisted of the following:                                                                               2003                          2002 - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     ------------------------                                                                               Carrying                       Carrying                                                                      Face       Value           Face          Value                                                             ----------------------------     ------------------------          6.50% Notes Due March 15, 2003                                           -            -         $100.0        $ 99.9 6.75% Notes Due March 15, 2008                                      $100.0       $ 97.7          100.0          97.1 6.846% Mandatory Par Put Remarketed Securities                       120.0        118.9          120.0         118.9 4.60% Notes Due July 1, 2013                                         200.0        199.6            -               -                                                             ----------------------------     ------------------------                                                                      420.0        416.2          320.0         315.9 Less: Current maturities                                                 -            -          100.0          99.9                                                             ----------------------------     ------------------------ Long-term debt                                                      $420.0       $416.2         $220.0        $216.0 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------          See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.       The Company has not guaranteed any indebtedness of its unconsolidated associated company.       The Company must maintain certain financial covenants contained in its Series C Stock, as modified. Under such covenants, the Company would have the ability to incur up to an additional $699.1 in debt at December 31, 2003 and make additional restricted payments (which include common stock dividends and repurchases of common stock) of $92.5. (For further information about the Series C Stock and financial covenants contained therein, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).        The impact of inflation on the Company is considered insignificant since the rate of inflation has remained relatively low in recent years and investments in areas of the world where inflation poses a risk are limited.

(See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).       The Company had $24.6 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees at December 31, 2003 that are issued on the Company's behalf in the ordinary course of business to support certain performance obligations and commitments of the Company. The instruments are typically renewed on an annual basis.                                         25          The Company does not have any unconsolidated limited purpose entities or any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities.                                          26   Item 7a.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about the Company's potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in currency rates, commodity prices, interest rates and equity price changes. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward-looking analysis.       Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings.       In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to various market risks, including fluctuations in currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates. To manage the exposure related to these risks, the Company may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with Company-established policies. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Moreover, the Company enters into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly-rated counterparties and makes reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties, thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks.  Currency Risk: The risk of adverse currency rate fluctuations is mitigated by the fact that there is no concentration of currency exposure outside the U. S. In addition, the Company periodically enters into currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business. At December 31, 2003, the principal transactions hedged involved accounts receivable, accounts payable and intercompany loans. When hedging currency exposures, the Company's practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure, and therefore, the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value, cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction.       At December 31, 2003, the currency and net contractual amounts of the Company's forward contracts translated into U. S. dollar equivalent amounts were as follows:                                                     Buy                                    -----------------------------------------                                                   Norwegian      Canadian               Sell                      Euro        Krone          Dollar               --------------------------------------------------------------                U. S. dollar             $10.1        $ 2.2          $4.5               Pound sterling             4.0          1.0             -               Euro                         -         10.7             -               Other                      0.8          0.1             -               --------------------------------------------------------------       The fair value of currency contracts, based on forward exchange rates at December 31, 2003, exceeded contract values by approximately $0.6. Assuming that year-end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical 10%, the change in the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year-end would be a decrease of approximately $3.4. However, since these contracts hedge specific transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged.  Commodity Price Risk: The Company frequently uses natural gas forward contracts and swaps to reduce the volatility of natural gas costs used for utility purposes at certain of its facilities. These contracts typically correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that the Company pays for the underlying commodity. While these contracts are primarily structured to limit the Company's exposure to increases in commodity prices, they can also limit the potential benefit the Company might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices.       At December 31, 2003, the Company had outstanding natural gas forward contracts with a notional value of $13.8 and delivery dates of January through October 2004 and outstanding natural gas swaps with a fair value gain of $0.3, which will be reclassified into manufacturing cost of sales in the period the hedged natural gas purchases affect earnings. At December 31, 2003, based on year-end NYMEX prices, the Company had net unrealized gains on its natural gas forward contracts of $0.8. Assuming that year-end prices were to decrease by a hypothetical 10%, the above gain would be reduced by approximately $1.2.  Interest Rate Risk: In March 2003 the Company repaid $100.0 of its outstanding borrowings. In June 2003, the Company sold $200.0 principal amount of 4.6% Notes due July 1, 2013. At December 31, 2003, the outstanding borrowings of the Company consisted of fixed rate long-term debt, which had a carrying value of $416.2, a face value of $420.0 and a fair value, based on dealer quoted values, of approximately $426.6. At December 31, 2003, the Company was a party to two interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert the interest cost on a total of $50.0 of the Company's 4.60% notes to a floating rate basis for the life of the notes. The fair value as of December 31, 2003 of the Company's interest rate swaps was $0.5.                                         27        Assuming other factors are held constant, interest rate changes generally affect the fair value of fixed rate debt. Accordingly, assuming a hypothetical increase of 1% in interest rates and all other variables remaining constant, interest expense would increase approximately $0.5 per annum and the fair market value of the fixed rate long-term debt would decrease by approximately $19.3.  OTHER  2004 OUTLOOK       In its January 22, 2004 earnings press release, which was also filed as an exhibit to a current report on Form 8K, the Company set forth its assumptions and management's best current estimate of first quarter and full year 2004 earnings at that time based on various assumptions set forth in its press release. The Company forecasted diluted earnings per share range in the range of $2.55-$2.65 for the year, a 12% -17% increase over 2003's diluted earnings per share of $2.27, before the cumulative effect of the accounting change, and first quarter diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.57-$0.62.       The Company's guidance for 2004 outlook will be updated when it reports first quarter 2004 earnings in April 2004. There can be no assurance sales or earnings will develop in the manner projected. Actual results may differ materially. See "Comments on Forward Looking Statements".  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements and changes in the estimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition.  Environmental and Other Contingent Liabilities       Accruals for environmental remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation, and other contingent liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability ahs been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are recorded at management's best estimate of the ultimate expected liabilities, without any discount to reflect the time value of money. These accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes available.       The amount accrued for environment remediation reflects the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature and cost of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties.       Included in other contingent liabilities are workers' compensation, product liability and toxic tort claims. The amount accrued for other contingent liabilities reflects the Company's assumptions about the incidence, severity, indemnity costs and dismissal rates for existing and future claims.       Accruals for environmental remediation and other contingent liabilities can change substantially if the Company's assumptions are not realized or due to actions by governmental agencies or private parties. The Company cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts. Moreover, environmental and other contingent liabilities are paid over an extended period, and the timing of such payments cannot be predicted with any certainty. Accruals for environmental and other contingent liabilities are recorded as other non current liabilities with any amounts expected to be paid out in the next twelve months classified as accrued expenses.       Probable insurance recoveries for past and probable future costs are recorded at management's best estimate of the ultimate expected receipts without discounting to reflect the time value of money and are recorded as other assets. A number of factors impact the estimates of insurance reimbursements. These factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies, the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies, how legal and defense costs will be covered by the insurance polices, the interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and the interrelationships, and the Company's historical recovery rates over the past ten years.                                         28          Defense and processing costs are expensed as incurred. Probable insurance recoveries for defense and processing costs are accrued when the related costs are incurred and are recorded as other assets.       For additional information see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedule II, "Valuation and Qualifying Accounts."  Retirement Plans       The Company sponsors defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans. The postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements. The Company's most significant pension plans are in the U. S., and constituted over 78% of the Company's consolidated pension assets and 80% of projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2003. The calculation of the Company's pension expense and pension liability associated with its defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that the Company deems to be "critical accounting estimates." Changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions. The Company believes that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets.       At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount rate to be used for pension liabilities. In estimating this rate, the Company looks to rates of return on high quality, long term corporate bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. The Company discounted its future pension liabilities using rates of 6.25% and 6.75% at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities has a significant effect on expense. For example, a change of a quarter percentage point in either direction in the discount rate would change pension expense by approximately $1.4 and postretirement benefit expense by a negligible amount.       The decrease in the discount rate assumption is expected to increase the Company's net periodic pension expense for the U. S. pension plans by approximately $3.2 million in 2004 compared to 2003. The Company's net periodic benefit expense for the U. S. postretirement welfare plans is expected to increase by approximately $0.4 million in 2004 compared to 2003.       The expected rate of return on plan assets reflects the long-term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability. The Company establishes the expected rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the Company at that time, including the historical returns of major asset classes, the expected investment mix of the plans' assets, and estimates of future long-term investment returns. The U. S. pension plan's investment mix at December 31, 2003 approximated 59% equities and 41% fixed income securities compared to 46% equities and 54% fixed income securities at December 31, 2002. Any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss. The unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss is amortized in accordance with Statement No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" ("SFAS No. 87").       The expected rate of return on assets in the U. S. pension plans is 8.5% for 2004, the same expected return as 2003. A change of a quarter percentage point in either direction in the expected rate of return on plan assets would change pension expense by approximately $0.9 and net postretirement expense by approximately $0.2 for 2004.       U. S. pension plan and postretirement plan contributions in fiscal 2004 are expected to be $17.0 and $18.6, respectively. The estimate of contributions is based on significant assumptions, such as pension plan benefit levels, interest rate levels and the amount and timing of asset returns. Actual contributions could differ from this estimate.        For additional information see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Impairment of Goodwill       The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," ("SFAS 142") effective January 1, 2002. Under SFAS 142, identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their useful life unless the useful life is determined to be indefinite. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are no longer amortized, but instead are reviewed for impairment and written down only in the periods in which it is determined that the recorded value is greater than the fair value. The Company does not have intangibles with indefinite useful lives other than goodwill.                                         29          The Company has defined its segments as its SFAS 142 reporting units. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis. Goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company uses a two-step process to test goodwill for impairment. First, the reporting unit's fair value is compared to its carrying value. The Company utilizes a market multiple approach to determine fair value estimates. Due to the cyclical nature of the Company's reporting unit's, values are determined utilizing a three year average. The three year period is comprised of the prior year, current year and one year projected amounts. If the market multiple approach yields a result, which may indicate a possible impairment, a discounted cash flow approach is utilized to more precisely determine the reporting unit's fair value. If a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired, and the second step of the impairment test would be performed. The second step of the goodwill impairment test is used to measure the amount of the impairment loss. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.       Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.       These evaluations involve amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company is not aware of reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being estimated that would have a material impact on these assessments for impairment.  Income Taxes       Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. The assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, as well as the ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, involves significant judgment in estimating future taxable income in each of the jurisdictions to which these tax benefits relate. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.       The Company intends to reinvest the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U. S. or additional non-U. S. taxes with respect to these earnings. In the event of repatriation to the U. S., such earnings would be subject to U. S. income taxes in most cases. Foreign tax credits would be available to substantially reduce the amount of U.S. tax otherwise payable in future years.                                         30      Item 8.
