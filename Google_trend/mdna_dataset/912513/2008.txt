Item 7.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the description of our business and risk factors contained in Part I of this report. Currency amounts are in millions, except per share amounts. Percentages are approximate.  GENERAL  We are a global specialty chemicals and materials company and sell our products to diverse major markets for aerospace, adhesives, automotive and industrial coatings, chemical intermediates, inks, mining and plastics. Sales price and volume by region and the impact of exchange rates on our reporting segments are important measures that are analyzed by management and are provided in our segment analysis.  In the course of our ongoing operations, a number of strategic product line acquisitions and dispositions have been made. The results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included in our consolidated results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. On February 28, 2005, we acquired the Surface Specialties business of UCB in a transaction valued at $1,789.6. In addition, on October 2, 2006, we completed the initial closing on the sale of our water treatment chemicals and acrylamide product lines for $208.0. The second and the last phase of the closings were completed during 2007. A further discussion of acquisitions and dispositions can be found in Notes 3 and 4 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein.  We also report net sales in four geographic regions: North America, Latin America, Asia/Pacific and Europe/Middle East/Africa. The destination of the sale determines the region under which it is reported consistent with management's view of the business. North America consists of the United States and Canada. Latin America includes Mexico, Central America, South America and the Caribbean Islands. Asia/Pacific is comprised of Asia, Australia and the islands of the South Pacific Rim.  Raw material cost changes year on year are an important factor in profitability especially in years of high volatility. Global oil and natural gas costs in certain countries are highly volatile and many of our raw materials are derived from these two commodities. Discussion of the year to year impact of raw materials and energy is provided in our segment discussion. In addition, higher global demand levels and, occasionally, operating difficulties at suppliers, have limited the availability of certain of our raw materials.  On January 1, 2007, we adopted FSP AUG AIR-1 retroactively and accordingly, prior financial statements have been restated. For further details see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  On January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"). For further details see Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  On January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"). For further details see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table sets forth the percentage relationship that certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income bear to net sales:          Years Ended December 31,                                   2007              2006               2005 -

International net sales were $2,315.2, $2,167.3, and $1,830.4, or 66%, 65% and 63% of total net sales, for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  For more information on our segments, refer to Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and further discussions in "Segment Results" below.  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006  Consolidated Results  Net sales for 2007 were $3,503.8 compared with $3,329.5 for 2006, up 5%, of which the divestiture of the water treatment chemicals and acrylamide product lines decreased sales 6%. Excluding the reduction due to these divestitures, sales were up 4% due to volume, 4% up due to price, and up 3% due to changes in exchange rates. Cytec Performance Chemicals selling volumes were down 17% attributable to the divestiture of the water treating chemicals product line. Excluding the divestiture, selling volumes and prices were flat and changes in exchange rates increased sales 2%. Cytec Surface Specialties selling volumes decreased 3% while selling prices increased sales 5% and changes in exchange rates increased sales 6%. Cytec Engineered Materials selling volumes increased 9% and selling prices increased 2%. Building Block Chemicals overall sales volumes were up 24% and selling prices were up 11%. Building Block Chemical sales volume declined 15% due to the divestiture of the acrylamide product line which was more than offset by a 23% increase in selling volumes of acrylonitrile to the purchaser of the divested product line.  For a detailed discussion on revenues refer to the Segment Results section below.  Manufacturing cost of sales was $2,752.9 (78.6% of net sales) compared with $2,669.6 (80.2% of net sales) for 2006. The $83.3 increase was primarily due to $112.5 of costs related to higher selling volumes, $93.0 related to higher raw material costs, and unfavorable currency exchange of $88.1. These were partially offset by a reduction in manufacturing cost of sales of $168.1 due to the divestiture of the water treatment chemicals and acrylamide product lines and benefits related to the various restructuring initiatives and the shutdown of an unprofitable manufacturing facility in Dijon, France. Also included in 2007 and 2006 manufacturing cost of sales were pre-tax costs of $5.7 and $47.6, respectively, related to restructuring, asset impairment, and pension curtailment/settlement costs. See Restructuring Activities section below and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail of the net restructuring and impairment charges.                                        -21-   Pension and other post employment benefits expense was $30.7 for 2007 versus $55.0 in 2006. The $24.3 decrease from 2006 is primarily related to lower costs due to the divestiture of the water treatment chemicals and acrylamide product lines as well as 2006 included an additional $9.2 of pension curtailments and plan settlements primarily related to European defined benefit pension plans. Pension and other post employment benefit expense is reported in the expense category that it relates to, which is primarily in manufacturing cost of sales. For a detailed discussion on employee benefit plans, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.  Selling and technical services was $212.8 in 2007 versus $215.4 in the prior year. The decrease of $2.6 was primarily due to lower costs of $15.2 due to the divestiture of the water treatment chemicals and acrylamide product lines partially offset by increases primarily due to exchange rate changes of $8.0 and increased spending principally to support future growth programs. Included in 2006 are net restructuring charges of $1.1 and a benefit plan curtailment charge as described above of $0.4.  Research and process development was $75.7 in 2007 versus $73.9 in the prior year. The increase was primarily related to changes in exchange rates of $2.6 and increased spending principally to support future growth programs. Partially offsetting this was a reduction in costs due to divestiture of the water treatment chemicals and acrylamide product lines of $3.7. Also included in 2006 are restructuring charges of $1.2.  Administrative and general expenses were $113.2 in 2007 versus $102.9 in the prior year. The increase in 2007 was primarily attributable to changes in exchange rates of $4.1, higher compensation expenses and higher professional services expenses. Included in 2006 are integration expenses of $1.4 associated with the transition from UCB's information technology system infrastructure, a benefit plan curtailment charge of $0.2 as described above and restructuring charges of $1.9.  Amortization of acquisition intangibles was $38.7 in 2007 versus $37.8 in the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to changes in exchange rates of $1.8. Included in 2006 is a write-off of $1.4 related to impaired intangibles related to an unprofitable product line manufactured in Europe.  Gain on the sale of assets was $13.6 in 2007 compared to $75.5 in 2006 and amounts in both years are related to the divestiture of the water treatment and acrylamide product lines. See Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  Other income (expense), net was expense of ($0.4) in 2007 compared with income of $12.7 in the prior year. Included in 2006 is a gain of $15.7 in connection with proceeds collected in an arbitration award in settlement of the commercial dispute as discussed in Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Equity in earnings of associated companies was $1.4 in 2007 versus $3.2 in the prior year. The decline is attributable to the lower sales at our associated company.  Interest expense, net was $41.9 in 2007 compared with $55.5 in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the lower average debt levels in 2007.  The effective income tax rate for 2007 was a tax provision of 27.1% ($76.7) compared to a tax provision of 26.1% ($69.4) for 2006. The 2007 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a shift in our earnings to higher tax jurisdictions, changes in U.S. tax laws regarding export incentives, and a French restructuring charge for which no tax benefit was given due to the unlikely utilization of related net operating losses. The rate was favorably affected by the relatively low tax expense of $0.3 with respect to the $13.6 gain recorded on the water business divestiture, U.S. manufacturing incentives and a net tax benefit of $6.3 to primarily adjust our deferred taxes for recently enacted tax legislation that lowered the corporate income tax rate in a number of jurisdictions beginning in 2008. Excluding these items and accrued interest and penalties from uncertain tax positions, the underlying estimated annual tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 29.3%, with a normalized rate of approximately 30.3% including such interest and penalties.  The 2006 effective tax rate was positively impacted by an arbitration award in settlement of a commercial dispute, a portion of which was recorded in a lower tax entity resulting in an effective rate of 20.0%, the gain on the divestiture of the water treatment and acrylamide product lines recorded at a 21% rate, and a reduction in tax expense of $3.5 as a result of the completion of prior years U.S. tax audits. The rate was also favorably impacted by the change in statutory tax rates with respect to deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded in certain countries. These results were partially offset by a reduction of earnings of divested product lines in lower tax jurisdictions, the zero tax benefit on a French restructuring charge due to insufficient earnings to realize its net deferred tax asset, a tax benefit from a restructuring charge recorded at 29.6% and a $1.7 tax charge associated with a capital reduction with respect to a foreign subsidiary. In 2006 a tax benefit of $0.7 was allocated to the cumulative effect of accounting change. Excluding these items, the underlying annual tax rate for 2006 was 26.8%.  Net earnings for 2007 were $206.5 ($4.20 per diluted share) compared with net earnings of $195.2 ($4.01 per diluted share) in 2006. Included in 2007 results were an after-tax gain of $13.3 ($0.27 per diluted share) on the sale of the water treatment chemicals product line to Kemira, a $6.3 benefit for tax adjustments primarily related to tax rate changes in various jurisdictions ($0.13 per diluted share) and net restructuring charges of $5.0 after-tax charge ($0.10 per diluted share). The improvement in net earnings is primarily related to the net effect of the aforementioned items, higher selling volumes, and increased selling prices partially offset by higher raw materials, higher operating expenses as discussed above, and a smaller gain on the product line divestiture as compared to 2006.                                        -22-   Included in the 2006 results are an after-tax gain of $59.6 ($1.23 per diluted share) related to the first phase of the sale of the water treatment and acrylamide product lines, after-tax net restructuring and impairment charges of $40.6 ($0.84 per diluted share), an after-tax charge of $1.6 ($0.03 per diluted share) related to completion of a detailed update of our asbestos contingent liability, net of insurance recoveries, after-tax costs of $1.3 ($0.03 per diluted share) related to Surface Specialties integration, an after-tax gain of $12.4 ($0.26 per diluted share) related to a favorable resolution of a legal dispute, an after-tax charge of $1.9 ($0.04 per diluted share) related to a change in employee benefit plans in the U.K., and the cumulative effect of an accounting change after-tax charge of $1.2 ($0.02 per diluted share) related to the adoption of SFAS 123R.

On a regional basis, North America sales volumes declined across all product lines primarily due to weaker market demand while the sales volume increase in Latin America was primarily attributable to the mining chemicals product line as a result of increased demand. The Asia/Pacific volume increase is primarily due to higher demand levels for mining chemicals and the specialty additives product lines.  Earnings from operations were $71.1, or 10% of sales, compared with $68.4 or 8% of sales in 2006. The $2.7 increase in earnings is primarily attributable to slightly higher selling prices of $2.6, favorable volume/mix of approximately $7.9 due to higher sales of more profitable product lines, favorable changes in exchange rates of $4.3 and cost reduction of $10.0 primarily due to savings from restructuring activities. These were partially offset by higher raw material costs of approximately $14.4, higher operating costs of $5.0, and the loss of $2.7 of profitability associated with the divested water treatment product line.

Volumes increased in Asia/Pacific due to strong demand for liquid coating resins and Radcure resins partially offset by lower powder coating resins where we gave up low profit business. In Latin America volumes were up across all product lines principally due to improved demand. Overall selling prices increased 5%. Selling prices for liquid coating and powder coating resins were higher in all regions while Radcure prices were up in Europe and Asia/Pacific but down in North America and Latin America.                                        -23-   Earnings from operations were $99.7, or 6% of sales, compared with earnings from operations of $95.5, or 6% of sales in 2006. The $4.2 increase in earnings is primarily attributable to higher selling prices of $73.8 and changes in exchange rates with a favorable impact of approximately $4.6. These were partially offset by higher raw material costs of $46.9, lower selling volumes of $15.8, and higher manufacturing and operating expenses of $12.0.

Overall selling volumes increased 9% primarily due to higher sales to the large commercial aircraft sector across most regions predominantly related to higher production levels on the existing Boeing and other aircraft programs and ramp up of the 787 program as well as higher sales to the business jet sector and launch vehicle sector for the crew launch vehicle partially offset by lower sales to Airbus. The increase in Asia/Pacific sales selling volumes were primarily due to the aforementioned increases in build-rates in the large commercial aircraft sector.  Earnings from operations were $132.3, or 20% of sales, compared with $106.0, or 18% of sales, in 2006. The $26.3 increase in earnings is primarily attributable to higher volumes of $32.8 and higher selling prices of $11.5. These increases were partially offset by higher manufacturing and operating expenses of $14.9 related to the higher manufacturing volumes as well as additional spending to support future growth programs, higher raw materials of $2.6, and changes in exchange rates with an unfavorable impact of $3.1. Operating earnings in 2006 included a $2.4 charge related to the curtailment/settlement of a U.K. pension plan.

Overall sales volumes were up 24%. Sales volume declined 15% due to the divestiture of the acrylamide product line which was more than offset by a 23% increase in selling volumes of acrylonitrile to the purchaser of the divested product line. Acrylonitrile is the key raw material to make acrylamide and prior to the divestiture our internal uses of acrylonitrile to make acrylamide were treated as internal transfers. Sales volumes were also up another 16% primarily due to increased capacity available following our takeover of the melamine manufacturing facility in August 2006, which previously was a 50-50 joint venture with a third party and higher demand levels for acrylonitrile. Sales volumes were up in all regions except Asia/Pacific where they were flat. Acrylonitrile volumes were up in 2007 as some shipments in late December 2006 were delayed to 2007 due to weather conditions in the Gulf Coast of the U.S. as well as the acrylonitrile manufacturing facility shutdown in 2006 due to a scheduled maintenance turnaround. Overall selling prices were up 11% with higher prices in acrylonitrile and melamine. Prices were up in all regions as they trended with increases in the raw material prices and higher demand.  Earnings from operations were $23.8, or 5% of sales, compared with $19.8, or 6% of sales, in 2006. The $4.0 increase in earnings is primarily attributable to selling price increases of $36.7 and a $37.0 positive impact from higher selling volumes of acrylonitrile and melamine. These were partially offset by lower earnings of $9.3 due to the divestiture of the acrylamide product line, $29.1 of higher raw material costs as well as $32.0 of higher manufacturing costs related to the higher volumes and acquiring 100% of the melamine manufacturing facility discussed above.                                         -24-   YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005  Consolidated Results  Net sales for 2006 were $3,329.5 compared with $2,925.7 for 2005, up 14%, of which 7% was due to the inclusion of sales from Surface Specialties for a full year (acquired on February 28, 2005). The divestiture of the water treatment and acrylamide product lines on October 1, 2006 decreased sales 2%. Excluding these two factors, selling volumes were up 6%, selling prices increased 2% and changes in exchange rates increased sales 1%. Cytec Performance Chemicals experienced a net increase in sales which resulted primarily from higher selling volumes, the addition of sales of the acquired pressure sensitive adhesives and polyurethanes product lines of Surface Specialties as well as from selling price increases. This was partially offset by decreased sales due to the divestiture of the water treatment chemicals product line. Cytec Surface Specialties experienced a net increase in sales which resulted primarily from the addition of sales related to the acquired product lines of Surface Specialties for a full year and higher selling volumes. The Cytec Engineered Materials sales increase was principally volume related, primarily from increased sales to the large commercial transport and commercial rotorcraft sectors. Building Block Chemicals sales increased from higher selling volumes and selling prices, partially offset by decreased sales due to the divestiture of the acrylamide product line. Net sales and operating results for the Building Blocks segment in 2005 were significantly impacted by the effects of hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the U.S. gulf coast.  For a detailed discussion on revenues refer to the Segment Results section below.  Manufacturing cost of sales was $2,669.6 compared with $2,312.1 for 2005. Most of the increase is associated with higher selling volumes, the inclusion of expenses for a full year relating to Surface Specialties, higher raw material costs of $60.3, unfavorable currency exchange on raw materials and energy of $12.5, partially offset by reduction in manufacturing cost of sales due to the October 1, 2006 divestiture of the water treatment chemicals and acrylamide product lines. The results for 2006 also include an impairment and restructuring charge of $22.1 related to the Polymer Additives product line, an impairment and restructuring charge of $20.9 for an unprofitable manufacturing facility in France, a charge of $1.0 for restructuring of a manufacturing site in the U.S., a $2.2 net increase in asbestos related contingent liabilities, a $2.6 charge related to a change in employee benefit plans in the U.K., and a charge of $2.0 related to stock options and stock-settled SARS due to the application of SFAS 123R. These were partially offset by a net restructuring charge reversal of $0.7. See restructuring section below for additional detail of the net restructuring and impairment charges. The 2005 results include $20.8 of amortization of the excess of the fair value of the finished goods inventory for the acquired Surface Specialties business over normal manufacturing cost.  Pension expense increased $20.8 principally as a result of a full year of expense for the additional plans and employees acquired upon the Surface Specialties acquisition in 2005, curtailments and settlements, and to a lesser extent, the lowering of the discount rate at the beginning of 2006 in the U.S. by 0.15% to reflect current market rates on fixed income securities. Pension expense is primarily reported in manufacturing cost of sales.  Selling and technical services was $215.4 in 2006 versus $213.6 in the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of expenses for a full year relating to Surface Specialties and charges related to stock options and stock-settled SARS due to the application of SFAS 123R of $3.2. Partially offsetting this was a reduction in costs due to the divestiture of the water treatment chemicals and acrylamide product lines. Also included in 2006 are net restructuring charges of $1.1 and a benefit plan curtailment charge as described above of $0.4. Included in amounts for 2005 was $3.5 for employee severance costs.  Research and process development was $73.9 in 2006 versus $68.5 in the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of expenses for a full year relating to Surface Specialties and charges related to stock options and stock-settled SARS due to the application of SFAS 123R of $0.6. Partially offsetting this was a reduction in costs due to divestiture of the water treatment chemicals and acrylamide product lines. Also included in 2006 are restructuring charges of $1.0. Included in amounts for 2005 are restructuring charges of $0.8.  Administrative and general expenses were $102.9 in 2006 versus $102.1 in the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of expenses for a full year relating to Surface Specialties and charges related to stock options and stock-settled SARS due to the application of SFAS 123R of $4.6. Also included in 2006 are integration expenses of $1.4 associated with transitioning away from UCB's information technology system infrastructure, a benefit plan curtailment charge of $0.2 as described above and restructuring charges of $1.8. Included in amounts for 2005 are employee severance costs of $7.3 and a charge of $2.4 related to the settlement of a litigation matter.  Amortization of acquisition intangibles was $37.8 in 2006 versus $30.3 in the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of amortization expense for a full year relating to Surface Specialties, the write-off of $1.4 related to impaired intangibles related to an unprofitable product line manufactured in Europe and $0.6 of higher amortization of certain Radcure trademarks due to a change in their estimated useful lives.                                        -25-   The write-off of acquired in-process research and development of $37.0 in the prior year was related to the Surface Specialties acquisition.  The divestiture gain of $75.5 is attributable to the phase one closing of the water treatment and acrylamide product lines. See Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  Other income (expense), net was income of $12.7 in 2006 compared with expense of $44.9 in the prior year. Included in 2006 is a gain of $15.7 in connection with proceeds collected in an arbitration award in settlement of the commercial dispute as discussed in Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Included in 2005 is a loss of $44.2 related to derivative contracts entered to hedge currency and interest rate exposure associated with the acquisition of Surface Specialties and a charge of $4.4 for a settlement to resolve a dispute over an environmental matter.  Equity in earnings of associated companies was $3.2 versus $7.9 in the prior year. On June 1, 2005, we sold our 50% ownership stake in CYRO Industries ("CYRO") to our joint venture partner Degussa Specialty Polymers, a company of Degussa AG, which subsequently reduced our equity earnings.  Interest expense, net was $55.5 in 2006 compared with $80.0 in the prior year. The amount for 2005 includes $21.0 of interest charges and $1.0 of unamortized put premiums and rate lock agreements related to the optional redemption of the Mandatory Par Put Remarketed Securities (MOPPRS) in May 2005. Excluding these 2005 charges, interest expense is down due to the reduction in the outstanding weighted-average debt balance during 2006 as we used our free cash flow and proceeds from the divestiture to pay down debt.  The effective income tax rate for 2006 was a tax provision of 26.1% ($69.4) compared to a tax benefit of 30.6% ($13.8) for 2005. The 2006 effective rate was positively impacted by an arbitration award in settlement of a commercial dispute, a portion of which was recorded in a lower tax entity resulting in an effective rate of 20%. Also favorably impacting the rate was a 21% tax rate associated with the gain on the divestiture of the water treatment and acrylamide product lines and a $3.5 reduction of tax expense as a result of the completion of prior years U.S. tax audits. The rate was also favorably impacted by the change in statutory tax rates with respect to deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded in certain countries. These results were partially offset by a reduction of earnings of divested product lines in lower tax jurisdictions, the zero tax benefit on a French restructuring charge due to insufficient earnings to realize its net deferred tax asset, a tax benefit from a restructuring charge recorded at 29.6% and a $1.7 tax charge associated with a capital reduction with respect to a foreign subsidiary. Excluding these items, the underlying annual tax rate for 2006 was 26.8%.  The 2005 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by hedging losses incurred in the U.S. in connection with the Surface Specialties acquisition, the MOPPRS redemption, and reduction in tax expense of $12.2 due to partial resolution of a tax audit in Norway and a reduction in income tax expense of $16.2 related to final approval of the Internal Revenue Service's examination of our tax returns for the years 1999 through 2001. The rate was unfavorably impacted by the write-off of acquired in-process research and development expenses related to the Surface Specialties acquisition, for which there is no tax benefit. Excluding these items, the underlying annual tax rate for 2005 would have been 26%.  Earnings from discontinued operations were $1.2 in 2005 and reflect the results of Surface Specialties amino resins ("SSAR") product line. SSAR was divested on August 31, 2005.  The adoption of SFAS 123R was recorded as of January 1, 2006 and resulted in a non-cash charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $1.2, net of tax benefit of $0.7.  Net earnings for 2006 were $195.2 ($4.01 per diluted share) compared with net earnings for 2005 of $60.1 ($1.30 per diluted share). Included in the 2006 results are an after-tax gain of $59.6 ($1.23 per diluted share) related to the first phase of the sale of the water treatment and acrylamide product lines, after-tax net restructuring and impairment charges of $40.6 ($0.84 per diluted share), an after-tax charge of $1.6 ($0.03 per diluted share) related to completion of a detailed update of our asbestos contingent liability, net of insurance recoveries, after-tax costs of $1.3 ($0.03 per diluted share) related to Surface Specialties integration, an after-tax gain of $12.4 ($0.26 per diluted share) related to a favorable resolution of a legal dispute, an after-tax charge of $1.9 ($0.04 per diluted share) related to a change in employee benefit plans in the U.K. and the cumulative effect of an accounting change after-tax charge of $1.2 ($0.02 per diluted share) related to the adoption of SFAS 123R. The improvement in net earnings is primarily related to the net effect of the aforementioned special items, higher selling volumes, increased selling prices, inclusion of a full year of earnings from Surface Specialties, increased production levels and the benefits of our recent restructuring initiatives partially offset by higher raw material costs.                                        -26-    Net earnings for 2005 included the write-off of $37.0 ($0.80 per diluted share) of in-process research and development costs; a $15.2 ($0.33 per diluted share) after-tax amortization charge from the write-up to fair value of the acquired inventory that was subsequently sold; $0.1 after-tax integration costs related to the acquired business; a charge of $1.8 ($0.04 per diluted share) after-tax for settlement of a certain litigation matter; $12.4 ($0.27 per diluted share) after-tax employee restructuring costs; a $3.2 ($0.07 per diluted share) settlement to resolve a dispute over an environmental matter; $14.0 ($0.30 per diluted share) after-tax interest charges and unamortized put premiums related to the redemption of the MOPPRS prior to their final maturity; a $28.1 ($0.61 per diluted share) after-tax charge related to currency and interest rate derivative transactions associated with the Surface Specialties acquisition, all of which were partially offset by the higher overall sales attributable to the acquisition; and an income tax benefit of $28.4 ($0.61 per diluted share) reflecting favorable resolution of tax audits with respect to prior year tax returns.   Segment Results (Sales to external customers)  Year-to-year comparisons and analyses of changes in net sales by segment and region are set forth below.

This was partially offset by decreased selling volumes primarily in the specialty urethanes product line due to competitive price pressure. The inclusion of full year sales attributable to pressure sensitive adhesives and polyurethane product lines of Surface Specialties added 2% to sales and the divestiture of the water treatment chemicals product line decreased sales 5%. On a regional basis, North America sales volumes declined primarily in water treatment chemicals due to low demand from the paper sector and our decision to reduce sales on low profit accounts and in urethane specialties due to a technology shift in the market that affected our customer. The sales volume increase in Asia/Pacific is primarily in mining chemicals and phosphines mostly due to higher demand levels. Sales volume in Europe/Middle East/Africa increased 11% as a result of overall improved demand.  Earnings from operations were $68.4, or 8% of sales, compared with $56.6 or 7% of sales in 2005. The increase in earnings is primarily attributable to increased selling volumes, slightly higher selling prices, benefits of restructuring initiatives and the inclusion of the full year Surface Specialties product lines. Partially offsetting these were higher raw material costs of $28.1, the divestiture of the water treatment chemicals product line and expense of $3.6 for stock options and stock-settled SARS related to SFAS 123R. 2005 results also included $2.6 for the excess of the fair value of the finished goods inventory over normal manufacturing cost related to the Surface Specialties acquisition and $7.0 of in-process research and development cost write-offs related to the Surface Specialties acquisition.

The inclusion of full year sales attributable to Surface Specialties added $192.0 to sales. In North America volumes declined due to reduced demand levels from the automotive and architectural sectors in the liquid coating resins product line. In Asia/Pacific and Europe/Middle East/Africa volumes increased 19% and 7%, respectively, due to improved demand and new business. Selling prices declined in Asia primarily due to price competition in lower technology products.                                        -27-   Earnings from operations were $95.5, or 6% of sales, compared with earnings from operations of $22.0, or 2% of sales in 2005. The increase in earnings is primarily attributable to the increased selling volumes, the benefits of restructuring initiatives and the inclusion of a full year results from Surface Specialties. Partially offsetting these are higher raw material costs of $7.8 which were not offset by selling price increases and expense of $3.2 for stock options and stock-settled SARS related to SFAS 123R. 2005 results include the write-off of in-process research and development costs of $30.1 and a charge of $18.2 for the excess of the fair value of the finished goods inventory over normal manufacturing cost related to the Surface Specialties acquisition.

Overall selling volumes increased 9% primarily from higher sales to the large commercial aircraft, rotorcraft and business jet sector partially offset by lower sales in the high performance auto sector due to the completion of a program in early 2006 and lower sales to the launch vehicle sector. Net selling prices increased 2% due to price increases in all regions and across a number of markets. North America, Europe, and Asia/Pacific sales volumes increased 6%, 8%, and 45%, respectively, with the increases coming primarily from the large commercial aircraft and military sectors due to increased aircraft build rates.  Earnings from operations were $106.0, or 18% of sales, compared with $103.0, or 19% of sales, in 2005. The impact of the increased sales volume and prices on operating earnings was partially offset by increased raw material costs of $9.7, increased costs in manufacturing to support the higher production volumes, some plant inefficiencies, planned higher technical service and research expenses, lower production rates in one of our carbon fiber plants due to trial runs of new product and costs to startup a carbon fiber manufacturing line that was previously idled. Also included is expense of $2.4 for stock options and stock-settled SARS related to SFAS 123R and a $2.4 pension curtailment charge due to a change from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution pension plan in the U.K.  Building Block Chemicals                - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                      % Change Due to                                                                                             ----------------------------------------                                                                      Total                                         2006         2005          % Change       Price       Volume/Mix     Divestiture    Currency - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ North America                         $  177.6     $  149.2            19%          7%             14%            -2%            - Latin America(1)                           4.7          4.9            -            -               -             -              - Asia/Pacific                              26.9         50.3           -46%          3%            -49%            -              - Europe/Middle East/Africa                130.0         79.8            63%         17%             58%           -13%            1%                                      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                                   $339.2       $284.2            19%          9%             15%            -5%            - - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ (1)  Due to the level of sales in this geographic region, percentage comparisons      are not meaningful.   Overall sales volumes are 10% higher and selling prices are 9% higher, both primarily related to acrylonitrile. The divestiture of the acrylamide product line on October 1, 2006 reduced sales 5% but was more than fully offset by increased sales of acrylonitrile to the purchaser of the acrylamide product line. Acrylonitrile is the key raw material to make acrylamide and prior to the divestiture our internal uses of acrylonitrile to make acrylamide were treated as internal transfers, and our internal uses of acrylamide to make certain of our divested water treating chemicals were treated as intersegment sales. After the divestiture, acrylonitrile used to make acrylamide is now a third party sale and for the year this added 7% to sales. After excluding the above, selling volumes increased 8% from the prior year when volumes were adversely impacted due to plant shutdowns as a result of the hurricanes in the U.S. gulf coast in the third quarter of 2005. On a regional basis selling volumes in Asia/Pacific were down due to sluggish demand for acrylonitrile for use in upgrading to acrylic fiber. Selling volumes in Europe/Middle East/Africa improved due to increased demand for imported acrylonitrile as a result of reduced regional supply. Selling prices were up overall due to acrylonitrile and acrylamide as they trended with increases in raw material costs.  Earnings from operations were $19.8, or 6% of sales, compared with $7.3, or 3% of sales, in 2005. The increase in earnings reflects the higher selling volumes (some due to the impact of the aforementioned hurricanes in 2005) and higher selling prices. This was partially offset by higher raw material costs of $14.7, inefficiencies on lower melamine production, difficulties in our sulfuric acid plant operations and higher costs due to a two week scheduled acrylonitrile plant outage in the first quarter of 2006. Also included is expense of $1.2 for stock options and stock-settled SARS related to SFAS 123R.                                        -28-   RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES  In accordance with our accounting policy, restructuring costs are included in our corporate unallocated operating results for segment reporting purposes consistent with management's view of its businesses.  In 2007, we recorded total net restructuring charges of $6.2 ($5.0 after-tax), which were charged to expense as follows: manufacturing cost of sales $5.7, and administrative and general of $0.5.  Details of 2007 restructuring initiatives are as follows:  We decided to cease manufacturing of several mature products at our Willow Island, West Virginia plant. The discontinued products were part of the polymer additives business in our Cytec Performance Chemicals segment. As a result, we recorded a restructuring charge of $2.6 to 2007 manufacturing cost of sales primarily related to severance and other benefits for 63 employees who are expected to be retained through May 2008. This charge also included the write-off of excess raw materials and spare parts. An additional restructuring charge of $2.9 to manufacturing cost of sales is expected to occur in the first half of 2008. This relates to the remainder of the severance and other benefits which will be accrued as they are earned as well as decontamination expenses which will be expensed as incurred. Minimal savings from this restructuring initiative were realized in 2007. A one-time cash benefit of $17.2 from working capital reductions is expected to be realized through the first quarter of 2009. Once all actions have taken place in 2008, annualized before tax savings from these restructuring initiatives are projected to be $1.2. These benefits are net of lost earnings due to an annual sales reduction of $31.5.  We also announced the restructuring of our liquid coating resins plant in Wallingford, Connecticut in order to exit a mature product line and consolidate and automate certain operations at the site. Liquid coating resins are part of the Cytec Surface Specialties segment. We recorded a restructuring charge of $1.4 to 2007 manufacturing cost of sales relating to severance and other benefits for 31 employees. An additional restructuring charge of $0.4 is expected to be recorded in 2008, primarily related to the remainder of the severance and other benefits which will be accrued as they are earned. The economic benefit of this restructuring is derived from the combination of ceasing operations of one manufacturing line and supplying the volume on a consolidated operating basis. A one-time cash benefit of $1.7 from working capital reductions is expected to be realized from this initiative, of which $1.0 was realized in 2007. Annualized before tax benefits of $4.7 are projected to be realized beginning in 2008 as a result of this restructuring initiative, of which $0.5 was realized in 2007. These benefits are net of lost earnings due to an annual sales reduction of $6.8. Asset retirements on both these projects will be recorded when production ceases and will be charged to the composite depreciation reserve in accordance with our accounting policy. The remaining reserve relating to this restructuring initiative is expected to be paid by 2009.  We also incurred additional net restructuring charges of $2.2 in 2007 relating to restructurings initiatives announced in 2006 and 2005. These charges were comprised of $2.5 related to the Dijon restructuring and a net credit of $0.3 related to lower costs than anticipated for prior restructuring initiatives. In addition, a non-cash charge of $0.3 was recognized and cash payments of $11.5 were incurred for the 2006 restructuring initiatives.  In 2006, we recorded total restructuring charges of $51.1 ($42.3 after-tax) in connection with several restructuring initiatives, including related asset impairments of $29.3 ($24.6 after-tax). In the aggregate these costs were charged to expense as follows: manufacturing cost of sales $45.2, selling and technical services $2.0, administrative and general $1.5, research and process development $1.0, and amortization of acquisition intangibles $1.4.  Details of 2006 restructuring initiatives are as follows:  Based on forecasted cash flow information, we determined that our manufacturing facility in Dijon, France and related intangible assets were impaired. This facility manufactured solventborne alkyd and solventborne acrylic based resins for our Cytec Surface Specialties segment, which are used in the coating industry for sale in the European market. These mature products were in a declining market with supplier overcapacity with severe price erosion and were generating losses. We recorded an impairment charge of $15.5 to write-down the carrying value of the manufacturing facility and related intangible assets down to zero as we did not believe the assets were saleable and the outlook for recovery of products it manufactured was not positive. Also in 2006, after the appropriate consultations with the Works Council, we decided to close the facility and commence shutdown activities. At that time, we recorded a restructuring charge of $8.4, based on estimated severance costs for eliminating 60 positions at our Dijon, France manufacturing site. In addition, we recorded a net restructuring charge of $1.5 primarily for the severance costs for eliminating 8 positions at our Indian Orchard, Massachusetts site, and 16 positions at our leased facilities in New Castle, Delaware, which operations have relocated to our new manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The restructuring was charged as follows: manufacturing cost of sales $7.8, selling and technical services $0.6, research and process development $0.5, and administrative and general $1.0. No payments were made in 2006. In 2007, the Dijon restructuring reserve was reduced by $7.7 for cash payments primarily related to severance and the balance is expected to be paid by the beginning of 2009. In addition, a non-cash charge of $0.3 for asset impairment at the Indian Orchard facility was charged against the reserve and all cash payments for severance of the 8 positions in Indian Orchard and 16 positions in New Castle were made in 2007 for a total of $1.3 and the reserve is now depleted. This decision resulted in a reduction in annual revenues of approximately $24.0; however, net annual before tax benefits of approximately $2.9 were expected to begin in 2007 as a result of these restructuring initiatives. Savings realized in 2007 were $2.4 and are projected to be $2.9 beginning in 2008.                                        -29-   We recorded a restructuring charge of $22.5 of which $13.8 related to the impairment of fixed assets in Botlek related to our polymer additives product line in our Cytec Performance Chemicals segment and the remainder related to the elimination of 38 positions. This initiative includes the cessation of manufacturing of two light stabilizer products in Botlek. Manufacture of one of these products, which had sales of approximately $12.0 in 2005, has been consolidated at our facility in West Virginia; the other product, representing 2005 sales of approximately $6.0, has been exited. The restructuring costs included estimated cash severance, reduction of prepaid pensions and retirement of fixed assets and were charged as follows: manufacturing cost of sales $22.1, and selling expense $0.4. In 2007, this restructuring reserve was reduced by $1.6 for cash payments primarily related to severance and the balance of the reserve is expected to be paid in 2008. Expected annualized savings of approximately $6.5 were realized in 2007 from this restructuring initiative.  We also recorded restructuring charges of $3.2 related to the elimination of 35 positions associated with our Cytec Specialty Chemicals segments as we continue our efforts to take advantage of synergies from the 2005 acquisition, and to mitigate continuing costs related to the 2006 divestiture of our water treatment chemicals and acrylamide product lines. The restructuring costs, which were primarily severance related, were charged to expense as follows: manufacturing cost of sales $1.3, selling and technical services $0.9, research and process development $0.5 and administrative and general $0.5. In 2007, cash payments primarily related to severance of $0.9 were made and the remaining reserve is expected to be paid by 2009. Expected annualized savings of approximately $5.9 were realized in 2007 as a result of these restructuring initiatives.  In 2005, we recorded aggregate restructuring charges of $16.8, principally related to our formation of Cytec Specialty Chemicals whereby we combined our specialty chemicals product lines into one organization. As a result of 2005 restructuring initiatives, a total of 136 positions were eliminated. Of the 136 positions, 22 were related to our Cytec Engineered Materials segment and 114 were related to our Cytec Specialty Chemicals segments. In 2007, all payments relating to severance for the Cytec Engineered Materials segment were completed. The remaining 2005 restructuring reserve balance relates to severance for the Cytec Specialty Chemicals segment which will be paid through 2009. See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further summary of the restructuring charges.  LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  At December 31, 2007, our cash balance was $76.8 compared with $23.6 at year end 2006.  Cash flows provided by operating activities were $269.8 compared with $201.0 for 2006. A significant portion of the improvement over the prior year is attributable to increased earnings. In 2007, trade accounts receivables increased $38.8 due to higher sales levels. Inventories increased $21.7 due to higher overall raw material costs and, in the Specialty Materials segment, higher inventory levels to meet increasing demand. Other receivables decreased $10.1 which includes payments received for certain supplier rebates of $1.9, and insurance and claim recoveries of $4.1. Other liabilities decreased $51.5 principally due to contributions to our pension and post retirement plans net of accrued expenses of $44.1.  Cash flows used in investing activities were $76.1 for 2007 compared with cash flows provided by investing activities of $104.1 for 2006. In 2006, we received $206.6, net of cash transaction costs, for the completion of the first of three phases of the sale of our water treatment chemicals and acrylamide product lines. In 2007, we received $38.7 for the second and third phases of the aforementioned divestiture. Capital spending for 2007 was $114.8, which compares to $102.5 in 2006 with most of the increase due to capacity expansions in waterborne and Radcure resins, engineering work on a new carbon fiber line, and new safety and compliance initiatives.  Net cash flows used in financing activities were $144.0 in 2007 compared with $354.4 for 2006. The 2007 financing cash flows were driven by net debt repayments of $99.0 and treasury stock repurchases of 1,252,800 shares for $77.3. These were partially offset by proceeds received on the exercise of stock options of $39.3 and excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements of $11.7. During 2006, we had net debt repayments of $391.4, which were partially offset by proceeds received on the exercise of stock options of $45.0 and excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements of $10.7. In June 2007, we amended and restated our revolving credit agreement to increase the facility from $350.0 to $400.0, and extend the maturity date to June 2012. There was no borrowing against the $400.0 unsecured five-year revolving credit facility at December 31, 2007. Also at December 31, 2007, we had $104.6 of non-U.S. credit facilities, with outstanding borrowings of $46.3.                                        -30-   In February 2007, we announced the reinstatement of our stock buyback program authorized in 2003. Approximately $69.0 remained authorized under the buyback program as of that date. In December 2007, we completed that authorization and announced a new authorization to repurchase up to an additional $100.0 of our outstanding common stock. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $92 remained authorized under our new stock buyback program. The repurchases are made from time to time on the open market or in private transactions and the shares obtained under this authorization are anticipated to be utilized for stock option plans, benefit plans and other corporate purposes.  As of December 31, 2007, our total debt of $848.7 is denominated approximately 59% in Euros, 38% in dollars and the balance in other currencies, after taking into account Euro/U.S. dollar cross currency swaps.  During 2007, we paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per common share which aggregated $19.1. On January 30, 2008, the Board of Directors increased the regular dividend rate by 25% and declared a $0.125 per common share cash dividend, payable on February 25, 2008 to shareholders of record as of February 11, 2008.  We believe that we have the ability to fund our operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures and dividends as well as the ability to meet our debt service requirements for the foreseeable future from existing cash and from internal cash generation. However, from time to time, based on such factors as local tax regulations, prevailing interest rates and our plans for capital investment or other investments, it may make economic sense to utilize our existing credit lines in order to meet those cash requirements, which may include debt-service related disbursements. We have a $100.0 scheduled debt payment due March 15, 2008, which we intend to repay using a combination of our cash and, if necessary, part of our unused revolver.  We have not guaranteed any indebtedness of our unconsolidated associated company.  Excluding the impact of increasing raw materials costs, inflation is not considered significant since the rate of inflation has remained relatively low in recent years and investments in areas of the world where inflation poses a significant risk are limited. The impact of increasing raw material costs are discussed under "Customers and Suppliers" in "Business" in Item 1, herein.  Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  The following table sets forth our contractual obligations under long-term agreements as of December 31, 2007:              - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              Payments Due by Period                                     --------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       Less Than                                     More than Contractual Obligations                    Total         1 Year      1-3 Years      3-5 Years         5 Years - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Long-term debt                           $ 806.3         $101.5         $252.9            $ -         $ 451.9 Interest payments (1)                     $186.8          $38.2          $60.4          $37.0           $51.2 Operating leases                           $65.3          $15.1          $18.7           $9.6           $21.9 Pension and postretirement    plans obligations (2)                   $49.2          $49.2 Purchase obligations                       $41.9          $19.2          $13.4           $6.8            $2.5 Other noncurrent liabilities (3):    Environmental liabilities (2)            $7.4           $7.4    Cross currency swap (4)                $112.2                         $56.1                          $56.1                                     -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                                  $ 1,269.1         $230.6        $ 401.5         $ 53.4         $ 583.6 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   (1)  Includes variable interest rate payments on $42.0 of debt using the LIBOR      rates at December 31, 2007. (2)  Expected cash flows for our pension and postretirement plans obligations      and environmental liabilities for years beyond 2008 were excluded as      specific payment dates could not be reasonably estimated. Amounts reflected      to be paid in less than one year are based on our budget and actual amounts      paid in 2008 may vary significantly for pension. See notes 13      (environmental) and 15 (pension) for more information on these liabilities. (3)  Included in other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets      at December 31, 2007, were $70.1 of contingent liabilities (principally      asbestos related liabilities) and $45.7 of asset retirement obligations. As      specific payment dates for these items are unknown, the related balances      have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Period" section of the      table above. (4)  Related balances are based on unfavorable fair values (at December 31, 2007      exchange rate) of the foreign exchange component of the cross currency      swaps. Actual cash flows upon settlements will be based on the fair values      on the related maturity dates.  As of December 31, 2007, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits (FIN 48 liabilities) was $42.4 (gross). As specific payment dates can not be reasonably estimated, the related balances have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Period" section of the table above.                                        -31-   We had net contractual commitments under currency forward contracts in U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of $118.1, that all settle in less than one year. (Refer to Item 7A as well as Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein).  We had $39.7 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees at December 31, 2007 that are issued on our behalf in the ordinary course of business to support certain of our performance obligations and commitments. The instruments are typically renewed on an annual basis.  We do not have any unconsolidated limited purpose entities or any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities.                                          -32-   Item 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward-looking analysis. Currencies are in millions.  Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings.  In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to various market risks, including fluctuations in currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates. To manage the exposure related to these risks, we may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with our established policies. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Moreover, we enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly-rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties, thereby limiting exposure to credit-related and performance-related risks.  Currency Risk: We periodically enter into currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity. At December 31, 2007, the principal transactions hedged involved accounts receivable, accounts payable and intercompany loans. When hedging currency exposures, our practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure, and therefore, the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value, cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction.  At December 31, 2007, the currency and net contractual amounts of forward contracts outstanding translated into U.S. dollar equivalent amounts were as follows:                December 31, 2007                                                          Buy - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------          Sell          U.S. Dollar       Euro         Pound Sterling    Australian Dollar  Canadian Dollar    Others - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ U.S. Dollar            $         -   $          11.1   $          13.7  $              15.0   $       31.7  $        6.4 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Pound Sterling         $         -   $           5.4                 -                    -              -             - - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Japanese Yen           $       7.6   $             -                 -                    -              -             - - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Malaysian Ringgit      $         -   $           4.9                 -                    -              -             - - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Norwegian Krone        $       7.2   $             -                 -                    -              -             - - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Taiwan Dollar          $       7.4   $             -                 -                    -              -             - - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Others                 $       3.6   $           4.1                 -                    -              -             - - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   The favorable fair value of currency contracts, based on exchange rates at December 31, 2007, was approximately $1.3. Assuming that year-end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical 10%, the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year-end would decrease by approximately $11.3. However, since these contracts hedge specific transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged.  In September, 2005, we entered into (euro)207.9 of five year cross currency swaps and (euro)207.9 of ten year cross currency swaps to effectively convert the five-year notes and ten-year notes into Euro-denominated liabilities. The swaps included an initial exchange of $500.0 on October 4, 2005 and will require final principal exchanges of $250.0 on each settlement date of the five-year and ten-year notes (October 1, 2010 and October 1, 2015), respectively. At the initial principal exchange, we paid U.S. dollars to counterparties and received Euros. Upon final exchange, we will provide Euros to counterparties and receive U.S. dollars. The swaps also call for a semi-annual exchange of fixed Euro interest payments for fixed U.S. dollar interest receipts. With respect to the five year swaps, we will receive 5.5% per annum and will pay 3.78% per annum on each April 1 and October 1, through the maturity date of the five year swaps. With respect to the ten year swaps, we will receive 6.0% per annum and will pay 4.52% per annum on each April 1 and October 1, through the maturity date of the ten year swaps. The cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the changes in value of the future Euro interest and principal receipts that results from changes in the U.S. dollar to Euro exchange rates on certain Euro denominated intercompany receivables we have with one of our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the five and ten year swaps were $(39.8) and $(31.4), respectively. Assuming other factors are held constant, a hypothetical increase/decrease of 10% in the Euro exchange rate would cause an increase/decrease of approximately $57.1 in the value of the hedging instruments referred to above.                                        -33-   A portion of an intercompany Euro denominated loans payable naturally hedges our net investment in our Belgium-based subsidiary, Cytec Surface Specialties SA/NV. From time to time we also enter into designated forward Euro contracts to adjust the amount of the net investment hedge. At December 31, 2007, we had no designated forward contracts.  Commodity Price Risk: We use natural gas swaps to hedge a portion of our utility requirements at certain of our North American manufacturing facilities. The maturities of these swaps correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that we pay for the underlying commodity. While these contracts are structured to limit our exposure to increases in commodity prices, they can also limit the potential benefit we might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices. These swaps are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value, which will be reclassified into manufacturing cost of sales through October 2008 as the hedged natural gas purchases affect earnings. For a detailed discussion on natural gas swaps, see Critical Accounting Policies - Commodity Price Risk section below.  At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding natural gas swaps with a fair value loss of $(0.7) net of taxes. Assuming that year-end natural gas prices were to decrease by a hypothetical 10%, the value of these contracts would decrease by approximately $1.2.  Interest Rate Risk: At December 31, 2007, our outstanding borrowings consisted of $42.0 of short-term variable rate borrowings and long-term debt, including the current portion, which had a carrying value of $806.7, a face value of $806.3 and a fair value, based on dealer quoted values, of approximately $803.2.  Assuming other factors are held constant, a hypothetical increase/decrease of 1% in the weighted-average prevailing interest rate on our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2007, interest expense would increase/decrease by approximately $0.4 for the next fiscal year and the fair value of the fixed rate long-term debt would decrease/increase by approximately $30.0.  2008 OUTLOOK  In our January 30, 2008 press release, which was also furnished as an exhibit to a current report on Form 8-K, we set forth our assumptions and management's best estimate of the full year 2008 earnings at the time based on various assumptions set forth in our press release. We forecasted diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.15-$4.35, before any potential special items for the year. We also forecasted 2008 capital expenditures to be in a range of $180.0 to $200.0. There can be no assurance that sales or earnings will develop in the manner projected. Actual results may differ materially. See "Comments on Forward Looking Statements."  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and changes in the estimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition.  Share-based Compensation  In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. SFAS 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," ("APB No. 25") and requires companies to recognize compensation cost in an amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments, such as stock options granted to employees. On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method.  With the adoption of SFAS 123R, the compensation cost for performance stock is recorded based on the market value on the original date of grant, and not based on the price of our common stock at the end of each reporting period as formerly was required under APB No. 25. Compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in cash ("cash-settled SARS") is recognized based on the fair value of the award at the end of each period through the date of vesting, also a change from APB No. 25. Compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in shares ("stock-settled SARS") and stock options is recognized over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value on the date of the grant. SFAS 123R also requires that we estimate a forfeiture rate for all share-based awards. We monitor share option exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates within the valuation model. The estimated fair values are based on assumptions, including estimated lives of the instruments, historical and implied volatility, dividend yield, and risk-free interest rates. These estimates also consider the probability that the options and stock-settled SARS will be exercised prior to the end of their contractual lives and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder. These assumptions are based on reasonable facts but are subject to change based on a variety of external factors.                                        -34-   Environmental and Other Contingent Liabilities  Accruals for environmental remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation, and other contingent liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are recorded at management's best estimate of the ultimate expected liabilities, without any discount to reflect the time value of money. These accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes available.  The amount accrued for environmental remediation reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature and cost of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties.  Included in other contingent liabilities are workers' compensation, product liability and toxic tort claims. The amount accrued for other contingent liabilities reflects our assumptions about the incidence, severity, indemnity costs and dismissal rates for existing and future claims.  Our asbestos related contingent liabilities and related insurance receivables are based on a study. The study estimated our gross asbestos liabilities using a frequency/severity approach. With this approach, the cost of future claim filings due to asbestos-related diseases are estimated as the product of the future number of claims filed and the average value of those claims on a nominal as opposed to discounted basis. Future claim frequency has been estimated using our claims history and the Stallard/Manton Epidemiological Decay Model, a widely used industry study. The Decay model assumes that future levels of claims activity will gradually decrease from current levels by applying model-specific decay factors that project this claim activity to wind down over the next 35 to 40 years. Our current levels are estimated based on our risk profile and our historical claim experience. The estimated cost per claim is based on our historical paid claims adjusted for inflation. Although these estimates and assumptions are based on reasonable facts, they are subject to change based on the actual outcome and a variety of external factors. A sustained 1% change in the annual number of future asbestos claims filed against us will increase or decrease the liability and related receivable by $0.5 and $0.3, respectively. A sustained 1% change in the average value of asbestos claims paid will increase or decrease the liability and related receivable by $0.5 and $0.3, respectively.  Accruals for environmental remediation and other contingent liabilities can change substantially if our assumptions are not realized or due to actions by governmental agencies or private parties. We cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts. Moreover, environmental and other contingent liabilities are paid over an extended period, and the timing of such payments cannot be predicted with any certainty. Accruals for environmental and other contingent liabilities are recorded as other noncurrent liabilities with any amounts expected to be paid out in the next twelve months classified as accrued expenses.  Probable insurance recoveries for past and probable future indemnity costs are recorded at management's best estimate of the ultimate expected receipts without discounting to reflect the time value of money and are recorded as other assets. A number of factors impact the estimates of insurance reimbursements. These factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies, the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies, how legal and defense costs will be covered by the insurance policies, the interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships, and historical recovery rates over the past ten years.  Defense and processing costs are expensed as incurred. Probable insurance recoveries for defense and processing costs are recognized when the related costs are incurred and are recorded as other assets.  Retirement Plans  We sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements. Our most significant pension plans are in the U.S., and constituted over 68% of our consolidated pension assets and 66% of projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2007. The calculation of our pension expense and pension liability associated with our defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions. We believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets.  At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used for pension liabilities. In estimating this rate, we look to rates of return on high quality, long-term corporate bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. We discounted our U.S. future pension liabilities using a rate of 6.2% at December 31, 2007. The discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities has a significant effect on expense. A 1% increase to the discount rate for our U.S. pension plans will decrease our 2008 expected annual expense by $6.0 and decrease our liability by $70.4. A 1% decrease to the discount rate for our U.S. pension plans will increase our 2008 expected annual expense by $7.5 and increase our liability by $80.6. A 1% increase to the discount rate for our U.S. post retirement medical plan will increase our 2008 expected annual expense by $0.4 and decrease our liability by $17.9. A 1% decrease to the discount rate for our U.S. post retirement medical plan will decrease our 2008 expected annual expense by $0.7 and increase our liability by $19.6.                                        -35-   The expected rate of return on our U.S. plan assets, which was 8.0% for 2007, reflects the long-term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability. We establish the expected rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to us at that time, including the historical returns of major asset classes, the expected investment mix of the plans' assets, and estimates of future long-term investment returns. A 1% change to the expected rate of return on plan assets of our U.S. pension plans will increase or decrease our 2008 expected annual expense by $4.9. The U.S. pension plan's investment mix at December 31, 2007 approximated 50% equities and 50% fixed income securities. Any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss. The unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss is amortized into pension expense in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions."  Impairment of Goodwill  We have defined our segments as our SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" reporting units. Our four business segments are Cytec Performance Chemicals, Cytec Surface Specialties, Cytec Engineered Materials and Building Block Chemicals. Cytec Performance Chemicals serves large, global industrial markets. Cytec Surface Specialties serves the large, global coatings market. Cytec Engineered Materials serves principally aerospace markets. Building Block Chemicals sells commodity chemical intermediates to industrial users. The segments above reflect how we run our company, manage the assets and the customer perspective.  We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis. Goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. We use a two-step process to test goodwill for impairment. We initially use a market multiple approach (1A) to estimate a range of fair values by reporting unit, and then use a discounted cash flow approach (1B) if the market multiple approach indicates that a potential impairment might exist to refine and reaffirm the results of the first test. The market multiple approach provides a straightforward, cost effective and relatively simple method to readily determine if an impairment might exist by utilizing EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) information by reporting unit multiplied by average current industry valuation factors or multiples to easily determine an estimated range of fair value. Due to the cyclical nature of our reporting units, we utilize a three year EBITDA average of historical and forecasted EBITDA for the reportable segment times the range of EBITDA multiple factors. The three year period is comprised of the prior year, current year and one year projected amounts. The market multiple range utilizes an average lower and upper multiple limit based on recent industry acquisition average EBITDA multiples paid by financial and strategic purchasers. We obtain this information from a third party investment bank. If the reporting unit's estimated fair value using the low end of the range is close to or below the reporting unit's carrying value, in our judgment, we refine the calculation using cash flows to calculate a point estimate of the reporting unit's fair value, as opposed to a range. If the discounted cash flow approach yields a fair value estimate less than the reporting unit's carrying value, we would proceed to step two of the impairment test, as defined by SFAS No. 142. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.  In 2007, our Surface Specialties reporting unit had a fair value that did not materially exceed its carrying value, hence, we have estimated its discounted cash flows to complete the first step in the SFAS No. 142 test. As the majority of this segment's operations and related carrying value (including its intangibles and goodwill) came from our 2005 significant acquisition, we did not expect that its fair value would materially exceed its carrying value for some time until we successfully expand the business.  For the market multiple approach, we used an EBITDA range of between 8.2X and 10.5X. At the upper limit multiple of 10.5X EBITDA, the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value but it was below using the 8.2X multiple. The Surface Specialties EBITDA of $185 was a three year average of the 2006 actual, the 2007 full year estimate, and the 2008 budgeted EBITDA amounts. The market multiple approach (Step 1A) resulted in a fair value range of $1,521 to $1,947. Since the low end of the range of the estimated fair value using the multiples was below the carrying value, we reaffirmed the estimate of the fair value using a discounted cash flow approach in accordance with our aforementioned policy which resulted in a value of $1,937. The discounted cash flow approach fair value exceeded the carrying value by $242, or 14%, indicating that there was no impairment of Surface Specialties goodwill. The discounted cash flow approach used our 2007 weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") rate of 8.5% as the discount rate and an estimated net cash flow for a ten-year period from 2008 to 2017. Our WACC calculation is the standard calculation and includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt and expected equity premiums. A terminal value of six times 2017 EBITDA was assumed. The terminal value EBITDA multiple approximates a long-term growth rate of 3% which we believe is reasonable for this business. These evaluations involve amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments.                                        -36-   The discounted cash flows were based on a ten year projection, covering 2008 through 2017. The 2008 to 2011 projections were based on forecasts prepared by Surface Specialties management. The 2012 to 2017 amounts were based on forecasted average revenue growth factor of 4%. Operating profit margins improve from approximately 7% in 2008 to approximately 11% by 2017. The average revenue growth for the ten year period is 5.3%. The projections included average annual capital expenditures of $60 and net working capital increases corresponding to the revenue growth assumed. We assumed an average tax rate of 30% for the discounted cash flow approach which we believe is a realistic approximation of our future annual effective tax rate.  The following table summarizes the approximate impact that a change in certain critical assumptions would have on the estimated fair value of our Cytec Surface Specialties segment. The approximate impact of the change in each critical assumption assumes all other assumptions and factors remain constant.  - -------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            Approximate                                                             Impact On              Critical Factors                 Change       Fair Value - ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Weighted Average Cost of Capital                  0.50%              $73 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Terminal Value Multiple                              1X              158 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual Capital Expenditures                         $10               46 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual Sales Volume Growth Rate                   0.25%              102 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operating Profit Margin                              1%              158 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. We are not aware of reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being estimated that would have a material impact on these assessments for impairment.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Assets to be Disposed  Long-lived assets and intangible assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed annually for impairment. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets or asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be charged to earnings. Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell.  Income Taxes  Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.  We intend to reinvest the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes with respect to these earnings. In the event of repatriation to the U.S., such earnings would be subject to U.S. income taxes in most cases. Foreign tax credits would be available to substantially reduce the amount of U.S. tax otherwise payable in future years.  Our annual effective tax rate is based on expected income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions.                                        -37-   We establish accruals for tax contingencies when, notwithstanding the reasonable belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, we believe that certain filing positions are likely to be challenged and moreover, that such filing positions may not be fully sustained. Prior to the issuance of FIN 48, all uncertain income tax positions were accounted for under FASB Statement 5: Accounting for Contingencies ("SFAS 5"). We adopted FIN 48 in January 2007, which provides that recognition of a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position will only be recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We continually evaluate our uncertain tax positions and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances all within accordance of the provisions of FIN 48 including but not limited to emerging case law, tax legislation, rulings by relevant tax authorities, and the progress of ongoing tax audits. Settlement of a given tax contingency could impact the income tax provision in the period of resolution. Our accruals for gross uncertain tax positions are presented in the balance sheet within income taxes payable for current items and other noncurrent liabilities for long-term items.  Acquisitions  We account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition. The cost to acquire a business, including transaction costs, is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business in proportion to their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to acquired in-process research and development are expensed at the date of acquisition.  The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. Accordingly, for significant items, we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists.  Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.  All of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our results of operations.  Derivative Financial Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities  We use derivative instruments in accordance with our established policies to manage exposure to fluctuations in currency rates, interest rates and natural gas prices in North America. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly-rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties, thereby limiting exposure to credit-related and performance-related risks.  Foreign Currency Risk: We use currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps to manage our exposure to fluctuations in currency rates on third party and intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity. We hedge such exposures with currency forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar terms as the underlying exposure, and therefore, the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item or transaction. All derivative contracts used to manage foreign currency risk are measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. Changes in fair value are reported in earnings or deferred, depending on the nature and effectiveness of the hedging relationship. Ineffectiveness, if any, in a hedging relationship is recognized immediately into earnings. If the hedging relationship is not highly effective in generating offsetting cash flows or changes in fair value, we would recognize the change in the fair value of the currency forward contract in other income (expense), net. We did not terminate any designated hedging relationships in 2007, 2006 or 2005. There was no ineffectiveness in 2007, 2006 or 2005.  The earnings impact of currency forward contracts that are used to economically hedge foreign currency assets or liabilities is recognized in other income (expense), net during the term of the contracts.   We use cross currency swaps to hedge certain future cash flows from Euro receipts on certain Euro denominated intercompany loans receivable we have with certain subsidiaries against changes in the U.S. dollar to Euro exchange rates. The swaps fix the U.S. dollar equivalent cash flows of these Euro denominated intercompany loans and eliminate foreign exchange variability since the notional amounts of the swaps equal that of the loans, and all cash flow dates and interest rates coincide between the swaps and the loans, therefore no ineffectiveness is expected. These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges. The cross currency swaps are recorded at fair value as either assets or liabilities. Each period we record the change in the swaps fair value to accumulated other comprehensive income. We reclassify an amount out of accumulated other comprehensive income to the income statement to offset the foreign currency gain or loss on the remeasurement to U.S. dollar of the Euro loans. We also accrue for the periodic net swap payments each period in the consolidated income statement. We monitor the counterparty credit risk and the continued probability of the hedged cash flows as to amount and timing.                                        -38-   Another portion of our intercompany Euro denominated loans payable of one of our U.S. subsidiaries is designated as a hedge of our net investment in our Belgium-based subsidiary, Cytec Surface Specialties SA/NV. The portion of the remeasurement of the intercompany loan to the U.S. dollar that relates to the amount designated as a hedge of our net investment is recorded as a translation adjustment.  Commodity Price Risk: We use natural gas swaps to hedge a portion of our utility requirements at certain of our North American manufacturing facilities. These swaps, which are highly effective at achieving offsetting cash flows of the underlying natural gas purchases, have been designated as cash flow hedges and are reported on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, with the effective portion of the hedged item included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) on an after-tax basis. Gains and losses are reclassified into earnings, as a component of manufacturing cost of sales, in the period the hedged natural gas purchases affect earnings. If the derivative is no longer highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows, subsequent changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in other income (expense), net in the current period. If the hedging relationship is terminated we continue to defer the related gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income and include it as a component of the cost of the underlying hedged item. If the forecasted transaction is no longer likely to occur we recognize the related gain or loss in other income (expense), net in that period. We did not terminate any hedges during 2007, 2006 and 2005. All hedged transactions that were forecasted to occur in 2007, 2006 and 2005 occured as forecasted. Ineffectiveness during these years was insignificant. The fair values of all of these instruments are based on quotes from third party financial institutions.                                           -39-    ITEM 8.
