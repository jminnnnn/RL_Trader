Item 7.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. Percentages are approximate.  GENERAL       Cytec Industries Inc. is a global specialty chemicals and materials company and sells its products to diverse major markets for aerospace, automotive and industrial coatings, chemical intermediates, mining, plastics and water treatment. With slightly over half of the Company's sales outside of the U.S., sales volume by region and the impact of exchange rates are important measures that are analyzed by management. The Company reports its net sales in four segments: Water and Industrial Process Chemicals, Performance Products, Specialty Materials and Building Block Chemicals. The Water and Industrial Process Chemicals and Performance Products segments are collectively referred to as Specialty Chemicals. The Company also reports its net sales in four geographic regions: North America, Latin America, Asia/Pacific and Europe/Middle East/Africa. The destination of the sale determines the region under which it is reported consistent with management's view of the business. North America consists of the United States and Canada. Latin America includes Mexico, Central America, South America and the Caribbean Islands. Asia/Pacific is comprised of Asia, Australia and the islands of the South Pacific Rim.       Raw material cost changes year on year are an important factor in profitability especially in years of high volatility. Oil and natural gas costs are significantly higher than the year ago period and many of the Company's raw materials are derived from these two commodities. Key raw materials for the Specialty Chemicals and Building Block Chemicals segments are propylene, ammonia, methanol derivatives and natural gas for utilities. Key raw materials for the Specialty Materials segment are carbon fiber and various resins. Discussion of the year to year impact of raw materials and energy is provided in our segment discussion. In addition, higher global demand levels and, occasionally, operating difficulties at suppliers, have limited the availability of certain of the Company's raw materials. With the exception of propylene availability in the first quarter, this did not have a material impact on results of operations in 2004. The Company was recently notified by its major supplier of propylene that as of February 1, 2005, it will be placed on an 85% supply allocation of its requirements for up to six months due to mechanical difficulties. Management does not expect this allocation to have a material impact on Company operations in the first quarter of 2005 should it occur for the term anticipated.       In the course of the Company's ongoing operations, a number of strategic product line acquisitions and dispositions have been made. All acquisitions have been recorded using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in the Company's consolidated results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. A further discussion of acquisitions and dispositions can be found in Note 2 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following table sets forth the percentage relationship that certain items in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income bear to net sales:    Years Ended December 31,                                   2004              2003               2002 -

--------------------------------------------------- ------------- -------------- ------------ --------------- ------------        Net sales in the United States were $802.4, $719.7 and $685.8 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. International net sales were $918.9, $752.1, and $660.4, or 53%, 51% and 49% of total net sales, for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.       For more information on the Company's segments, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and further discussions in "Segment Results," below.  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003  Consolidated Results       Net sales for 2004 were $1,721.3 compared with $1,471.8 during 2003. All segments reported increased sales. In the two Specialty Chemicals segments sales increased primarily due to increased selling volumes, the acquisitions completed in the second half of 2003 and favorable exchange rates. The Specialty Materials segment sales increase was primarily volume related and all product lines participated. The Building Block Chemicals segment sales increased principally due to higher selling prices which were driven by higher raw material and energy costs offset somewhat by a decrease in sales volumes of acrylonitrile and acrylamide.       For a detailed discussion on sales refer to the Segment Results section below.       Manufacturing cost of sales was $1,311.2 compared with $1,114.9 during 2003. Cost of sales was primarily impacted by higher raw material and energy costs of $69.0. Gross margin percent however, decreased by only 0.4% as the higher raw material and energy costs were offset by increased selling prices of $42.1, the net impact of exchange rates on operations outside of the United States of $35.1, the fixed cost leverage from the increased production levels and a favorable product mix.       Pension expense increased $5.1 principally as a result of the Company lowering its discount rate in the U. S. by 0.5% to reflect current market rates on fixed income securities and by the 2003 acquisitions which increased pension expense by $0.3. Pension expense is primarily reported in manufacturing cost of sales. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies, Retirement Plans for further discussion on how changes in discount rates and return on asset assumptions can impact annual expense.       Selling and technical services was $139.8 in 2004 versus $126.9 in the prior year due to ongoing costs of the businesses in the Specialty Chemical segments acquired in the second half of 2003, the impact of exchange rate changes on operations outside of the United States of $4.2 and higher costs in the Specialty Materials segment of $2.0 where the Company is investing in personnel, product qualifications and commercialization of new products for its growth initiatives.                                         17        Research and process development was $40.0 versus $35.2 in the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of ongoing costs of the acquired businesses of the Specialty Chemical segments completed in the second half of 2003, costs associated with the start up of the newly renovated Specialty Chemicals Technology Center and higher costs in the Specialty Materials segment where the Company continues to invest for a number of future opportunities.       Administrative and general expenses were $65.1 versus $49.7 in the prior year. Included in 2004 is a charge of $8.0 related to the settlement of the federal carbon fiber class action lawsuit and several other minor litigation matters. Also contributing to the increase were ongoing costs of the businesses of the Specialty Chemical segments acquired in the second half of 2003 of approximately $1.3, an increase in deferred compensation expense of $2.6 due to the increase in the Company's stock price versus the year ago period and the impact of exchange rate changes on operations outside of the U.S. of $1.1. Additionally, the Company incurred $2.0 in third party expenses related to implementing accounting and disclosure control procedures as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.       Other income, net was $16.9 compared with a loss of $5.7 in the prior year. Included in 2004 results was a net gain of $26.8 related to derivative contracts entered into during the fourth quarter to economically hedge currency and interest rate exposure associated with the pending acquisition of Surface Specialties. The Company entered into foreign currency contracts to offset the potential dollar to euro exchange rate fluctuation that would have an impact on the acquisition cost in dollars and this resulted in a gain of $33.3. In anticipation of future long-term debt that would be issued to partially finance the acquisition, the Company also entered into interest rate hedges which resulted in the recognition of a loss of $6.5. Also included in other income, net are charges of $6.2 for settlement of several environmental remediation and toxic tort lawsuits and a charge of $2.0 related to the settlement of a series of disputed matters with Wyeth, partially offset by a gain of $2.0 related to the sale in 1999 of the Company's share of its methanol joint venture whereby the Company received additional proceeds because the market price of methanol stayed above an agreed upon index over a predetermined period of time. The Company also recorded $3.0 in other income, net, of which $1.0 has been received, that relates to insurance recoveries and expected recoveries from its insurers of lead-related defense costs which had been previously expensed. Lead-related defense costs recognized during 2004 amounted to $2.5. The prior year loss of $5.7 primarily resulted from the recognition of currency losses whereby certain international subsidiaries held dollar denominated assets while the US dollar weakened.       Equity in earnings of associated companies was $5.2 versus $7.2 in the prior year. Earnings from CYRO, the Company's 50% owned acrylic plastics joint venture, remained flat as compared with the prior year as increased sales volumes and selling prices offset higher raw material costs. In addition, results for 2003 included earnings of $1.8 from the Company's former 50% owned Mitsui-Cytec joint venture. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.       Interest expense, net was $17.4 compared with $16.2 in the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from a higher outstanding weighted-average debt balance during 2004.       The Company's effective tax rate in 2004 was 23% compared with 28% in 2003. This reduction reflects the Company's continued earnings growth in lower tax jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, a favorable international tax ruling received in the first quarter of 2004. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a reduction of its tax liabilities due to the completion of several years of tax audits in an international tax jurisdiction that resulted in a reduction of $2.4 to its income tax provision. These reductions were partially offset by the derivative net gain noted above which was taxed at the higher incremental U.S. rate.       Net earnings available to common stockholders for 2004 were $116.2 ($2.84 per diluted share). Net earnings available to common stockholders for 2004 included a charge of $9.9 ($0.24 per diluted share) as a result of the redemption of the Company's Series C Preferred Stock (the "Series C Stock"). The Series C Stock was originally issued in 1993 in conjunction with Cytec's spin-off from American Cyanamid Company ("Cyanamid"). Wyeth became beneficial owner of Series C Stock following its acquisition of Cyanamid in 1994. Net earnings available to common stockholders for 2003 were $77.4 ($1.93 per diluted share). Included in 2003 results is an after-tax, non-cash charge of $13.6 ($0.34 per diluted share) reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change related to the adoption of SFAS No.143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" which became effective January 1, 2003.                                         18   Segment Results       Year-to-year comparisons and analyses of changes in net sales by product line segment and region are set forth below.

The 4% increase in base selling volumes is attributable to increased sales across all product lines, particularly mining chemicals. On a regional basis, sales volumes in Latin America increased with acquisitions accounting for 12% with the remainder of the increase primarily due to improved demand for mining chemicals from copper mining applications. Sales volumes were up 12% in Europe/Middle East/Africa with acquisitions accounting for 3% and the remainder of the increase primarily due to increased demand for water treatment chemicals from full service providers and phosphine applications. Overall average price decreased in areas where pricing is linked to the U.S. dollar, with an offsetting effect due to currency rate changes.       Earnings from operations were $21.2, or 5% of sales, compared with $20.3 or 6% of sales in 2003. The increase in earnings is primarily attributable to increased selling volumes, in part due to acquisitions during the second half of 2003, and the impact of exchange rate changes partly offset by increased raw material and energy costs of $11.6.

Asia/Pacific sales volumes increased 29% with acquisitions accounting for most of the increase. Europe/Middle East/Africa sales were up 18% due to the favorable impact of exchange rate changes and increased demand primarily for coatings and specialty additives. Overall average selling price was flat although higher selling prices in the Polymer Additives product line were offset by declines in certain products within the Performance Chemical product line due to competitive pressures.       Earnings from operations were $57.2, or 10% of sales, compared with $37.3, or 8% of sales, in 2003. The favorable impact from acquisitions, higher base sales volumes, improved manufacturing operations and net favorable exchange rate changes more than offset the effect of higher raw material and energy costs of $5.8.

On a regional basis the 10% increase in North America sales volumes represents increased sales primarily to large commercial aircraft, military, business and regional jet and rotorcraft applications. Europe/Middle East/Africa sales volumes increased 40% principally due to increased sales to large commercial aircraft and high performance automotive applications as well as to business and regional jet and rotorcraft applications. Asia/Pacific sales volumes increased 40% principally due to increased sales for large commercial aircraft and regional and business jets. The overall decrease in average selling price was primarily due to increased volume rebates.       Earnings from operations were $84.2, or 17% of sales, compared with $66.3, or 16% of sales, in 2003. Higher earnings are principally due to the increase in selling volumes partly offset by increased manufacturing and commercial costs to service the higher demand levels and growth opportunities of this segment.

Global sales volumes declined slightly due in part to decreased acrylonitrile production as a result of reduced propylene (the key raw material for acrylonitrile) availability during the first quarter as well as a scheduled plant maintenance shutdown during May 2004. North America selling volumes were up 18% with the majority due to increased acrylonitrile and sulfuric acid business. Europe/Middle East/Africa volumes decreased as 2003 reflected opportunistic sales in this region resulting from more favorable spot selling prices versus the Asia/Pacific region. North America and Asia/Pacific selling prices were up primarily reflecting partial recovery of higher raw material and energy costs.       Earnings from operations were $14.8, or 4% of sales, compared with $20.3, or 7% of sales, in 2003. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to the decrease in volume and increased raw material and energy costs of $47.2, which were not fully offset by price increases of $46.0.  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002  Consolidated Results       Net sales for 2003 were $1,471.8, up 9%, compared to $1,346.2 for 2002. Overall, sales volume increased 5% with acquisitions accounting for 2% of this increase, favorable changes in currency rates adding 3%, and higher selling prices adding 1%.       For a detailed discussion on sales refer to the Segment Results section below.       Manufacturing cost of sales was $1,114.9, or 75.8% of net sales, for 2003 compared with $1,020.4, or 75.9% of net sales, for 2002. Included in 2002 is a $10.8 net restructuring charge or 1.0% of net sales for plant closure costs and expenses associated with discontinuing a product line. Additional savings related to 2002 restructuring initiative were $1.4 in 2003 which was the result of planned personnel reductions under the 2002 initiative. Manufacturing costs in 2003 were also impacted by higher raw material and energy costs of $37.4, particularly from petroleum based products globally and natural gas based products in the U. S. and currency rate changes increased cost $18.2 Freight and warehousing increased $6.6 of which $3.0 was due to currency rates changes. The remainder of the increase in freight and warehousing is due primarily to sales volume increases as well as higher freight rates and fuel surcharges. Insurance costs increased $1.7 over 2002. Partially offsetting this were lower costs as a result of the Company's operational excellence initiatives.       Pension expense increased $5.2 principally as a result of the Company lowering its discount rate in the U. S. by 0.5% to reflect current market rates on fixed income securities and by the 2003 acquisitions which increased pension expense by $0.3. This was partly offset by plan changes to the retirement medical plans in the U. S. which were instituted by the Company in 2002 and reduced expense by $0.7. Pension expense is primarily reported in manufacturing cost of sales. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies, Retirement Plans for further discussion on how changes in discount rates and return on asset assumptions can impact annual expense.                                         20        Selling and technical services increased $4.3. Included in prior year amounts are net restructuring charges of $2.5. Additional savings related to 2002 restructuring were $1.1 in 2003 primarily as a result of planned personnel reductions. Costs associated with the acquisitions in 2003 added $2.6 and costs associated with the Company's performance stock plan increased by $1.1 due to a higher market value for the Company's common stock. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to currency rate changes.       Research and process development increased $1.5. Included in the prior year are net restructuring charges of $1.0. Costs associated with the acquisitions in 2003 added $0.5. Headcount additions and costs for outside testing in the Specialty Chemical segments accounted for the increase in costs.       Administrative expenses increased $2.7 but included in prior year amounts are net restructuring charges of $0.8 and fees of $1.7 related to a research and development tax credit filing. The Company's performance stock plan increased costs by $1.5 due to the higher stock price. The acquisitions of 2003 added $0.7 to administrative costs in 2003 and insurance premiums increased $1.1 over 2002. Currency rate changes also increased costs.       The increase in amortization expense is due to the impact amortizing acquisition intangibles associated with 2003 acquisitions.       Other expense, net increased $6.9 from the year ago period. This resulted primarily from currency losses where certain of our international subsidiaries held dollar denominated assets when the U. S. dollar weakened. Currency rate changes increased expenses compared to 2002 by $5.3. Cleanup costs of $0.6 at an operating site related to a divested product line and royalty income of $0.8 that expired in 2002 also contributed to the increase.       Equity in earnings of associated companies increased $1.1 from the year ago period. Included in 2002 results was a restructuring charge of $0.4 representing the Company's 50% share of restructuring charges recorded by CYRO, and a charge of $1.7 to reduce to zero the carrying value of the Company's net investment in the one-third owned PA.com. In addition, the Company's share of operating losses from PA.com in 2002 totaled $0.9. CYRO had increased sales of 5% in 2003, however its product mix was less favorable and raw material and energy costs were higher than the year ago period. As a result, the Company's share of earnings in 2003 from CYRO decreased by $1.7.       Interest expense, net was $16.2, a decrease of $0.3, from the prior year period. Interest income in 2002 was favorably impacted by $2.0 received in conjunction with research and development tax credit refund. In March 2003 the Company repaid $100.0 of its existing debt with an interest rate of 6.5% per annum resulting in lower interest expense. This was largely offset by interest expense related to the $200.0 principal amount of 4.6% Notes that were issued in June 2003. The interest expense associated with this new debt was partially reduced by $0.7 as a result of interest rate swap agreements entered into in August 2003.       Income tax provision reflects a reduction in the effective tax rate from 33.5%, before the impact of prior years' tax credits, to 28.0%. This reduction was a result of the Company's continued emphasis on global tax planning and execution of those plans together with an increased level of investment and earnings in tax jurisdictions with lower rates as well as a favorable international tax ruling with respect to a legal entity restructuring that occurred in the prior year. The 2002 full year effective tax rate of 28% reflects a reduction for a tax refund of $6.0 associated with prior years, research & development tax credits.       Net earnings before the cumulative effect of the accounting change were $91.0, or $2.27 per diluted share, for 2003, compared to $79.3, or $1.96 per diluted share, in 2002. Included in 2002 was an after-tax net restructuring charge of $9.4, or $0.23 per diluted share. Also included in 2002 is a net credit of $0.15 per diluted share related to research and development tax credits discussed above (a reduction of $6.0 in income tax provision, interest income of $2.0 or $1.3 after-tax, and a charge of $1.7 or $1.1 after-tax in administrative expenses for fees related to tax planning).       On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143 and recorded an after-tax, non-cash charge of $13.6 ($0.34 per diluted share) reported as a cumulative effect of an accounting change.       Net earnings after the cumulative effect of the accounting change were $77.4 or $1.93 per diluted share.                                         21   Segment Results       Year-to-year comparisons and analyses of changes in net sales by product line segment and region are set forth below.

Currency rate changes increased sales 5% with acquisitions adding 4%. Base volume increased 3%, and selling prices declined 3%. North American volumes increased 6% with the 2003 acquisitions of the metal extractant and aromatic phosphines product lines of Avecia accounting for 6%. Also, the Water Treatment product line selling volume was down as the Company exited certain low profit municipal business but this was offset by increased Phosphine gas sales. In Latin America, the volume growth of 21% was primarily in the mining chemicals product line as a result of higher demand in the alumina market and acquisitions accounting for 3%. Asia/Pacific volumes decreased 2%; 2002 volume included sales for an initial fill of the Company's solvent extraction product at one of the world's largest cobalt nickel mines. Europe volumes increased 4% primarily in the Water Treatment product line. Currency rate changes were primarily the result of the weaker U. S. dollar, except in Latin America where the U. S. dollar remained strong for the first three quarters of 2003. Selling prices decreased in North America in all product lines due to customer mix and competitive pricing. Latin America pricing increased offsetting the impact of negative currency rate changes. Asia/Pacific selling prices decreased principally in mining chemicals where pricing was linked to the U. S. dollar with an offsetting effect due to currency rate changes.       Earnings from operations were $20.3, or 6% of net sales in 2003, compared to $26.2, or 8% of net sales, in 2002. Included in 2003 were increased savings from the 2002 restructuring initiative of $1.4 million as a result of planned personnel reductions. The impact from the increase in sales and restructuring savings was more than offset by higher raw material and energy costs of $3.2, higher freight, warehousing, employee benefit and insurance costs.

Currency rate changes increased sales 4%, principally from the stronger euro offset somewhat by overall weakness in Latin American currencies. Base volumes for the year were flat and selling prices were up slightly. The Company experienced strong demand in the Asia/Pacific and Latin America regions although off a smaller base but this was almost all offset by lower demand in Europe and North America due to reduced economic activity in those regions. Selling prices were up in Latin America offsetting the negative impact of currency rate changes. Prices in Asia/Pacific were down 2% primarily in Polymer Additives due to continued competitive pricing initiatives.       Earnings from operations were $37.3, or 8% of net sales, in 2003 compared to $39.6, or 9% of net sales, in 2002. Included in 2003 are increased savings from the 2002 restructuring initiative of $1.1 million as a result of planned personnel reductions. The impact from the increase in sales and restructuring savings was more than offset by higher raw material and energy costs of $9.2, increased freight, warehousing, employee benefit and insurance costs.                                         22   Specialty Materials                                                                                                   % Change Due to                                                                             Total         ----------------------------------------                                                  2003         2002          % Change      Price      Volume/Mix       Currency - -------------------------------------------- ------------- ------------ ---------------- --------- ---------------- -------------              North America                                  $292.3        $290.7              1%            0%           1%             0% Latin America(1)                                  1.6           1.3             ---           ---          ---            --- Asia/Pacific                                     15.5          14.7              4%           -2%           6%             0% Europe/Middle East/Africa                        99.3          88.8             12%           -3%          11%             4%                                              ------------- ------------ Total                                          $408.7        $395.5              3%           -1%           3%             1% - -------------------------------------------- ------------- ------------ ---------------- --------- ---------------- -------------  (1)  Due to the level of sales in this geographic region, percentage comparisons      are not meaningful.       Selling volumes were up 3% overall. Sales to military and rotorcraft applications added 5% due to increased production levels for military aircraft and a high level of replacement parts for rotorcraft and restocking by certain customers from low 2002 year-end inventory levels. Sales to the commercial aerospace sector for large commercial aircraft, regional jets and business jets were down 2% from 2002. Sales to Boeing were down in line with the decrease in large commercial aircraft build rates but offset somewhat by increased sales to Airbus.       Earnings from operations were $66.3, or 16% of sales, in 2003 compared to $65.7, or 17% of sales, in 2002. Included in 2003 were increased savings from the 2002 restructuring initiative of $0.5 million as a result of planned personnel reductions. The impact from the increase in sales, restructuring savings and higher plant utilization was essentially offset by higher operating costs as the Company invested in its manufacturing plants and increased its selling and technical efforts.

Selling volumes increased 10% overall. North American and European acrylonitrile volumes were up due to new business. Demand in Asia/Pacific for acrylonitrile was low principally in the second quarter of the year. Selling prices were up primarily related to acyrlonitrile due to tighter supply and increased input costs.       Earnings from operations were $20.3, or 7% of net sales, in 2003 compared to $5.6, or 3% of net sales, in 2002. The increased earnings were primarily the result of higher selling volumes and prices and the favorable impact of currency rate changes. Additionally, earnings increased due to lower plant spending of $3.2 and higher plant capacity utilization. The increase was partially offset by significantly higher raw material and energy costs of $24.0 which were primarily due to the higher cost of ammonia, propylene and natural gas.  LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION       At December 31, 2004 the Company's cash balance was $323.8 compared with $251.1 at year end 2003.       Cash flows provided by operating activities, which continued to be the primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures, were $167.4 for 2004 compared with $132.4 for 2003. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities resulted from an increase in current period income from operations and $18.9 million related to closing various currency contracts that were entered into relative to the anticipated acquisition of Surface Specialties. Trade accounts receivables increased by $24.1 as a result of increased sales. Inventory levels increased by $38.7 due to increased production to support higher customer demand as well as higher raw material costs. Accounts payable increased by $36.5, primarily due to increased raw material costs and purchases to support increased demand levels. Cash flows provided by operating activities were reduced by $48.0 and $46.2 from cash contributions to pension plans and postretirement plans during 2004 and 2003, respectively.       Cash flows used in investing activities were $84.1 for 2004 compared with $195.3 for 2003. Capital spending, which totaled $89.3, included spending on projects to: upgrade and modernize the Stamford, Connecticut Specialty Chemicals research facility; expand capacity at the Oestringen, Germany manufacturing facility; upgrade the Willow Island, West Virginia manufacturing facility; and upgrade two plants acquired during 2003. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company received from a third party $9.1, net of expenses, as a prepayment for a long-term lease on a certain property for future development. The development of the property is not connected with Company operations. The third party has the option to purchase the property from the Company at a later date. The net proceeds are being amortized to income over the life of the lease. Prior year investing activities included cash flows of $101.6 used to acquire the MEP and I&S product lines of Avecia Investments Limited.                                         23        Net cash flows used in financing activities were $20.6 in 2004 compared with net cash flows provided by financing activities of $85.4 during 2003.       Proceeds from stock option exercises totaled $24.6 compared with $14.5 during 2003. The total number of treasury shares reissued as a result of option exercises was approximately 1,217,500 in 2004 compared with approximately 1,079,800 in 2003. The Company repurchased 388,300 shares of stock at a cost of $13.1 compared with the repurchase of 838,200 shares of stock at a cost of $27.7 during 2003.       During 2004 the Company paid off all of the $9.3 in short term borrowings and also redeemed its Series C Stock for $10.0 in cash.       During 2004 the Company paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per common share which aggregated $15.7.       On January 20, 2005, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per common share, paid on February 25, 2005 to stockholders of record as of February 10, 2005.       In June 2003, the Company sold $200.0 principal amount of 4.6% Notes due July 1, 2013. Proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Notes after deducting costs were approximately $198.9. The Company has the ability to issue $200.0 more debt securities under a $400.0 shelf registration statement it has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that has been effective since December 2000.       On February 15, 2005, the Company entered into credit agreements totaling $1.775 billion in preparation for the upcoming acquisition of Surface Specialties. The agreements provide: a $725.0 5-year term loan facility, a $700.0 364-day credit facility, and a $350.0 5-year revolving credit facility. The term loan and 364-day facilities will be used to finance the acquisition and the revolving credit facility will provide additional liquidity for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The facilities contain covenants that are customary for such facilities.       On October 1, 2004, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to purchase the Surface Specialties business of UCB, a Belgium biopharmaceutical and specialty chemical company, for cash and stock, valued at that time, of 1.5 billion euros. In early February 2005, the Company reached agreement with UCB to modify the terms of the purchase agreement. Assuming the dollar to euro exchange rate is 1.3 to 1 and Cytec common stock is $51 per share, the transaction would be valued at $1.841 billion of which 1.140 billion euros ($1.482 billion) will be paid in cash and the balance will be paid in 5,772,857 shares of Cytec common stock ($294.0). In addition, there is contingent consideration up to a maximum of 50 million euros ($65.0), of which 20 million euros ($26.0) will be paid up front with the balance payable in 2006. The contingent consideration will be earned on a pro-rata basis pending the achievement of certain operating results by Surface Specialties in 2005. UCB also agreed to reimburse Cytec 15 million euros ($19.5) for transaction related costs. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions including the approval of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The Company anticipates closing on this transaction in the first quarter of 2005.       Upon closing, UCB would own approximately 12% of the outstanding shares of Cytec and will enter into a stockholders agreement that will provide that UCB must reduce its stake to less than 9% within three years, less than 7% within four years and less than 5% within five years and that will contain other customary terms and provisions.       At closing, the Company expects to finance the cash portion of the acquisition with combined bank borrowings of approximately $1,320.0 under the two acquisition related credit facilities that were executed on February 15, 2005 and approximately $200.0 of available cash balances. Approximately $600.0 of the bank debt will be refinanced on a long-term basis in the public debt markets after the acquisition.       The acquisition complements Cytec's existing product lines in the Performance Products segment by significantly increasing Cytec's product offering to the coatings industries including the general industrial, automotive, architectural, plastic, graphic arts and wood sectors.       The global Surface Specialties business had sales and earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Belgium and which are unaudited, of 1.112 billion euros and 147 million euros, respectively, ($1.446 billion and $191 million, respectively, at 1.3 U.S. dollar per euro) in 2004. Many of the Surface Specialties product lines such as UV cure, powder and waterborne systems have above average growth rates.                                         24        Cytec intends to operate the Surface Specialties business as a separate segment and will integrate the existing Cytec coatings chemicals and performance chemicals product lines into the new segment.       Surface Specialties also has a significant amino resins business. The Company has agreed with the European Union Commission, and expects to reach a similar agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, that it will divest UCB's amino resins business after it purchases Surface Specialties and that prior to the divestment, Surface Specialties amino resins business will be held separately and will report to an independent trustee. After the transaction is consummated, for the duration that the resins business is owned by Cytec, its results of operations will be classified as results from discontinued operations on Cytec's consolidated statements of income. The Company will use the proceeds to reduce debt. Sales of Surface Specialties' amino resin product line, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Belgium and which are unaudited in 2004, were approximately $150.0.       Through February 16, 2005, the Company has entered into $623.2 of forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge the benchmark interest rate and credit spread on a portion of the debt that will be issued to finance the acquisition of Surface Specialties. The weighted-average interest rate of 4.69% for the U.S dollar swaps includes the current swap credit spread of approximately 38 basis points and premium of approximately 3 basis points for the forward starting element of the swap. The corresponding euro swaps have a weighted-average interest rate of 3.97% and include the current swap credit spread of approximately 16 basis points and premium of approximately 1 basis point for the forward starting element of the swap. The credit spread portion of the swaps are representative of AA rated 10-year notes and serve as a proxy credit spread for the Company. The Company's actual credit spread at the time of debt issuance will be determined primarily based on its actual credit rating and market conditions. The swaps, which mature in March 2005, are marked to market and recorded currently in earnings until maturity or settlement. As of February 16, 2005, the Company has hedged approximately 90% of the anticipated portion of the purchase price that will be refinanced with long-term debt. As of February 16, 2005, the net impact of the marked to market value on these swaps was a loss of approximately $13.7 of which $6.5 was recorded in 2004.       Through February 16, 2005, the Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts totaling 1.002 billion euros that relate to approximately 84% of the euro exposure of 1.190 billion for the cash component of the Surface Specialties acquisition. The Company has hedged approximately 93% of the cash euro exposure with these forward contracts together with natural hedges of approximately 100.8 euros. The forward contracts, which mature on February 28, 2005, are marked to market and recorded currently in earnings until settlement or maturity. As of February 16, 2005, the cumulative impact of the marked to market adjustment on these forward contracts and certain forward contracts which were closed during 2004, was a net loss of approximately $8.7. A gain of $33.3 was recorded in 2004 of which $18.9 was realized.       In connection with the acquisition, the Company suspended its stock buy-back program and does not anticipate making future stock buy-backs for at least two years following closing in order to maximize funds available for debt service and other corporate purposes.       The Company believes that, based on its expected operating results for 2005, it will be able to fund operating cash requirements, including the debt service requirements related to the anticipated acquisition of Surface Specialties, planned capital expenditures and dividends from internal cash generation, which would include cash generated from the operations of Surface Specialties after acquisition.       At December 31, 2004 and 2003, long-term debt, including the current portion in 2004, consisted of the following:                                                                      2004                            2003 - -------------------------------------------------     ----------------------------   -----------------------------                                                                        Carrying                          Carrying                                                             Face         Value            Face            Value                                                       --------------- ------------   -------------- --------------              6.75% Notes Due March 15, 2008                                $100.0        $98.2           $100.0         $ 97.7 6.846% Mandatory Par Put Remarketed Securities                 120.0        119.0            120.0          118.9 4.60% Notes Due July 1, 2013                                   200.0        201.9            200.0          199.6 - -------------------------------------------------     --------------- ------------   -------------- --------------                                                                420.0        419.1            420.0          416.2 Less: Current maturities                                       120.0        119.0                -              - - -------------------------------------------------     --------------- ------------   -------------- -------------- Long-term debt                                                $300.0       $300.1           $420.0         $416.2 - -------------------------------------------------     --------------- ------------   -------------- --------------   Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.

At December 31, 2004, the Company also had $14.9 of natural gas forward contracts that settle in less than one year. (Refer to Item 7A included herein as well as Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).       The Company had $25.2 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees at December 31, 2004 that are issued on the Company's behalf in the ordinary course of business to support certain performance obligations and commitments of the Company. The instruments are typically renewed on an annual basis.       The Company does not have any unconsolidated limited purpose entities or any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities.                                          26   Item 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about the Company's potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in currency rates, commodity prices, interest rates and equity price changes. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward-looking analysis. Dollars are in millions.       Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings.       In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to various market risks, including fluctuations in currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates. To manage the exposure related to these risks, the Company may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with Company-established policies. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Moreover, the Company enters into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly-rated counterparties and makes reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties, thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks.  Currency Risk: The risk of adverse currency rate fluctuations is mitigated by the fact that, except for the currency exposure related to the pending acquisition of Surface Specialties (Refer to "Liquidity and Financial Condition" in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"), there is no concentration of currency exposure outside the U. S. In addition, the Company periodically enters into currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business. At December 31, 2004, the principal transactions hedged involved accounts receivable, accounts payable and intercompany loans. When hedging currency exposures, the Company's practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure, and therefore, the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value, cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction.       At December 31, 2004, except for the currency hedges entered into as part of the pending acquisition of Surface Specialties (Refer to "Liquidity and Financial Condition" in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"), the currency and net contractual amounts of forward contracts outstanding translated into U. S. dollar equivalent amounts were as follows:                                                      Buy                                    -----------------------------------------                                                Pound               Canadian             Sell                        Euro   Sterling            Dollar             ---------------------- ---------- ---------------- -------------              U. S. Dollar               $24.2         $1.0          $2.5             Euro                           -          0.9             -             Norwegian Krone              6.3            -             -             Other                        0.8            -             -             ---------------------- ---------- ---------------- -------------       The fair value of currency contracts, based on forward exchange rates at December 31, 2004, exceeded contract values by approximately $0.9. Assuming that year-end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical 10%, the change in the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year-end would be a decrease of approximately $3.7. However, since these contracts hedge specific transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged. Assuming that year-end dollar-to-euro exchange rate were to adversely change by a hypothetical 10%, the change in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts associated with the pending acquisition of Surface Specialties would be a decrease of approximately $95.9.  Commodity Price Risk: The Company uses natural gas forward contracts, which are physically settled, to hedge certain utility requirements. The maturities of these contracts correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that the Company pays for the underlying commodity. While these contracts are structured to limit the Company's exposure to increases in commodity prices, they can also limit the potential benefit the Company might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices. Because the Company takes physical delivery of the commodity, these contracts are not required to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Instead, realized gains and losses are included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of the contract.       At December 31, 2004, the Building Block Chemicals segment Fortier plant's 2005 forecasted natural gas utility requirements were 51% hedged utilizing natural gas forward contracts. These contracts had a notional value of $14.9 and have delivery dates from January 2005 through December 2005. Based on year-end NYMEX prices, the Company had net unrealized losses on its natural gas forward contracts at December 31, 2004 of $1.6. Assuming that year-end natural gas prices were to decrease by a hypothetical 10%, the above loss would be increased by approximately $1.4.                                         27        At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had outstanding natural gas swaps with a fair value loss of $0.7 and a fair value gain of $0.3, net of taxes, respectively.  Interest Rate Risk: At December 31, 2004, the outstanding borrowings of the Company consisted of fixed rate long-term debt, including the current portion, which had a carrying value of $419.1 a face value of $420.0 and a fair value, based on dealer quoted values, of approximately $418.8.       During 2004, the Company terminated certain interest rate swaps which had been designated as cash flow hedges. The net gain thereon of $2.9 is being amortized over the life of the 4.60% Notes as a decrease to interest expense of such notes. The amount of the unamortized swap settlement included in long-term debt was $2.7 at December 31, 2004.       Assuming other factors are held constant, interest rate changes generally affect the fair value of fixed rate debt. Accordingly, assuming a hypothetical increase of 1% in interest rates and all other variables remaining constant, interest expense would not change, however, the fair value of the fixed rate long-term debt would decrease by approximately $16.1.       To hedge the benchmark interest rate and credit spread on a portion of the debt that will be issued to finance the acquisition of Surface Specialties, the Company entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps (Refer to "Liquidity and Financial Condition" in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"). Assuming a hypothetical decrease of 1% in interest rates and all other variables remaining constant, the fair value of the forward-starting interest rate swaps would decrease by approximately $56.8.  OTHER  2005 OUTLOOK       The Company intends to provide its earnings outlook for 2005 after it closes on the pending acquisition of Surface Specialties. The closing is anticipated to take place about February 28, 2005 and therefore the Company anticipates that it will be able to provide its 2005 outlook when it reports first quarter earnings in May 2005.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements and changes in the estimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition.  Environmental and Other Contingent Liabilities       Accruals for environmental remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation, and other contingent liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are recorded at management's best estimate of the ultimate expected liabilities, without any discount to reflect the time value of money. These accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes available.       The amount accrued for environment remediation reflects the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature and cost of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties.       Included in other contingent liabilities are workers' compensation, product liability and toxic tort claims. The amount accrued for other contingent liabilities reflects the Company's assumptions about the incidence, severity, indemnity costs and dismissal rates for existing and future claims.       Accruals for environmental remediation and other contingent liabilities can change substantially if the Company's assumptions are not realized or due to actions by governmental agencies or private parties. The Company cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts. Moreover, environmental and other contingent liabilities are paid over an extended period, and the timing of such payments cannot be predicted with any certainty. Accruals for environmental and other contingent liabilities are recorded as other noncurrent liabilities with any amounts expected to be paid out in the next twelve months classified as accrued expenses.                                         28        Probable insurance recoveries for past and probable future costs are recorded at management's best estimate of the ultimate expected receipts without discounting to reflect the time value of money and are recorded as other assets. A number of factors impact the estimates of insurance reimbursements. These factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies, the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies, how legal and defense costs will be covered by the insurance polices, the interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships, and the Company's historical recovery rates over the past ten years.       Defense and processing costs are expensed as incurred. Probable insurance recoveries for defense and processing costs are accrued when the related costs are incurred and are recorded as other assets.       For additional information refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedule II, "Valuation and Qualifying Accounts."  Retirement Plans       The Company sponsors defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans. The postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements. The Company's most significant pension plans are in the U. S., and constituted over 76% of the Company's consolidated pension assets and 78% of projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2004. The calculation of the Company's pension expense and pension liability associated with its defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that the Company deems to be "critical accounting estimates." Changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions. The Company believes that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets.       At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount rate to be used for pension liabilities. In estimating this rate, the Company looks to rates of return on high quality, long term corporate bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. The Company discounted its U.S. future pension liabilities using rates of 5.75% and 6.25% at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities has a significant effect on expense. For example, a change of a quarter percentage point in either direction in the discount rate would change pension expense by approximately $1.7 and postretirement benefit expense by a negligible amount.       The decrease in the discount rate assumption is expected to increase the Company's net periodic pension expense for the U. S. pension plans by approximately $3.4 million in 2005 compared with 2004. The Company's net periodic benefit expense for the U. S. postretirement welfare plans is expected to decrease by approximately $0.4 million in 2005 compared with 2004.       The expected rate of return on plan assets reflects the long-term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability. The Company establishes the expected rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the Company at that time, including the historical returns of major asset classes, the expected investment mix of the plans' assets, and estimates of future long-term investment returns. The U. S. pension plan's investment mix at December 31, 2004 approximated 63% equities and 37% fixed income securities compared with 59% equities and 41% fixed income securities at December 31, 2003. Any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss. The unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss is amortized in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions".       The expected rate of return on assets in the U. S. pension plans is 8.5% for 2005, the same expected return as 2004. A change of a quarter percentage point in either direction in the expected rate of return on plan assets would change pension expense by approximately $1.0 and net postretirement expense by approximately $0.2 for 2005.       Pension plan and postretirement plan contributions in fiscal 2005 are expected to be $15.8 and $20.5, respectively. The estimate of contributions is based on significant assumptions, such as pension plan benefit levels, interest rate levels and the amount and timing of asset returns. Actual contributions could differ from this estimate.       For additional information refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.                                         29   Impairment of Goodwill       The Company has defined its segments as its SFAS No. 142 reporting units. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis. Goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company uses a two-step process to test goodwill for impairment. First, the reporting unit's fair value is compared to its carrying value. The Company utilizes a market multiple approach to determine fair value estimates. Due to the cyclical nature of the Company's reporting unit's, values are determined utilizing a three year average. The three year period is comprised of the prior year, current year and one year projected amounts. If the market multiple approach yields a result, which may indicate a possible impairment, a discounted cash flow approach is utilized to more precisely determine the reporting unit's fair value. If a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired, and the second step of the impairment test would be performed. The second step of the goodwill impairment test is used to measure the amount of the impairment loss. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.       Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.       These evaluations involve amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company is not aware of reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being estimated that would have a material impact on these assessments for impairment.  Income Taxes       Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.       The Company intends to reinvest the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes with respect to these earnings. In the event of repatriation to the U.S., such earnings would be subject to U.S. income taxes in most cases. Foreign tax credits would be available to substantially reduce the amount of U.S. tax otherwise payable in future years.       The Company's annual effective tax rate is based on expected income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's annual effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions.       The Company establishes accruals for tax contingencies when, notwithstanding the reasonable belief that its tax return positions are fully supported, the Company believes that certain filing positions are likely to be challenged and moreover, that such filing positions may not be fully sustained.       The Company continually evaluates its tax contingency accruals and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances, including but not limited to emerging case law, tax legislation, rulings by relevant tax authorities, and the progress of ongoing tax audits. Settlement of a given tax contingency could impact the income tax provision in the year of resolution. The Company's tax contingency accruals are presented in the balance sheet within income taxes payable.                                         30   Item 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
