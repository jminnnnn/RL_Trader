Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results         of Operations                       MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF                   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See Item 8. Dollars are in millions except share and per share amounts.                                RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The following table sets forth the percentage relationship that certain items in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income bear to net sales:                                                   Years Ended December 31,                                              1996       1995          1994  Net sales                                   100.0%     100.0%        100.0% Manufacturing cost of sales                  71.3       72.4          74.3 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gross profit                                 28.7       27.6          25.7 Selling and technical services               11.2       10.8          11.9 Research and process     development                               3.2        3.5           3.6 Administrative and general                    3.5        3.6           4.0 Earnings from operations                     10.8        9.7           6.2 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net earnings                                  7.9       22.4(1)        5.1 Excess of repurchase price     over related book value     of Series A Stock and     Series B Stock                           --        (15.5)         --                                        - 17 -      Dividends on preferred stock                 --          (0.8)        (1.3) Net earnings available for     common stockholders                      7.9%        6.1%         3.8% - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  (1)  Includes the 15% effect of a partial reversal of the tax valuation      allowance.                            NET SALES BY PRODUCT CATEGORY  The Company's net sales by product category are set forth below.                                                     Years Ended December 31,                                              1996          1995          1994                                          --------      --------      -------- Specialty Chemicals                      $  744.7      $  731.0      $  676.2 Specialty Materials                         320.5         305.6         272.8 Building Block Chemicals(1)                 194.4         223.5         152.3                                          $1,259.6      $1,260.1      $1,101.3  (1) More than half of the Company's production of building block chemicals were used internally in the manufacture of specialty chemicals, specialty materials and other building block chemicals. Such internal usage is not reflected in net sales of building block chemicals.       The Company has a 50% interest in each of five unconsolidated associated companies with aggregate net sales of $600.7 in 1996, $601.3 in 1995 and $500.7 in 1994, of which approximately 16.0% were sales of specialty chemicals in 1996 and 19.0% in 1995 and 1994 and approximately 84.0% were sales of specialty materials in 1996 and 81.0% in 1995 and 1994.      YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995  Net sales for 1996 were $1,259.6, which was essentially flat in comparison with 1995 net sales of $1,260.1. The Company's specialty product lines grew 2.8% principally on higher volumes. Building Block Chemical net sales decreased 13.0% as a result of lower selling prices and selling volumes in certain products.       International net sales grew to 39.1% of total net sales in 1996 from 37.9% of total net sales in 1995. On a regional basis, sales in the United States declined primarily due to decreased methanol sales as a result of lower selling prices and volumes plus the effect of divested products in 1996. Earnings from operations were up significantly in the United States as a result of cost reduction programs and an improved product mix. Also included in 1995 results for the region were startup costs associated with the expanded acrylonitrile facility. Sales and earnings from operations in the Asia/Pacific region were down principally due to lower export acrylic fiber and acrylonitrile selling prices.       Specialty Chemicals net sales increased $13.7, or 1.9%, with the increase spread among all regions of the world. Also affecting net sales in 1996 was the effect of divesting certain minor product lines, which had a negative impact on the year to year comparison in net sales. The most significant sales increases were in paper chemicals, where sales increased principally in North America as a result of a rebound in paper industry production and new business. Europe and Latin American sales also had modest increases for the year. Mining chemical net sales improved in most regions as new customers converted over to higher technology products. Polymer Additives net sales increased primarily in the North American and Asia/Pacific regions. Selling prices were up less than 1.0% for Specialty Chemicals in 1996.       Specialty Materials net sales increased $14.9, or 4.9%. Aerospace Materials net sales increased 9.3% due to volume increases at existing accounts and new customers. In addition, aircraft build rates started to improve in late 1996, and this trend is expected to continue in 1997. Acrylic Fibers net sales increased 2.0%, but volume was up 11.0%. Selling prices for acrylic fibers were down with the bulk of the price decrease coming from export sales.       Building Block Chemical net sales decreased $29.1, or 13.0%, primarily due to acrylonitrile and methanol. Acrylonitrile volume was up due to the expanded plant being in service for a full year, but this was more than offset by lower selling prices. Methanol sales decreased as a result of lower selling prices in the first half of 1996. In addition, methanol volumes were down in the first half of 1996 as a result of production downtime due to repairs as well as a shutdown in January 1996 due to poor economic conditions caused by low selling prices coupled with high natural gas costs.       Manufacturing cost of sales improved to 71.3% of net sales from 72.4% of net sales for 1995. Much of the improvement resulted from cost reduction programs, improved plant efficiencies in batch operation facilities, and an improved product mix as the Company divested or de-emphasized low margin products. Raw materials were generally lower with the exception of natural gas, which was significantly higher than the year ago period. Natural gas prices are expected to remain well above 1995 levels in 1997. Selling prices                                        - 18 -       were slightly higher in the specialty businesses with the exception of export acrylic fibers, where prices were down significantly. The Company does not plan on any significant price increases in 1997.       Selling and technical service expenses increased $5.0 and increased as a percent of sales to 11.2% from the 10.8% of sales experienced in 1995. The 1996 amount reflected the full year effect of certain investments the Company made in this area during 1995. In particular, investments in the international regions have increased, partially offset by reduced expenses in North America, where the Company has been able to rationalize its costs. This trend is expected to continue in 1997.       Research and process development expenses decreased $4.0 and were 3.2% of net sales in 1996. The decrease was the result of a reduction in non-value-added overhead costs at our research facilities completed in late 1995. Technical spending as it relates to our product lines increased from the prior year as planned.       Administrative and general expenses decreased $0.8 in 1996 and decreased as a percent of net sales to 3.5% from 3.6% in 1995. The Company continues to focus on tight cost controls in this area and expects spending for 1997 to remain at this level or possibly decrease.       Interest and other income (expense), net, decreased $0.4, principally as a result of reduced interest income on lower cash balances maintained during the year, partially offset by other income from royalties and technology sales and fees.       Interest expense increased $3.0 due to higher levels of debt outstanding primarily as a result of the Company's stock repurchase program.       The income tax provision for 1996 reflects an effective tax rate of 40.0%. This was a decrease of approximately 3.0%, excluding the effect of a tax valuation reversal in 1995. The lower effective rate was the result of a focused tax strategy designed to reduce, where applicable, the Company's tax burden. In addition, a one-time benefit of $1.4 was recorded in the fourth quarter to recognize the tax effect of a noncash transaction completed in December 1996.       Equity in net earnings of associated companies, all of which are 50% owned, represents the Company's after tax share of its associates' earnings. Such earnings increased $1.0 from 1995. Increased earnings were reported by CYRO Industries, reflecting the capacity expansions completed in the second half of 1995 plus lower raw material costs. Earnings of Dyno-Cytec improved over the prior year as a result of higher sales and lower raw material costs. Partially offsetting the above were reduced earnings from Criterion Catalyst Company. The lower earnings were the result of several factors: the purchase of high cost intermediate product from third parties due to capacity constraints, start-up costs related to capacity expansions and lower hydroprocessing catalyst selling prices.       Dividends on preferred stock were essentially eliminated as the Company repurchased all of its Series A Cumulative Adjustable Preferred Stock ("Series A Stock") and Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series B Stock") in the second half of 1995. Dividends on the outstanding Series C Cumulative Preferred Stock ("Series C Stock") were negligible.       Net earnings available for common stockholders increased $23.8, or 31.2%, over the year ago period.      YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994  In 1995, net sales were $1,260.1, an increase of $158.8, or 14.4%, as compared with 1994. The net sales increase was due primarily to improved sales volume and higher selling prices in the majority of the Company's product lines. International net sales grew to 37.9% of net sales in 1995 from 31.1% of net sales in 1994.       Specialty Chemicals net sales increased $54.8, or 8.1%, with the largest increases coming from international operations. The European net sales increase was widely spread among most product lines and was due to improved economies, market share gains and the favorable effect of exchange rates. Asia/Pacific net sales gains were made primarily in Korea, Taiwan and Australia and across most product lines. Latin American net sales increased as demand for the Company's higher technology products continued to grow. U.S. net sales of Specialty Chemicals increased $16.8, or 4.0%. U.S. net sales increases in the first half of 1995 were offset in part by decreases in the second half of 1995 as a result of what management believes to be a correction for high inventory levels by certain customers and a slower growth rate in the U.S. economy. This particularly impacted the polymer additives product line and coatings and resin product lines.       Specialty Materials net sales increased $32.8, or 12.0%. Aerospace Materials reported the largest increase in net sales principally due to new business in the aerospace sector. Acrylic fibers reported a strong gain due primarily to higher selling prices. Acrylic fiber selling volume was down in the fourth quarter due to sharply reduced exports to China.       Building Block Chemicals net sales increased $71.2, or 46.7%. Methanol sales accounted for $12.3 of the increase, since the methanol plant was still under construction until September 1994. Partially offsetting the higher sales volume were methanol selling prices that were much lower than during the fourth quarter of 1994 and unscheduled maintenance downtime in the methanol manufacturing facility in the third quarter of 1995. Acrylonitrile sales increased due to additional capacity available from the expanded acrylonitrile manufacturing plant, which started up in the second quarter of 1995. In addition, acrylonitrile selling prices were well above the prior year. Partially offsetting the higher acrylonitrile sales was unscheduled maintenance downtime in the acrylonitrile manufacturing facility in the third quarter of 1995. Acrylamide sales also increased over the prior year period, principally in the United States and Europe.       Manufacturing cost of sales improved to 72.4% of net sales in 1995 as compared with 74.3% of net sales for 1994. Much of the improvement was due to manufacturing cost efficiencies as costs, excluding raw materials and utilities, increased at a much lower rate than the growth in net sales. Overall, selling prices were up for the year, but not in all product lines due to competitive pressures. The                                       - 19 -    bulk of the increase in selling prices occurred in the first nine months of 1995. Raw material costs started to decline in the third quarter of 1995 and continued through the fourth quarter, although not for all raw materials.      Selling and technical service expenses increased $4.9, but decreased as a percent of net sales to 10.8% from 11.9% in 1994. The increase in expenses primarily reflected the full-year effect of the increased investment in international markets. The decrease as a percent of net sales indicates that the Company has been able to leverage its investment in this area.      Research and process development expenses increased $4.2, but were slightly lower as a percent of net sales in 1995 as compared with 1994. The increase in expenses was the result of costs associated with certain patent litigation matters and higher spending on applications technology. The increase in spending on applications technology was in line with the Company's targeted spending for 1995.      Administrative and general expenses increased $1.2 in 1995, but decreased as a percent of net sales to 3.6% from 4.0% in 1994. The increase in expenses was the result of the full-year impact of costs added in the second half of 1994 as the Company started up certain functions as a result of becoming an independent public company.      Interest and other income (expense), net, decreased $1.8 principally as a result of decreased interest income on lower cash balances and a gain from the sale of certain assets related to a minor product line which was included in the third quarter of 1994.       Except for the partial reversal of the tax valuation allowance of $193.0 in the fourth quarter of 1995, the income tax provision in each period was based on the estimated effective tax rate for the full year.       Equity in net earnings of associated companies for 1995 increased $3.8 from 1994. Increased earnings were recorded by CYRO Industries as a result of higher selling prices and increased sales of methyl methacrylate monomer due to a plant expansion. Earnings from Criterion Catalyst Company also improved due to higher selling volume, particularly of new and improved products. These increases were partially offset by losses from Mitsui-Cytec due to expenses associated with the start-up of a new resins manufacturing facility and the shutdown of an existing resins facility.       Dividends on preferred stock were lower than the prior year period due to the repurchase of all of the Series A Stock and Series B Stock. The reduced dividends, offset in part by lower interest income and higher interest expense from these transactions as well as the reduced fully diluted common shares outstanding, had a positive impact of approximately $0.15 for the full year on fully diluted earnings per common share. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Financial Condition."       Net earnings available for common stockholders reflected a $195.2 reduction recorded in the fourth quarter of 1995 upon the completion of the repurchase of the Series B Stock. The $195.2 represented the excess of the repurchase price of the Series A Stock and Series B Stock over the related book value.                                       - 20 -                             LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  At December 31, 1996, the Company's cash balance was $20.4,  an increase of $8.4 from year end 1995.       Net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $170.8 for the year ended December 31, 1996, compared with $160.8 in the same period of 1995. Cash was favorably impacted on by increased net earnings, after adjusting for the partial reversal of the tax valuation allowance in 1995, and improved accounts receivable due to lower days outstanding. Inventory levels increased primarily in the international regions as the Company expanded its presence outside of the United States. Other liabilities decreased primarily as a result of increased environmental spending in 1996 as more projects reached the remediation phase of activity.       Environmental remediation spending for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, was $26.8, $22.1, and $15.7, respectively. There can be no assurances that the Company's annual cash expenditures will not be higher in the future.       While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending environmental suits and claims, it is reasonably possible that there will be a necessity for future provisions for environmental costs which, in management's opinion, will not have a material effect on the financial position of the Company, but could be material to the results of operations of the Company in any one accounting period. The Company cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amount. Moreover, environmental liabilities are paid over an extended period, and the timing of such payments cannot be predicted with any confidence. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to environmental matters.       The Company is also a party to various other claims and routine litigation arising in the normal course of its business. Based on the advice of counsel, management believes that the resolution of such claims and litigation will not have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Company but could be material to the results of operations of the Company in any one accounting period.       Net cash flows used for investing activities totaled $41.0. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 1996 of $72.5 were lower than for the corresponding period in 1995 due primarily to the acrylonitrile expansion which was completed in 1995. Capital expenditures for the year 1997 are expected to be in the range of $90.0 to $95.0.       During 1996, the Company received $25.0 from its associated company, CYRO Industries, as a return of capital. CYRO Industries financed the distribution in part by bank borrowings of $40.0. Also during the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company sold the majority of the assets of its aluminum sulfate business and received approximately $11.0 in cash proceeds before taxes.       The Company believes that, based on internal cash generation and current levels of liquid assets, it will be able to fund operating cash requirements and planned capital expenditures in 1997.       Net cash flows used for financing activities totaled $121.5 compared with $161.0 in 1995. In 1995 the Company repurchased its Series A Stock and the Series B Stock for a total of $395.1. Partially offsetting the above use of cash in 1995 were proceeds from the   Company's stock offering, net of discount and expenses, of $181.2 and net borrowings of $66.0. The reduction in preferred stock dividend payments of $14.4 favorably affected net cash flows used for financing activities in 1996. Net cash flows used for financing activities in 1996 were principally affected by the purchase of treasury stock of $148.7. In February 1996, the Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase up to 1,700,000 (pre-split basis) shares of the Company's common stock, of which approximately 885,400 shares were  repurchased prior to the Company's three-for-one stock split in July 1996. The remaining authorized balance was adjusted for the stock split to bring the total shares authorized for repurchase to approximately 3,329,200. Pursuant to this program, for the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company repurchased approximately 3,033,000 shares of its common stock on the open market (equivalent to 4,803,800 on a post-split basis) at a cost of approximately $148.7, leaving 296,200 shares remaining authorized to be repurchased. The Company anticipates completing its current stock repurchase program during the first quarter of 1997. Depending on the level, price and timing of repurchases, borrowings may be required. In connection with the repurchase program, the Company wrote put warrants on 1,500,000 shares of its common stock (on a post-split basis) for which it received premiums of approximately $1.7 in cash. At December 31, 1996, all warrants expired at no cost to the Company.       In June 1995, the Company executed a five-year (due on June 1, 2000) $150.0 unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the "Credit Agreement"). Funds are available for general corporate purposes including, without limitation, for purposes of making acquisitions permitted under the Credit Agreement. At December 31, 1996 and 1995, outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement were $88.0 and $65.0, respectively. At December 31, 1996, the effective interest rate on borrowings was 5.876%, which was based on short-term London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a .25% margin. The Credit Agreement contains covenants customary for such facilities, including a leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company had an additional $62.0 available at December 31, 1996.       The Credit Agreement also provides that it is an event of default if any person other than American Home Products Corporation and its subsidiaries acquires more than 20% of the voting power of all voting stock of the Company. The Company was in compliance with all material terms, covenants and conditions of the Credit Agreement at December 31, 1996. Other debt was $1.0 at both December 31, 1996 and 1995.       Under the terms of its Series C Stock, the Company must maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 2-to-1 and must not incur more than $150.0 of debt unless the Company's equity is in excess of $200.0, in which case the Company may incur additional debt as long as its debt-to-equity ratio is not more than 0.75-to-1. At December 31, 1996, the Company had $89.0 in debt, $314.3 in equity, as defined in the Series C Stock covenants, and the ability to incur up to an additional $146.7 in debt under the terms of the Series C Stock.       The Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission during 1996 a shelf registration statement (which has yet to become effective) covering $300.0 of senior debt securities which may be offered by the Company from time to time. Proceeds of any sale can be used for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of indebtedness and other liabilities, share repurchases, additions to working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions.       During 1996 and 1995, the Company made contributions to its VEBA to fund certain employee and retiree health care benefits. The balance in the VEBA trusts at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was $25.2 and $20.0, respectively.       The Company had foreign currency contracts at December 31, 1996 and 1995. The contracts are utilized by the Company to hedge certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables and are not used for speculation. All contracts are for periods of six months or less. At December 31, 1996, the Company had net contracts to sell $14.7 of primarily European currencies for U.S. dollars, and Dutch guilders having a value equivalent of $10.4 for other European currencies. At December 31, 1995, the Company had net contracts to sell $25.0 of primarily European currencies for U.S. dollars, and Dutch guilders having a value equivalent of $1.5 for other European currencies. In addition, the Company occasionally hedges to reduce its exposure to future price changes of natural gas used in the Company's manufacturing activities. At December 31, 1996, the Company had contracts to buy natural gas at set future prices with settlement dates through March 31, 1997. The maturity of these contracts highly correlates to the actual purchases of the commodity. The contracts outstanding at December 31, 1996 and 1995, were not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. During 1996, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage its debt portfolio. These agreements were immaterial to the Company's financial statements at December 31, 1996. There were no interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 1995.       The impact of inflation on the Company is considered insignificant as the rate of inflation has remained relatively low in recent years.                                    OTHER MATTERS  On January 31, 1997, the Company completed the sale of its Acrylic Fibers business to a subsidiary of Sterling Chemicals, Inc. The assets transferred include Cytec's plant located near Pensacola, Florida. The Company received approximately $88.0 in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, and received other consideration including the assumption by Sterling of certain contingent and other liabilities, with a value of approximately $15.0. The Company expects to record a gain from this transaction in the first quarter of 1997. Cytec's Acrylic Fibers business had sales of approximately $138.7, $136.1 and $121.1 in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.       On November 8, 1996, the Company announced a restructuring proposal for its Botlek, Netherlands plant. The restructuring would include a major reengineering of the plant organization, relocation of certain manufacturing operations to other Cytec sites and staff                                       - 21 -      reductions. The proposal was subject to negotiations with the Works Council and the Unions. The negotiations were completed in February and the Company is moving forward with the restructuring. The Company expects to record a charge against earnings in the first quarter of 1997 related to this transaction.       On January 16, 1997, the Company announced the consolidation of its surfactant and docusate manufacturing at its Willow Island, West Virginia facility. As a result of this consolidation, the Company will close its Linden, New Jersey plant. The phasedown of the Linden facility will occur over approximately the next 18 months. The Company expects to record a charge against earnings in the first quarter of 1997 related to this transaction.       The Company believes that the impact of the above divestiture and restructurings will have an immaterial effect on the results of operations for 1997.                                     COMMENTS ON                            FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  A number of the statements made by the Company in this Management's Discussion and Analysis, or in other documents, including but not limited to the Company's Annual Report to Stockholders, its press releases and its periodic reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, may be regarded as "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.       Forward-looking statements include, among others, statements concerning the Company's outlook for 1997, pricing trends and forces within the industry, cost reduction strategies and their results, long-term goals of the Company and other statements of expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends, and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.       All predictions as to future results contain a measure of uncertainty and, accordingly, actual results could differ materially. Among the factors that could cause a difference are: changes in the general economy, in demand for the Company's products or in the costs and availability of its raw materials; the actions of competitors; technological change; changes in employee relations, including possible strikes; government regulations; litigation, including its inherent uncertainty; difficulties in plant operations and materials transportation; environmental matters; and other unforeseen circumstances. A number of these factors are discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.                                        - 22 -      Item 8.
