Item 7.   MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the description of our business and risk factors contained in Part I of this report. Currency amounts are in millions, except per share amounts. Percentages are approximate.   GENERAL       We are a global specialty chemicals and materials company and sell our products to diverse major markets for aerospace, adhesives, automotive andindustrial coatings, inks, mining and plastics. Sales price and volume by region and the impact of exchange rates on our reporting segments are important measures that are analyzed by management and are provided in our segment analysis.   We report net sales in four geographic regions: North America, Latin America, Asia/Pacific and Europe/Middle East/Africa. The destination of the saledetermines the region under which it is reported consistent with managements view of the business. North America consists of the United States and Canada. Latin America includes Mexico, Central America, South America and the Caribbean Islands.Asia/Pacific is comprised of Asia, Australia and the islands of the South Pacific Rim.    Selling price changes and raw material cost changesyear on year are an important factor in profitability especially in years of high volatility. Global oil and natural gas costs in certain countries are highly volatile and many of our raw materials are derived from these two commodities. Discussionof the year to year impact of raw materials and energy is provided in our segment discussion. In addition, higher global demand levels and, occasionally, operating difficulties at suppliers, have limited the availability of certain of our rawmaterials.    On February 28, 2011, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of our Building BlockChemicals business (the Business) to Cornerstone Chemical Company, an affiliate of HIG Capital, LLC (the Purchaser), pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Agreement) dated January 28, 2011, between theCompany and the Purchaser. The total consideration received from the sale was $175.7, including cash consideration of $160.7 that we received at closing and a promissory note for $15.0. A cash payment of $6.6 was made to the Purchaser in July 2011as final settlement of the agreed upon working capital transferred, resulting in net realized consideration of $169.1. Accordingly, the business has been treated as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Footnote 2 fora further discussion.    Coating Resins Business     In January 2012, we announced that we have retained an advisor, J.P. Morgan, to assist us in reviewing all strategic options for a separation of the entire Coating Resins segment and the pressuresensitive adhesives product line, which is included in the Engineered Materials segment. Our intention is to review all our options with respect to these businesses as we had previously disclosed during the third quarter 2011 earnings conferencecall. We expect to complete this review and make a decision regarding the separation of these businesses in the second quarter of 2012.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following table sets forth the percentage relationship that certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income bear to net sales:                      Years Ended December 31,      2011        2010        2009        Net sales         100.0  %         100.0  %         100.0  %      Manufacturing cost of sales         75.8            75.5            81.3         Gross profit         24.2            24.5            18.7         Selling and technical services         7.3            7.5            8.1         Research and process development         2.7            2.6            3.1         Administrative and general         4.1            4.6            5.1         Amortization of acquisition intangibles         1.3            1.3            1.6         Gain on sale of assets         (0.1  )         0.0            0.0         Asset impairment charge         0.0            0.0            0.2         Earnings from operations         8.9            8.5            0.6         Net earnings (loss) attributable to Cytec Industries Inc.         6.8            6.3            (0.1  )        -17-        NET SALES BY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA                              Net Sales      North America         Latin America         Asia/ Pacific         Europe/ Middle East/ Africa         Total        2011                                        Engineered Materials      $  567.5          $  8.9          $  49.5          $  281.9          $  907.8         In-Process Separation         97.6             105.6             80.3             56.0             339.5         Additive Technologies         106.3             22.5             65.2             82.8             276.8         Coating Resins         316.0             69.8             367.2             796.0             1,549.0         Total         1,087.4             206.8             562.2             1,216.7             3,073.1         2010                                        Engineered Materials      $  485.0          $  7.2          $  40.7          $  241.2          $  774.1         In-Process Separation         76.8             90.1             66.1             59.2             292.2         Additive Technologies         101.5             19.7             64.7             73.5             259.4         Coating Resins         303.9             64.1             346.1             708.5             1,422.6         Total      $  967.2          $  181.1          $  517.6          $  1,082.4          $  2,748.3         2009                                        Engineered Materials      $  449.3          $  4.3          $  34.0          $  229.9          $  717.5         In-Process Separation         69.0             79.7             69.5             47.6             265.8         Additive Technologies         90.8             19.7             55.4             73.2             239.1         Coating Resins         260.0             50.5             274.3             622.1             1,206.9         Total      $  869.1          $  154.2          $  433.2          $  972.8          $  2,429.3            Net sales in the United States were $1,017.4, $906.1,and $810.5, or 33%, 33%, and 33% of total net sales, for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. International net sales were $2,055.7, $1,842.2, and $1,618.8, or 67%, 67%, and 67% of total net sales, for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.   We have four reportable business segments: Engineered Materials, In-Process Separation, Additive Technologies, and Coating Resins. The EngineeredMaterials segment principally includes the following product lines: advanced composites, carbon fiber, structural film and pressure sensitive adhesives, and formulated resins. The In-Process Separation segment includes mining chemicals andphosphines. The Additive Technologies segment includes polymer additives and specialty additives. The Coating Resins segment includes the following product lines: specialty coating resins, industrial coating resins, and powder coating resins.Included in the specialty coating resins product line are specialty radiation-cured resins (Radcure resins) and waterborne resins. Included in the industrial coating resins product line are Radcure commodities, amino cross-linkers, solventborneresins, and urethane resins. In-Process Separation, Additive Technologies, and Coating Resins are managed under one executive leader and are referred to collectively as Cytec Specialty Chemicals.   For more information on our segments, refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and further discussions under SegmentResults below.    YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010       Consolidated Results   Net sales for 2011 were $3,073.1, compared with $2,748.3 for 2010. Overall, net sales increased 12%, driven by price increases of 8%, a favorable impactfrom changes in exchange rates of 2%, and volume increases of 2%. Higher selling prices improved sales in all segments in 2011 compared to 2010, but especially for Coatings Resins, which had 11% price increases. Engineered Materials and In-ProcessSeparation improved their selling volumes by 13% and 9%, respectively, compared to the 2010 period. Coating Resins sales volumes, down 6% compared to 2010, fell across all regions, while Additive Technologies sales were impacted by 1%lower volumes compared to 2010. For a detailed discussion on sales, refer to the Segment Results section below.    Manufacturing costof sales was $2,330.5, or 75.8% of sales, for 2011 compared with $2,074.0, or 75.5% of sales, for 2010. The increase in manufacturing cost of sales of $256.5 compared to 2010 is due primarily to higher raw material costs and the impact of changes inforeign exchange rates in 2011. The increase consists of $186.6 related to higher raw material costs, the unfavorable impact of changes in exchange rates of $52.1, of which $35.6 relates to raw materials, $33.8 related to higher period costs, andhigher restructuring       -18-        costs of $2.4. The higher period costs were mostly due to increased costs from higher production demand and volume in the Engineered Materials segment. These increases were partially offset by$15.2 in reduced costs due to lower net sales volume across the other three segments in 2011 and favorable fixed cost absorption of $3.2. Approximately $11.8 of restructuring charges are included in manufacturing cost of sales in 2011, mostly fromour closure of our manufacturing facility in Suzano, Brazil in the third quarter. Restructuring charges in cost of sales in 2010 were $9.4, primarily related to the exit of a phosphorus product at out Mt. Pleasant manufacturing facility, andadditional restructurings at our European manufacturing locations. Included in manufacturing cost of sales is a $3.9 credit pertaining to environmental accrual adjustments for revised estimates at active sites due to approved, modified plans forremediation.    Selling and technical services expenses were $224.4 for 2011 versus $205.4 for 2010. Research and process development expenses in2011 were $84.6 versus $72.5 in the prior year. Administrative and general expenses were $125.7 versus $125.4 in the prior year. Overall operating expenses increased by $31.4. This increase is primarily related to higher 2011 operating costs of$23.1, the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates of $11.3, and higher restructuring charges in 2011 of $10.4, primarily related to the realignment of the supporting structure of the Coating Resins segment in the first half of 2011.These increases were partially offset by $14.0 of reduced costs from lower consulting fees and other general corporate expenses.    Amortizationof acquisition intangibles was $38.7 for 2011 versus $37.1 for 2010 mostly due to increases in Coating Resins amortization as a result of changes in exchange rates.    Net gain on sale of assets of $3.3 in 2011 includes a gain from the sale of a former manufacturing site in Bogota, Colombia in the first quarter of 2011.   Other expense, net was $4.5 for 2011 versus $5.6 for 2010. Included in 2011 are environmental accrual charges related to inactive locations totaling $5.2,and a charge of $1.2 related to the settlement of an existing pension plan in an international jurisdiction. These expenses were partially offset by transaction exchange gains of $4.0 during the year. Included in 2010 are environmental accrualsrelated to inactive locations totaling $8.3 and losses on cross currency swaps of $3.0. Also included in 2010 are a gain on the sale of a parcel of land of $2.3, a gain from the settlement of a legal claim of $2.4, and transaction exchange gains of$1.7.    The loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2011 was $0.3, compared to a loss of $0.8 in 2010, due to early repurchases of $5.4 and$16.5 in 2011 and 2010, respectively, of our notes due in 2013.    Equity in earnings of associated companies was $1.3 in 2011 versus $1.0 in2010.   Interest expense, net was $35.8 for 2011 compared with $33.2 for 2010. The $2.6 increase is primarily due to the $7.3 reduction in thebenefits of the interest differential on the five year cross currency swaps, which settled on October 1, 2010, and on the ten year cross currency swaps, which were re-designated as a net investment hedge on October 1, 2010. The increase waspartially offset by higher interest income of $2.3 on cash balances and the note receivable from the sale of our former Building Block Chemicals segment, higher capitalized interest of $1.2, and the 2010 redemption of our 5.5% notes which reducedinterest by $0.6.    The effective income tax rate for 2011 was a tax provision of 27.8% ($64.8) compared to a tax provision of25.9% ($50.5) for 2010. The 2011 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $3.8 related to the resolution of an international tax matter. In addition to the $3.8 benefit noted, the 2011 effective tax rate includes discretetax benefits of $2.3 attributable to several tax rate changes in certain tax jurisdictions.    Earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxwas $42.5 in 2011 compared with $30.3 in 2010 and reflects the results of our former Building Block Chemicals segment. The results in 2011 include the net after tax gain of $34.6 resulting from the sale of the business in the first quarter of 2011.   Net income for 2011 was $207.8, or $4.24 per diluted share, compared with net income in 2010 of $172.3, or $3.46 per diluted share. For 2011,net income includes an after-tax charge of $14.9, or $0.30 per diluted share, for restructuring activities principally related to the Coating Resins segment, a $3.3 after-tax charge, or $0.07 per diluted share, related to increases in theenvironmental liabilities at inactive sites for an updated estimate of future remediation costs, and an after tax charge of $0.4, or $0.01 per share, for the accelerated depreciation of the Stamford research and development facility we sold in 2011,but are required to maintain on our books until our environmental obligation is satisfied. Additionally, net income in 2011 includes the after-tax gain of $2.1, or $0.04 per diluted share, on the sale of our former manufacturing site in Bogota,Colombia, and an after-tax benefit of $2.6, or $0.05 per diluted share, associated with the adjustment of our environmental liabilities primarily at an active site in Europe due to local approval of revised remediation plans. Included in 2010 was anafter-tax charge of $5.6 related to various restructuring initiatives including consolidation and a closure of       -19-        manufacturing operations in Europe, and the exit of certain phosphorus derivative products at our Mt. Pleasant, TN facility. Our 2010 results also include an after-tax charge of $2.9 relatedto an increase in environmental liabilities at two inactive locations for a change in estimate for operating and maintenance costs, a tax charge of $8.3 related to the impact of health care legislation, and a tax benefit of $15.7 related to avaluation allowance reversal in international jurisdictions.        SegmentResults (Sales to external customers)    Year-to-year comparisons and analyses of changes in net sales by segment and geographic region areset forth below:    Engineered Materials                                                                               % Change Due to             2011         2010         Total % Change        Price        Volume/Mix        Currency        North America      $  567.5          $  485.0             17  %         4  %         13  %         0  %      Latin America         8.9             7.2             24  %         (2  %)         23  %         3  %      Asia/Pacific         49.5             40.7             22  %         2  %         20  %         0  %      Europe/Middle East/Africa         281.9             241.2             17  %         4  %         11  %         2  %      Total      $  907.8          $  774.1             17  %         3  %         13  %         1  %         Overall, net sales increased 17% primarily due toincreased selling volumes of 13%. The higher selling volumes in 2011 are due to the continued ramp up of new large commercial transport programs, build rate increases for existing large commercial transport programs, and the general recovery ofthe civil aircraft market. These volume increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes to the military sector related to the sunset of the C-17 and F-22 programs. Selling prices across all product lines increased net sales by 3%, whilechanges in exchange rates favorably impacted sales by 1%.    Earnings from operations were $131.7, or 15% of net sales, in 2011, compared with$115.6, or 15% of net sales, in 2010. The $16.1 increase in earnings was driven by increased marginal income of $62.7 due to higher sales volumes, higher selling prices of $26.1, and favorable absorption of $5.8 due to increased productionlevels in 2011. These positive    impacts were partially offset by higher manufacturing and freight costs of $37.2 in support of increasedproduction volumes and preparations for expected further volume increases in the near future, $26.5 of cost escalations driven primarily by higher raw material costs, $12.2 of higher operating expenses due to continued investments in selling andtechnology in support of new growth, and the unfavorable impact of changes in exchange rates of $2.7.        In-Process Separation                                                                               % Change Due to             2011         2010         Total % Change        Price        Volume/Mix        Currency        North America      $  97.6          $  76.8             27  %         12  %         15  %         0  %      Latin America         105.6             90.1             17  %         7  %         10  %         0  %      Asia/Pacific         80.3             66.1             21  %         (1  %)         18  %         4  %      Europe/Middle East/Africa         56.0             59.2             (5  %)         4  %         (9  %)         0  %      Total      $  339.5          $  292.2             16  %         6  %         9  %         1  %         Overall, net sales were up 16%, primarily due toincreased selling volumes of 9% based on strong demand for mining products in the alumina and copper markets and phosphine products in North America. Selling prices increased by 6%, with increases in both the mining and phosphines businesses. Theseprice increases reflect our efforts to offset higher raw material costs. Changes in exchange rates favorably impacted net sales by 1%.   Earnings from operations were $69.7, or 21% of net sales, in 2011, compared with $55.2, or 19% of net sales, in 2010. The $14.5 increase in earningsis the result of increased marginal income of $22.7 due to higher volumes, increased selling prices of $17.3, and favorable absorption $1.6 due to higher sales demand. This is partially offset by higher raw material costs of $12.9, higher operatingexpenses of $9.5 caused by increased headcount related to the segments growth initiatives, higher freight costs of $1.5 due to increased volumes, additional period costs of $1.1 due to maintenance activities, and an unfavorable impact fromchanges in exchange rates of $2.1.       -20-        Additive Technologies                                                                              % Change Due to             2011         2010         Total % Change        Price        Volume/Mix        Currency        North America      $  106.3          $  101.5             5  %         7  %         (2  %)         0  %      Latin America         22.5             19.7             14  %         7  %         5  %         2  %      Asia/Pacific         65.2             64.7             1  %         2  %         (4  %)         3  %      Europe/Middle East/Africa         82.8             73.5             13  %         7  %         1  %         5  %      Total      $  276.8          $  259.4             7  %         6  %         (1  %)         2  %         Overall, net sales increased 7%, of which 6%pertains to selling price increases, especially for the specialty additives business. These price increases reflect our efforts to recover the higher raw materials costs. Selling volumes decreased by 1%, primarily due to lower demand for products inthe polymer additives business. Additionally, changes in exchange rates favorably improved net sales by 2%.    Earnings from operations were$36.7, or 13% of net sales, for 2011, compared with $36.9, or 14% of net sales, in 2010. The $0.2 decrease in earnings is due to higher raw material costs of $9.9, reduced marginal income of $2.1 on lower volumes, and higher period andoperating expenses of $6.5 due to salary inflation factors and higher plant maintenance costs, and a $0.8 bad debt provision for a polymer additives customer in Spain. The negative effects are essentially offset by $14.5 of selling price increases,favorable production absorption of $1.4 reflecting higher production levels through the third quarter, a net favorable impact from changes in exchange rates of $2.7, and lower freight costs of $0.5 due to lower volumes.       Coating Resins                                                                              % Change Due to             2011         2010         Total % Change        Price        Volume/Mix        Currency        North America      $  316.0          $  303.9             4  %         11  %         (7  %)         0  %      Latin America         69.8             64.1             9  %         9  %         (1  %)         1  %      Asia/Pacific         367.2             346.1             6  %         9  %         (8  %)         5  %      Europe/Middle East/Africa         796.0             708.5             12  %         12  %         (5  %)         5  %      Total      $  1,549.0          $  1,422.6             9  %         11  %         (6  %)         4  %         Overall, net sales were up 9%, predominantly due toincreased selling prices of 11%. Selling prices increased across all product lines, reflecting our concerted efforts to recover higher raw material costs. Selling volumes were down 6% in 2011 as compared to 2010. Except for waterborne products, wehad lower demand across almost all of our products lines. Demand for waterborne products in the automotive markets was stronger in the first half of the year. Changes in exchange rates favorably impacted net sales by 4%.   Earnings from operations were $65.1, or 4% of net sales, in 2011, compared with earnings from operations of $68.2, or 5% of net sales, in 2010. Thedecrease of $3.1 in year over year earnings primarily is due to $137.3 of higher raw material costs, reduced marginal income of $30.8 due to lower volumes, net unfavorable absorption of $5.6 due to reduced production from lower demand, and $1.5 ofhigher period and operating expenses caused by salary inflation factors and consulting fees. The negative effects are partially offset by the favorable impacts of $158.9 from increased selling prices, lower freight costs of $8.3 caused by lowervolumes, and $4.8 from the net favorable impact of changes in exchange rates.    YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDEDDECEMBER 31, 2009        ConsolidatedResults    Net sales for 2010 were $2,748.3 compared with $2,429.3 for 2009. Overall, sales increased 13%, driven by volume increases of 12%and price increases of 2%, offset by unfavorable changes in exchange rates of 1%. Selling volumes increased in all segments in 2010 compared to 2009. Higher selling prices increased sales in Coatings Resins, Additive Technologies, and EngineeredMaterials, by 4%, 2% and 1%, respectively, compared to the 2009 period. Overall selling prices for In-Process Separation were flat as higher mineral processing product prices were offset by lower prices in phosphine and alumina products. For adetailed discussion on sales, refer to the Segment Results section below.       -21-        Manufacturing cost of sales was $2,074.0, or 75.5%, of sales for 2010 compared with $1,975.3, or 81.3%, ofsales for 2009. The 5.8% decrease in manufacturing cost of sales as a percent of sales is primarily attributable to improved manufacturing cost leverage on the increased volume and lower restructuring charges. The increase in manufacturing cost ofsales of $98.7 includes $164.6 related to the increased raw materials volume, $50.5 related to higher raw material costs, $32.0 of increased period costs resulting from the elimination of the 2009 short term cost reduction initiatives and to supportimproved sales volume in 2010, and $18.7 related to higher freight also due to higher volumes as well as rate increases. These increases were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption of $62.4 related to increased production as well as theinitiative to lower inventory levels in 2009, $59.5 of lower restructuring charges, $20.2 due to the exit of certain product lines in 2009, and the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates of $21.9, of which $19.7 relates to rawmaterials. Manufacturing cost of sales for 2010 also includes $3.6 of lower expenses related to environmental contingent liabilities compared with 2009. Restructuring charges included in 2010 were $9.4 of costs primarily related to the exit ofa phosphorus product at our Mt. Pleasant manufacturing facility, and additional restructurings at our European manufacturing locations. Manufacturing cost of sales for 2009 includes restructuring charges of $68.9, which includes manufacturing costsavings initiatives launched within our Specialty Chemical and Engineered Materials segments and corporate functions throughout 2009.    Sellingand technical services expenses were $205.4 for 2010 versus $197.0 for 2009. Research and process development expenses were $72.5 versus $75.0 in the prior year. Administrative and general expenses were $125.4 versus $124.2 in the prior year.Overall operating expenses increased by $7.1. This increase is primarily related to higher 2010 operating costs of $26.0, including the elimination of the 2009 short term cost reductions previously discussed, partially offset by lower restructuringcharges in 2010 of $17.7.    Amortization of acquisition intangibles was $37.1 for 2010 versus $38.2 for 2009 mostly due to decreases in CoatingResins amortization as a result of changes in exchange rates.    Net gain on sale of assets of $0.2 in 2009 includes a gain of $1.5 associatedwith the sale in the first quarter of 2009 of certain of our polyurethane product line assets in Europe and a loss of $1.3 associated with the sale of our polyurethane product line assets in Asia in the second quarter of 2009. See Note 2 of Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements for further information.    Asset impairment charge of $4.3 in 2009 relates to the write down of the land atour closed facility in La Llagosta, Spain to its estimated fair value.    Other expense, net was $5.6 for 2010 versus $2.6 for 2009. Included in2010 are environmental accruals related to inactive locations totaling $8.3 and losses on cross currency swaps of $3.0. Also included in 2010 are a gain on the sale of a parcel of land of $2.3, a gain from the settlement of a legal claim of $2.4,and transaction exchange gains of $1.7. Included in 2009 are a loss of $12.2 associated with a partial settlement of an existing pension plan in an international jurisdiction, losses on cross currency swaps of $4.5, environmental accruals related toinactive locations totaling $2.1, and transaction exchange losses of $2.1. Also included in 2009 are a gain of $8.9 resulting from a sale of land for which the proceeds were received in 2004, favorable adjustments to certain asset retirementobligations of $1.3, and a gain of $6.2 related to a legal settlement associated with our Engineered Materials segment.    The 2010 loss on earlyextinguishment of debt of $0.8 relates to the loss incurred on the repurchase of portions of our 4.6% notes due July 1, 2013, with a total carrying value of $16.5, for a total purchase price of $17.3 including accrued interest. The 2009 loss onearly extinguishment of debt of $9.1 consists of the loss incurred on the repurchase of $234.6 principal amount of our 5.5% notes with an original maturity of October 1, 2010 for a purchase price of $242.8 plus accrued interest of $3.7, and$15.4 principal amount of our 4.6% notes with an original maturity of July 1, 2013 for a purchase price of $14.6. Both of the 2009 debt repurchases were completed under an offer to repurchase the notes that expired during the third quarter of2009. Also during 2009, we repurchased portions of our 4.6% notes due July 1, 2013 with a total carrying value of $16.5 for a total purchase price of $16.9 plus accrued interest of $0.3, resulting in a loss of $0.5.   Equity in earnings of associated companies was $1.0 in 2010 versus $0.9 in 2009.   Interest expense, net was $33.2 for 2010 compared with $24.2 for 2009. Interest expense increased as the result of $11.5 of higher interest associated with our 8.95% notes due 2017, and $5.6 of lowercapitalized interest as compared to 2009 due to a lower level of capital expenditures in 2010. These increases were partially offset by $7.2 of lower interest associated with our 2009 repurchase of 5.5% notes due 2010, and $1.8 of lower interestrelated to our repurchase of 4.6% notes due 2013.       -22-            The effective income tax rate for 2010 was a tax provision of 25.9% ($50.5) compared to atax benefit of 45.8% ($8.9) for 2009. The 2010 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by an $8.3 charge to tax expense related to the enactment of U.S. health care legislation (as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements). The rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $15.7 related to valuation allowance reversals, of which $11.8 was primarily attributable to the remeasurement of the future utilization of deferred tax assets in three European taxjurisdictions.    Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax was $30.3 in 2010 compared with $9.7 in 2009 and reflects the results of ourformer Building Block Chemicals segment. The improved earnings are attributable to higher margin spreads on acrylonitrile and melamine.    Netincome for 2010 was $172.3 ($3.46 per diluted share) compared with a net loss in 2009 of $2.5 ($0.05 per basic share). Included in 2010 was an after-tax charge of $5.6 related to various restructuring initiatives including consolidation and aclosure of manufacturing operations in Europe, and the exit of certain phosphorus derivative products at our Mt. Pleasant, TN facility. Our 2010 results also include an after-tax charge of $2.9 related to an increase in environmentalliabilities at two inactive locations for a change in estimate for operating and maintenance costs, a tax charge of $8.3 related to the impact of health care legislation, and a tax benefit of $15.7 related to a valuation allowance reversal ininternational jurisdictions. Included in 2009 was an after-tax charge of $63.7 related to restructuring costs, of which $19.8 and $3.4 related to accelerated depreciation and an asset impairment charge, respectively. Our 2009 results alsoinclude an after-tax charge of $9.1 related to a pension settlement in an international jurisdiction, an after-tax loss of $5.2 associated with the repurchase of debt under a tender offer during the third quarter of 2009, and an after-tax loss of$1.9 associated with the sale of our polyurethane product line assets in Asia and Europe. In addition, our 2009 results include a non-cash after-tax gain of $5.5 associated with the transfer of ownership of land to a third party, an after-taxbenefit of $3.8 related to a legal settlement related to our Engineered Materials segment, and a tax benefit of $4.0 related to a favorable tax adjustment for an audit settlement in an international jurisdiction.       Segment Results (Sales to external customers)   Year-to-year comparisons and analyses of changes in net sales by segment and geographic region are set forth below:   Engineered Materials                                                                               % Change Due to             2010         2009         Total % Change        Price        Volume/Mix        Currency        North America      $  485.0          $  449.3             8  %         1  %         7  %         0  %      Latin America (1)         7.2             4.3             -            -            -            -         Asia/Pacific         40.7             34.0             20  %         1  %         19  %         0  %      Europe/Middle East/Africa         241.2             229.9             5  %         1  %         5  %         (1  %)      Total      $  774.1          $  717.5             8  %         1  %         7  %         0  %          (1)  Due to the level of sales in this geographic region, percentage comparisons are not meaningful.       Overall sales increased 8% primarily due to increased selling volumes of 7%. In2010, selling volumes increased due to new large commercial aircraft programs and higher sales in our high performance industrial materials product lines as a result of the improved economy. These benefits were partially offset by decreases inmilitary sales due to the wind down of certain programs in advance of new programs. Rotorcraft sales were also lower due to the decline in overall civilian aircraft build rates. Higher selling prices increased sales by 1%.   Earnings from operations were $115.6, or 15%, of sales in 2010, compared with $96.3, or 13%, in 2009. The $19.3 increase in earnings includedincreased selling volumes of $34.3, $20.8 of benefits primarily associated with higher fixed cost absorption due to increased production levels and the initiative to lower inventories in 2009, increased selling prices of $7.2, and favorable impactof changes in exchange rates of $1.9. These positive impacts were partially offset by $39.4 due to the elimination of 2009 short term cost savings initiatives and higher manufacturing and operating expenses to meet the increasing demand levelsand new business opportunities, $3.4 due to higher raw materials costs, and $2.1 due to increased freight costs.       -23-        In-Process Separation                                                                              % Change Due to             2010         2009         Total % Change        Price        Volume/Mix        Currency        North America      $  76.8          $  69.0             11  %         (1  %)         12  %         0  %      Latin America         90.1             79.7             13  %         (1  %)         14  %         0  %      Asia/Pacific         66.1             69.5             (5  %)         (1  %)         (8  %)         4  %      Europe/Middle East/Africa         59.2             47.6             24  %         3  %         22  %         (1  %)      Total      $  292.2          $  265.8             10  %         0  %         9  %         1  %         Overall sales were up 10% primarily due to increasedselling volumes of 9% as a result of higher demand in both the mining and phosphine markets. The favorable changes in exchange rates increased sales by 1%. Lower selling prices due to lower raw material cost represented a change of less than 1%.   Earnings from operations were $55.2, or 19%, of sales in 2010, compared with $34.6, or 13%, in 2009. The $20.6 increase in earnings isprincipally due to increased sales volumes of $15.3, lower raw material costs of $10.1, and $6.1 of higher fixed cost absorption due to higher production volumes. These positive impacts were partially offset by the elimination of the short termsavings initiatives and higher manufacturing and operating expenses of $4.4 mostly due to increased staffing for new business opportunities, unfavorable changes in exchange rates of $3.1, increased freight costs of $2.9 due to higher volumes andrate increases, and lower selling prices of $0.7.        AdditiveTechnologies                                                                               % Change Due to             2010         2009         Total % Change        Price        Volume/Mix        Currency        North America      $  101.5          $  90.8             12  %         2  %         10  %         0  %      Latin America         19.7             19.7             0  %         (1  %)         1  %         0  %      Asia/Pacific         64.7             55.4             17  %         2  %         12  %         3  %      Europe/Middle East/Africa         73.5             73.2             0  %         2  %         2  %         (4  %)      Total      $  259.4          $  239.1             8  %         2  %         6  %         0  %         Overall sales increased 8% primarily due toincreased selling volumes of 6% reflecting higher demand in both the polymer additive and the specialty additive product lines due to continued improvement in global economic conditions. Excluding the impact of the divested polyurethanesproduct line in 2009, overall sales increased by 17%. Selling prices increased 2% with increases occurring in all regions except Latin America, where selling prices decreased by 1%.    Earnings from operations were $36.9, or 14%, of sales in 2010, compared with $11.0, or 5%, of sales in 2009. The $25.9 increase in earnings is principally due to the positive impacts of $14.7 relatedto higher selling volumes and favorable product mix, $6.7 of higher fixed cost absorption due to higher production volumes from increased demand, $4.2 due to higher selling prices, and $1.0 of lower raw material costs predominately in the specialtyadditive business. These positive impacts were partially offset by increased freight costs of $2.3 due to increased sales volumes and rate increases. The divestiture of the polyurethanes product line in 2009 increased earnings fromoperations in 2010 by $1.6.        Coating Resins                                                                              % Change Due to             2010         2009         Total % Change        Price        Volume/Mix        Currency        North America      $  303.9          $  260.0             17  %         3  %         14  %         0  %      Latin America         64.1             50.5             27  %         1  %         26  %         0  %      Asia/Pacific         346.1             274.3             26  %         4  %         19  %         3  %      Europe/Middle East/Africa         708.5             622.1             14  %         4  %         15  %         (5  %)      Total      $  1,422.6          $  1,206.9             18  %         4  %         16  %         (2  %)        -24-        Overall net sales were up 18% primarily due to increased selling volumes of 16% across all regions and allproduct lines due to the continued recovery from the global recession that had significantly impacted sales in 2009. Overall selling prices increased net sales by 4%, with increased pricing across all product lines in response to the higher rawmaterial costs. Unfavorable changes in exchange rates decreased net sales by 2%.    Earnings from operations were $68.2, or 5%, of sales in 2010,compared with losses from operations of $3.2, or -0.3%, of sales in 2009. The $71.4 increase in earnings is principally due to the positive impacts of $80.6 due to higher selling volumes, $28.8 of higher fixed cost absorption due to higherproduction volumes supporting the increased sales demand and the 2009 initiative to reduce inventory levels, and $47.0 due to higher selling prices. These positive impacts were partially offset by unfavorable impacts of $58.2 from higher rawmaterial costs, $14.5 from higher operating expenses and the elimination of the 2009 short term cost savings initiatives, $11.4 from higher freight costs related to higher selling volumes and rate increases, and $0.8 from unfavorable changes inexchange rates.    RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES       In accordance with our accounting policy,restructuring costs are included in our corporate unallocated operating results for segment reporting purposes consistent with managements view of its businesses.    Details of our 2011 restructuring initiatives are as follows:    In July 2011, we approvedplans to discontinue production at our leased powder polyester resins facility in Suzano, Brazil. These plans resulted in a restructuring charge of $9.4 in 2011, of which $1.7 related to the severance of 27 positions, $4.0 related to assetwrite-offs, and $3.7 related to decommissioning activities and lease termination costs, all of which related to our Coating Resins segment. The plant has ceased operations and decommissioning is expected to be completed in April 2012. We are alsopursuing a sale of the manufacturing assets located at the facility.    In April 2011, we approved plans to realign the supporting structure ofour Coating Resins segment to meet the current business needs. This plan was developed in response to continued commoditization of certain product lines as well as a lack of recovery in certain end markets, and was an outcome of our overall reviewregarding the cash versus the growth classification of product lines within the segment. These actions resulted in a restructuring charge of $10.3 related to severance for the elimination of 80 positions in the segments commercial, technicaland administrative functions, primarily in Europe.    We realized an estimated $3.9 of cost savings in 2011 related to these initiatives andexpect to realize an estimated $13.1 of pre-tax savings annually, beginning in 2012. The aforementioned initiatives are expected to be completed in 2012.    The remaining reserve of $4.1 at December 31, 2011 for the above initiatives is expected to be paid through the first half of 2012.    Details of our 2010 restructuring initiatives are as follows:    In the fourth quarter of2010, we initiated restructuring actions in our Coating Resins segment at our San Fernando, Spain facility after reaching an agreement for the transfer of the site to the local municipality in exchange for monetary consideration. These actionsresulted in pre-tax restructuring charges of $6.6 for the severance of 38 positions, offset by credits of $3.6 primarily related to the reversal of asset retirement obligations. We ceased operations at the facilities in the first half of 2011, andwill clean and prepare the site and land for transfer to the municipality in the first half of 2012. Proceeds from the sale of the land will be approximately   13.5 (approximately $17.5 using exchange rates as of December 31, 2011),of which $5.3 was received in 2011 and $2.7 was received in January 2012. The remainder is expected to be received in 2012. Any potential gain from the sale of the land will be deferred until our continuing involvement in environmental remediationis complete, estimated to be by the end of 2012.    In September 2010, we approved plans to consolidate manufacturing activities at one of ourEuropean sites in the Coating Resins segment. These plans resulted in a restructuring charge of $4.0, of which $1.5 relates to the severance of nine positions, and $2.5 relates to the write-down of certain manufacturing assets.   In May 2010, we approved plans to exit the production of certain phosphorus derivative products at our Mt. Pleasant, Tennessee facility. These plansresulted in a restructuring charge of $5.5, of which $0.4 relates to the severance of 10 positions, $1.7 relates to asset write-offs, and $3.4 relates to decommissioning activities, all of which related to our In-Process Separation segment.   We realized an estimated $1.5 and $6.1 of cost savings in 2010 and 2011 respectively, related to these initiatives. The aforementionedinitiatives were substantially completed in 2011.       -25-        The remaining reserve at December 31, 2011 of $2.9 relating to 2010 restructuring initiatives isexpected to be paid through 2012.    Details of our 2009 restructuring initiatives are as follows:   In 2009, we initiated restructuring actions across all segments and corporate functions. These actions were taken in response to the downturn in theglobal economy, which especially impacted the automotive, construction and general industrial markets that we serve, and led to a significant reduction in our sales and operating profitability. The following summarizes the details of therestructuring initiatives launched in 2009, which resulted in $91.9 of restructuring charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009.   In 2009, we launched restructuring initiatives at several of our Specialty Chemical manufacturing locations, which resulted in restructuring chargestotaling $70.4, of which $40.4 were associated with severance and other employee benefits and $30.0 were associated with asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. The manufacturing locations impacted by these initiatives included:                  Closure of our manufacturing facility in La Llagosta, Spain and the transfer of manufacturing of most of the liquid coating resins products produced atthe site to our facility in Werndorf, Austria.                   Transfer of the manufacturing of our powder coating resins product line from Drogenbos, Belgium to our manufacturing facility in Bassano, Italy andconsolidation or elimination of supply chain, sales, marketing and administrative functions at the site.                   Transfer of the manufacturing of certain liquid coating resins products from our Hamburg, Germany site to our facility in Werndorf, Austria andconsolidation or elimination of certain manufacturing, supply chain, and administrative functions at the site.                   Conversion of our manufacturing facility in Antofagasta, Chile into a blending and distribution facility to support the Mining business and eliminationof manufacturing functions at the site.                   Closure of our manufacturing facility in Bogota, Colombia.    The above manufacturing restructuring initiatives included the elimination of 365 positions. During 2010 we recorded a net favorable adjustment of $0.9; we realized an estimated $9.3 of cost savings in2009 and $33.0 of cost savings in 2010 related to these initiatives.    We launched restructuring initiatives across our Engineered Materialssegment in response to inventory destocking by parts manufacturers that supply large commercial aircraft manufacturers as well as a sharper than expected decline in business and regional jet production rates. These initiatives resulted in $4.4 ofrestructuring charges for severance and employee benefits related to the elimination of 239 positions. During 2010, we recorded a net favorable adjustment of $0.5; we realized an estimated $6.0 of cost savings in 2009 and $20.0 of annualized pre-taxsavings in 2010 related to these initiatives.    We launched several initiatives throughout 2009 in our Specialty Chemicals segments andcorporate functions across sales, marketing, manufacturing, supply chain, research and development, and administrative functions, including our initiative to establish a shared services center. These initiatives resulted in $17.1 of charges relatedto severance and employee benefits associated with the elimination of 388 positions. During 2010 and 2011 we recorded a net favorable adjustment of $2.4 and $0.5, respectively; we realized $16.4 of estimated cost savings in 2009 related to theseinitiatives and an estimated $30.2 of annualized pre-tax savings in 2010. Incremental annualized savings of $6.8 were realized in 2011 and $3.0 are projected to be realized in 2012.    During 2011, we recorded net favorable adjustments of $0.5 related to our 2009 restructuring initiatives. The majority of the aforementioned initiatives are substantially complete as of December 31,2011, with some components expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2012.    The remaining reserve at December 31, 2011 of $1.3relating to 2009 restructuring initiatives is expected to be paid through 2013.    See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for afurther summary of the restructuring charges.    LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION       At December 31, 2011, our cash balance was$415.8, compared with $383.3 at year end 2010. As of December 31, 2011, $117.5 of our cash was in the U.S. and $298.3 was held by our subsidiaries outside the U.S.    Net cash provided by continuing operations    Net cash provided by operating activities ofcontinuing operations for 2011 was $235.0 compared with $239.7 for 2010. For 2011, trade accounts receivable increased $38.8 primarily       -26-        reflecting increased sales in 2011 compared to 2010, partly offset by a slight reduction in days outstanding from 49 days at December 31, 2010 to 48 days at December 31, 2011. Inventoryincreased $30.2 reflecting increased demand year over year, as the inventory days outstanding increased from 66 days at December 31, 2010 to 68 days at December 31, 2011. Accounts payable increased $22.9 primarily due to increasedpurchases in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the prior year quarter. Days outstanding increased from 48 days at December 31, 2010 to 50 days at December 31, 2011. Other accounts receivable decreased approximately $11.8 mostly due to areduction in VAT receivables outstanding globally, due to a concerted effort to improve collection in 2011. Accrued expenses decreased by $12.2, primarily as the result of lower incentive compensation accruals and restructuring charges as ofDecember 31, 2011, as compared to 2010. Other liabilities decreased $54.1 during 2011, primarily due to contributions we made in 2011 to our pension and postretirement plans of $63.9 and $10.1, respectively, and a payment of $5.4 to aninsurance company to fund a long-term employee benefit liability in an international jurisdiction.    Net cash used in investing activities ofcontinuing operations was $107.6 in 2011 compared to $110.2 in 2010. In 2011, we received proceeds from the sale of certain real estate and facilities of former sites for cash proceeds totaling $8.9. In 2010, we sold certain real estate for which wereceived cash proceeds of $5.4. Capital spending for 2011 was $116.5, of which approximately two-thirds is related to the Specialty Chemicals segments for maintenance of business capital, cost reduction and work on certain expansion projects. Theremaining amount is related to the Engineered Materials segment, which includes spending related to equipment purchases and work on our new carbon fiber line in Greenville, South Carolina, and expansion work at our composite facility in Greenville,Texas. In the first quarter of 2009, we decided to delay the completion of the carbon fiber expansion project due to recession-driven demand reductions. Since then, carbon fiber demands have significantly increased, and we are currently assessingour timing and the cost for this projects restart, which is expected in 2012. Our capital spending for 2012 is expected to be in the range of $200.0 to $250.0.    Net cash used in financing activities was $211.5 in 2011 compared with $33.6 in 2010. In 2011, we repurchased $196.1 of treasury stock, we paid cash dividends of $27.1, and we had net debt repayments of$8.7. The cash outflows were partly offset by $11.0 of proceeds received in September from the sale-leaseback transaction of our research and development facilities in Stamford, Connecticut, which is being treated as a financing activity until ourenvironmental remediation is complete and the sale can be recognized, $8.1 of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and $1.5 of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments.    Share repurchases    In 2011, we repurchased 4,280,000 shares of our common stock at a totalcost of $196.1. On December 8, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a new stock buyback authorization in the amount of $200.0. Approximately $197.9 remained authorized under our stock buyback programs as of December 31, 2011. Weanticipate repurchases will be made from time-to-time on the open market or in private transactions and will be utilized for share-based compensation plans and other corporate purposes.    Dividends    During 2011, we paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.125 per common share,which aggregated to $24.3. On January 31, 2012, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share, payable on February 24, 2012 to stockholders of record as of February 10, 2012. Also during 2011,our majority owned subsidiary paid cash dividends to their minority shareholders which aggregated to $2.8.    Net cash (used in) provided bydiscontinued operations    Net cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations for 2011 was $23.2, compared to net cash providedby operating activities of discontinued operations of $39.1 for 2010. In 2011, cash uses consisted primarily of tax payments related to the gain on the sale of our former Building Block Chemicals segment that occurred in early 2011, while 2010 cashflows primarily represented the net earnings from the former segment.    Net cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations was$149.9 in 2011, compared with net cash used of $15.3 in 2010. In 2011, we received net cash proceeds of $152.2, net of transaction costs, related to the sale of our former Building Block Chemicals segment, which were partially offset by capitalspending of $2.4 for the business prior to the sale. The 2010 activities related to capital spending at our Building Block Chemicals facilities.   Credit facility    There were no borrowingsoutstanding under the $400.0 unsecured five-year revolving credit facility at December 31, 2011 and 2010. On June 21, 2011, we amended and restated our existing Five       -27-        Year Credit Agreement (the Agreement). The material terms and conditions of the Agreement remain substantially similar to the prior agreement except as set forth below. As the resultof the amendment and restatement, the maximum amount we may borrow under the Agreement continues to be $400.0, but now includes a $25.0 swing line, and the term of the Agreement was extended to June 21, 2016. Subject to the consent of thelenders, we have the ability under certain circumstances to extend the term of the Agreement through June 21, 2019 and to increase the maximum amount we may borrow under the Agreement to up to $500.0. This facility contains covenants that arecustomary for such facilities, including two financial covenants: the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and the ratio of consolidated EBITDA toconsolidated interest expense. We are in compliance with these covenants and expect to be in compliance for the foreseeable future.    Debtoffering    On July 6, 2009 we closed on an offering of $250.0 aggregate principal amount of 8.95% senior unsecured notes dueJuly 1, 2017, which resulted in $247.7 in net proceeds after original issue discount and underwriting fees. In addition, on June 30, 2009, we commenced offers to purchase our 5.5% notes due October 1, 2010 and our 4.6% notes dueJuly 1, 2013. In July 2009, we applied the net proceeds from the issuance of the 8.95% notes and corporate cash to repurchase $234.6 principal amount of our 5.5% notes due October 1, 2010 for a purchase price of $242.8 plus accruedinterest of $3.7 and $15.4 principal amount of our 4.6% notes due July 1, 2013 for a purchase price of $14.6. We raised the additional debt and launched the tender offer to improve our debt maturity profile and further mitigate any liquidityconcerns associated with debt maturities. The repurchase of the notes through the tender offer resulted in a net loss of $8.6, including transaction costs, recognized in the third quarter of 2009.   Funding of future cash requirements    Webelieve that we have the ability to fund our operating cash requirements and planned capital expenditures as well as the ability to meet our debt service requirements for the foreseeable future from existing cash and from internal cash generation.However, from time to time, based on such factors as local tax regulations, prevailing interest rates and our plans for capital investment or other investments, it may make economic sense to utilize our existing credit lines in order to meet thosecash requirements, which may include debt-service related disbursements. We are required to meet financial ratios under our $400.0 five-year revolving credit agreement, including a maximum permitted ratio of Total Consolidated Debt (as defined) toConsolidated EBITDA (as defined) and a minimum consolidated EBITDA (as defined) to interest expense ratio. Complying with these ratios could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and couldotherwise restrict our financing activities. Our ability to comply with the covenants will depend on our future operating performance. If we fail to comply with those covenants and terms, we will be in default. In this case, we would be required toobtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance. If we were unable to obtain any necessary waivers, the amounts outstanding under this agreement could be accelerated, and become immediately due and payable, and we would not be ableto borrow any additional funds under the agreement while such default continued. We are in compliance with these covenants and expect to be in compliance for the foreseeable future. We have no borrowings outstanding under the agreement as ofDecember 31, 2011. Our ability to fully utilize our revolving credit agreement can be limited by our actual calculated Debt Covenant Ratio as compared to the maximum Debt Covenant Ratio permitted under the agreement. At December 31, 2011the full amount of the facility is available to us, and we expect that the full amount will continue to be available based on our current forecasts.    Use of cash    We have generated a significant amount of cash in recent years. Going into2012, our use of cash priority will be to invest in the typical maintenance of business capital spending projects and pension contributions. This is followed by expansion/cost reduction capital in our growth product lines and fast payback/marginimprovement capital in our cash product lines. In addition, if available at a reasonable price, we will pursue bolt-on acquisitions for our growth product lines. We will continue to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and sharerepurchases when it is prudent to do so. We have approximately $197.9 of buyback authorized as of December 31, 2011. We also will continue to pursue debt reductions when available at a reasonable price.   We have not guaranteed any indebtedness of our unconsolidated associated company.    Inflation at this time is not considered significant although higher costs for energy and commodities could impact our future operating expenses and capital spending. The impact of increasing raw      -28-        material costs is discussed earlier in Item 1., BUSINESS  Customers and Suppliers.       We estimate that pension and postretirement plan funding willbe approximately $51.9 in 2012 as compared to $74.0 in 2011.       Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments    The following table sets forth our contractual obligations under long-term agreements as of December 31, 2011:                               (In Millions)      Payments Due by Period      Contractual Obligations      Total           Less Than  1 Year         1-3 Years         3-5 Years           More than  5 Years        Long-term debt      $  636.4          $  0.0          $  135.2          $  250.0          $  251.2         Interest payments  (1)         196.0             40.9             75.6             57.1             22.4         Operating leases         63.9             13.1             18.9             14.8             17.1         Pension and postretirement plans obligations  (2)         51.9             51.9             0.0             0.0             0.0         Purchase obligations         20.2             13.0             5.0             0.6             1.6         Environmental liabilities  (2)         10.0             10.0             0.0             0.0             0.0         Other noncurrent liabilities  (3)                                        Cross currency swap  (4)         19.5             0.0             0.0             19.5             0.0         Total      $  997.9          $  128.9          $  234.7          $  342.0          $  292.3             (1)  Based on the Euro exchange rate at December 31, 2011.         (2)  Expected cash flows for our pension and postretirement plans obligations and environmental liabilities for years beyond 2012 were excluded as specific payment datescould not be reasonably estimated. Amounts reflected to be paid in less than one year are based on our budget and actual amounts paid in 2011 and may vary significantly for pension. See Note 11 (Environmental, Contingencies andCommitments) and Note 13 (Employee Benefit Plans) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these liabilities.        (3)  Included in other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011, were $53.7 of contingent liabilities (principally asbestos relatedliabilities) and $36.9 of asset retirement obligations. As specific payment dates for these items are unknown, the related balances have not been reflected in the Payments Due by Period section of the table above.        (4)  Related balances are based on principal components using the Euro exchange rate at December 31, 2011.       As of December 31, 2011, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $35.5. Asspecific payment dates cannot be reasonably estimated, the related balances have not been reflected under the Payments Due by Period section of the table above.    At December 31, 2011, we had net contractual commitments under currency forward contracts in U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts of $203.2, that all settle in less than one year. (Refer toItem 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, as well as Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).    We had $34.7 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees at December 31, 2011 that are issued on our behalf in the ordinary course of business to support certain of ourperformance obligations and commitments. The instruments are typically renewed on an annual basis.    We do not have any unconsolidated limitedpurpose entities or any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities.       -29-            Item 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in currency rates, commodity prices andinterest rates. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward-looking analysis. Currencies are in millions.   Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on thelikelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings.    In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to variousmarket risks, including fluctuations in currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates. To manage the exposure related to these risks, we may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with our established policies. We do not holdor issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Moreover, we enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly-rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversifytransactions among counterparties, thereby limiting exposure to credit-related and performance-related risks.    Currency Risk : Weperiodically enter into currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity. At December 31, 2011, the principal transactionshedged involved accounts receivable and accounts payable. When hedging currency exposures, our practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure,and therefore, the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value, cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction.       At December 31, 2011, the currency and net notional amounts of forward contracts outstanding translated into U.S. dollar equivalent amounts were asfollows:                                                 December 31, 2011      Buy      Sell      U.S. Dollar         Euro         Chilean Peso           Canadian  Dollar           Australian  Dollar         Thai Baht         Mexican Peso         Pound Sterling         Norwegian Krone        U.S. Dollar         0.0          $  48.3          $  21.8          $  21.7          $  18.0          $  15.0          $  11.5          $  5.5          $  0.9         Brazilian Real      $  8.4             0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0         Norwegian Krone         0.0          $  51.5             0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0         Pound Sterling         0.0          $  0.4             0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0         Others         0.0          $  0.2             0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0            The net unfavorable fair value of currency contracts,based on exchange rates at December 31, 2011, was $2.4. Assuming that year-end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical 10%, thefair value of all outstanding contracts at year-end would decrease by approximately $12.3. However, since these contracts hedge specific transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying valueof the transaction being hedged.    We use cross currency swaps (ten year swaps) to hedge the value of one of our U.S.subsidiaries net investment in our Belgium-based subsidiary, Cytec Surface Specialties SA/NV, against the risk of adverse foreign exchange movements in the USD value of the Euro, which is designated as a net investment hedge. The totalnotional amount of the ten year swaps is   207.9. We pay 4.52% per annum on the Euro notional amount and receive 5.80% per annum on the USD notional amount on each April 1 and October 1, through the maturity date ofthe swap, which is on October 1, 2015. Since the critical terms of the ten year swaps match the critical terms of the net investment in Cytec Surface Specialties SA/NV, the ten year swaps are highly effective in offsetting the changes in thevalue of the net investment attributable to the change in USD value of the Euro.    At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the unfavorable fairvalue of the ten year swaps was $13.2 and $16.5, respectively. Assuming other factors are held constant, a hypothetical increase/decrease of 10% in the Euro exchange rate would cause an increase/decrease of approximately $32.1 in the total value ofthe hedging instrument referred to above.       -30-        In the fourth quarter of 2011, we entered into a contract for the construction of certain manufacturingequipment, the payments of which are denominated in Swiss francs (CHF) and will total approximately 7.3 CHF, exposing us to exchange rate fluctuations between CHF and USD. To hedge this risk, we entered into forward contracts to buy CHF and sell USDat agreed upon rates, and designated these currency forwards as a cash flow hedge of the foreign currency risks associated with our capitalization of the CHF-denominated invoices. At hedge inception, we expected that the hedging relationship wouldbe highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged because the key features and terms (i.e., the currency, notional amount, and timing) for the forward and the respective hedged transactionsclosely match at inception.    As of December 31, 2011, the notional amount of the forward contracts designated as a cash flow hedge isapproximately $4.2, and the unrealized loss as of December 31, 2011 is approximately $0.1. Assuming other factors are held constant, a hypothetical increase/decrease of 10% in the CHF exchange rate would cause an increase/decrease ofapproximately $0.4 in the total value of this hedging instrument.    Interest Rate Risk : At December 31, 2011, our outstandingborrowings consisted of $3.5 of short-term variable rate borrowings and long-term fixed rate debt, which had a carrying value of $635.9, a face value of $636.4 and a fair value, of $715.4. The fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysiswhich incorporates the contractual terms of the notes and observable market-based inputs that include time value, interest rate curves, and credit spreads.   Assuming other factors are held constant, a hypothetical increase/decrease of 1% in the weighted-average prevailing interest rate on our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011,interest expense would increase/decrease by approximately $0.1 for the next fiscal year and the fair value of the fixed rate long-term debt would decrease/increase by approximately $24.0.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates andassumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and changes in theestimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition.    Share-Based Compensation   U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires recognition of compensation cost in an amount equal to the fair value ofshare-based payments. Compensation cost for performance stock is recorded based on the market value on the original date of grant (which is the fair value). Compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in cash (cash-settledSARS) is recognized based on the fair value of the award at the end of each period through the date of settlement. Compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in shares (stock-settled SARS) and stock options isrecognized over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value on the date of the grant.    GAAP also requires that we estimate aforfeiture rate for all share-based awards. We monitor share option exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates within the valuation model. The estimated fair values are based on assumptions, including estimated lives ofthe instruments, historical and implied volatility, dividend yield on our common stock, and risk-free interest rates. We also consider the probability that the options and stock-settled SARS will be exercised prior to the end of their contractuallives and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder. These assumptions are based on reasonable facts but are subject to change based on a variety of external factors. Changes in assumptions from period to period may materiallyaffect the amount of share-based compensation cost we recognize in income.    Environmental and Other Contingent Liabilities    Accruals for environmental remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation and other contingent liabilities arerecorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are recorded at managements best estimate of the ultimate expected liabilities, without any discount toreflect the time value of money. These accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes available.    The amount accrued for environmental remediation reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature and cost of the remedy, the outcome of discussions withregulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the       -31-        number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties.    Included inother contingent liabilities are workers compensation, product liability and toxic tort claims. The amount accrued for other contingent liabilities reflects our assumptions about the incidence, severity, indemnity costs and dismissal rates forexisting and future claims.    Our asbestos related contingent liabilities and related insurance receivables are based on a study, which isprepared every three years by a third party. Our last study was prepared during the third quarter of 2009 and we expect the next study will be prepared during the third quarter of 2012. The study estimates our gross asbestos liabilities using afrequency/severity approach. With this approach, the cost of future claim filings due to asbestos-related diseases are estimated as the product of the future number of claims filed and the average value of those claims on a nominal as opposed todiscounted basis. Future claim frequency is estimated using our claims history and the Stallard/Manton Epidemiological Decay Model (the Decay Model), a widely used industry study. The Decay Model assumes that future levels of claimsactivity will gradually decrease from current levels by applying model-specific decay factors that project this claim activity to wind down over the next 35 to 40 years. Our current levels are estimated based on our risk profile and ourhistorical claim experience. The estimated cost per claim is based on our historical paid claims adjusted for inflation. Although these estimates and assumptions are based on reasonable facts, they are subject to change based on the actualoutcome and a variety of external factors. A sustained 1% change in the annual number of future asbestos claims filed against us will increase or decrease the liability and related receivable by $0.4 and $0.2, respectively. A sustained 1% change inthe average value of asbestos claims paid will increase or decrease the liability and related receivable by $0.4 and $0.2, respectively.   Accruals for environmental remediation and other contingent liabilities can change substantially if our assumptions are not realized or due to actions bygovernmental agencies or private parties. We cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts. Moreover, environmental and other contingent liabilities are paid over an extended period, and the timingof such payments cannot be predicted with any certainty. Accruals for environmental and other contingent liabilities are recorded as other noncurrent liabilities with any amounts expected to be paid out in the next twelve months classified asaccrued expenses.    Probable insurance recoveries for past and probable future indemnity costs are recorded at managements best estimateof the ultimate expected receipts without discounting to reflect the time value of money and are recorded as other assets. A number of factors impact the estimates of insurance reimbursements. These factors include the financial viability of theinsurance companies, the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies, how legal and defense costs will be covered by the insurance policies, the interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms andlimits and their interrelationships, and historical recovery rates over the past ten years.    Defense and processing costs are expensed asincurred. Insurance recoveries for defense and processing costs are recognized when the recovery is probable and related costs are incurred and are recorded as other assets.    Retirement Plans    We sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefitplans. The postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements. Our most significant pension plans are in the U.S., and constituted over 81% of our consolidated pension assetsand 77% of projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2011. The calculation of our pension expense and pension liability associated with our defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in theseassumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions. We believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, andhealthcare cost trend rates. Our U.S. salaried pension plan was frozen on December 31, 2007.    At the end of each year, we determine thediscount rate to be used for pension liabilities. In estimating this rate, we look at the yields on high quality, long-term corporate bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. Future expected actuariallydetermined cash flows of our major U.S. plans are matched against a yield curve encompassing such bonds to arrive at a single discount rate by plan. We discounted our U.S. future pension and postretirement medical liabilities using a rate of 4.7%and 4.3%, respectively, at December 31, 2011. The discount rate used to determine the       -32-        value of liabilities has a significant effect on expense. A 1% increase to the discount rate for our U.S. pension plans would decrease our 2012 expected annual expense by $6.2 and decrease ourliability by $84.4. A 1% decrease to the discount rate for our U.S. pension plans would increase our 2012 expected annual expense by $5.8 and increase our liability by $95.0. A 1% increase to the discount rate for our U.S. postretirement medicalplan would decrease our 2012 expected annual expense by $0.6 and decrease our liability by $16.6. A 1% decrease to the discount rate for our U.S. postretirement medical plan would increase our 2012 expected annual expense by $0.5 and increase ourliability by $18.0.    In order to reduce the volatility of our pension plan assets relative to pension liabilities, over the past eighteenmonths we have gradually implemented a liability-driven investment (LDI) strategy for our U.S., U.K. and Canadian defined benefit pension plans. As part of the strategy, we have transitioned some of our equity allocation tolonger-term fixed income assets with an emphasis on high quality corporate bonds. As the funded status of the plans improves, we expect to further decrease equity investments and increase fixed income investments. As a result of thesechanges, the expected rates of return have been adjusted downward, as appropriate, to reflect the new allocations. The expected rate of return on our U.S. plan assets, which was 7.25% for 2011, reflects the long-term average rate of return expectedon funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability. We establish the expected rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to us at thattime, including the historical returns of major asset classes, the expected investment mix of the plans assets, and estimates of future long-term investment returns. A 1% change to the expected rate of return on plan assets of our U.S. pensionplans would increase or decrease our 2012 expected pension expense by $6.4; the 2012 expected postretirement medical expense would increase or decrease by $0.3. The U.S. pension plans investment mix at December 31, 2011 approximated 27%equities and 73% fixed income securities. Any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss. The unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss is amortized into pension expense inaccordance with GAAP.    The assumed rate of future increases in the per capita cost of healthcare benefits (healthcare cost trend rate) is 8.0%in 2011, decreasing to ultimate trend of 5.0% in 2017. The healthcare cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and related expense. A 1% decrease to theassumed healthcare cost trend rate for our postretirement benefit plans would decrease our expense by $0.8 and decrease our postretirement benefit obligation by $13.5. A 1% increase to the assumed healthcare cost trend rate for our postretirementbenefit plans would increase our expense by $0.8 and increase our postretirement benefit obligation by $14.7.    Impairment of Goodwill andIntangible Assets    We have defined our segments as our reporting units. Our four business segments are Engineered Materials, In-ProcessSeparation, Additive Technologies, and Coating Resins. Engineered Materials serves principally aerospace markets. In-Process Separation and Additive Technologies serve large, global industrial markets. Coating Resins serves the large, globalcoatings market. The segments above reflect how we run our Company, manage the assets, and view our customers.    We test goodwill for impairmenton an annual basis. Goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. We use a two-stepprocess to test goodwill for impairment. We initially use a market multiple approach (1A) to estimate a range of fair values by reporting unit, and then use a discounted cash flow approach (1B) if the market multiple approach indicatesthat a potential impairment might exist to refine and reaffirm the results of the first test. The market multiple approach provides a straightforward, cost effective and relatively simple method to readily determine if an impairment might exist byutilizing EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) information by reporting unit multiplied by average current industry valuation factors or multiples to easily determine an estimated range of fair value. Due to thecyclical nature of our reporting units, we utilize a three year EBITDA average of historical and forecasted EBITDA for the reportable segment times the range of EBITDA multiple factors. The three year period is comprised of the prior year, currentyear and one year projected amounts. The market multiple range utilizes an average lower and upper multiple limit based on recent industry acquisition average EBITDA multiples paid by financial and strategic purchasers. We obtain this informationfrom a third party investment bank. If the reporting units estimated fair value using the low end of the range is close to, in our judgment, or       -33-        below the reporting units carrying value, we refine the calculation using cash flows to calculate a point estimate of the reporting units fair value, as opposed to a range. If thediscounted cash flow approach yields a fair value estimate less than the reporting units carrying value, we would proceed to step two of the impairment test. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill isdetermined by allocating the reporting units fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from theapplication of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.   In the fourth quarter of 2011, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test. For the market multiple approach, we used an EBITDA range of between 5.9Xand 9.0X. All of our reporting units passed step 1A with the exception of the Coating Resins reporting unit. The Coating Resins EBITDA of $142.5 was a three year average of the 2010 actual, 2011 actual or forecast, and the 2012 budgeted EBITDAamounts. The market multiple approach (Step 1A) for the Coating Resins reporting unit resulted in a fair value range of $840.5 to $1,282.2. Since the carrying value was in excess of the lower end of the range of the estimated fair values using themultiples, we refined the estimate of the fair value using a discounted cash flow approach in accordance with our aforementioned policy which resulted in a fair value of $1,236.2. The discounted cash flow approach fair value exceeded the carryingvalue by $189.7, or 18%, indicating that there was no impairment of Coating Resins goodwill. The discounted cash flow approach considered a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rate of 9.6% as the discount rate and an estimatednet cash flow for a ten-year period from 2012 to 2021. The WACC calculation considered a risk-free rate of return, cost of debt and expected equity premium. The risk-free rate of return equaled the yield on long-term United States Treasury bonds.The cost of debt represented the yield of a BBB rated bond. The cost of equity included an estimate of the return on typical long-term investments required to induce investment in a diversified portfolio of U.S. publicly traded stocks adjusted forspecific risk and size premiums of the reporting unit. The risk premium reflects the specific risks associated with the current business and future performance estimates. The cost of equity and debt were weighted based on the observed capitalstructures of companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. The discounted cash flow model also reflects a terminal value that assumes 2021 net cash flows will continue to grow at a rate of 2.75% in perpetuity, which we believe isreasonable for this business. These evaluations involve amounts that are based on managements best estimates and judgments.    Thediscounted cash flows were based on a ten year projection, covering 2012 through 2021. The 2012 to 2015 projections take into account current macroeconomic conditions and reflect managements best estimate of the amount of time required beforethe business recovers from the current recessionary environment. The 2016 to 2021 amounts were based on forecasted average revenue growth factor of approximately 2.3%. The projections included average annual capital expenditures of $40.0 and networking capital increases corresponding to the revenue growth assumed. We assumed an average tax rate of 31% for the discounted cash flow approach which we believe is a realistic approximation of our future annual effective tax rate for thisbusiness.    The following table summarizes the approximate impact that a change in certain critical assumptions would have on the goodwillimpairment. The approximate impact of the change in each critical assumption assumes all other assumptions and factors remain constant.                   Critical Factors      Change         Approximate  Increase/(Decrease) on Fair Value        Weighted Average Cost of Capital         +0.50  %      $  (72.5  )      Weighted Average Cost of Capital         -0.50  %         83.3         Terminal Value Growth Rate         +0.25  %         21.1         Terminal Value Growth Rate         -0.25  %         (19.6  )      Annual Capital Expenditures         +$10.0            (46.9  )      Annual Capital Expenditures         -$10.0            46.9         Annual Sales Volume Growth Rate         +0.25  %         101.0         Annual Sales Volume Growth Rate         -0.25  %         (99.2  )      Operating Profit Margin         +1  %         150.6         Operating Profit Margin         -1  %         (150.6  )     Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. We are not aware ofreasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being estimated that would have a material impact on these assessments for impairment.       -34-        Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes incircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets or asset group to the futureundiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fairvalue of the assets and would be charged to earnings. Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives.    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed    Long-lived assets,including those to be disposed, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured bya comparison of the carrying amount of the assets or asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized ismeasured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be charged to earnings. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell.   Depreciation    Depreciation isprovided on either the straight-line or the straight-line composite method. Certain assets in the United States and all assets outside the United States and Canada are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of theassets. When these assets are retired or disposed of, the net book value of assets are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the net gain or loss is included in the determination of earnings from operations. Depreciation for the remainderof our assets in the United States and Canada is recorded primarily on a straight-line composite method over the estimated useful lives of various classes of assets, with rates periodically reviewed and adjusted if necessary. When such depreciableassets are sold or otherwise retired from service, unless a major change in the composition of an asset class has occurred, their costs plus demolition costs less amounts realized on sale or salvage are charged or credited to the accumulateddepreciation account. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to current operating expenses. Acquisitions, additions and betterments, either to provide necessary capacity, improve the efficiency of production units, modernize or replaceolder facilities or to install equipment for protection of the environment, are capitalized. We capitalize interest costs incurred during the period of construction of plants and equipment.    We are in the process of completing our review of our accounting policies related to the composite method of depreciation including our estimates of useful lives to determine if another depreciationmethod allowed under GAAP may be preferable. If we determine that another depreciation method is preferred under GAAP, we will change our accounting policies to the more preferred method. We anticipate that our review will be finalized duringthe first quarter of 2012 and that we would account for any such change on a prospective basis as a change in estimate in accordance with GAAP. Based on our analysis to date, we do not believe such changes, if any, would be material to our futurefinancial statements.    Income Taxes    Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between thefinancial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or allof the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered orsettled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.   We intend to reinvest the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes with respect to these earnings. In theevent of repatriation to the U.S., such earnings would be subject to U.S. income taxes in most cases. Foreign tax credits would be available to substantially reduce the amount of U.S. tax otherwise payable in future years.   Our annual effective tax rate is based on expected income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in various jurisdictions in whichwe operate. Significant judgment is required       -35-        in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions.    Weestablish accruals for tax contingencies when, notwithstanding the reasonable belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, we believe that certain filing positions are likely to be challenged and moreover, that such filing positions maynot be fully sustained. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.We continually evaluate our uncertain tax positions and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances including but not limited to emerging case law, tax legislation, rulings by relevant tax authorities, and the progress ofongoing tax audits. Settlement of a given tax contingency could impact the income tax provision in the period of resolution. Our accruals for gross uncertain tax positions are presented in the balance sheet within income taxes payable andother noncurrent liabilities.    Derivative Financial Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities   We use derivative instruments in accordance with our established policies to manage exposure to fluctuations in currency rates, interest rates and, whenappropriate, natural gas prices in North America. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly-ratedcounterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties, thereby limiting exposure to credit-related and performance-related risks.    Foreign Currency Risk:  We use currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps to manage our exposure to fluctuations in currency rates on third party and intercompany transactions denominatedin currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity. We hedge such exposures with currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps denominated in the same currency and with similar terms as the underlying exposure, and therefore,the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item or transaction. All derivative contracts used to manage foreign currency risk are measured at fair value and reported as assets orliabilities on the balance sheet. Changes in fair value are reported in earnings or deferred, depending on the nature and effectiveness of the hedging relationship. Ineffectiveness, if any, in a hedging relationship is recognized immediately intoearnings. If the hedging relationship is not highly effective in generating offsetting cash flows or changes in fair value, we would recognize the change in the fair value of the currency forward contract in other income (expense), net. There was noineffectiveness in 2011, 2010, or 2009.    We used cross currency swaps to hedge certain future cash flows from Euro receipts on certain Eurodenominated intercompany loans receivable we had with certain subsidiaries against changes in the U.S. dollar to Euro exchange rates. The swaps fixed the U.S. dollar equivalent cash flows of these Euro denominated intercompany loans and eliminatedforeign exchange variability since the notional amounts of the swaps equaled that of the loans, and all cash flow dates and interest rates coincided between the swaps and the loans, therefore no ineffectiveness was expected. These swaps had beendesignated as cash flow hedges. In November 2008, the   207.9 five year cross currency swaps were de-designated as cash flow hedges, due to our decision to execute new off-setting cross currency swaps (two year cross currencyswaps) to lock-in the Euro forward exchange rate for the principal exchange on the five year cross currency swaps that were due on October 1, 2010. The two year swaps were not designated as cash flow hedges, therefore all changes infair value were reported in interest expense, net, and other (expense)/income, net. The two and five year swaps were settled on October 1, 2010.    In September 2010, we de-designated our ten year swaps as hedging instruments due to the early settlement of a portion of these swaps by one of our counterparties effective October 1, 2010. As aresult of this termination, we executed a new cross currency swap effective October 1, 2010 to maintain the total notional amount of the ten year swaps at   207.9. We concurrently designated all the ten year swaps as a net investmenthedge of the value of one of our U.S. subsidiaries net investment in our Belgium-based subsidiary, Cytec Surface Specialties SA/NV, against the risk of adverse foreign exchange movements in the USD value of the Euro. Since the critical termsof the ten year swaps match the critical terms of the net investment in Cytec Surface Specialties SA/NV, the ten year swaps are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the value of the net investment attributable to the changes in USD value ofthe Euro.    All cross currency swaps are recorded at fair value as either assets or liabilities. Each period we record the change in the fairvalue of the ten year swaps in accumulated other comprehensive income. For the ten year swaps, prior to de-designation as cash flow       -36-        hedges in September 2010, we reclassified an amount out of accumulated other comprehensive income to the income statement to offset the foreign currency gain or loss on the remeasurement to USDof the Euro intercompany loans. The amount of such reclassification depended on changes in the USD/Euro exchange rate that occurred during the period. We also accounted for the five year swaps in this manner until de-designation as cashflow hedges in November 2008.    For cross currency swaps designated as a hedge of our net investment in Cytec Surface Specialties SA/NV, thefair value is calculated each period with changes in fair value reported in foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Such amounts reclassified to a translation adjustment will remainin other comprehensive income/(loss) until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of our investment in Cytec Surface Specialties SA/NV. The fair values of the two year swaps and, since its de-designation, the five year swaps, werecalculated each period with changes in fair value reported in interest expense, net, and other (expense)/income, net. We monitor the counterparty credit risk and, while designated as cash flow hedges, the continued probability of the hedged cashflows as to amount and timing.    Cash flow hedges:  In the fourth quarter of 2011, we entered into a contract for the construction ofcertain manufacturing equipment, the payments for which are denominated in Swiss francs (CHF), and will total approximately 7.3 CHF. These CHF payments expose us to exchange rate fluctuations between CHF and USD. To hedge this risk, we entered intoforward contracts to buy CHF and sell USD at agreed upon rates. To protect our consolidated earnings against the risk of foreign currency-related fluctuation associated with the forecasted CHF payments for the equipment, we designated the currencyforward to buy CHF and sell USD on the forwards maturity date (the hedging instrument) as a cash flow hedge of the foreign currency risks associated with our capitalization of the first, previously unhedged, forecastedCHF-denominated invoices. At hedge inception, we expected that the hedging relationship would be highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged because the key features and terms (i.e., thecurrency, notional amount, and timing) for the forward and the respective hedged transactions closely match at inception.    If the hedgingrelationship qualifies as highly effective, the hedging instrument will be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and accumulated other comprehensive income will be adjusted to a balance that reflects the lesser of either the cumulative changein the fair value of the hedging instrument or the cumulative change in the fair value of the hypothetical derivative. The amount of ineffectiveness, if any, recorded in earnings will be equal to the excess of the cumulative change in the fair valueof the hedging instrument over the cumulative change in the fair value of the hypothetical derivative. Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecastedtransactions affect earnings.    Each hedging relationship will terminate once the payable related to the hedged transactions as defined above isrecognized and the hedging instrument (or portion thereof equal to each hedged transaction) will be marked-to-market through current period earnings in future periods after termination of the hedging relationship (providing offset against theremeasurement through earnings of the CHF denominated payable).    As of December 31, 2011, the notional amount of the forward contractsdesignated as a cash flow hedge is approximately $4.2, and the unrealized loss as of December 31, 2011 is approximately $0.1. The contracts will settle in the first and third quarters of 2012. There was no hedge ineffectiveness for thecontracts in 2011.    Commodity Price Risk:  At times, we used natural gas forwards to hedge a portion of our utility requirements atcertain of our North American manufacturing facilities. These forward contracts, which were highly effective at achieving offsetting cash flows of the underlying natural gas purchases, had been designated as cash flow hedges and were reported on theconsolidated balance sheets at fair value, with the effective portion of the hedged item included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) on an after-tax basis. Gains and losses were reclassified into earnings, as a component ofmanufacturing cost of sales, in the period the hedged natural gas purchases affected earnings. If the derivative was no longer highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows, subsequent changes in fair value were recorded in other income(expense), net. Any ineffectiveness was recognized in other income (expense), net in the current period. If the hedging relationship was terminated, we continued to defer the related gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income andincluded it as a component of the cost of the underlying hedged item. If the forecasted transaction was no longer likely to occur, we recognized the related gain or loss in other income (expense), net in that period. We did not terminate      -37-        any hedges during 2011, 2010, and 2009. All hedged transactions that were forecasted to occur in 2011, 2010, and 2009 occurred as forecasted. Ineffectiveness during these years was insignificant.   There are no natural gas hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2011.    Fair Value Measurements    We have certain assets and liabilities that are carried at fairvalue on a recurring basis in the financial statements, for which we determine the appropriate level in the fair value input hierarchy for each fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs, which refer broadly toassumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, into three levels. It gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservableinputs. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Level 1 inputs arequoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable for the asset orliability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, interest rates, exchange rates, and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservableinputs for the asset or liability.    All of our derivatives are valued based on Level 2 inputs. Our currency forwards are valued based onreadily available published indices for currency exchange rates. Our cross currency swaps are valued using an income approach based on industry-standard techniques. This model includes a discounted cash flow analysis that nets the discounted futurecash receipts and the discounted expected cash payments resulting from the swap. The analysis is based on the contractual terms of the swaps including the period to maturity and observable market-based inputs that include time value, interest ratecurves, foreign exchange rates, implied volatilities, as well as other relevant economic measures. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the counterpartys nonperformancerisk in the fair value measurements.   Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall withinLevel 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and ourcounterparties. However, as of December 31, 2011, we have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we have determined that our derivative valuationsin their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.    At December 31, 2011, the unfavorable fair value of the ten yearswaps was $13.2. The following table summarizes the approximate impact that a change in certain critical inputs would have on the fair values of our ten year swaps. The approximate impact of the change in each critical input assumes all other inputsand factors remain constant.
