ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION         AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the description of our business and risk factors contained in Part I of this report. Currency amounts are in millions, except per share amounts. Percentages are approximate.  GENERAL  We are a global specialty chemicals and materials company which sells our products to diverse major markets for aerospace, adhesives, automotive and industrial coatings, chemical intermediates, inks, mining, plastics and water treatment. Sales price and volume by region and the impact of exchange rates on our reporting segments are important measures that are analyzed by management.  In the course of our ongoing operations, a number of strategic product line acquisitions and dispositions have been made. The results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included in our consolidated results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. On February 28, 2005, we acquired the Surface Specialties business of UCB in a transaction valued at $1,799.7. After adjusting for a final working capital adjustment of $25.4 and transaction costs incurred of $14.9, the acquisition was valued at $1,789.2. A further discussion of acquisitions and dispositions can be found in Note 2 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein.  We also report net sales in four geographic regions: North America, Latin America, Asia/Pacific and Europe/Middle East/Africa. The destination of the sale determines the region under which it is reported consistent with management's view of the business. North America consists of the United States and Canada. Latin America includes Mexico, Central America, South America and the Caribbean Islands. Asia/Pacific is comprised of Asia, Australia and the islands of the South Pacific Rim.  Raw material cost changes year on year are an important factor in profitability especially in years of high volatility. Oil and natural gas costs are significantly higher than the year ago period and many of our raw materials are derived from these two commodities. Discussion of the year to year impact of raw materials and energy is provided in our segment discussion. In addition, higher global demand levels and, occasionally, operating difficulties at suppliers, have limited the availability of certain of our raw materials. Hurricane activity in the US Gulf region led to further increases in the cost of natural gas and oil-related raw materials.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table sets forth the percentage relationship that certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income bear to net sales:  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,                       2005        2004     2003 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Net sales                                     100.0%      100.0%   100.0% Manufacturing cost of sales                    79.1        75.7     75.5 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Gross profit                                   20.9        24.3     24.5 Selling and technical services                  7.3         8.1      8.6 Research and process development                3.6         2.3      2.4 Administrative and general                      3.5         3.8      3.3 Amortization of acquisition intangibles         1.0         0.3      0.3 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Earnings from operations                        5.5         9.8      9.9 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Net earnings available to common stockholders   2.0         7.0      5.4 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                         -21-       NET SALES BY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA                                                                                                     EUROPE/                                                        NORTH          LATIN         ASIA/      MIDDLE EAST/ NET SALES                                             AMERICA        AMERICA       PACIFIC        AFRICA         TOTAL - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2005              Cytec Performance Chemicals                           $  340.8         $126.8       $118.5        $  269.7     $  855.8   Cytec Surface Specialties                                329.6           50.7        202.9           660.9      1,244.1   Cytec Engineered Materials                               349.2            1.5         30.0           160.9        541.6   Building Block Chemicals                                 149.2            4.9         50.3            79.8        284.2                                                     ----------------------------------------------------------------------     Total                                               $1,168.8         $183.9       $401.7        $1,171.3     $2,925.7                                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 2004   Cytec Performance Chemicals                           $  293.8         $104.0       $106.7        $  208.2     $  712.7   Cytec Surface Specialties                                122.4           16.2         56.7            65.7        261.0   Cytec Engineered Materials                               322.4            1.7         21.5           141.4        487.0   Building Block Chemicals                                 126.6            3.3         77.0            53.7        260.6                                                     ----------------------------------------------------------------------     Total                                               $  865.2         $125.2       $261.9        $  469.0     $1,721.3                                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 2003   Cytec Performance Chemicals                           $  272.5         $ 77.9       $101.3        $  171.9     $  623.6   Cytec Surface Specialties                                120.5           13.4         36.5            58.0        228.4   Cytec Engineered Materials                               292.3            1.6         15.5            99.3        408.7   Building Block Chemicals                                  88.9            4.0         58.0            60.2        211.1                                                     ----------------------------------------------------------------------     Total                                               $  774.2         $ 96.9       $211.3        $  389.4     $1,471.8                                                     ======================================================================   Net sales in the United States were $1,095.3, $802.4 and $719.7 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. International net sales were $1,830.4, $918.9, and $752.1, or 63%, 53% and 51% of total net sales, for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  For more information on our segments, refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and further discussions in "Segment Results," below.  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  Net sales for 2005 were $2,925.7 compared with $1,721.3 for 2004, up 70% of which 62% was due to the inclusion of sales from Surface Specialties which was acquired on February 28, 2005, selling prices increased 6%, exchange rates increased sales 1% and selling volumes were up 1%. Cytec Performance Chemicals experienced a net increase in sales which resulted primarily from the addition of sales of the acquired pressure sensitive adhesives and polyurethanes product lines of Surface Specialties as well as from selling price increases. Cytec Surface Specialties experienced a net increase in sales which resulted primarily from the addition of sales related to the remainder of the acquired product lines of Surface Specialties. Cytec Engineered Materials sales increase was primarily volume related, primarily from increased sales to the large commercial transport and commercial rotorcraft sectors. Building Block Chemicals sales increased from higher selling prices, while volumes decreased. Net sales and operating results for the Building Blocks segment were significantly impacted by the effects of hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the US gulf coast.  For a detailed discussion on revenues refer to the Segment Results section below.  Manufacturing cost of sales was $2,313.7 compared with $1,303.1 during 2004. This increase was primarily attributable to the following items: the inclusion of the acquired Surface Specialties business; higher raw material and energy costs of $98.4; a charge of $20.8 representing the excess of the fair value of the finished goods inventory of the acquired business over normal manufacturing cost and the direct impact from the hurricanes of $6.3 for maintenance and repair costs, extra labor and related expenses, energy and start up costs. Also included was approximately $5.0 of employee severance costs related to a restructuring that occurred during the second half of 2005.  Pension expense increased $15.7 principally as a result of additional plans acquired upon acquisition and to a lesser extent, the lowering of the discount rate in the U. S. by 0.50% to reflect current market rates on fixed income securities. Pension expense is primarily reported in manufacturing cost of sales.                                         -22-   Selling and technical services was $213.6 versus $139.8 in the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to the following items: the inclusion of the acquired Surface Specialties business; $3.5 of employee severance costs; $1.2 of unfavorable exchange rate changes; and $4.4 from increased investments in people and qualification work on a number of new aircraft platforms for our customers in the Cytec Engineered Materials segment.  Research and process development was $68.5 versus $40.0 in the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the acquired Surface Specialties business and $0.8 related to restructuring charges.  The write-off of acquired in-process research and development of $37.0 was the result of the Surface Specialties acquisition.  Administrative and general expenses were $102.1 versus $65.1 in the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to the following items: the inclusion of the acquired Surface Specialties business; a charge of $2.4 related to the settlement of a litigation matter and employee severance costs of $7.3. Included in administrative expenses for the prior year period is a charge of $8.0 related to the settlement of a federal carbon fiber class action lawsuit and several other minor litigation matters.  Amortization of acquisition intangibles was $30.3 versus $5.6 in the prior year due to the amortization of intangibles related to the acquired Surface Specialties business.  Other income (expense), net was expense of $44.9 compared with income of $16.9 in the prior year. We entered into derivative contracts to economically hedge currency and interest rate exposures associated with the Surface Specialties acquisition. These contracts were settled following completion of the acquisition and resulted in a loss of $19.2 during 2005. The foreign currency contracts have matured. In anticipation of the long-term debt that was subsequently issued in October, 2005 to refinance debt, we also entered into interest rate derivatives which resulted in the recognition of a loss of $25.0 in 2005. Also included in 2005 was a charge of $4.4 for a settlement to resolve a dispute over an environmental matter. Included in 2004 results was a net gain of $26.8 related to derivative contracts entered into during the fourth quarter to economically hedge currency and interest rate exposure associated with the pending acquisition of Surface Specialties. Also included in 2004 results were charges of $6.1 for settlement of several environmental remediation and toxic tort lawsuits and a charge of $2.0 related to the settlement of a series of disputed matters with the holder of our Series C Preferred Stock ("Series C Stock").  Equity in earnings of associated companies was $7.9 versus $5.2 in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in earnings by CYRO even though the 2005 results include only the five months of results. We sold our 50% ownership stake in CYRO on June 1, 2005.  Interest expense, net was $80.0 compared with $17.4 in the prior year. The increase resulted from higher  outstanding debt balances incurred in conjunction with our acquisition of Surface  Specialties  and $22.0 of interest  charges and unamortized  put  premiums  and rate lock  agreements  related  to the  optional redemption of our Mandatory Par Put Remarketed Securities ("MOPPRS") in 2005.  Our 2005 effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was a tax benefit of 33%. Our effective tax rate for  continuing  operations was favorably impacted  by a  reduction  in income tax  expense of $12.2  related to a partial resolution of a tax audit in Norway with respect to prior year tax returns and a reduction in income tax expense of $16.2  recorded  related to final approval of the Internal Revenue Service's examination of our tax returns for the years 1999 through  2001.  Also  favorably  impacting  the rate  were the  losses  of $44.2 incurred in the U.S. on interest rate and currency  derivatives  entered into in connection with Surface Specialties  acquisition and the $22.0 charge pertaining to the optional  redemption  of the MOPPRS.  The tax benefit on these losses was recorded at 36.5%. Unfavorably impacting the 2005 tax rate was a charge of $37.0 for the write-off of in-process research and development expenses related to the Surface Specialties acquisition for which no tax benefit was recorded. Excluding these items,  our underlying 2005 annual effective tax rate would have been 26%. The comparable  effective tax rate in 2004 was 24%,  which excludes  acquisition related  net  currency  and  interest  rate hedge  gains.  The  increase  in the underlying annual effective tax rate versus last year was primarily attributable to the  addition of  earnings  from  acquired  Surface  Specialties  entities in countries with higher tax rates than in countries for heritage Cytec.  Earnings from discontinued operations were $1.2 in 2005, net of taxes of $0.8 and reflect the results of Surface Specialties amino resins ("SSAR") product line for the six months ended August 31, 2005, the date on which we divested SSAR.  During 2004, we redeemed our Series C Stock, which had a liquidation value of $0.1, for $10.0 in cash. The resulting charge to net earnings available to common stockholders of $9.9 was recorded as a premium paid to redeem preferred stock during 2004.                                         -23-     Net earnings available to common stockholders for 2005 were $59.1 ($1.27 per diluted share) compared with $121.1 ($2.96 per diluted share). Included in the full year ended December 31, 2005 were purchase accounting related charges of $20.8 pre-tax (after-tax $15.2, or $0.33 per diluted share), related to acquired inventories from Surface Specialties being recorded at fair value which exceeded normal manufacturing cost, and $37.0 or $0.80 per diluted share related to the write-off of in-process research and development costs of Surface Specialties, a pre-tax charge of $44.2 million (after tax $28.1 or $0.61 per diluted share) related to currency and interest rate derivative transactions associated with the Surface Specialties acquisition, a pre-tax charge of $2.4 (after tax $1.8 or $0.04 per diluted share) related to an anticipated settlement of a certain litigation matter, a pre-tax charge of $22.0 (after-tax $14.0 or $0.30 per diluted share) related to the optional redemption of our MOPPRS prior to their maturity, an income tax benefit of $28.4, or $0.61 per diluted share, reflecting favorable resolution of tax audits with respect to prior year tax returns, employee restructuring costs of $16.8 (after tax net $12.4 or $0.27 per diluted share), integration costs related to the acquired business of pre-tax $0.2 (after tax $0.1) and a $4.4 settlement to resolve a dispute over an environmental matter (after tax $3.2 or $0.07 per diluted share).

On a regional basis, sales volume in North America increased 7% with acquisitions accounting for 11%. The decrease in base volumes is primarily attributable to the water treatment and polymer additive product lines which were impacted by decisions to give up low margin business and reduced demand. Sales volume in Europe/Middle East/Africa increased 23%, with acquisitions accounting for 24%, partly offset by a decrease in base selling volume of 1% principally in the polymer additives product line. Sales volumes in Asia were up 6% with the acquisition accounting for 12%. The decrease in base volumes was principally in the polymer additives product line due to decisions to give up low margin business. Sales volumes in Latin America increased 12% primarily due to improved demand for mining chemicals for copper mining applications. Selling prices increased as a result of implementation of price increase initiatives to cover significantly higher raw material and energy costs.  Earnings from operations were $56.6, or 7% of sales, compared with $57.5 or 8% of sales in 2004. Earnings declined slightly as price increases of $47.1 and the net favorable impact of exchange rate changes were offset by higher raw material and energy costs of $35.8, a write-off of acquired in-process research and development costs of $6.9, a charge of $2.5 for the excess of the fair value of the finished goods inventory of the acquired business over normal manufacturing cost and lower selling volumes compounded by reduced production levels at certain facilities in response to lower demand levels.                                          -24-   CYTEC SURFACE SPECIALTIES                                                                                                        % CHANGE DUE TO                                                                                         ---------------------------------------                                                                                TOTAL                    ACQUISTION/                                                 2005          2004            % CHANGE    PRICE          VOLUME        CURRENCY - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------              North America                                  $  329.6       $122.4           169%        3%             166%            0% Latin America                                      50.7         16.2           213%       -1%             210%            4% Asia/Pacific                                      202.9         56.7           258%        1%             256%            1% Europe/Middle East/Africa                         660.9         65.7           906%        2%             903%            1%                                              -------------------------- Total                                          $1,244.1       $261.0           377%        2%             374%            1% ===============================================================================================================================   Selling volumes increased 374% as a result of the acquisition with base volumes decreasing slightly for heritage businesses. In North America base business declined 5% due to weak demand and Latin America, all of the volume increase is acquisition related. In Asia/Pacific, base business grew 8% while in Europe/Middle East/Africa, base volumes were down 2% due to weak demand.  Earnings from operations were $22.0, or 2% of sales, compared with earnings from  operations  of $28.7 or 11% of sales in 2004.  The decrease in earnings is primarily  attributable  to the  following  factors:  the  write-off of acquired in-process research and development costs of $30.1; a charge of $18.3 for the excess  of the fair  value  of the  finished  goods  inventory  of the  acquired business over normal  manufacturing  costs; a decline in base business selling volumes which decreased earnings by $6.5, and; higher raw material and energy costs of $12.5 which were only partially recovered by selling price increases of $4.8. Partially offsetting the above were the earnings of the acquired business of $57.8 (excluding the acquired research and development and inventory charges referred to above) and the net favorable impact of exchange rate changes.

Overall selling volumes increased 9%. Increased sales to the Europe/Middle East/Africa, North America and Asia/Pacific regions primarily related to increased volumes to the large commercial transport and commercial rotorcraft sectors primarily due to increased build rates and new business.  Earnings from operations were $103.0, or 19% of sales, compared with $83.4, or 17% of sales, in 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to increased earnings of $30.5 from higher selling volumes and price increases of $8.3 partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs of $5.6, manufacturing difficulties in Europe and increased in technical, commercial and research of $5.2 principally to support future growth initiatives.

Sales were higher overall due to higher selling prices, primarily for acrylonitrile, which were in line with the increase in raw material costs. Selling volumes decreased 7% overall. Selling volumes to the Asia/Pacific region decreased due to sluggish demand for acrylonitrile in light of higher selling prices but were partially offset by increased volumes to the Europe/Middle East/Africa region where local production outages increased demand for imported acrylonitrile. Selling volumes in North America were impacted by reduced industrial demand and the hurricanes in the US Gulf region.                                         -25-   Earnings from operations were $5.7, or 2% of sales, compared with $15.6, or 6% of sales, in 2004. The decrease in earnings reflects the impact from the hurricanes of about $6.3 related to maintenance and repair costs, extra labor and related expenses, energy and start up costs and the related lower production levels which reduced fixed cost absorption by approximately $3.9. Higher selling prices of $41.0 mostly offset increased raw material and energy costs of $44.6.  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  Net sales for 2004 were $1,721.3 compared with $1,471.8 during 2003. All segments reported increased sales. In the two specialty chemicals segments sales increased primarily due to increased selling volumes, the acquisitions completed in the second half of 2003 and favorable exchange rates. The Cytec Engineered Materials segment sales increase was primarily volume related and all product lines participated. The Building Block Chemicals segment sales increased principally due to higher selling prices which were driven by higher raw material and energy costs offset somewhat by a decrease in sales volumes of acrylonitrile and acrylamide.  For a detailed discussion on sales refer to the Segment Results section below.  Manufacturing cost of sales was $1,303.1 compared with $1,111.9 during 2003. Cost of sales was primarily impacted by higher raw material and energy costs of $69.0. Gross margin percent however, decreased by only 0.2% as the higher raw material and energy costs were offset by increased selling prices of $42.1, the net impact of exchange rates on operations outside of the United States of $35.1, the fixed cost leverage from the increased production levels and a favorable product mix.  Pension expense increased $5.1 principally as a result of our lowering the discount rate in the U. S. by 0.5% to reflect current market rates on fixed income securities and by the 2003 acquisitions which increased pension expense by $0.3. Pension expense is primarily reported in manufacturing cost of sales. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies, Retirement Plans" for further discussion on how changes in discount rates and return on asset assumptions can impact annual expense.  Selling and technical services was $139.8 in 2004 versus $126.9 in the prior year due to ongoing costs of the businesses in the Specialty Chemical segments acquired in the second half of 2003, the impact of exchange rate changes on operations outside of the United States of $4.2 and higher costs in the Cytec Engineered Materials segment of $2.0 where we are investing in personnel, product qualifications and commercialization of new products for our growth initiatives.  Research and process development was $40.0 versus $35.2 in the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of ongoing costs of the acquired businesses of the Specialty Chemical segments completed in the second half of 2003, costs associated with the start up of the newly renovated specialty chemicals technology center and higher costs in the Cytec Engineered Materials segment where we continue to invest for a number of future opportunities.  Administrative and general expenses were $65.1 versus $49.7 in the prior year. Included in 2004 is a charge of $8.0 related to the settlement of the federal carbon fiber class action lawsuit and several other minor litigation matters. Also contributing to the increase were ongoing costs of the businesses of the Specialty Chemical segments acquired in the second half of 2003 of approximately $1.3, an increase in deferred compensation expense of $2.6 due to the increase in our stock price versus the year ago period and the impact of exchange rate changes on operations outside of the U.S. of $1.1. Additionally, we incurred $2.0 in third party expenses related to implementing accounting and disclosure control procedures as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Other income, net was $16.9 compared with a loss of $5.7 in the prior year. Included in 2004 results was a net gain of $26.8 related to derivative contracts entered into during the fourth quarter to economically hedge currency and interest rate exposure associated with the pending acquisition of Surface Specialties. We entered into foreign currency contracts to offset the impact of potential dollar to euro exchange rate fluctuations on the acquisition cost in dollars and this resulted in a gain of $33.3. In anticipation of future long-term debt that would be issued to partially finance the acquisition, we also entered into interest rate hedges which resulted in the recognition of a loss of $6.5. Also included in other income, net are charges of $6.2 for settlement of several environmental remediation and toxic tort lawsuits and a charge of $2.0 related to the settlement of a series of disputed matters with Wyeth, partially offset by a gain of $2.0 related to the sale in 1999 of our share of a methanol joint venture whereby we received additional proceeds because the market price of methanol stayed above an agreed upon index over a predetermined period of time. We also recorded $3.0 in other income, net, of which $1.0 has been received, that relates to insurance recoveries and expected recoveries from our insurers of lead-related defense costs which had been previously expensed. Lead-related defense costs recognized during 2004 amounted to $2.5. The prior year loss of $5.7 primarily resulted from the recognition of currency losses whereby certain international subsidiaries held dollar denominated assets while the U.S. dollar weakened.                                         -26-     Equity in earnings of associated companies was $5.2 versus $7.2 in the prior year. Earnings from CYRO, our 50% owned acrylic plastics joint venture, remained flat as compared with the prior year as increased sales volumes and selling prices offset higher raw material costs. In addition, results for 2003 included earnings of $1.8 from our former 50% owned Mitsui-Cytec joint venture. Refer to Notes 2 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Interest expense, net was $17.4 compared with $16.2 in the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from a higher outstanding weighted-average debt balance during 2004.  Our effective tax rate in 2004 was 24.0% compared with 28.3% in 2003. This reduction reflects our continued earnings growth in lower tax jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, a favorable international tax ruling received in the first quarter of 2004. During the second quarter of 2004, we recorded a reduction of our tax liabilities due to the completion of several years of tax audits in an international tax jurisdiction that resulted in a reduction of $2.4 to our income tax provision. These reductions were partially offset by the derivative net gain noted above which was taxed at the higher incremental U.S. rate.  Net earnings available to common stockholders for 2004 were $121.1 ($2.96 per diluted share). Net earnings available to common stockholders for 2004 included a charge of $9.9 ($0.24 per diluted share) as a result of the redemption of our Series C Stock. Our Series C Stock was originally issued in 1993 in conjunction with our spin-off from American Cyanamid Company ("Cyanamid"). Wyeth became beneficial owner of Series C Stock following its acquisition of Cyanamid in 1994. Net earnings available to common stockholders for 2003 were $79.2 ($1.97 per diluted share). Included in 2003 results is an after-tax, non-cash charge of $13.6 ($0.34 per diluted share) reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change related to the adoption of SFAS No.143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" which became effective January 1, 2003.

The 5% increase in base selling volumes was attributable to increased sales across all product lines, mining chemicals and water treatment chemicals. On a regional basis, sales volumes in Latin America increased 33% with acquisitions accounting for 11% and the remainder of the increase primarily due to improved demand for mining chemicals from copper mining applications. Sales volumes were up 13% in Europe/Middle East/Africa with acquisitions accounting for 4% and the remainder of the increase primarily due to increased demand for water treatment chemicals from full service providers and phosphine applications.  Earnings from operations were $57.5, or 8% of sales, compared with $35.7 or 6% of sales in 2003. The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to increased selling volumes, primarily due to acquisitions during the second half of 2003, and the impact of exchange rate changes of $20.3 partly offset by increased raw material and energy costs of $8.7.                                         -27-      CYTEC SURFACE SPECIALTIES                                                                                                        % CHANGE DUE TO                                                                                         ---------------------------------------                                                                                TOTAL                                                 2004          2003            % CHANGE    PRICE          VOLUME/MIX    CURRENCY - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------              North America                                    $122.4       $120.5             2%       -1%               3%            0% Latin America                                      16.2         13.4            21%        0%              20%            1% Asia/Pacific                                       56.7         36.5            55%       -2%              55%            2% Europe/Middle East/Africa                          65.7         58.0            13%        1%               3%            9%                                              -------------------------- Total                                            $261.0       $228.4            14%       -1%              12%            3% ===============================================================================================================================   Overall selling volumes increased 12% with acquisitions accounting for 7%. Base selling volumes increased for all product lines as a result of improved demand and new business. On a regional basis, Asia/Pacific sales volumes increased 55% with acquisitions accounting for 45%. Latin America sales volumes increased 20% and resulted from increased demand for coatings. Europe/Middle East/Africa sales were up 13% due to the favorable impact of exchange rate changes and increased demand primarily for coatings chemicals.  Earnings from operations were $28.7, or 11% of sales, compared with $23.7, or 10% of sales, in 2003. The favorable impact from acquisitions, higher base sales volumes, improved manufacturing operations and net favorable exchange rate changes of $6.2 more than offset the effect of higher raw material and energy costs of $3.4.

On a regional basis, the 10% increase in North America sales volumes represented increased sales primarily to large commercial aircraft, military, business and regional jet and rotorcraft applications. Europe/Middle East/Africa sales volumes increased 40% principally due to increased sales to large commercial aircraft and high performance automotive applications as well as to business and regional jet and rotorcraft applications. Asia/Pacific sales volumes increased 40% principally due to increased sales for large commercial aircraft and regional and business jets. The overall decrease in average selling price was primarily due to increased volume rebates.  Earnings from operations were $83.4, or 17% of sales, compared with $66.0, or 16% of sales, in 2003. Higher earnings were principally due to the increase in selling volumes partly offset by increased manufacturing and commercial costs to service the higher demand levels and growth opportunities of this segment.

Global sales volumes declined slightly due in part to decreased acrylonitrile production as a result of reduced propylene (the key raw material for acrylonitrile) availability during the first quarter as well as a scheduled plant maintenance shutdown during May, 2004. North America selling volumes were up 18% with the majority due to increased acrylonitrile and sulfuric acid business. Europe/Middle East/Africa volumes decreased as 2003 reflected opportunistic sales in this region resulting from more favorable spot selling prices versus the Asia/Pacific region. North America and Asia/Pacific selling prices were up primarily reflecting partial recovery of higher raw material and energy costs.                                        -28-   Earnings from operations were $15.6, or 6% of sales, compared with $20.7, or 10% of sales, in 2003. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to the decrease in volume and increased raw material and energy costs of $48.0, which were not fully offset by price increases of $46.0.  LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  At December 31, 2005, our cash balance was $68.6 compared with $323.8 at year end 2004. This decrease was primarily attributable to the use of cash to pay for a portion of the purchase price of Surface Specialties and to reduce debt, partially offset by cash generated from operations and sales of assets and discontinued operations.  Cash flows provided by operating activities were $232.4 compared with $167.4 for 2004. Significant one-time non-cash acquisition related charges for the write-off of acquired in-process research and development and amortization of acquired finished goods step up to fair value negatively impacted earnings but did not impact operating cash flow. The acquisition also resulted in significant increases in non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses. Other receivables reflect cash flows of $31.7 primarily due to the reimbursement from UCB for the payment of $19.4 of pre-acquisition tax liabilities for which we have been indemnified. Income taxes payable decreased $42.6 reflecting payment of the pre-acquisition income tax liabilities of $19.9 and the favorable resolution of several prior year tax matters which amounted to a reduction of income taxes payable of $28.3. Inventories decreased $9.5 reflecting efforts to optimize inventory levels. Other assets decreased $21.5 primarily from the cash realization of gains on acquisition related derivative instruments that were recognized in 2004. Accrued expenses decreased $19.3. Included in this are payments against acquisition related accruals of $7.9, payments against prior year incentive accruals higher than the current year accrual of $10.9, payment of legal settlements of $10.4 of which $8.0 was accrued in 2004 and a payment of $7.7 for losses on interest rate derivative instruments that were recognized in 2004. Partially offsetting these payments were net accruals for restructuring of $10.5.  Cash flows used in investing activities were $1,385.2 for 2005 compared with $84.1 for 2004. This increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Surface Specialties. On February 28, 2005, we acquired Surface Specialties for cash and stock valued at $1,799.7, of which $1,508.9 (euro 1,138.5 at 1.325 U.S. dollar per euro) was paid in cash and the balance was paid in 5,772,857 shares of Cytec common stock ($290.8 at $50.37 per Cytec share). During September 2005, we received $25.4 from UCB representing an adjustment to the purchase price for finalization of working capital amounts as of the acquisition date. After considering the final working capital adjustment and transaction costs of $14.9, the acquisition is valued at $1,789.2 of which $1,493.8 was paid in cash in 2005 and $4.6 was paid in cash in 2004. Assets acquired includes $34.7 in cash, so the net cash used for the acquisition in 2005 totaled $1,459.1. The increase in cash flows used in investing activities was partly offset by the sale of assets of $105.5 of which $100.4 was received from the sale of our 50% investment in CYRO. Also, $74.3 was received from the sale of SSAR, which was classified as a discontinued operation. Capital spending for 2005 was $105.3, up from $89.3 primarily due to spending at acquired sites.  Net cash flows provided by financing activities were $906.4 in 2005 compared with net cash flows used in financing activities of $20.6 during 2004. This  increase  primarily  resulted  from  borrowings  in  connection  with  the acquisition of Surface Specialties.  We financed the cash component with $600.0 under an unsecured 364-day credit facility, $725.0 under an unsecured five-year term loan and the remaining $184.0 was paid from existing cash. During October 2005, we sold $250.0 principal amount of 5.5% Notes due October 1, 2010 and $250.0 principal amount of 6.0% Notes due October 1, 2015 (collectively, the "Notes"). The Notes were offered under our $600.0 shelf registration statement. We received $495.1 in net proceeds from the offering after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses which we used to repay all amounts outstanding under our unsecured 364-day facility and our revolving credit facility which were $417.5 and $66.2, respectively. The 364-day facility is now terminated. The Notes will pay interest on each April 1 and October 1, commencing on April 1, 2006 through their respective due dates. The Notes are unsecured and subordinated to any secured indebtedness of Cytec. The Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option at any time subject to a prepayment adjustment. Our bank agreements contain certain customary covenants with which we are in compliance at December 31, 2005.  In late 2004, we entered into $642.9 of forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge the benchmark interest rate and credit spread on certain debt anticipated to be issued in 2005 in connection with the acquisition of Surface Specialties. Due to a subsequent reduction in borrowing requirements, we liquidated $25.0 of these swaps in March 2005 at a cost of $0.4 and $60.4 of these swaps in June 2005 at a cost of $3.7. On September 29, 2005, we settled the remaining outstanding swaps at the same time that we priced our public debt offering. The termination payment of $27.4 was paid in October, 2005.                                         -29-   In connection with the acquisition, we suspended our stock buy-back program and do not anticipate making future stock buy-backs for at least two years from the closing date in order to maximize the funds available for debt service and other corporate purposes.  In order to take advantage of interest rates then in effect, we elected to redeem the MOPPRS in May, 2005, at the optional redemption price of $141.0. The optional redemption price represented the $120.0 principal amount of the securities and a $21.0 pre-tax interest charge for redemption prior to their final maturity. The redemption provided us with the ability to refinance this debt at a significantly lower cost and a shorter tenor.  In conjunction with our note offering, we entered into (euro)207.9 of five year and (euro)207.9 of ten year euro/US dollar cross currency swaps. The swaps included an initial exchange of $500.0 on October 4, 2005 and will require final principal exchanges of $250.0 on each settlement date of the 5-Year and 10-Year Notes (October 1, 2010 and October 1, 2015), respectively. At the initial principal exchange, we paid US dollars to counterparties and received euros. Upon final exchange, we will provide euros to counterparties and receive U.S. dollars. The swaps also call for an exchange of fixed euro interest payments for fixed US dollar interest receipts. With respect to the five year swaps, we will receive 5.5% per annum and will pay 3.784% per annum on each April 1 and October 1, through the maturity. With respect to the ten year swaps, we will receive 6.0% per annum and will pay 4.5245% per annum on each April 1 and October 1, through the maturity date.  After accounting for the cross currency swaps, the "all-in" effective interest rate including amortization of underwriters' discount and other offering costs is approximately 4.0% and 4.7% for the 5-Year and 10-Year Notes, respectively.  The euro denominated bank borrowings including the impact of our euro/US dollar cross currency swaps, naturally hedge our euro denominated intercompany receivables and provide a partial hedge of our net investment in our Belgium-based subsidiary, Cytec Surface Specialties SA/NV.  As of December 31, 2005, our total debt of $1,311.0 is denominated approximately 60% in euros, 38% in dollars and the balance denominated in various other currencies, after taking into account the euro/US dollar cross currency swaps.  As of December 31, 2005, we may borrow up to $350.0 under our revolving credit facility.  During 2005, we paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per common share which aggregated $17.8. On February 9, 2006 the Board of Directors declared a $0.10 per common share cash dividend, payable on March 15, 2006 to shareholders of record as of February 27, 2006.  We believe that we have the ability to fund our operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures and dividends as well as the ability to meet our debt service requirements for the foreseeable future from existing cash and from internal cash generation. However, from time to time, based on such factors as local tax regulations, prevailing interest rates and our plans for capital investment or other investments, it may make economic sense to utilize our existing credit lines in order to meet those cash requirements, which may include debt-service related disbursements.  We have not guaranteed any indebtedness of our unconsolidated associated company.  Excluding the impact of increasing raw materials costs, inflation is not considered significant since the rate of inflation has remained relatively low in recent years and investments in areas of the world where inflation poses a significant risk are limited. The impact of increasing raw material costs are discussed under "Customers and Suppliers" in "Business" in Item 1, herein.                                         -30-       CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005:                                                               PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD                                    -------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     LESS THAN                                     MORE THAN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS                  TOTAL         1 YEAR      1-3 YEARS       3-5 YEARS        5 YEARS - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------            Long-term debt                       $ 1,277.2          $51.1         $247.7         $ 526.7        $ 451.7 Operating leases                          60.3           13.6           19.7            10.6           16.4 Purchase obligations                      51.9           16.7           19.4             7.8            8.0 Unfunded employee benefits                15.2            1.5            4.3             3.0            6.4                                    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                                $ 1,404.6          $82.9        $ 291.1         $ 548.1        $ 482.5 ============================================================================================================   We had net contractual commitments under currency forward contracts in U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of $42.4, that all settle in less than one year.

(Refer to Item 7A as well as Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein).  We had $46.6 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees at December 31, 2005 that are issued on our behalf in the ordinary course of business to support certain of our performance obligations and commitments. The instruments are typically renewed on an annual basis.  We do not have any unconsolidated limited purpose entities or any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities.                                          -31-      ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward-looking analysis. Currencies are in millions.  Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings.  In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to various market risks, including fluctuations in currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates. To manage the exposure related to these risks, we may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with our established policies. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Moreover, we enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly-rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties, thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks.  CURRENCY RISK: We periodically enter into currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business. At December 31, 2005, the principal transactions hedged involved accounts receivable, accounts payable and intercompany loans. When hedging currency exposures, our practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure, and therefore, the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value, cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction.  At December 31, 2005, the currency and net contractual amounts of forward contracts outstanding translated into U. S. dollar equivalent amounts were as follows:                                                                       BUY                                    ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                               POUND                CANADIAN     AUSTRALIAN             SELL                        EURO   STERLING            DOLLAR         DOLLAR    U.S. DOLLAR             ---------------------- ---------- ---------------- ------------- -------------- ------------                    U.

Assuming that year-end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical 10%, the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year-end would decrease by approximately $3.5. However, since these contracts hedge specific transactions, any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged.  In September, 2005, we entered into (euro)207.9 of five year cross currency swaps and (euro)207.9 of ten year cross currency swaps to effectively convert the 5-Year Notes and 10-Year Notes into euro-denominated liabilities. The swaps included an initial exchange of $500.0 on October 4, 2005 and will require final principal exchanges of $250.0 on each settlement date of the 5-Year and 10-Year Notes (October 1, 2010 and October 1, 2015), respectively. At the initial principal exchange, we paid US dollars to counterparties and received euros. Upon final exchange, we will provide euros to counterparties and receive US dollars. The swaps also call for a semi-annual exchange of fixed euro interest payments for fixed US dollar interest receipts. With respect to the five year swaps, we will receive 5.5% per annum and will pay 3.784% per annum on each April 1 and October 1, through the maturity date of the five year swaps. With respect to the ten year swaps, we will receive 6.0% per annum and will pay 4.5245% per annum on each April 1 and October 1, through the maturity date of the ten year swaps. The cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the changes in value of the future euro interest and principal receipts that results from changes in the US dollar to euro exchange rates on certain euro denominated intercompany receivables we have with our subsidiaries. The cross currency swaps plus the euro denominated bank borrowings naturally hedge our euro denominated intercompany loans receivable and, further, provide a partial hedge of our net investment in our Belgium-based subsidiary, Cytec Surface Specialties SA/NV.  At December 31, 2005, the fair value of the five and ten year swaps were $5.8 and $2.7, respectively. Assuming other factors are held constant, a hypothetical increase/decrease of 10% in the euro exchange rate would cause an increase/decrease of approximately $49.2 in the value of the hedging instruments referred to above.                                         -32-   COMMODITY PRICE RISK: We use natural gas forward contracts, which are physically settled, to hedge certain utility requirements. The maturities of these contracts correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that we pay for the underlying commodity. While these contracts are structured to limit our exposure to increases in commodity prices, they can also limit the potential benefit we might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices. Because we take physical delivery of the commodity, these contracts are not required to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Instead, realized gains and losses are included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of the contract.  At December 31, 2005, the Building Block Chemicals segment Fortier plant's 2006 forecasted natural gas utility requirements were 37% hedged utilizing natural gas forward contracts at an average cost of $8.84 per MMBTU. These contracts had a notional value of $10.5 and have delivery dates from January 2006 through December 2006. Based on year-end NYMEX prices, we had net unrealized gains on our natural gas forward contracts at December 31, 2005 of $2.4. Assuming that year-end natural gas prices were to decrease by a hypothetical 10%, the value of these contracts would decrease by approximately $1.3.  At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had outstanding natural gas swaps with a fair value gain of $1.7 and a fair value loss of $(0.7), net of taxes, respectively.  INTEREST RATE RISK: At December 31, 2005, our outstanding borrowings consisted of $34.3 of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the current portion, which had a carrying value of $1,276.7, a face value of $1,277.2 and a fair value, based on dealer quoted values, of approximately $1,243.5.  Assuming other factors are held constant, a hypothetical increase/decrease of 1% in the weighted-average prevailing interest rate on our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2005, interest expense would increase/decrease by approximately $1.3 for the next fiscal quarter and the fair value of the fixed rate long-term debt would decrease/increase by approximately $39.1.  2006 OUTLOOK  In our February 9, 2006 press release, which was also furnished as an exhibit to a current report on Form 8-K, we set forth our assumptions and management's best estimate of the full year 2006 earnings at the time based on various assumptions set forth in our press release. We forecast diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.45-$3.70, before special items, for the year. There can be no assurance that sales or earnings will develop in the manner projected. Actual results may differ materially. See "Comments on Forward Looking Statements."  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and changes in the estimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition.  ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES  Accruals for environmental remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation, and other contingent liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are recorded at management's best estimate of the ultimate expected liabilities, without any discount to reflect the time value of money. These accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes available.  The amount accrued for environment remediation reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature and cost of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties.  Included in other contingent liabilities are workers' compensation, product liability and toxic tort claims. The amount accrued for other contingent liabilities reflects our assumptions about the incidence, severity, indemnity costs and dismissal rates for existing and future claims.                                         -33-   Accruals for environmental remediation and other contingent liabilities can change substantially if our assumptions are not realized or due to actions by governmental agencies or private parties. We cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts. Moreover, environmental and other contingent liabilities are paid over an extended period, and the timing of such payments cannot be predicted with any certainty. Accruals for environmental and other contingent liabilities are recorded as other noncurrent liabilities with any amounts expected to be paid out in the next twelve months classified as accrued expenses.  Probable insurance recoveries for past and probable future costs are recorded at management's best estimate of the ultimate expected receipts without discounting to reflect the time value of money and are recorded as other assets. A number of factors impact the estimates of insurance reimbursements. These factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies, the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies, how legal and defense costs will be covered by the insurance policies, the interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships, and historical recovery rates over the past ten years.  Defense and processing costs are expensed as incurred. Probable insurance recoveries for defense and processing costs are accrued when the related costs are incurred and are recorded as other assets.  RETIREMENT PLANS  We sponsor defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans. The postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements. Our most significant pension plans are in the U. S., and constituted over 67% of our consolidated pension assets and 66% of projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2005. The calculation of our pension expense and pension liability associated with our defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that we deem to be "critical accounting estimates." Changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions. We believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets.  At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used for pension liabilities. In estimating this rate, we look to rates of return on high quality, long term corporate bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. We discounted our U.S. future pension liabilities using a rate of 5.6% at December 31, 2005. The discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities has a significant effect on expense.  The expected rate of return on plan assets, which was 7.7% for 2005, reflects the long-term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability. We establish the expected rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to us at that time, including the historical returns of major asset classes, the expected investment mix of the plans' assets, and estimates of future long-term investment returns. The U. S. pension plan's investment mix at December 31, 2005 approximated 67% equities and 33% fixed income securities. Any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss. The unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss is amortized in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions."  IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL  We have defined our segments as our SFAS No. 142 reporting units. Our four business segments are Cytec Performance Chemicals, Cytec Surface Specialties, Cytec Engineered Materials and Building Block Chemicals. Cytec Performance Chemicals and Cytec Surface Specialties are managed under one executive leadership, and are referred to collectively as Cytec Specialty Chemicals. Cytec Performance Chemicals serves large, global industrial markets. Cytec Surface Specialties serves the large, global coatings market. Cytec Engineered Materials serves principally aerospace markets. Building Block Chemicals sells commodity chemical intermediates to industrial users. The segments above reflect how we run our company, manage the assets and the customer perspective.  We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis. Goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. We use a two-step process to test goodwill for impairment. First, the reporting unit's fair value is compared to its carrying value. We utilize a market multiple approach to determine fair value estimates. Due to the cyclical nature of our reporting units, values are determined utilizing a three year average. The three year period is comprised of the prior year, current year and one year projected amounts. If the market multiple approach yields a result, which may indicate a possible impairment, a discounted cash flow approach is utilized to more precisely determine the reporting unit's fair value. If a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired, and the second step of the impairment test would be performed. The second step of the goodwill impairment test is used to measure the amount of the impairment loss. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.                                         -34-   These evaluations involve amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. We are not aware of reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being estimated that would have a material impact on these assessments for impairment.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED  Long-lived assets and intangible assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed annually for impairment. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be charged to earnings. Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell.  INCOME TAXES  Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.  We intend to reinvest the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes with respect to these earnings. In the event of repatriation to the U.S., such earnings would be subject to U.S. income taxes in most cases. Foreign tax credits would be available to substantially reduce the amount of U.S. tax otherwise payable in future years.  Our annual effective tax rate is based on expected income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions.  We establish accruals for tax contingencies when, notwithstanding the reasonable belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, we believes that certain filing positions are likely to be challenged and moreover, that such filing positions may not be fully sustained.  We continually evaluate our tax contingency accruals and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances, including but not limited to emerging case law, tax legislation, rulings by relevant tax authorities, and the progress of ongoing tax audits. Settlement of a given tax contingency could impact the income tax provision in the period of resolution. Our tax contingency accruals are presented in the balance sheet within income taxes payable.  ACQUISITIONS  We account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition. The cost to acquire a business, including transaction costs, is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business in proportion to their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to acquired in-process research and development are expensed at the date of acquisition.  The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. Accordingly, for significant items, we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists.                                         -35-   Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.  All of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our results of operations.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND COMMODITY HEDGING ACTIVITIES  Financial instruments reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are recorded at cost which approximates fair value for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, certain other assets, accounts payable, and certain other liabilities. Fair values are determined through a combination of management estimates and information obtained from third parties using the latest available market data. Long-term debt is carried at amortized cost.  We use derivative instruments in accordance with our established policies to manage exposure to fluctuations in currency rates, certain commodity (e.g., natural gas) prices, interest rates and equity prices. Derivative instruments currently utilized include currency forward contracts and swaps, natural gas forward contracts and swaps, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly-rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties, thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks.  We periodically enter into currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business. The principal transactions hedged involve accounts receivable, accounts payable and intercompany loans. When hedging currency exposures, our practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure, and therefore, the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value, cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction. Currency forward contracts are reported as either assets or liabilities with changes in their fair value recorded in other income (expense), net together with offsetting gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability.  We use cross currency swaps to synthetically convert some of our U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge future cash flows from euro interest and principal receipts on certain euro denominated intercompany receivables we have with our subsidiaries against changes in the US dollar to euro exchange rates. The cross currency swaps are recorded as either assets or liabilities. Changes in fair value include both an interest and an exchange component. The interest component is recorded in other comprehensive income while the exchange component is recorded in other income (expense), net together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged intercompany receivables.  We use natural gas forward contracts, which are physically settled, to hedge certain utility requirements. The maturities of these contracts correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that we pay for the underlying commodity. While these contracts are structured to limit our exposure to increases in commodity prices, they can also limit the potential benefit we might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices. Because we take physical delivery of the commodity, these contracts are not required to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Instead, realized gains and losses are included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of the contract.  We also use natural gas swaps, which are financially settled, to hedge utility requirements at certain of our other facilities. These swaps, which are highly effective at achieving offsetting cash flows of the underlying natural gas purchases, have been designated as cash flow hedges and are reported on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, with offsetting amounts included in unrealized net (losses) gains on cash flow hedges on an after-tax basis. Gains and losses are reclassified into earnings, as a component of manufacturing cost of sales in the period the hedged natural gas purchases affect earnings.                                          -36-       ITEM 8.
