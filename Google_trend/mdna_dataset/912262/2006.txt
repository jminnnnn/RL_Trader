ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                   The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with "Selected Consolidated Financial Data" and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors.   Overview             We are one of the nation's largest publicly traded full-line sporting goods retailers, with a presence in most major markets across the United States. At January 28, 2006, we operated 398 stores in 45 states under three principal brands: Sports Authority, Gart Sports and Sportmart. We also have a licensing agreement with Mega Sports Co. Ltd. We own 19.9% of the common stock of Mega Sports Co. Ltd., which operates stores in Japan under the Sports Authority name.            On August 4, 2003, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gart Sports Company completed a merger with The Sports Authority, Inc., and Gart Sports Company was renamed The Sports Authority, Inc. The references made to the entities herein refer to The Sports Authority, Inc. (formerly Gart Sports Company which includes "Sports Authority" or "Company" or "we" or "our" or "us") and its subsidiaries. "TSA" refers to TSA Stores Inc. (formerly known as The Sports Authority, Inc.). The merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting with Gart Sports Company as the acquirer. Accordingly, the results of operations below for fiscal 2003 include the results of TSA since the date of the merger. The combined company is headquartered in Englewood, Colorado and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "TSA."            In 2005, our major initiatives included the continuation of our store remodeling program and rebranding of our stores to the Sports Authority name, new store openings and continued improvements in our merchandise assortment and supply chain.            We completed a major stage in the rebranding of our Oshman's, Sportmart and Gart Sports stores to the Sports Authority name with approximately 75% of our stores operating under the Sports Authority name as of the end of fiscal 2005. Our goal is to have all stores rebranded to the Sports Authority name by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The rebranding will allow us to increase consumer awareness and drive loyalty to our Sports Authority brand on a national level and allow us to realize advertising cost savings that result from eliminating redundant advertising to support multiple brands in a single market.            We continue to refine our merchandise assortments with higher-end merchandise in our golf, footwear, active sportswear and fitness categories and we are improving the quality of our merchandise assortments in most categories by refining the overall number of SKU's offered and providing a deeper, more focused offering of high quality top brand products that more precisely meet the needs of our targeted customers. We continue to focus on improving our supply chain by reducing both the time it takes to get inventory to the store and the time it takes to get inventory to the sales floor. Our backstock program, which ensures quicker replenishment on specific items, was expanded to include additional inventory items during the year, increasing the benefits of the program. Additionally, we continued to grow our SDQ initiative in which product is pre-ticketed and pre-packed by store by the vendor. These initiatives, as well as strategic sales of aged product, contributed to our reduction in overall inventory levels and long-term debt levels of $58.7 million and $69.2 million, respectively, compared to fiscal 2004.            We completed 56 remodels during fiscal 2005. In addition, we have completed 65 "Golf Day" shops for a total of approximately 130 company-wide and now have our full service "Footwear Statement Walls" in approximately 265 stores company-wide. These Footwear Statement Walls provide a full service environment for higher priced performance footwear and allow us to gain access to premier footwear products from Nike.    24                   During fiscal 2005 we opened 13 new stores, closed 7 stores and relocated four stores. Our comparable store sales for fiscal 2005 increased 1.5%. In fiscal 2005, our comparable store sales were driven by strong performances in fitness equipment, active sportswear and outdoor apparel categories. These gains were partially offset by declines in outdoor hardlines, bike and skate categories.            Given the economic characteristics of our store formats, the similar nature of the products sold, the type of customer and method of distribution, our operations are aggregated in one reportable segment as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."    Proposed Merger             On January 22, 2006, we entered into a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by an investor group led by Green Equity Investors IV, L.P., an affiliate of Leonard Green & Partners, L.P. ("the buyer") and including members of our senior management team for $37.25 per share in cash. The transaction is subject to approval of our stockholders and other customary terms and conditions. A definitive proxy statement will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and a special meeting of our stockholders will be held to vote on the merger. We filed our notice of the merger with the United States Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission on March 8, 2006 and on March 17, 2006, the Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act waiting period.            The merger agreement provides that until the effective time of the merger, we will conduct our business in the ordinary and usual course consistent with past practice, subject to certain conditions and restrictions as set forth in the merger agreement. In addition, we have agreed not to authorize any capital expenditures in excess of $5 million in the aggregate in excess of the capital expenditures provided for in our 2006 budget. The merger agreement contains certain termination rights, and, under certain circumstances, if the merger is not completed, we may be required to pay the buyer a termination fee of $30 million and/or reimburse the buyer for its out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the merger up to $5 million, subject to possible increase. Any termination fee would be net of expenses reimbursed.    Results of Operations             The following table sets forth for the periods indicated, certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales and the number of stores open at the end of each period (dollars rounded to millions):             Fiscal 2005(1)     Fiscal 2004(1)     Fiscal 2003(1)             Dollars     %     Dollars     %     Dollars     %       Net sales     $  2,509.3     100.0  %  $  2,435.9     100.0  %  $  1,760.5     100.0  %    Cost of goods sold, buying, distribution and occupancy        1,802.1     71.8        1,756.9     72.1        1,274.5     72.4                                       Gross profit        707.2     28.2        679.0     27.9        486.0     27.6       Operating expenses        593.8     23.7        579.8     23.8        407.5     23.1       Merger integration costs(2)                     21.8     0.9        43.8     2.5       Pre-opening expenses        2.6     0.1        4.0     0.2        1.9     0.1                                       Operating income        110.8     4.4        73.4     3.0        32.7     1.9       Interest expense        (22.4  )  (0.9  )     (20.1  )  (0.8  )     (12.3  )  (0.7  )    Other income, net        3.1     0.1        1.4     0.1        3.5     0.2                                       Income before income taxes        91.5     3.6        54.8     2.2        24.0     1.4       Income tax expense        (36.1  )  (1.4  )     (21.3  )  (0.9  )     (7.7  )  (0.4  )                                    Net income     $  55.4     2.2  %  $  33.5     1.4  %  $  16.3     0.9  %                                    Number of stores at end of period        398              392              384                 (1) Columns may not add due to rounding.   25          (2) Represents merger integration costs associated with the TSA merger.            We consider cost of goods sold to include the direct cost of merchandise, plus certain costs associated with procurement, warehousing, handling and distribution. In addition to the full cost of inventory, cost of goods sold includes related store occupancy costs and amortization and depreciation of leasehold improvements and rental equipment.            Operating expenses include store and non-store expenses (except occupancy), and depreciation and amortization not included in cost of goods sold.    Fiscal 2005 as compared to Fiscal 2004             Net Sales.     Net sales increased $73.4 million, or 3.0%, to $2,509.3 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $2,435.9 million in fiscal 2004. The increase is attributable primarily to higher comparable store sales and sales from new store openings of $86.1 million, offset by $33.4 million of sales decreases from store closures. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2005 were up 1.5%. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily due to strong performances in the active sportswear, fitness equipment and outdoor apparel categories. These improvements were driven primarily by our ability to consistently maintain in stock positions of high demand products in each of these categories. In aggregate, these categories produced a $61.5 million, or a 2.7% increase, in comparable store sales. Offsetting these gains were declines in the outdoor hardlines, bike and skate categories aggregating $37.1 million, or a 1.6% decrease, in comparable store sales.            Gross Profit.     Gross profit for fiscal 2005 was $707.2 million, or 28.2% of net sales, as compared to $679.0 million, or 27.9% of net sales, for fiscal 2004, or an improvement of 30 basis points. This improvement was due to an increase in gross profit as a result of improved merchandise margins resulting primarily from the reduction of several one-time coupon events and promotional footwear offerings and higher margin merchandise in our active sportswear, footwear and fitness categories. These increases in gross profit were partially offset by higher store occupancy and transportation fuel costs as a percent of sales.             Operating Expenses.     Operating expenses in fiscal 2005 were $593.8 million, or 23.7% of net sales, as compared to $579.8 million, or 23.8% of net sales, for fiscal 2004. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased by 0.1% compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a decrease in insurance costs of 0.3% offset by an increase in overall payroll costs of 0.2%.            Merger Integration Costs.     There were no merger integration costs for fiscal 2005, compared to $21.8 million, or 0.9% of net sales, for fiscal 2004. Integration costs include only non-recurring, incremental costs arising as a direct result of integrating the two companies following the TSA merger. For fiscal 2004, these costs consisted primarily of $10.2 million of severance, recruitment fees and duplicative payroll and benefits, $7.0 million for consulting fees related to integrating the two companies, $2.0 million in relocation and travel expenses, $1.3 million related to closing the operations of the former TSA corporate office and closure of a Gart distribution center, and $1.0 million in advertising expense.            Pre-opening expenses.     Pre-opening expenses in fiscal 2005 were $2.6 million or 0.1% of net sales, as compared to $4.0 million, or 0.2% of net sales for fiscal 2004. Pre-opening expenses in fiscal 2005 were for the addition of 13 new stores and four relocations compared to 22 new stores and two relocations in fiscal 2004.            Operating Income.     As a result of the factors described above, operating income for fiscal 2005 was $110.8 million, or 4.4% of net sales, compared to $73.4 million, or 3.0% of net sales, in fiscal 2004.            Interest Expense.     Interest expense for fiscal 2005 increased to $22.4 million, or 0.9% of net sales, from $20.1 million, or 0.8% of net sales, in the prior year. Higher interest expense is due to an increase in average interest rates offset by decreases in average debt compared to fiscal 2004.    26                   Other Income.     Other income was $3.1 million for fiscal 2005 compared to $1.4 million for fiscal 2004. The increase in other income is primarily related to a $1.0 million gain from the sale of a non-operating property and $0.7 million of other income received from the early payoff by the debtor of a mortgage note receivable that we held.            Income Taxes.     Our income tax expense for fiscal 2005 was $36.1 million compared to $21.3 million in fiscal 2004. Our effective rate was approximately 39.5% for fiscal 2005 compared to approximately 39% for fiscal 2004.    Fiscal 2004 as compared to Fiscal 2003             Net Sales.     Net sales increased $675.4 million, or 38.4%, to $2,435.9 million in fiscal 2004, compared to $1,760.5 million in fiscal 2003. Of the $675.4 million increase, $642.7 million is due to the inclusion of sales from TSA stores acquired in the merger in the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2004 versus results for Gart Sports on a stand-alone basis for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2003. The remaining increase of $32.7 million is attributable primarily to sales from new store openings of $98.2 million, offset by $37.5 million of sales decreases from store closures and lower comparable store sales. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2004 were down 2.0%. However, we had positive performance in the outdoor apparel and ski categories primarily due to our expansion of winter sports products into certain TSA markets. In aggregate, these categories produced a $30.6 million, or a 1.3% increase, in comparable store sales. Additionally, we have experienced strong sales trends in our remodeled TSA stores. Offsetting these gains were declines in the fitness, team sports, outdoor and skate categories aggregating $52.1 million, or a 2.2% decrease, in comparable store sales. During the second fiscal quarter of 2004 we reassigned responsibilities within the merchandising group, which resulted in some short-term disruption in placement and allocation of product orders, which negatively impacted the sales in several categories. In the third fiscal quarter of 2004, we experienced a decline in comparable store sales partially as a result of the hurricanes that impacted the southeastern United States.            Gross Profit.     Gross profit for fiscal 2004 was $679.0 million, or 27.9% of net sales, as compared to $486.0 million, or 27.6% of net sales, for fiscal 2003, or an improvement of 30 basis points. This improvement was due to an increase in gross profit of 117 basis points as a result of improved merchandise margins resulting primarily from lower inventory costs due to the increased buying power of the combined company and improved shrink performance. The application of EITF 02-16 produced an increase in gross profit of $4.4 million, or 15 basis points, for vendor entitlements recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold which would historically have been treated as a reduction of advertising expense. These increases in gross profit were partially offset by higher store occupancy and distribution center costs as a percent of sales.             Operating Expenses.     Operating expenses in fiscal 2004 were $579.8 million, or 23.8% of net sales, as compared to $407.5 million, or 23.1% of net sales, for fiscal 2003. These increases are primarily due to the operating costs associated with the acquired TSA stores and as a result of the application of EITF 02-16 which resulted in the additional recharacterization of $4.2 million, or 0.2% of net sales, in vendor entitlements from a reduction of advertising expense to a reduction of cost of inventory purchased in 2004. Additionally, operating expenses increased as a percentage of sales due to the decrease in comparable store sales.             Merger Integration Costs.     Merger integration costs for fiscal 2004 were $21.8 million, or 0.9% of net sales, compared to $43.8 million, or 2.5% of net sales, for fiscal 2003. Integration costs include only non-recurring, incremental costs arising as a direct result of integrating the two companies following the TSA merger. For fiscal 2004, these costs consisted primarily of $10.2 million of severance, recruitment fees and duplicative payroll and benefits, $7.0 million for consulting fees related to integrating the two companies, $2.0 million in relocation and travel expenses, $1.3 million related to closing the operations of the former TSA corporate office and closure of a Gart distribution center, and $1.0 million in advertising expense related to rebranding. For fiscal 2003, these costs consisted of $17.7 million of    27           duplicative payroll, benefits and retention payments, $8.4 million of severance costs, $6.7 million of consulting fees, $6.0 million of expense related to closing the operations of the former TSA corporate office in Ft. Lauderdale and closing a Gart store in an overlapping market, $3.0 million for relocation and travel, and $2.0 million of advertising.             Pre-opening expenses.     Pre-opening expenses in fiscal 2004 were $4.0 million or 0.2% of net sales, as compared to $1.9 million, or 0.1% of net sales for fiscal 2003. Pre-opening expenses in fiscal 2004 were for the addition of 22 new stores and two relocations compared to 14 new stores and three relocations in fiscal 2003.            Operating Income.     As a result of the factors described above, operating income for fiscal 2004 was $73.4 million, or 3.0% of net sales, compared to $32.7 million, or 1.9% of net sales, in fiscal 2003.            Interest Expense.     Interest expense for fiscal 2004 increased to $20.1 million, or 0.8% of net sales, from $12.3 million, or 0.7% of net sales, in the prior year. The increase in interest expense is primarily related to increased debt levels due to the assumption of TSA debt upon completion of the merger, funding of merger and integration costs, and financing increased inventory levels due to the replacement of TSA inventory identified as clearance and non-go-forward at the time of the merger, negative comparable store sales, and our investment in the remodeling of acquired TSA stores. We also paid interest at higher rates in fiscal 2004 versus the prior year as a result of higher 90-day LIBOR rates.            Other Income.     Other income was $1.4 million for fiscal 2004 compared to $3.5 million for fiscal 2003. The prior year included $1.9 million in interest income associated with the settlement of a tax dispute involving Gart's former parent.            Income Taxes.     Our income tax expense for fiscal 2004 was $21.3 million compared to $7.7 million in fiscal 2003. The prior year included a tax benefit of $1.7 million related to the settlement of the tax dispute discussed above. This one-time benefit had the effect of reducing the effective tax rate, which would otherwise have been approximately 39%, compared to approximately 39% for fiscal 2004.    Liquidity and Capital Resources             Our primary capital requirements are for inventory and other seasonal working capital needs, capital improvements, including investments in store remodeling, store fixtures and ongoing infrastructure improvements, and pre-opening expenses to support our expansion plans.    NAME="dg1261_cash_flow_analysis">      Cash Flow Analysis                 The following table presents changes in cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented:             Fiscal  2005     Fiscal  2004     Fiscal  2003             (dollars in thousands, except ratios)         Cash provided by operating activities     $  165,589     $  81,902     $  54,835       Cash used in investing activities        (101,597  )     (78,138  )     (113,841  )    Cash provided by (used in) financing activities        (63,535  )     (6,935  )     76,859        Capital expenditures     $   107,643     $   111,502     $   76,498       Long-term debt (at end of period)        236,138        305,383        317,321       Working capital (at end of period)        348,710        355,518        378,909        Long-term debt to equity ratio (at end of period)         0.43         0.63         0.73                  Cash provided by operating activities increased $83.7 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash expenditures for deferred taxes and depreciation and amortization, totaling $43.9 million, as well as a reduction of    28           inventory net of payables of $30.0 million. Cash provided by operating activities increased $27.1 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. Net income adjusted for deferred taxes and depreciation and amortization increased by $49.5 million which was offset by an increase in cash used for inventories net of accounts payable of $34.3 million. Additionally, the change in accounts receivable during fiscal 2004 resulted in a $11.5 million increase in operating cash flows compared to fiscal 2003.            Cash used in investing activities increased $23.5 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 as cash received from the sale of property was $27.9 million lower in fiscal 2005. Total net capital expenditures in 2005 including a change in accrued property and equipment of $4.1 million and a $21.7 million inflow of tenant improvement allowances from landlords classified as operating cash flows is $90.0 million. This $90.0 million of net capital expenditures was used to fund various capital improvements, including: $45.7 million for store remodels, new fixtures and miscellaneous store improvements; $13.2 million for thirteen new store openings and four relocations; $15.3 million for upgrades at our distribution centers and information systems; and $4.5 million for rebranding signage. In fiscal 2004, cash used in investing activities decreased $35.7 million. This decrease in cash outflows is primarily due to an increase in cash received from the sale of property and equipment and mortgage notes of $27.8 million and the absence of any direct TSA merger costs which totaled $42.8 million in fiscal 2003, offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $35.0 million in fiscal 2004.            Cash used in financing activities, which consists principally of net borrowings or payments under our revolving credit facility, increased $56.6 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. This increase reflects net paydowns to reduce our long-term debt by $69.2 million in fiscal 2005 compared to net paydowns of $11.9 million in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2004, cash used in financing activities increased $83.8 million. This increase in cash outflows reflects net paydown of $11.9 million in fiscal 2004 compared to net borrowings of $73.2 million in fiscal 2003.            Our liquidity and capital needs have principally been met by operating cash flows and by borrowings under a revolving credit facility with CIT/Business Credit, Inc. ("CIT"), as agent. Under our revolving credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") the Company may borrow up to $600 million, generally limited to an amount equal to 70% of eligible inventory or 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory (as defined in the agreement), but with seasonal increases in the advance rate permitted. On September 15, 2004, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Financing Agreement with CIT that modified the terms of the Credit Agreement by providing for an additional $40 million term loan and extending the maturity date of our existing revolving credit line to August 4, 2008. The term loan was drawn in full on September 15, 2004. The Company paid one-time fees of approximately $1.2 million in fiscal 2004 to secure the Amended and Restated Financing Agreement, and is amortizing that amount over the life of the agreement on the effective interest method. Borrowings are secured by substantially all present and future accounts (as defined in the Amended and Restated Financing Agreement), equipment, inventory, the common stock of its subsidiaries, documents of title and intangible assets.            On April 11, 2005, the Company entered into Amendment One to the Amended and Restated Financing Agreement. This amendment extends the maturity date of the revolving credit line to August 4, 2009 and modifies the method of calculating the margin spread above the applicable interest rates available to us. The pricing grids for both the term loan and the revolving credit line in the loan agreement were also modified to allow us to earn a lower spread if certain financial targets are achieved which is more favorable than the spread in the Amended and Restated Financing Agreement. The Company paid one-time fees of approximately $0.4 million to secure Amendment One to the Amended and Restated Financing Agreement. At January 28, 2006, borrowings under the credit agreement were $230.3 million and $226.5 million was available for borrowing. On February 17, 2006, we paid off the outstanding balance of our term loan. In accordance with the Credit Agreement our maximum availability on our revolving credit facility increased from $600 million to $640 million at the time the term loan was paid off.    29        NAME="page_di1261_1_30">                 Loan interest is payable monthly at Chase Manhattan Bank's prime rate plus a margin rate or, at the option of the Company, at Chase Manhattan Bank's LIBOR rate plus a margin rate. The applicable margin rates during the relevant time periods vary based on the Company's EBITDA levels and are summarized in the table below:             Revolving Credit Line     Term Loan          Prime RateMargin  Rate     LIBORMargin  Rate     Prime RateMargin  Rate     LIBORMargin  Rate    August 4, 2003 Financing Agreement     0%-0.50%     1.50%-2.50%     N/A     N/A    September 15, 2004 Amended and Restated Financing Agreement     0%-0.50%     1.50%-2.50%     3.25%     5.50%-6.00%    April 11, 2005 Amendment No. 1 to Amended and Restated Financing Agreement     0%     1.25%-2.00%     1.50%-2.25%     3.00%-4.00%               Capital expenditures, net of tenant improvement allowances, are projected to be approximately $70 to $75 million in fiscal 2006, primarily for the opening of new or relocating stores, store remodels, miscellaneous store improvements, rebranding signage, and information system upgrades and enhancements.            We believe that cash generated from operations, combined with funds available under the revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to fund projected capital expenditures, future common share purchases, if any, and other working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months as well as the foreseeable future. We intend to utilize the revolving credit facility to meet seasonal fluctuations in cash flow requirements.    Contractual obligations and commercial commitments             The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments in effect at January 28, 2006:             Payments due by period          Total     Within  1 year     2-3  years     4-5  years     After  5 years          (in thousands)      Contractual obligations:                                                    Long-term debt and note payable(1)     $  288,770     $  15,013     $  68,532     $  197,387     $  7,838       Capital lease obligations(2)        606        367        239                       Operating leases, net(3)        1,904,550        217,629        423,834        383,195        879,892                             Total contractual cash obligations     $  2,193,926     $  233,009     $  492,605     $  580,582     $  887,730                               30                   Amount of commitment expiration per period          Total     Within  1 year     2-3  years     4-5  years     After  5 years          (in thousands)      Other commercial commitments:                                                    Purchase commitments     $  5,535     $  5,535     $       $       $         Standby letters of credit        14,028        14,028                                                     Total commercial commitments(4)     $  19,563     $  19,563     $       $       $                                   (1) Amounts include estimated contractual interest payments using interest rates as of January 28, 2006. (2) Capital lease obligations include interest of $0.1 million. (3) These amounts include future minimum rent payments, net of $19.3 million of non-cancelable sublease payments, and exclude the associated operating costs of our operating leases. In addition to minimum rent payments, our leases typically provide for the payment of associated operating costs, primarily common area maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes. For the year ended January 28, 2006, these associated operating costs for our leases were approximately $58.4 million. (4) We have routine commitments under merchandise inventory purchase orders, which vary in amount from month to month depending on seasonality and other factors. Such purchase orders are cancelable by us without payment. In addition, we have entered into employment agreements with certain employees, primarily those at the vice president level and above. Payments under these employment agreements are dependent on these employees providing future services and certain payments are required to be made upon termination of employment by us without cause, as defined in the employment agreements. These items have not been included in the amounts in the above table.            Off balance sheet arrangements.     We have noncancelable operating leases primarily for stores, distribution facilities, and our corporate offices. Future obligations under these leases are shown in the contractual obligations table above.     Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management             We entered into an interest rate swap agreement on June 23, 2004 for a notional amount of $75 million, beginning July 7, 2004, and expiring on June 30, 2007, to minimize the risks and costs associated with our financing activities in general and to minimize its exposure to variable cash flows in particular. On April 8, 2005, we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement effective June 1, 2005 and expiring May 31, 2010 with a notional amount of $50 million. Under the swap agreements, we pay fixed rate interest and receive variable LIBOR interest rate payments periodically over the life of the agreement. The total notional interest rate swap amount is $125 million, which is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the exposure due to credit loss.            Our interest rate swaps are each designated as a cash flow hedge and are considered highly effective, as defined by FASB Statement No. 133. There is no charge to earnings for changes in the fair value of the swap agreements. Cash settlements on the swap agreements are recorded as interest expense. At January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, the fair value of the swaps were a gain of $937,000 and a loss of $250,000, respectively, net of the related income tax effects. The unrealized gain and loss from these interest rate swaps are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and are shown as a component of stockholders' equity.            Our exposure to foreign currency risk is not material.    31           Seasonality and Inflation             The following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in fiscal 2005 and 2004. This information is unaudited, but is prepared on the same basis as the annual financial information and, in the opinion of management, reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented. The results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.             Fiscal 2005             First  Quarter     Second  Quarter     Third  Quarter     Fourth  Quarter             (dollars in millions)         Net sales     $  591.2     $  617.0     $  560.0     $  741.1       % of full year net sales        23.6  %     24.6  %     22.3  %     29.5  %    Operating income     $  18.0     $  28.6     $  10.8     $  53.4                         Fiscal 2004             First  Quarter     Second  Quarter     Third  Quarter     Fourth  Quarter             (dollars in millions)         Net sales     $  572.0     $  605.0     $  545.0     $  713.8       % of full year net sales        23.5  %     24.8  %     22.4  %     29.3  %    Operating income     $  10.6     $  15.5     $  0.7     $  46.6                  The fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter. We believe that two primary factors contribute to this seasonality: first, sales of cold weather sporting goods and ski and snowboard merchandise during the fourth quarter are generally strong in anticipation of the ski and snowboard season; and second, holiday sales contribute significantly to our operating results. As a result of these factors, inventory levels, which gradually increase beginning in April, generally reach their peak in November and then decline to their lowest level following the December holiday season. Any decrease in sales for the fourth quarter, whether due to a slow holiday selling season, poor snowfall in ski areas near our markets or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year.            Although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions, we do not believe that inflation has a material impact on our results of operations. We believe that we are generally able to pass along inflationary increases in costs to our customers.    Critical Accounting Policies             Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to inventory valuation, vendor allowances, the recoverability of long-lived assets including intangible assets, store closing reserves, income taxes, self insured reserves and the estimates used to apply the purchase method of accounting to our mergers and acquisitions. Management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. See    32           Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our significant accounting policies.    Valuation of Inventory             We value our inventory at the lower of last-in, first-out ("LIFO") cost or market. Cost is determined using the average cost of items purchased and applying the dollar value LIFO inventory method. Our dollar value LIFO pools are computed using the Inventory Price Index Computation ("IPIC") method. LIFO cost of our inventories is then compared to estimated market value. This assessment of estimated market value is based on the quality and age of merchandise, the rate of sale of merchandise, the quantities on hand, and our assessment of the market conditions. Estimates and judgments are required in the determination of the market value of our inventory and future events, such as changes in customer merchandise preferences or unseasonable weather patterns, could impact the market value of our inventory.            Inventory shrinkage is accrued as a percentage of merchandise sales based on historical inventory shrinkage trends. We perform physical inventories at stores and distribution centers throughout the year. The reserve for inventory shrinkage represents an estimate for inventory shrinkage for each location since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date. These estimates are impacted by internal and external factors and may vary from actual results.    Vendor Allowances             We receive certain allowances from our vendors, which include rebates, discounts and cooperative advertising funds. These amounts are negotiated with vendors typically on an annual basis and are, at times, dependent on projected purchase volumes and advertising plans. The amounts are subject to changes in market conditions or marketing strategies of our vendors, and changes in our product purchases. We record an estimate of earned allowances based on the latest information available with respect to purchase volumes, advertising plans and status of our negotiation with vendors.    Impairment of Assets             We review long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets are impaired.    Store Closing Reserves             Prior to December 31, 2002 and the adoption of SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS No. 146"), we recorded a provision for store closing costs when the decision was made by management to close a store. In accordance with SFAS No. 146, for store closing activities initiated after December 31, 2002, the related liability is recorded at fair value when a liability is incurred rather than when the decision to close a store is made. This will change the timing of recognition for certain exit costs, so that certain exit costs will be recognized over the period in which the exit activities occur. We also record store exit reserves arising from our various mergers and acquisitions pursuant to SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and EITF Issue No. 95-3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination" ("EITF 95-3"). Under EITF 95-3, the costs of a plan to exit an activity of the acquired company are recognized as    33           liabilities assumed in the business combination. As such, reserves are recorded in purchase accounting for the net present value of projected costs to be incurred after the store closing date. The costs incurred in connection with store closings primarily consist of post-closing future net lease obligations, utilities, property taxes, and employee costs directly related to the store closing.    Deferred Taxes             Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability based on projections of future operating results, which dictate our ability to realize the tax assets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets when this amount exceeds the amount more likely than not to be realized. As of January 28, 2006, we had no valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.            We file our tax returns based on our best understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations. However, complexities in the rules and our operations, as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required. We generally maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority, available review periods expire, or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has been evaluating the accounting for uncertain tax positions and is likely to issue guidance during 2006 for all companies to follow. We believe our current processes are consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.    Self-Insured Reserves             We are self-insured for our workers' compensation, general liability and employee medical plans up to a self-insured retention amount. We record a reserve for the estimated cost of both reported and incurred but not reported ("IBNR") claims. The estimate of our current claim obligation requires significant judgment and is based on specific loss estimates for reported claims, and on loss triangulation estimates of future claims payments, including IBNR claims. Reserves are regularly evaluated for adequacy based on the most current available information, including historical claims experience and expected future claims costs.    Acquisitions and Mergers Accounting             Our acquisitions and mergers are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the total costs of such transactions are allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. The determination of fair values involves the use of estimates and assumptions, which are subject to adjustment in the future. While we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate, and will not require adjustment in future periods.    Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements             In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4" ("SFAS 151"). SFAS 151 clarifies that inventory costs that are "abnormal" are required to be charged to expense as incurred as opposed to being capitalized into inventory as a product cost. SFAS 151 provides examples of "abnormal" costs to include costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage).    34           SFAS 151 is effective for the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. Upon adoption of SFAS 151, there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements.            In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),  Share-Based Payment,  ("SFAS 123(R)"). This Statement requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments issued to employees. Currently, companies are required to calculate the estimated fair value of these share-based payments and can elect to either include the estimated cost in earnings or disclose the pro forma effect in the footnotes to their consolidated financial statements. We have chosen to disclose the pro forma effect in our consolidated financial statements. The fair value concepts were not changed significantly in SFAS 123(R); however, in adopting this Standard, companies must choose among alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions. On April 14, 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced a deferral of the effective date of SFAS 123(R). SFAS 123(R) is effective for the first fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005, which for us is fiscal 2006, a 53 week year beginning January 29, 2006. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 using the modified prospective method. Under the modified prospective method, we will record compensation expense for the fair value of equity awards issued after January 28, 2006 on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. We will also record compensation expense over the remaining service periods for previously-issued, unvested stock options that are outstanding as of January 28, 2006. We will continue to utilize the Black Scholes model in calculating estimated fair value of stock options. The complete impact of the adoption of SFAS 123(R) on future grants cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the future, as well as the assumptions and the fair value model used to value them, and the market value of our common stock. For grants made prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the impact of expensing unvested stock options that previously had no expense associated with them under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and related Interpretations is currently estimated to be approximately $0.03 per diluted share in fiscal 2006.            In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 47,  Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations . FIN 47 clarifies the term "conditional" as used in SFAS 143,  Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations . This interpretation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity even if the timing and/or settlement is conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of an entity. Accordingly, the entity must record a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. We adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the impact is immaterial to our financial statements.            In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Correctionsa replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3" ("SFAS 154"). This Statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20, "Accounting Changes" and FASB Statement No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements," and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. It requires retrospective application to prior-period financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. Although we have no current application for this statement, the adoption of this statement may impact our future results of operations, financial position or cash flows.            Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 05-6, "Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased after Lease Inception or Acquired in a Business Combination," ("EITF 05-6") provides guidance on amortization of leasehold improvements purchased subsequent to the inception of the lease or acquired in a business combination. EITF 05-6 states that leasehold    35           improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of the assets' purchase. EITF 05-6 became effective for the Company in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.             In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 13-1, "Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period." This FSP requires rental costs for ground or building operating leases incurred during the construction period be recognized as rental expense. The guidance permits either retroactive or prospective treatment for periods beginning after December 15, 2005. We will prospectively change our policy from capitalization to expensing beginning in fiscal 2006. Due to uncertainties about store opening dates, construction and merchandising periods prior to store openings and other activities that could delay or accelerate a store opening it is difficult to determine the precise impact the adoption of this pronouncement will have on the Company's operating results. Currently, the Company estimates the increase in pre-opening costs in fiscal 2006 due to the adoption of FAS 13-1 will decrease net income by approximately $0.05 to $0.06 per share.    NAME="di1261_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02669">      ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk                 Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from our long-term debt agreement. Our long-term debt bears interest at variable rates that are tied to either the U.S. prime rate or LIBOR at the time of the borrowing. We maintain portions of our debt in LIBOR traunches that mature in one to six months. As those traunches mature, the interest rates on our outstanding borrowings are changed to reflect current prime or LIBOR rates. Therefore, our interest expense changes as the prime or LIBOR market rates change. We have entered into two interest rate swap instruments, designated as cash flow hedges, as shown in the following table:       Date Entered Into       Rate paid     Rate received     Notional amount     Fair value  at 01/28/06    June 23, 2004     3.76  %  3-mo. US Libor     $  75,000,000     $  1,161,103    April 8, 2005     4.65  %  3-mo. US Libor     $  50,000,000     $  362,559               Based on our overall interest rate exposure at January 28, 2006, a hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in interest rates applied to borrowings under our revolving credit facility would change our after-tax earnings by approximately $1.4 million over a 12-month period prior to considering the effects of our interest rate swaps.            Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates is limited because we do not operate any stores outside of the United States. We do not consider the market risk exposure relating to foreign currency exchange to be material. Foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on us during the quarter or year-to-date periods in fiscal 2005, 2004 or 2003.    36        NAME="page_dk1261_1_37">        NAME="dk1261_item_8._financial_statements_and_supplementary_data">      ITEM 8.
