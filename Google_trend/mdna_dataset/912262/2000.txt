Business and Properties  General    Gart Sports Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company" or "Gart Sports") is one of the leading sporting goods retailers in the midwest and western United States and the leading full-line sporting goods retailer in the Rocky Mountain region. The Company's business strategy is to provide its customers with an extensive selection of high quality, brand name merchandise at competitive prices with quality customer service. The Company operated 127 sporting goods stores in 16 states as of January 29, 2000, the end of its 1999 fiscal year. The Company's executive offices are located at 1001 Lincoln Avenue, Denver, Colorado 80203, and its telephone number is (303) 861-1122. The Company's web site, which is not part of this Annual Report, is http://www.gartsports.com.    The Company acquired Sportmart, Inc. ("Sportmart") on January 9, 1998 in a transaction involving the issuance of 2,180,656 shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.01 (the "Common Stock"), in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of Sportmart. At the time of the Sportmart acquisition, Sportmart operated 59 stores in the midwest and western United States, none of which overlapped in markets served by Gart Sports stores. With the Sportmart acquisition, the Company became the second largest, publicly traded, full-line sporting goods retailer in the United States.    Founded in 1928, the Company operates under the Gart Sports and Sportmart names in California, Colorado, Illinois, Utah, Washington, Idaho, Minnesota, Wyoming, Ohio, Oregon, Wisconsin, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Indiana and Iowa. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1993 and operates through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Gart Bros. Sporting Goods Company ("Gart Bros.") and Sportmart.  Industry Overview    The retail sporting goods industry is comprised of five principal categories of retailers: (i) large format sporting goods stores, which typically range from 30,000 to 100,000 square feet in size and emphasize high sales volumes and a large number of SKUs, (ii) traditional sporting goods stores, which typically range in size from 5,000 to 20,000 square feet and carry a more limited assortment of merchandise, (iii) specialty sporting goods stores, consisting of specialty stores and pro shops, generally specializing in one product category of sporting goods, (iv) mass merchandisers, including discount retailers, warehouse clubs and department stores, which although generally price competitive, have limited customer service and a more limited selection, and (v) internet based retailers, consisting of on-line internet retailers who are relatively new to the industry and sell a full line of products via the internet.    The sporting goods industry in the United States is characterized by fragmented competition, limited assortments from traditional sporting goods retailers, customer preference for one-stop shopping convenience and the growing importance of delivering value to the customer through selection, service and price. The Company believes that these characteristics of the sporting goods industry make the Company's superstore format particularly well suited to grow and increase the Company's market share relative to traditional sporting goods stores, specialty sporting goods retailers, mass merchandisers, other large format sporting goods retailers, and internet based retailers.  Business Strategy    The Company's business strategy is to provide its customers with an extensive selection of high quality, brand name merchandise at competitive prices with a high level of customer service. The key elements of the Company's business strategy are the following:      Broad Assortment of Quality, Brand Name Products. The Company offers a   wide selection of high-quality, brand name apparel and equipment at   competitive prices designed to appeal to both the casual                                         1     sporting goods customer and sports enthusiast for their complete sporting   goods needs. The Company carries over 100,000 active SKUs, including   popular brands such as Adidas, Coleman, Columbia, Easton, FootJoy, K2, New   Balance, Nike, Rawlings, Reebok, Rollerblade, Rossignol, Russell, Salomon,   Spalding, Speedo and Wilson. The Company's customer service, expert   technicians and specialty store presentation enable it to purchase directly   from manufacturers the full product lines typically available only in   specialty stores and pro shops, such as Armour, Callaway, Cleveland, Cobra,   Taylor Made, and Titleist golf accessories, Diamondback bikes, The North   Face apparel and accessories and Volkl and Volant ski equipment.      Customer Service. The Company's objective is to provide the quality of   customer service generally associated with specialty sporting goods stores   and pro shops. The Company has committed increased resources to its   customer service program in an effort to achieve these high standards. The   newly created Director of Customer Service position will focus on several   initiatives that will increase the customer service level in our stores.   These initiatives include improved associate training, labor scheduling,   and incentive programs designed to heighten associate awareness of customer   service and improve our ability to address customer needs. The Company will   increase its use of an independent professional shopping service to monitor   the stores' compliance with these initiatives and all customer service   procedures. In addition, the Company offers its customers special services   including special order capability, equipment rental, on site repair   centers, discount ski lift tickets, and hunting and fishing licenses. The   Company strives to provide the highest level of technical support.      Attractive Shopping Environment. The Company seeks to offer a uniquely   attractive shopping environment that showcases the breadth of the Company's   product offerings and reinforces the Company's distinctive brand image. The   Company's brightly lit stores are designed to project a clean, upscale   atmosphere, with a user-friendly layout featuring wide aisles, well-   organized merchandise displays and clearly defined departments arranged in   a logical and convenient floor plan.      Customized Merchandise Mix. The Company tailors its product mix to local   demographics and lifestyles based on the Company's experience and market   research. Purchasing decisions are made on a regional, and sometimes a   store by store, basis and store operations work directly with the Company's   buyers to revise the product mix in each store. Various factors typically   influence the product mix in a particular market, such as disposable   income, professional and amateur sports activities, specific regional and   seasonal activities, and recreational licenses.      Promotional Advertising and Marketing. The Company uses a promotional   pricing and advertising strategy focused on the creation of "events" to   drive traffic and sales in its stores. Each event is based upon either a   key shopping period such as the winter holidays, Father's Day and Back-to-   School or a specific sales or promotional event, including the annual   Sniagrab ("bargains" spelled backwards) sale, which the Company believes is   the largest pre-season ski and snowboard sale in the United States. The   Company's strategy of clustering stores in major markets enables it to   employ an aggressive advertising strategy on a cost-effective basis,   utilizing newspaper, radio and television.      Internet Based Commerce. Although the Company does not currently sell   products on the internet, it continues to review various opportunities.  Merchandising    The Company offers its customers over 100,000 active SKUs of high quality brand name merchandise in over 100 categories of sporting goods and apparel. The Company provides an assortment of products typically found only in a large format sporting goods store with the presentation and service typical of specialty stores and pro shops. As a result of its customer service emphasis, expert technicians and specialty store presentation, the Company has direct vendor access to full lines of top name brands.                                         2     The Company believes that the quality and breadth of its winter sports merchandise has contributed to its strong reputation in the Rocky Mountain region compared to other large format competitors with less experience marketing winter sporting goods. In addition, the Company believes that its ability to manage the complex inventory requirements of the winter product line, which is characterized by a short selling season and peak selling periods at the beginning and end of the selling season, gives it an important competitive advantage. Hardlines increased as a percentage of sales in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998 due to a better assortment of products as a result of improved assortment management and buying disciplines.    The following table sets forth the percentage of total net sales for each major product category for each of the Company's last three fiscal years:                                                            Fiscal Years                                              -----------------------------------                                                 1999        1998       1997(1)                                              ----------- ----------- -----------                                              (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited)             Hardlines................................     50.3%       47.9%       49.4%    Softlines:      Apparel................................     25.2        26.0        30.4      Footwear...............................     24.5        26.1        20.2                                                 -----       -----       -----        Subtotal.............................     49.7        52.1        50.6                                                 -----       -----       -----        Total................................    100.0%      100.0%      100.0%                                                 =====       =====       =====  - -------- (1) Historical Gart Sports only balances.

Based on more than 70 years of experience in the sporting goods retail industry, the Company has developed a superstore prototype designed to feature the quality and variety of brand                                         5   name merchandise, the breadth of product selection and the high levels of customer service that are the foundation of the Company's strong reputation. The Company typically penetrates larger, multiple store markets primarily with a 40,000 square foot superstore and smaller single-store markets with a 33,000 square foot superstore. The Company has determined that the superstore format provides the best opportunity for growth.    The Company's superstores average approximately 40,000 square feet in size. Each store is designed to provide ample space for customers to shop the extensive depth of product. Generally, 80% of store space is dedicated to selling while 20% is used for office and non-retail functions. The Company plans to do various levels of remodeling in 29 stores during fiscal 2000. In certain stores, the Company plans to improve the shopping environment with clearer sight lines, more appealing flooring and color schemes and improved visual design. In some instances, department size and adjacencies will be tailored to regional and seasonal needs to improve the stores' shopability.    The prototype superstore layout features a racetrack configuration with apparel and specialty brand shops in the middle of the store and the specialty hardlines departments along the outside of the racetrack. The lighting, flooring and color scheme is designed to enhance the presentation of the merchandise and avoid a warehouse-type atmosphere. In addition, many of the Company's stores feature specialized brand shops for vendors such as Nike, Columbia, and Adidas, which offer a broad array of vendor-specific products in specialized, image-enhancing fixtures. The visibility of the branded apparel and the feature shops emphasize the quality image and brand assortment of the Company's stores.    Specialty departments are located adjacent to other related departments and apparel assortments to increase customer convenience and to stimulate cross- purchasing. The specialty departments display merchandise on low racking to allow customers easy access to products and to promote storewide visibility and easy department identification. The specialty departments use the walls effectively to display merchandise in order to convey the depth and breadth of product selection. Department layouts are adjusted periodically to make room for seasonal products.    The Company is in the process of rolling out an exciting new fixturing program that will affect virtually every superstore in the chain. It will utilize a set of apparel fixtures, accessories, signage and graphics that will clearly define these categories and sub-categories to create a more customer friendly environment. The Company is currently negotiating with apparel vendors to use these same fixtures in developing vendor shop areas. This coordinated effort will produce a completely integrated, flexible apparel fixture program.    The Company's 18 non-superstore freestanding and strip center stores more closely resemble traditional sporting goods stores and range in size from 9,000 to 31,000 square feet. The Company's 14 stores in enclosed shopping malls average 14,000 square feet and carry a selection of merchandise that appeals to the mall-oriented shopper, focusing on apparel and footwear. Three of the mall locations are mall anchors. The Company's five resort stores range in size from 14,000 to 27,000 square feet and provide a broader merchandise selection and lower prices than typically available in resort areas, while offering a high level of customer service.  Operations and Training    Typically, the Company's superstores have 55 to 80 sales associates and technicians, while its non-superstores employ a staff of approximately 20 to 25. Additional seasonal support is hired during Father's day, Back-to-School, Thanksgiving, Christmas and for the annual Sniagrab pre-season ski sale.    The Company employs a Store Manager, a Sales Manager and Merchandise Manager in each store. The Store Manager reports to a District Manager who is responsible for a number of stores within a limited geographic region. There are currently 17 District Managers who report to two Regional Vice Presidents. Each region has two Merchandise Apparel Managers responsible for implementing the visual layouts of the apparel and footwear areas.                                         6     The Company has hired two regional trainers to train and educate its associates in the serviceable areas such as ski, golf, tennis, and home fitness. The goal of the Company is to improve the customer shopping experience in our stores by providing better customer service.    The Company's new Store Managers are either promoted internally or hired as trainees. The Company places significant emphasis on training store-level management. Training new Store Managers is a two-step process which involves participation in a formalized training program covering, among other topics, time management, staff selection, scheduling, employee training, customer service and retail selling skills. The management trainee then becomes a manager in training in one of the Company's stores. Upon completion of this program, management is eligible to be promoted to the position of Store, Sales or Merchandise Manager.    The Company's stores are typically open seven days a week, from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday; and 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on Sunday. Hours are adjusted for individual markets as necessary.  Site Selection and Location    In choosing appropriate markets, the Company considers the demographic and lifestyle characteristics of a market, including, among other factors, the following: levels of disposable income; local population and buying patterns; enthusiasm for outdoor recreation; popularity of collegiate and professional sports teams; and level of affinity for regional sports activities.    The following table sets forth the location, by state, of the Company's stores, as of January 29, 2000:                                                                       Total Number    State                    Superstores Resort Stores Other Stores  of Stores    -----                    ----------- ------------- ------------ ------------               California..............      30           --           --           30    Colorado................      11            3           14           28    Illinois................      15           --           --           15    Utah....................       4            1            9           14    Washington..............       9           --           --            9    Idaho...................       1           --            6            7    Minnesota...............       5           --           --            5    Wyoming.................      --            1            3            4    Ohio....................       3           --           --            3    Oregon..................       3           --           --            3    Wisconsin...............       2           --           --            2    Montana.................       2           --           --            2    New Mexico..............       2           --           --            2    Nevada..................       1           --           --            1    Indiana.................       1           --           --            1    Iowa....................       1           --           --            1                                 ---          ---          ---          ---      Total.................      90            5           32          127                                 ===          ===          ===          ===     The Company plans to open new stores primarily in existing markets to further leverage the Company's fixed cost structure, advertising program and distribution system. The Company intends to open one to three additional stores in fiscal 2000.  Management Information Systems    Over the last five years the Company has installed sophisticated management information systems which use JDA, E-3 Replenishment, and Arthur Planning retail software operating on an IBM AS/400 platform. The Company utilizes IBM 4680 and 4690 point-of-sale systems that incorporate scanning, price look-up, zone pricing support, and store level access to the Company's merchandise information system. The Company's fully                                         7   integrated management information systems track purchasing, sales and inventory transfers down to the SKU level and have allowed the Company to improve overall inventory management by identifying individual SKU activity and projecting trends and replenishment needs on a timely basis. These systems have enabled the Company to increase margins by reducing inventory investment, strengthening in-stock positions, reducing the Company's historical shrinkage levels, and creating store level perpetual inventories and automatic inventory replenishment on basic items of merchandise. The Company has implemented a state-of-the-art data warehouse application that allows its merchandising staff to analyze product and pricing strategies, its operations staff to optimize its investments in store labor, and its executive staff to monitor all of the key business performance indicators on a daily basis. The Company has implemented Radio Frequency (RF) Scanning for all of its stores and is continuing to roll out this technology to its distribution centers this year. This technology allows the Company to streamline its merchandise handling and inventory management. RF technology, along with expansion of the Company's EDI initiatives, will result in lower overall cost of inventory ownership and improved accuracy in merchandise requirements forecasting.  Other information technology placed into production during fiscal 1999 includes:    .  In-store advertising and product information sign systems;    .  Corporate-wide electronic office systems, including e-mail;    .  New Payroll and Human Resources Management System (Lawson); and    .  Store Intranet for on-line access to the Standard Operating Procedures      manual, advertising events, corporate directives, etc.    The Company's continuing development of enhancements to its management information systems includes store-level merchandise planning and allocation capability, and automated systems management software. These enhancements are intended to:    .  Improve the Company's merchandise flow from its suppliers through its      distribution facilities and to its stores;    .  Improve customer service through the reduction and automation of other      tasks in the stores;    .  Reduce distribution costs by allowing vendors to pre-package orders by      store;    .  Provide for more effective store assortments;    .  Provide additional detailed information on key business performance      indicators; and    .  Enhance overall systems reliability, availability, and service-ability.  Advertising and Promotion    The Company's comprehensive marketing program is designed to promote the Company's quality image and extensive selection of brand name products at competitive prices. The program is centered on extensive newspaper advertising supplemented by television, radio and billboard ads. The advertising strategy is focused on weekly newspaper advertising utilizing both four-page pre- printed flyer inserts and standard run of press (ROP) advertising, with additional emphasis on key shopping periods, such as the winter holidays, Father's Day, Back-to-School, and on specific sales and promotional events, including the annual Sniagrab sale.    The Company's strategy of clustering stores in major markets enables it to employ an aggressive advertising strategy on a cost-effective basis through the use of newspaper, radio and television advertising. The Company's goal is to be one of the dominant sporting goods advertisers in each of its markets. The Company advertises in major metropolitan newspapers as well as regional newspapers circulated in areas surrounding its store locations. Newspaper advertising typically consists of weekly promotional ads with three-color inserts on a semi-monthly                                         8   basis. Television advertising is generally concentrated three to four days prior to a promotional event or key shopping period. Radio advertising is used primarily to publicize specific promotions in conjunction with newspaper advertising or to announce a public relations promotion or grand opening. Billboards emphasizing the Company's image and high quality brand name merchandise are strategically located on high traffic thoroughfares near store locations. Vendor payments under cooperative advertising arrangements with the Company, as well as vendor buy-ins to sponsor sporting events and programs, have significantly contributed to the Company's advertising leverage.    The Company's advertising is designed to create an "event" in the stores and to drive customer traffic with advertisements promoting a wide variety of sale priced merchandise appropriate for the current holiday or event. In addition to holidays, the Company's events include the Sniagrab sale, celebrity autograph sessions, events related to local sports teams, race sponsorships and registrations, vendor demonstrations and other activities that attract customers to its stores. The Company's marketing program is administered by an in-house staff.    The Company sponsors tournaments and amateur competitive events in an effort to align itself with both the serious sports enthusiast and the recreational athlete. The Company is also recognized as a major sponsor of professional sports teams in its markets, including, from time to time, the Denver Broncos, Colorado Rockies, Chicago Bulls, Cubs, Blackhawks and Bears, the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Seattle Supersonics, the Minnesota Twins and Vikings, the Milwaukee Brewers and the San Francisco Giants.  Purchasing and Distribution    The Company's merchandise purchasing department is composed of two Senior Vice Presidents of Merchandising, two Vice Presidents and 19 buyers. The buying group has an average of approximately 15 years of retail experience. In addition to merchandise procurement, the buying staff is also responsible for determining initial pricing and working with the allocation and replenishment groups to establish stock levels and product mix. The buying staff also regularly communicates with store operations to monitor shifts in consumer tastes and market trends.    The Company's Planning, Replenishment, Allocation, and Merchandise Control Department is responsible for merchandise distribution, inventory control, and the Replenishment Purchasing and Allocation System. This group acts as the central processing intermediary between the buying staff and the Company's stores. The group also coordinates the inventory levels necessary for each advertising promotion with the buying staff and Advertising Department, tracking the effectiveness of each ad to allow the buying staff and Advertising Department to determine the relative success of each promotional program. In addition, the group's other duties include implementation of price changes, creation of all vendor purchase orders, and determination of the adequate amount of inventory for each store.    The Company purchases merchandise from over 1,000 vendors and has no long- term purchase commitments. During fiscal 1999, Nike, the Company's largest vendor, represented approximately 12.8% of the Company's purchases. No other vendor represented more than 5.0%.    The Company utilizes a "hub and spoke" distribution system in which vendors ship directly to central distribution centers serving regional stores. Management believes that its distribution system has the following advantages as compared to a direct delivery (i.e., drop shipping) system utilized by other retailers: reduced individual store inventory investment; more timely replenishment of store inventory needs, better use of store floor space; reduced transportation costs, and easier returns to vendors. This "hub and spoke" distribution system is utilized by many major volume retailers such as Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Circuit City.    The Company has three regional distribution centers: (1) a 240,000 square foot facility located in Denver, Colorado, (2) a 202,500 square foot facility located in Fontana, California, and (3) a 141,000 square foot facility located in Woodridge, Illinois. Inventory arriving at the distribution centers is allocated directly to the stores or                                         9   to the distribution center or to both. The E-3 automated reorder system regularly replenishes the stores by allocating merchandise from the distribution centers based on each store's sales. This system has significantly reduced the need for back-stock in the stores. The Company plans to continue adding SKUs to this automated reorder system.    The Company operates tractor trailers for delivering merchandise from its Denver distribution center to its Colorado stores, and contracts with common carriers to deliver merchandise to its stores outside a 150-mile radius from Denver and to its stores receiving merchandise from the Company's Fontana, California and Woodridge, Illinois distribution centers. The Company believes its three distribution centers are adequate to service the Company's current and expanding needs for the foreseeable future.  Competition    The retail sporting goods industry is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. While the Company's competition differs by market, there are five general categories of sporting goods retailers with which the Company competes: large format sporting goods stores, traditional sporting goods stores, specialty sporting goods stores, mass merchandisers and internet based retailers.    Large Format Sporting Goods Stores. Stores in this category include Galyans, The Sports Authority, Sport Chalet and Oshman's, typically range from 30,000 to 100,000 square feet in size and tend to be destination (freestanding or strip shopping center anchor) locations. Most large format sporting goods stores emphasize high sales volumes and a large number of SKUs.    Traditional Sporting Goods Stores. This category consists of traditional sporting goods chains, such as Big 5 and Hibbetts, as well as local independent sporting goods retailers. These stores typically range in size from 5,000 to 20,000 square feet and are frequently located in regional malls and strip shopping centers. Traditional chains and local sporting goods stores often carry a more limited assortment of products.    Specialty Sporting Goods Stores. This category consists of specialty stores and pro shops specializing in certain categories of sporting goods. Examples include such national retail chains as The Athlete's Foot, Champs, Finish Line, Foot Locker, Just for Feet, REI, Pro Discount Golf and Nevada Bob's. These retailers are highly focused, selling generally only one product category such as athletic footwear, ski or snowboard equipment, backpacking and mountaineering, or golf and tennis equipment and apparel.    Mass Merchandisers. Stores in this category include discount retailers such as Target, Kmart and Wal-Mart, warehouse clubs such as Costco, and department stores such as JC Penney and Sears. These stores range in size from approximately 50,000 to 200,000 square feet and are primarily located in regional malls and strip shopping centers. Sporting goods merchandise and apparel represent a small portion of the total merchandise in these stores and the selection is often more limited than in other sporting goods retailers. Although generally price competitive, the Company believes that discount and department stores have limited customer service because the store personnel often lack product expertise in the selling of sporting goods.    Internet Based Retailers. This category consists of on-line internet retailers such as Fogdog Sports, dsports.com, mvp.com and Global Sports Interactive. These competitors are relatively new and sell a full line of sporting goods products via the internet.    The Company believes that although it will continue to face competition from retailers in each of these categories, the most significant competition is expected to be from the large format sporting goods stores. The Company faces direct competition from large format sporting goods stores, including Sport Chalet in California; The Sports Authority in California, Illinois and Washington; Dick's Clothing and Sporting Goods in Ohio;                                        10   Galyans in Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota and Ohio; and Oshman's in California, Minnesota, New Mexico, Utah and Washington. The principal competitive factors include store location and image, product selection, quality and price, and customer service. Increased competition in markets in which the Company has stores, the adoption by competitors of innovative store formats and retail sales methods or the entry of new competitors or the expansion of operations by existing competitors in the Company's markets could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, certain of the Company's competitors have substantially greater resources than the Company. The Company believes that the principal strengths with which it competes are its broad selection and competitive prices combined with a high level customer service and brand names typically available only in specialty stores and pro shops.  Properties    The Company currently leases all of its store locations. Most leases provide for the payment of minimum annual rent subject to periodic adjustments, plus other charges, including a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance. The Company has identified certain markets for strategic repositioning and plans to address the positioning of each store as leases expire and as opportunities arise. Leases for 13 of the Company's non- superstore format stores have expired or are expiring by the end of fiscal 2000. Two of such stores are occupied on a month-to-month basis, four of such stores will be closed and seven stores are subject to leases with an option to renew or relocate. The Company regularly evaluates whether to renew store leases in existing locations or to strategically relocate some of the stores to better locations and replace them with larger stores. The acquisition of two Jumbo Sports stores in Denver, CO in November 1999, will result in the closing of two non-superstore locations. The Company believes that at store locations where it chooses to remain and renew expired leases, the Company can do so on favorable terms. Leases for the Company's 90 Superstores expire between 2000 and 2018. The Company anticipates that all of its new stores will have long-term leases, typically 15 years, with multiple five-year renewal options.    Seven of the leases for the Company's stores are with partnerships, the partners of which are certain former officers or directors of Sportmart (including Messrs. Larry and Andrew Hochberg, currently directors of the Company) and their family members (the "Hochberg Partnerships"). In addition, the Company leases from Hochberg Partnerships three stores that the Company no longer occupies but sublets. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."    In addition, as a result of the closing of Sportmart's Canadian subsidiary, the Company remains secondarily liable for two leases the Company has assigned in Canada and is contingently liable behind two other parties with respect to a portion of a third location in Canada. The Company has sublet the former Sportmart corporate offices in Wheeling, Illinois.    The Company owns a vacant Sportmart store located in Edmonton, Canada, which is being marketed for sale and has entered into an agreement to sell the property. The closing of the sale is subject to numerous regulatory licensing and re-zoning requirements.    The Company also leases its three regional distribution centers. The lease for the 240,000 square foot distribution center in Denver, Colorado, expires in 2004 with a ten year renewal option. The lease for the 202,500 square foot distribution center in Fontana, California expires in 2008, assuming all options are exercised. The lease for the 141,000 square foot distribution center in Woodridge, Illinois expires in 2007, assuming all options are exercised. In addition, the Company leases a warehouse in Denver, Colorado. The lease for the 76,000 square foot warehouse expires in 2001.    In January 1998, the Company entered into a lease for approximately 22,000 square feet of additional corporate office space located adjacent to the Denver Sportscastle store. This lease expires in 2017.                                        11   Employees    At March 31, 2000, the Company employed approximately 4,900 individuals, 44% of whom were employed on a full-time basis and 56% of whom were employed on a part-time (less than 32 hours per week) basis. Due to the seasonal nature of the Company's business, total employment fluctuates during the year. The Company considers its employee relations to be good. None of the Company's employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  Trademarks and Tradenames    The Company uses the Gart Sports(R), Gart Bros. Sporting Goods Company(R), Gart Sports Superstore(R), Sniagrab(R), Sportscastle(R), Gart Sports Company(R) and SWAT(R) trademarks and trade names, which have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Sportmart(R) and Sportmart's corporate logo are federally registered servicemarks of the Company. The Company also owns numerous other trademarks and servicemarks which involve the manufacturing of soft goods, advertising slogans, promotional event names and store names used in its business.  ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings    The Company is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of its business. The Company believes that the outcome of all such pending legal proceedings to which it is a party will not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, or operating results.    On July 24, 1997, the Internal Revenue System proposed adjustments to the 1992 and 1993 consolidated federal income tax returns of the Company and its former parent company, now Thrifty PayLess Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of RiteAid Corporation, and the manner in which LIFO inventories were characterized on such returns. See note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    The Company received a letter from the U.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division (the "DOL") in Minnesota, dated April 7, 2000, stating that the DOL had received information indicating that the Company may not be in full compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act with regard to the payment of overtime. The compliance review by the DOL is in the preliminary stage and at this time, the Company has no reason to believe that the outcome of the compliance review will be material to the Company.  ITEM 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders    No matters were put to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999.                                         12                                       PART II  ITEM 5. Market Price of Common Stock and Related Stockholder Matters    The Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq National Market on January 9, 1998, under the symbol "GRTS." As of March 31, 2000, there were approximately 246 holders of record of Common Stock. The number of holders of Common Stock does not include the beneficial owners of Common Stock whose shares are held in the name of banks, brokers, nominees or other fiduciaries. The table below sets forth the reported high and low closing sales prices of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market during fiscal 1999 and 1998:                                                                      High     Low                                                                  ------- -------           Fiscal Year 1999      First quarter.............................................. $ 8.125 $ 5.750      Second quarter............................................. $ 7.750 $ 5.625      Third quarter.............................................. $ 7.000 $ 4.500      Fourth quarter............................................. $ 6.750 $ 4.625    Fiscal Year 1998      First quarter.............................................. $17.250 $12.750      Second quarter............................................. $18.000 $12.500      Third quarter.............................................. $16.375 $ 6.750      Fourth quarter............................................. $10.375 $ 5.625     The Company has never declared or paid any dividends on its Common Stock. The Company plans to retain earnings to finance future growth and has no current plans to pay cash dividends to stockholders. The payment of any future cash dividends will be at the sole discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, future earnings, capital requirements, and the general financial condition of the Company. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Liquidity and Capital Resources." In addition, the Company's revolving line of credit limits the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on the Common Stock.    During fiscal 1999, the Board of Directors authorized a discretionary program to purchase up to $3,000,000 of its common stock, par value, $.01 per share, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions using the Company's currently available cash. As of March 31, 2000, the Company had purchased 192,500 shares of its stock at a cost of approximately $1.2 million.                                        13   ITEM 6. Selected Financial Data    The selected data presented below under the caption "Statement of Operations Data" and "Net cash provided by (used in)" for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 29, 2000 (fiscal 1999), and the 28 day period ended January 31, 1998 and the "Balance Sheet Data" as of January 29, 2000 and January 30, 1999 are derived from the Company's audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and should be read in conjunction therewith. This data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company, the notes thereto and other financial information of the Company included elsewhere in this report. The "Statement of Operations Data" and "Net cash provided by (used in)" for each of the fiscal years in the two year period ended January 4, 1997 (fiscal 1996) and the "Balance Sheet Data" as of January 31, 1998, January 3, 1998, January 4, 1997 and January 6, 1996 are derived from audited consolidated financial statements not included in this report.    Management does not believe that the results of operations for the transition period are indicative of future results, due to the effects of seasonality and costs associated with the Sportmart acquisition. Therefore, the results of operations for the transition period are not comparable to other presented periods. The results for fiscal years 1999 and 1998 are comparable to each other, but these results are not comparable to the transition period ended January 31, 1998 or fiscal 1997, 1996, and 1995, which represent the results of Gart Sports only, before the acquisition of Sportmart.

Accordingly, fiscal 1997 began on     January 5, 1997 and ended on January 3, 1998 and included 52 weeks of     operations; fiscal 1996 began on January 7, 1996 and ended on January 4,     1997 and included 52 weeks of operations; and fiscal 1995 began on January     1, 1995 and ended on January 6, 1996 and included 53 weeks of operations.     During 1998, the Company adopted an annual fiscal reporting period that     ends on the Saturday closest to the end of January. Accordingly, fiscal     1999 began on January 31, 1999 and ended on January 29, 2000 and included     52 weeks of operations; fiscal 1998 began on February 1, 1998 and ended on     January 30, 1999 and included 52 weeks of operations. (2) Represents the 59 Sportmart stores acquired on January 9, 1998 and one new     store opened in January 1998. (3) Stores enter the comparable store sales base at the beginning of their     14th month of operation. The 59 Sportmart stores acquired on January 9,     1998, are included in comparable store sales bases utilizing historical     Sportmart comparable store data. (4) EBITDA is earnings (loss) before income taxes plus interest expense and     other financing costs and depreciation and amortization. Gart Sports     believes that, in addition to cash flows from operations and net income     (loss), EBITDA is a useful financial performance measure for assessing     operating performance as it provides an additional basis to evaluate the     ability of Gart Sports to incur and service debt and to fund capital     expenditures. In evaluating EBITDA, Gart Sports believes that     consideration should be given, among other things, to the amount by which     EBITDA exceeds interest costs for the period, how EBITDA compares to     principal repayments on debt for the period and how EBITDA compares to     capital expenditures for the period. To evaluate EBITDA, the components of     EBITDA such as revenue and operating expenses and the variability of such     components over time should also be considered. EBITDA should not be     construed, however, as an alternative to operating income (loss) (as     determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles     (GAAP)) as an indicator of Gart Sports' operating performance or to cash     flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as     a measure of liquidity. Gart Sports' method of calculating EBITDA may     differ from methods used by other companies, and as a result, EBITDA     measures disclosed herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled     measures used by other companies.                                        15                       MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF                  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and the notes thereto and the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, included elsewhere in this report.    During 1995, the Company adopted an annual fiscal reporting period that ends on the first Saturday in January. Accordingly, fiscal 1997 began on January 5, 1997 and ended on January 3, 1998 and included 52 weeks of operations. Fiscal 1996 began on January 7, 1996 and ended on January 4, 1997 and included 52 weeks of operations. During 1998, the Company adopted an annual fiscal reporting period that ends on the Saturday closest to the end of January. Accordingly, fiscal 1999 began on January 31, 1999 and ended on January 29, 2000 and included 52 weeks of operations. Fiscal 1998 began on February 1, 1998 and ended on January 30, 1999 and included 52 weeks of operations. The 28 day period following the end of fiscal 1997 through January 31, 1998 has been reported as a transition period.    In fiscal 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information", which establishes annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise's operating segments and related disclosures about its products, services, major customers and the significant countries in which the entity holds assets and reports revenue. The Company is a leading retailer of sporting goods in the midwest and western United States. Given the economic characteristics of the store formats, the similar nature of the products sold, the type of customer and method of distribution, the operations of the Company are aggregated in one reportable segment.    Management does not believe that the results of operations for the transition period are indicative of future results, due to the effects of seasonality and costs associated with the Sportmart acquisition. Therefore, the results of operations for the transition period are not comparable to other presented periods. The results for fiscal years 1999 and 1998 are comparable to each other, but these results are not comparable to the transition period ended January 31, 1998 or fiscal 1997 which represents the results of Gart Sports prior to the acquisition of Sportmart.  Results of Operations    The following table sets forth for the periods indicated, certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales and the number of stores open at the end of each period:                                                               28 days ended                           Fiscal 1999    Fiscal 1998     January 31, 1998       Fiscal 1997                          -------------  --------------   -------------------   -------------                          Dollars   %    Dollars    %      Dollars      %       Dollars   %                          ------- -----  -------  -----   -------------------   ------- -----                  Net sales............... $681.0  100.0% $658.0   100.0%   $   38.8     100.0%  $228.4  100.0% Cost of goods sold,  buying, distribution  and occupancy..........  517.5   76.0   503.4    76.5        31.9      82.2    164.3   71.9                          ------  -----  ------   -----    --------  --------   ------  ----- Gross profit............  163.5   24.0   154.6    23.5         6.9      17.8     64.1   28.1 Operating expenses......  151.0   22.2   148.3    22.5        11.4      29.4     52.7   23.2 Merger integration  costs..................     --     --     2.9     0.4         3.4       8.8      0.4    0.2                          ------  -----  ------   -----    --------  --------   ------  ----- Operating income  (loss).................   12.5    1.8     3.4     0.6        (7.9)    (20.4)    11.0    4.7 Interest expense, net...   10.6    1.5     9.3     1.4         0.5       1.3      1.0    0.4 Other income, net.......    0.9    0.1     0.3      --         0.1       0.3      0.8    0.4                          ------  -----  ------   -----    --------  --------   ------  ----- Income (loss) before  income taxes...........    2.8    0.4    (5.6)   (0.8)       (8.3)    (21.4)    10.8    4.7 Income tax expense  (benefit)..............    1.0    0.1    (2.2)   (0.3)       (0.3)     (0.8)     4.1    1.8                          ------  -----  ------   -----    --------  --------   ------  ----- Net income (loss)....... $  1.8    0.3% $ (3.4)   (0.5)%  $   (8.0)    (20.6)% $  6.7    2.9%                          ======  =====  ======   =====    ========  ========   ======  ===== Number of stores at end  of period..............    127            125                 123                 63                                         16     Newly opened stores enter the comparable store sales base at the beginning of their 14th month of operation. The 59 Sportmart stores acquired on January 9, 1998, are included in the comparable store sales base utilizing historical Sportmart comparable store data.    Inventories are stated at the lower of last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost or market. The Company considers cost of goods sold to include the direct costs of merchandise, plus certain internal costs associated with procurement, warehousing, handling and distribution. In addition to the full cost of inventory, cost of goods sold includes related occupancy costs and amortization and depreciation of leasehold improvements and rental equipment. Operating expenses include controllable and non-controllable store expenses (except occupancy), non-store expenses and depreciation and amortization not associated with cost of goods sold.  Fiscal 1999 as compared to Fiscal 1998    The Company's fiscal 1999 consists of the 52-week period ended January 29, 2000. These results are comparable to fiscal 1998, but are not comparable to the transition period ended January 31, 1998, or fiscal 1997 which represents the results of Gart Sports prior to the acquisition of Sportmart.    Net Sales. Net sales increased $23.0 million, or 3.5%, to $681.0 million in fiscal 1999 compared to $658.0 million in fiscal 1998. The increase in net sales is primarily attributed to the opening of seven new superstores resulting in $22.2 million in net sales and $4.4 million of increased sales from new stores opened late in fiscal 1998, which are not yet considered comparable, partially offset by $3.6 million in lost sales from the closing of five smaller format stores. Comparable store sales decreased 0.6% for the same period, primarily due to lower sales in licensed apparel, footwear, and in- line skates. The decrease in licensed apparel is primarily due to the Broncos not repeating as Super Bowl champions. The footwear and in-line skate segments of the industry continued to be very competitive in fiscal 1999. The decline in sales of these items was partially offset by strong sales of outdoor products and hard-goods.    Gross Profit. Gross profit for fiscal 1999 was $163.5 million or 24.0% of net sales as compared to $154.6 million or 23.5% of net sales for fiscal 1998. The increase in gross profit is primarily a result of the synergies realized from the acquisition of Sportmart and improved assortment management and buying disciplines. These increases were partially offset by higher occupancy costs due to new stores opened in fiscal 1999.    Operating Expenses and Merger Integration Costs. Operating expenses in fiscal 1999 were $151.0 million, or 22.2% of net sales compared to $151.3 million, or 23.0% of net sales for fiscal 1998. There were no integration costs in fiscal 1999. In fiscal 1998, operating expenses included $6.0 million of merger integration costs that are not recurring. Of these costs, $2.9 million were recorded as a non-recurring charge, and $3.1 million were included in other operating expenses. Excluding integration costs from fiscal 1998, operating expenses increased from $145.2 million or 22.1% of net sales in fiscal 1998 to $151.0 million or 22.2% of net sales in fiscal 1999. This increase is primarily due to the increase in the number of superstores compared to the prior year and bonuses earned in fiscal 1999.    Operating Income. As a result of the factors described above, operating income for fiscal 1999 was $12.5 million or 1.8% of net sales compared to $3.4 million or 0.6% of net sales in fiscal 1998.    Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net for fiscal 1999 increased to $10.6 million, or 1.5% of net sales, from $9.3 million, or 1.4% of net sales. The increase from the prior year is primarily due to an increase in average interest-bearing debt for the year attributable to new store inventories and an increase in the effective borrowing rate as a result of rising interest rates.    Income Taxes. The Company's income tax expense for fiscal 1999 was $1.0 million compared to an income tax benefit of $2.2 million in fiscal 1998. The Company's effective tax rate decreased to 36% in fiscal 1999, from 39% in fiscal 1998, as a result of lower state taxes.                                        17   Fiscal 1998 as compared to pro forma combined 1997 amounts (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)    The Company's fiscal 1998 consists of the 52-week year ended January 30, 1999. Note that these results are not comparable to the transition period ended January 31, 1998, or fiscal 1997 which represents the results of Gart Sports prior to the acquisition of Sportmart.    Net Sales. Net sales were $658.0 million for fiscal 1998 versus $666.3 million on a pro forma combined basis utilizing comparable fiscal periods, for the prior year. The decrease in net sales is attributable to a comparable store sales decrease of 4.5% for the year and an increase of $28.2 million from new stores opened offset by $6.8 million of lost sales from closed stores. Comparable store sales decreased due to weak apparel and winter related product sales. Apparel sales decreased primarily due to weak licensed product sales due to the shift in the timing of Superbowl-related items into the first quarter of fiscal 1999 from the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, as well as the impact of the NBA lockout. Sales of winter-related products decreased due to unseasonably warm weather.    Gross Profit. Gross profit was $154.6 million during fiscal 1998 or 23.5% of net sales compared to $160.1 million or 24.0% on a pro-forma combined basis, utilizing comparable periods for the prior year. Merchandise margins were consistent with the 1997 Company's margins on a pro forma combined basis utilizing comparable fiscal periods. However, gross margin was negatively impacted by higher occupancy costs including the favorable lease amortization established in conjunction with the merger.    Operating Expenses and Merger Integration Costs. Operating expenses and merger integration costs for fiscal 1998 were $151.2 million, or 22.9% of net sales versus $157.8 million or 23.7% on a pro-forma combined basis, utilizing comparable periods for the prior year. Operating expenses included $6.0 million of merger integration costs that are not recurring. Of these costs, $2.9 million were recorded as a non-recurring charge, and $3.1 million were included in other operating expenses. These costs consist primarily of $0.7 million of professional fees, $1.3 million of stay bonuses to employees at the Sportmart corporate headquarters, $0.5 million of travel and moving expenses, $1.6 million of costs associated with re-ticketing merchandise in the Sportmart stores, and $1.3 million of expenses to keep the Sportmart corporate office open during the first part of 1998.    Operating Income. As a result of the factors described above, operating income for fiscal 1998 was $3.4 million or 0.6% of net sales compared to $2.4 million or 0.4% of net sales on a pro-forma combined basis, utilizing comparable periods for the year. Excluding the integration costs of $6.0 million, operating income would have been $9.4 million, or 1.4% of net sales.    Interest Expense. Interest expense for fiscal 1998 was 1.4% of net sales or $9.3 million. The increase from prior periods is primarily due to increased debt levels as compared to fiscal 1997 and 1996, due to the assumption of the Sportmart debt.    Income Tax Benefit. The Company's income tax benefit for fiscal 1998 was $2.2 million. The Company's effective tax rate was 39%.  Transition Period ended January 31, 1998    The Company's transition period consists of the 28 days of operations for Gart Sports, which includes 22 days of operations for Sportmart (from the date of acquisition on January 9, 1998) (the "Transition Period").    Net Sales. Net sales were $38.8 million for the Transition Period. Net sales were evenly distributed between the Gart Sports stores and the Sportmart stores. Gart Sports stores were bolstered by licensed promotional apparel sales related to the Denver Broncos' winning of the Super Bowl, contributing to a 31.8% increase in comparable Gart Sports store sales offset by a 3.6% decline in comparable Sportmart stores sales subsequent to the acquisition. The Sportmart acquisition added an additional 59 superstores to the Company's sales base.                                        18     Gross Profit. Gross profit was $6.9 million during the Transition Period or 17.8% of net sales. The month of January is a historically slow sales period for Sportmart in which promotional clearance events are held. Such events generally result in higher cost of sales as a percentage of net sales and correspondingly lower gross profit margins.    Operating Expenses. Operating expenses for the period ended January 31, 1998 were $11.4 million, or 29.4% of net sales. Operating expenses associated with the Sportmart stores increased as a percentage of net sales primarily due to the decline in net sales while fixed costs remained consistent.    Merger Integration Costs. Merger integration costs were $3.4 million. These costs consist primarily of $653,000 of professional fees, $700,000 of stay bonuses to employees at the Sportmart corporate headquarters, $63,000 of travel expense, $1,153,000 of lease buyouts, $220,000 of obsolete equipment write down, $78,000 of debt fee expense, $505,000 of severance, moving and employee welfare costs, and $5,000 of other costs.    Operating Loss. As a result of the factors described above, the operating loss for the Transition Period was $7.9 million.    Interest Expense. Interest expense for the four week period ended January 31, 1998 was 1.3% of net sales or $0.5 million. In conjunction with the Sportmart acquisition, the Company refinanced the Sportmart debt of approximately $86.2 million under a new credit agreement.    Income Tax Benefit. The Company's income tax benefit for the Transition Period was $0.3 million. The Company's effective tax rate was 3.8% primarily due to the Company recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets generated by the operations of Sportmart for the Transition Period.  Liquidity and Capital Resources    The Company's primary capital requirements are for inventory, capital improvements, and pre-opening expenses to support the Company's expansion plans, as well as for various investments in store remodeling, store fixtures and ongoing infrastructure improvements.

Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 1999 was primarily for capital expenditures. These expenditures were primarily for the opening of seven new superstores, remodeling of existing stores and the purchase or enhancement of certain information systems. These cash uses were partially offset by cash received from the sale of marketable securities.                                        19     Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 1999 represents net proceeds from borrowings on the Company's revolving line of credit reduced by payments made on capital leases and the purchase of treasury stock. At the time of the Sportmart acquisition, the Company refinanced Sportmart debt of $86.2 million under the Credit Agreement referred to below.    The Company's liquidity and capital needs have been met by cash from operations and borrowings under a revolving line of credit with CIT/Business Credit, Inc. ("CIT"). In connection with the Sportmart acquisition, this agreement was replaced with a new revolving line of credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") with a group of lenders including CIT as agent. The long term debt currently consists of the Credit Agreement, which allows the Company to borrow up to 70% of its eligible inventories (as defined in the Credit Agreement) during the year and up to 75% of its eligible inventories for any consecutive 90 day period in a fiscal year. Borrowings are limited to the lesser of $175 million or the amount calculated in accordance with the borrowing base, and are secured by substantially all trade receivables, inventories and intangible assets. The lenders may not demand repayment of principal absent an occurrence of default under the Credit Agreement prior to January 9, 2003. The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a specified minimum level of net worth at all times and restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends. Loan interest is payable monthly at Chase Manhattan Bank's prime rate plus a margin rate that cannot exceed 0.25% or, at the option of the Company, at Chase Manhattan Bank's LIBOR rate plus a margin that cannot exceed 1.75%. The margin rate on prime and LIBOR borrowings will be reduced during the first quarter of fiscal 2000, as certain earnings levels have been achieved, to 0.0% and 1.50%, respectively. There was $134.7 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement at April 1, 2000, and $33.8 million was available for borrowing. The increase in long-term debt since fiscal year end 1999 is primarily attributable to seasonal inventory purchases and decreases in accounts payable.    The Internal Revenue Service has proposed adjustments to the 1992 and 1993 consolidated federal income tax returns of the Company and its former parent, now Thrifty PayLess Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of RiteAid Corporation, due to the manner in which LIFO inventories were characterized on such returns. Based on management's discussion with the Company's former parent, the Company believes the potential accelerated tax liability, which could have a negative effect on liquidity in the near term, ranges from approximately $2,500,000 to $9,700,000. See note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $12.0 million in fiscal 2000. These capital expenditures will be for store remodeling, store fixtures, information systems, distribution center facilities, and ski rentals. The Company leases all of its store locations and intends to continue to finance its new stores with long-term operating leases. Based upon historical data, newly constructed superstores require a cash investment of approximately $1.8 million for a 40,000 square foot store and $1.5 million for a 33,000 square foot store. Superstores constructed in existing retail space historically have required additional capital investments of approximately $700,000 in leasehold improvements per location. The level of capital improvements will be affected by the mix of new construction versus renovation of existing retail space.    The Company believes that cash generated from operations, combined with funds available under the Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to fund projected capital expenditures and other working capital requirements through fiscal 2000. The Company intends to utilize the Credit Agreement to meet seasonal fluctuations in cash flow requirements.  Foreign Currency and Interest Rate Risk Management    In connection with the Sportmart acquisition, certain derivative financial instruments were acquired. The instruments were utilized to reduce interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.    The assumed contracts consisted of one interest rate cap agreement and various foreign currency option contracts. These agreements were transferred from Sportmart's credit agreement to the Company's credit                                        20   agreement. The interest rate cap agreement was for a notional amount totaling $25.0 million, placed an interest rate ceiling on LIBOR at 6.0% and expired in August 1999.    In connection with its Canadian operations (which were closed in 1997), Sportmart had entered into foreign currency contracts to hedge intercompany loans and other commitments in currencies other than its Canadian subsidiary's functional currency. All of these foreign currency contracts expired prior to fiscal 1998.  Seasonality and Inflation    The following table sets forth the Company's unaudited consolidated quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in fiscal 1999 and 1998. This information is unaudited, but is prepared on the same basis as the annual financial information and, in the opinion of management, reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented. The results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.                                    Fiscal 1999                                                  First   Second    Third   Fourth                                              Quarter  Quarter  Quarter  Quarter                                              -------  -------  -------  -------               Net sales................................ $151.9   $172.6   $155.5   $201.0    % of full year...........................   22.3%    25.4%    22.8%    29.5%    Operating income (loss).................. $  1.8   $  3.6   $ (1.5)  $  8.6                                    Fiscal 1998     Net sales................................ $155.2   $169.1   $142.6   $191.1    % of full year...........................   23.6%    25.7%    21.7%    29.0%    Operating income (loss).................. $ (2.5)  $  6.0   $ (7.5)  $  7.4     The fourth quarter has historically been the strongest quarter for the Company. For fiscal 1999 and 1998, the fourth quarter contributed 29.5% and 29.0%, respectively, of net sales. Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999 increased 1.6%, although they were negatively impacted by weak licensed apparel sales. Licensed apparel sales decreased primarily due to the Denver Broncos not repeating as Super Bowl champions. The negative impact of licensed apparel sales was more than offset by strong sales in outdoor products and hard goods. The Company believes that two primary factors contribute to this seasonality. First, sales of cold weather sporting goods and purchases of ski and snowboard merchandise during these quarters in anticipation of the ski and snowboard season. Second, holiday sales contribute significantly to the Company's operating results. As a result of these factors, inventory levels, which gradually increase beginning in April, generally reach their peak in November and then decline to their lowest level following the December holiday season. Any decrease in sales for the fourth quarter, whether due to a slow holiday selling season, poor snowfall in ski areas near the Company's markets or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year.    Although the operations of the Company are influenced by general economic conditions, the Company does not believe that inflation has a material impact on the Company's results of operations. The Company believes that it is generally able to pass along any inflationary increases in costs to its customers.  Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements    Beginning in fiscal 1999, the Company is expensing pre-opening costs in the period in which they are incurred in conformity with Statement of Position 98- 5 ("SOP 98-5") Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities. SOP 98-5 broadly defines start-up activities as those one-time activities related to, among other things, opening a new facility. Prior to fiscal 1999, the Company capitalized such costs and amortized the balance over the fiscal year in which it opened the new facility. The implementation of SOP 98-5 slightly affects                                        21   quarterly results; however on an annual basis, there is no financial impact. Generally, the Company incurs approximately $125,000 of pre-opening costs per new store.  Year 2000 Compliance    The Company did not experience any significant malfunctions or errors in its operating or business systems when the date changed from 1999 to 2000. Based on operations since January 1, 2000, the Company does not expect any significant impact to its ongoing business as a result of the "Year 2000 issue." However, it is possible that the full impact of the date change, which was of concern due to computer programs that use two digits instead of four digits to define years, has not been fully recognized. The Company believes that any such problems are likely to be minor and correctable. In addition, the Company could still be negatively affected if its suppliers are adversely affected by the Year 2000 or similar issues. The Company currently is not aware of any significant Year 2000 issues that have arisen for its suppliers. The Company expended $901,000 on its Year 2000 readiness efforts including replacing some outdated, non-compliant hardware and software as well as identifying and remediating Year 2000 problems.  ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    The Company's primary interest rate risk exposure results from the Company's long-term debt agreement. The Company's long-term debt bears interest at variable rates that are tied to either the U.S. prime rate or LIBOR at the time of the borrowing. At the end of each 90-day period, the interest rates on the Company's outstanding borrowings are changed to reflect current prime or LIBOR rates. Therefore, the Company's interest expense changes as prime or LIBOR change.    Historically, the Company has not relied upon derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, in connection with the Sportmart acquisition, the Company acquired one interest rate cap agreement that Sportmart had used to reduce its interest rate risk. The interest rate cap was used to lock in a maximum rate if interest rates rose, but enabled the Company to otherwise pay lower market rates. The cap agreement was for a notional amount totaling $25.0 million, placed an interest rate ceiling on LIBOR of 6.0%, and expired in August 1999.    Based on the Company's overall interest rate exposure at January 29, 2000, a hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial instruments would change the Company's after-tax earnings by approximately $680,000 over a 12-month period.    The Company's exposure to foreign currency exchange rates is limited because the Company does not operate any stores outside of the United States. In connection with the acquisition of Sportmart, the Company acquired one store in Canada, which Sportmart had closed prior to the acquisition. The Company is currently attempting to sell this store (see Item 2 -- Properties discussion), but until then, the Company is exposed to the risk that a change in exchange rates between the U.S. and Canada would cause the Company's other comprehensive income to change due to foreign currency translation gains or losses. However, the Company does not consider the market risk exposure relating to foreign currency change to be material. Foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on the Company during fiscal 1999, 1998, the transition period, or fiscal 1997.    The fair value of the Company's investments in marketable equity securities at January 29, 2000 was $195,000. The fair value of these investments will fluctuate as the quoted market prices of such securities fluctuate. Based on the Company's marketable equity securities portfolio and quoted market prices at January 29, 2000, a 50% increase or decrease in the market price of such securities would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $98,000 in the fair value of the marketable equity securities portfolio. Although changes in quoted market prices may affect the fair value of the marketable equities securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses, such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold.                                        22     As of January 29, 2000, the fair value of the Company's investments in marketable equity securities was $574,000 less than the original cost of those investments. Such unrealized holding loss has not been recognized in the Company's consolidated statement of operations, but rather has been recorded as a component of stockholders' equity in other comprehensive loss. The actual gain or loss that the Company will realize when such investments are sold will depend on the fair value of such securities at the time of sale.  ITEM 8.
