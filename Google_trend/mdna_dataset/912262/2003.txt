ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with "Selected Consolidated Financial Data" and accompanying notes and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors.            We are the leading retailer of sporting goods in the Western United States. Given the economic characteristics of the store formats, the similar nature of the products sold, the type of customer and method of distribution, our operations are aggregated in one reportable segment as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."            We, together with Sports Authority, announced on February 20, 2003 that our boards of directors have unanimously approved a definitive agreement providing for a merger of equals to create the nation's preeminent sporting goods retailer. The combined company will be named "The Sports Authority, Inc." and be headquartered in Englewood, Colorado. The combined company will apply for listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "TSA." The transaction is expected to be completed in the third calendar quarter of 2003. The combined company will have 385 stores in 45 states nationwide. The merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by our stockholders and the stockholders of Sports Authority as well as Hart-Scott-Rodino approval under the United States antitrust laws. The Results of Operations presented below represent our historical results only.    Results of Operations              The following table sets forth for the periods indicated, certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales and the number of stores open at the end of each period (dollars rounded to millions):             Fiscal 2002     Fiscal 2001     Fiscal 2000             Dollars     %     Dollars     %     Dollars     %       Net sales     $  1,051.2     100.0  %  $  935.7     100.0  %  $  751.1     100.0  %    Cost of goods sold, buying, distribution and occupancy        776.3     73.8        696.3     74.4        559.8     74.5                                       Gross profit        274.9     26.2        239.4     25.6        191.3     25.5       Operating expenses        229.0     21.8        204.4     21.8        164.5     21.9       Merger integration costs                     12.5     1.4                                                    Operating income        45.9     4.4        22.5     2.4        26.8     3.6       Interest expense        (9.2  )  (0.9  )     (11.0  )  (1.2  )     (11.7  )  (1.6  )    Other income, net        1.1     0.1        2.1     0.3        0.6     0.1                                       Income before income taxes        37.8     3.6        13.6     1.5        15.7     2.1       Income tax benefit (expense)        (14.6  )  (1.4  )     (5.3  )  (0.6  )     7.4     1.0                                       Net income     $  23.2     2.2  %  $  8.3     0.9  %  $  23.1     3.1  %                                    Number of stores at end of period        181              179              120                        Newly opened stores enter the comparable store sales base at the beginning of their 14 th  full month of operation. The Oshman's stores are included in the comparable store sales base beginning August 4, 2002, the beginning of their 14 th  full month of operations since the date we acquired Oshman's.    17        NAME="page_dk1399_1_18">               Inventories are stated at the lower of last-in, first-out ("LIFO") cost or market. We consider cost of goods sold to include the direct costs of merchandise, plus certain internal costs associated with procurement, warehousing, handling and distribution. In addition to the full cost of inventory, cost of goods sold includes related occupancy costs and amortization and depreciation of leasehold improvements and rental equipment.            Operating expenses include controllable and non-controllable store expenses (except occupancy), non-store expenses and depreciation and amortization not associated with cost of goods sold.    Critical Accounting Policies             Management's Discussion and Analysis discusses the results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to inventory valuation, accounts receivable, the recoverability of long-lived assets including intangible assets, store closing reserves, income taxes, and the estimates used to record purchase accounting related to acquisitions. Management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our significant accounting policies.    Valuation of Inventory             We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the average cost of items purchased and applying the dollar value last-in, first-out ("LIFO") inventory method. Our dollar value LIFO pools are computed using the Inventory Price Index Computation ("IPIC") method. LIFO cost of our inventories is then compared to estimated market value. This assessment of estimated market value is based on the quality and age of merchandise, the rate of sale of merchandise, the quantities on hand, and our assessment of the market conditions. Estimates and judgments are required in the determination of the market value of our inventory and future changes, like changes in customer merchandise preferences or unseasonable weather patterns, could cause changes in the market value of our inventory.            Inventory shrinkage is accrued as a percentage of merchandise sales based on historical inventory shrinkage trends. We perform physical inventories at our stores and distribution centers throughout the year. The reserve for inventory shrinkage represents an estimate for inventory shrinkage for each of our locations since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date. These estimates are impacted by internal and external factors and may vary from actual results.    Vendor allowances             We receive certain allowances from our vendors, which include rebates and cooperative advertising funds. These amounts are negotiated with vendors typically on an annual basis and are, at times, dependent on projected purchase volumes and advertising plans. The amounts are subject to changes in market conditions or marketing strategies of our vendors, and changes in our product purchases. We record an estimate of earned allowances based on the latest information available with respect to purchase volumes, advertising plans and status of our negotiations with vendors.    18                  In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the FASB issued consensus No. 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor" ("EITF 02-16"). EITF No. 02-16 addresses how a reseller of a vendor's products should account for cash consideration received from the vendor. We believe that the provisions of EITF 02-16 could impact our financial reporting for certain vendor allowances by requiring recharacterization of amounts received from vendors from reduction of advertising expense to reduction of cost of inventory purchased. We have not yet completed our assessment of the impact of this ruling on fiscal 2003 and are working with our vendors as new arrangements are negotiated to minimize the effects of EITF 02-16 on our results of operations.    Impairment of Assets             We review long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets is impaired.    Store Closing Reserves             Prior to December 31, 2002 and the adoption of SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," we recorded a provision for store closing when the decision was made by management to close a store. In accordance with SFAS No. 146, for store closing activities initiated after December 31, 2002, we record a liability at fair value for costs associated with exit or disposal activities, when a liability is incurred rather than when the decision to close a store is made. This will change the timing of recognition for certain exit costs, so that certain exit costs will be recognized over the period in which the exit activities occur. The costs incurred in connection with store closings primarily consist of future net lease obligations, utilities, property taxes, and employee costs directly related to the store closing.    Acquisitions Accounting             Our acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the total costs of our acquisitions are allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. The determination of fair values involves the use of estimates and assumptions which could require adjustment in the future.            While we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate, which could require us to make adjustments to these estimates in future periods.    Fiscal 2002 as compared to Fiscal 2001             Net Sales.     Net sales increased $115.5 million, or 12.3%, to $1,051.2 million in fiscal 2002 compared to $935.7 million in fiscal 2001. Last year's sales include Oshman's results after the June 7, 2001 acquisition date compared to a full year of results for fiscal 2002. Comparable store sales in fiscal 2002, which includes the Oshman's stores since August 4, 2002, were flat. This comparable sales performance is the net effect of increases in several product categories offset by decreases in others. Comparative sales were strong in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. First quarter sales in apparel and    19          hardgoods increased due to a strong late ski season in our markets, sales of merchandise related to the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and increased exercise equipment promotions. During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the effects of the drought and forest fire activity in the Rocky Mountain Region and the Western United States fueled decreases in the camping, hunting and footwear departments. Third quarter 2002 sales increases were driven by licensed apparel sales as teams in our markets were involved in the Major League Baseball World Series and playoffs. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, there were increased sales in the activewear, athletic hardgood, bicycle and snowboard categories related primarily to the holiday selling season. These increases were offset by decreases during the fourth quarter in the footwear, outdoor apparel and licensed apparel categories. Footwear was impacted by a less promotional environment versus the year ago fourth quarter and a mild winter experienced during the quarter in many of our markets, which also negatively impacted outdoor apparel sales. Further, sales for the fiscal year were negatively impacted by an overall challenging retail sales environment.            Gross Profit.     Gross profit for fiscal 2002 was $274.9 million or 26.2% of net sales as compared to $239.4 million or 25.6% of net sales for fiscal 2001. The increase as a percent of sales is due to a number of factors including: a less promotional strategy taken during the year; synergies being realized from the Oshman's acquisition; favorable inventory shrinkage results; systems investments, allowing us to better manage in-stock positions; and the addition of key personnel in the buying organization, particularly in the softlines department.            Operating Expenses.     Operating expenses in fiscal 2002 were $229.0 million, or 21.8%, of net sales compared to $204.4 million, or 21.8%, of net sales for fiscal 2001. Operating expense dollars increased primarily due to the Oshman's acquisition. Prior year operating expenses only include Oshman's results after the June 7, 2001 acquisition date compared to a full year of expenses for fiscal 2002. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were consistent with last year due to a continued focus on controlling all costs.            Merger Integration Costs.     Merger integration costs for fiscal 2002 were $0 compared to $12.5 million, or 1.4% of net sales, for fiscal 2001, related to the Oshman's acquisition. We have has not incurred any merger integration costs since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.            Operating Income.     As a result of the factors described above, operating income for fiscal 2002 was $45.9 million or 4.4% of net sales compared to $22.5 million or 2.4% of net sales in fiscal 2001. Excluding integration costs from fiscal 2001, operating income increased $10.9 million and 0.7% from fiscal 2001.            Interest Expense.     Interest expense for fiscal 2002 decreased to $9.2 million, or 0.9% of net sales, from $11.0 million, or 1.2% of net sales in the prior year. The decrease in interest expense is related to lower effective borrowing rates on amounts borrowed in 2002, a settlement with the IRS in the third quarter of 2002 (see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements), lower average debt as a result of the net proceeds from the May 2002 common stock offering, offset by the higher average debt balance due to the acquisition of Oshman's on June 7, 2001 and the shares repurchased under the 2002 common share repurchase program.            Other Income.     Other income was $1.1 million for fiscal 2002 compared to $2.1 million for fiscal 2001. The decrease is primarily attributable to non-recurring items recorded in the prior year, including $0.7 million of income related to a consulting services agreement, $0.3 million of income recognized on the sales of marketable securities, and a one-time gain of $0.2 million on the sale of certain assets that were held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. These items were offset primarily by increased sales tax handling income in the current year, due to increased sales volume as a result of the acquisition of Oshman's.    20                  Income Taxes.     Our income tax expense for fiscal 2002 was $14.6 million compared to $5.3 million in fiscal 2001. Our effective tax expense rate for fiscal 2002 was 38.7% compared to 39.0% in fiscal 2001. The change in our effective tax expense rate in fiscal 2002 was primarily due to changes in permanent tax differences as compared to fiscal 2001.    Fiscal 2001 as compared to Fiscal 2000             Net Sales.     Net sales increased $184.6 million, or 24.6%, to $935.7 million in fiscal 2001 compared to $751.1 million in fiscal 2000. The acquisition of Oshman's increased sales by $203.4 million. Fiscal 2001 consisted of 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks for fiscal 2000. Total net sales, excluding Oshman's and on a comparable 52-week basis decreased by 1.0%. Comparable store sales decreased 0.9% for the comparable 52-week period, primarily due to decreased sales in the hardgoods product category as a result of the decrease in scooter sales. Newly opened stores enter the comparable store sales base at the beginning of their fourteenth full month of operation.            Gross Profit.     Gross profit for fiscal 2001 was $239.4 million or 25.6% of net sales as compared to $191.3 million or 25.5% of net sales for fiscal 2000. The slight increase as a percent to sales was primarily due to continued improvement in the replenishment and allocation of merchandise to our stores offset by increased occupancy costs as a percent of sales.            Operating Expenses.     Operating expenses in fiscal 2001 were $204.4 million, or 21.8%, of net sales compared to $164.5 million, or 21.9% of net sales for fiscal 2000. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses decreased due to continued cost controls, including reduced advertising costs as a percent to sales and corporate payroll cost synergies achieved from the acquisition of Oshman's. These savings were offset by increased depreciation and amortization, primarily due to increased capital spending and amortization of the favorable lease and goodwill assets related to the Oshman's acquisition. The increase in total operating expenses is primarily due to the increased number of stores operated as a result of the acquisition of Oshman's.             Merger Integration Costs.     Merger integration costs associated with the acquisition of Oshman's for fiscal 2001 were $12.5 million, or 1.4% of net sales. These costs consist primarily of $5.7 million of duplicative costs to operate two corporate offices, employee training, and personnel integration, $3.0 million of advertising costs for rebranding of stores and overlapping markets, $2.3 million of costs associated with consolidating and relocating corporate offices and $1.5 million of consulting fees.            Operating Income.     As a result of the factors described above, operating income for fiscal 2001 was $22.5 million or 2.4% of net sales compared to $26.8 million or 3.6% of net sales in fiscal 2000. Operating income excluding integration costs for fiscal 2001was $35.0, or 3.7% of net sales, an increase of $8.2 million and 0.1% as a percent to sales, versus fiscal 2000.            Interest Expense.     Interest expense for fiscal 2001 decreased to $11.0 million, or 1.2% of net sales, from $11.7 million, or 1.6% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the effective borrowing rate (excluding amortization of bank fees) from approximately 8.7% to approximately 6.2%, offset by an increase in the level of borrowings as a result of the Oshman's acquisition.             Other Income.     Other income was $2.1 for fiscal 2001 compared to $0.6 million for fiscal 2000. The increase in other income is primarily due to $0.7 million of income related to a one-time consulting services agreement, $0.3 million of income recognized on the sale of marketable securities and $0.2 million of income generated by the sale of certain nonoperating assets held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to increased sales tax handling income, due to increased sales volume as a result of the acquisition of Oshman's.    21                  Income Taxes.     Our income tax expense for fiscal 2001 was $5.3 million compared to an income tax benefit of $7.4 million in fiscal 2000. Our effective tax expense rate for fiscal 2001 was 39.0% compared to a benefit of 47.2% in fiscal 2000. The income tax benefit in the prior year reflected the reversal of valuation allowances, which had offset previously generated net operating losses, the majority of which were acquired in the purchase of Sportmart during January 1998.    Liquidity and Capital Resources             Our primary capital requirements are for inventory, capital improvements, and pre-opening expenses to support our expansion plans, as well as for various investments in store remodeling, store fixtures and ongoing infrastructure improvements.    Cash Flow Analysis              Fiscal  2002     Fiscal  2001     Fiscal  2000             (dollars in thousands, except ratios)         Cash provided by operating activities     $  20,807     $  12,079     $  15,941       Cash used in investing activities        (25,827  )     (64,414  )     (12,385  )    Cash provided by (used in) financing activities        3,640        55,764        (3,292  )     Capital expenditures     $   25,876     $   23,459     $   12,550       Long-term debt (at end of period)        121,147        158,474        95,900       Working capital (at end of period)        171,799        142,563        113,324       Current ratio (at end of period)        1.84        1.62        1.80       Long-term debt to equity ratio (at end of period)        0.61        1.17        1.08                  Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2002 was primarily the result of net income, adjusted for depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes, offset by payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses and inventory purchases.            Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2002 was primarily for capital expenditures. These expenditures were primarily for new stores, store remodeling, store fixtures, and the purchase or enhancement of certain information systems, including the rollout of a new POS system.             Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2002 related primarily to proceeds from a public stock offering offset by an increase in borrowings under our line of credit due to our stock repurchase program.            Our liquidity and capital needs have principally been met by cash from operations, proceeds from our stock offering and borrowings under a revolving credit facility with CIT/Business Credit, Inc., as agent. In connection with the Oshman's acquisition, we increased our revolving line of credit from $175 million to $300 million. Long-term debt currently consists of borrowings under the revolving credit facility, which allows us to borrow up to 70% of our eligible inventories or the lesser of 75% of eligible inventories or 85% of the net liquidation percentage for one consecutive 90-day period (as defined in the revolving credit facility) during the year. Borrowings are limited to the lesser of $300 million or the amount calculated in accordance with the borrowing base, and are secured by substantially all inventories, trade receivables, equipment, and intangible assets. The lenders may not demand repayment of principal, absent an occurrence of default, prior to June 7, 2005. The revolving credit facility, as amended, contains certain covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest ratios. The terms of our merger agreement with The Sports Authority restrict our ability to pay dividends prior to the consummation of the merger. Our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock is not limited under the revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit does, however, limit the amount    22           of dividends that may be declared or paid on the common stock of our subsidiaries and the amount of loans that may be made to us. Our subsidiaries may loan us amounts needed in the ordinary course of their business, as defined in the credit agreement and in addition, up to $10.0 million in the aggregate and declare up to $6.0 million in dividends each fiscal year. Beginning in August 2002 until August 31, 2003, our subsidiaries may loan us additional amounts, totalling up to $15.0 million, to fund repurchases of our common stock. We are in compliance with all covenants under the revolving credit facility. In connection with the revolving credit facility, we pledged all of the outstanding common stock of our operating retail subsidiaries as collateral.            Under the terms of the revolving credit facility, loan interest is payable monthly at Chase Manhattan Bank's prime rate plus a margin rate that cannot exceed 0.25% or, at our option, at Chase Manhattan Bank's LIBOR rate plus a margin that cannot exceed 2.25%. Our margin rates for the first loan year were 0.0% on prime and 2.0% on LIBOR borrowings. The margin rates on borrowings during the term of the revolving credit facility may be reduced to as low as 0.0% on prime and 1.50% on LIBOR, respectively, if certain Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization ("EBITDA") levels are achieved. The margin rates on current borrowings under the revolving credit facility are 0.0% on prime and 2.00% on LIBOR, based on our historical earnings levels. There was $121.1 million outstanding under the credit facility as of February 1, 2003, and $90.6 million was available for borrowing.            On May 29, 2002, we completed a common stock offering for 3.5 million shares. This offering resulted in net proceeds of approximately $53 million from the sale of 1.75 million shares. The proceeds were used to pay down debt in fiscal 2002. The balance of the shares were sold by various selling stockholders. We did not receive any portion of the proceeds from the sale of shares by selling stockholders.            In fiscal 2002, we repurchased 961,399 shares of our common stock totaling approximately $18.0 million under a common share repurchase program approved by our board of directors. As of February 1, 2003, we have authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to an additional $9.0 million of shares of our common stock. Prior to consummation of the merger, the terms of our merger agreement with The Sports Authority prohibit us from additional repurchases without their prior written consent.             We entered into an interest rate swap agreement on June 28, 2001, expiring on June 30, 2004, and entered into a second interest rate swap agreement on December 11, 2002, expiring on May 31, 2005, to minimize the risks and costs associated with our financing activities. Under the swap agreements, we pay fixed rate interest and receive variable interest rate payments periodically over the life of the instrument. The total notional amounts under the interest rate swaps are $60 million which do not represent the exposure due to credit loss. See note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.            On July 24, 1997, the IRS proposed adjustments to our and our former parent's (now Thrifty Payless Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of RiteAid Corporation) 1992 and 1993 federal income tax returns in conjunction with our former parent's IRS examination. The proposed adjustments related to the manner in which LIFO inventories were characterized on these returns. On November 1, 2002, in order to eliminate the accrual of additional interest on taxes owed to the IRS, we entered into an agreement with the IRS, based upon the terms of the settlement that is currently pending between the IRS and our former parent. Pursuant to the agreement, we paid the IRS taxes of $1.1 million and interest of $0.5 million. We believe this to be a full and complete settlement of all our separate return issues under review by the IRS. The IRS settlement with our former parent has not been finalized. Under the terms of our tax sharing agreement with our former parent, we could be liable for amounts that arise out of our former parent's settlement with the IRS. Based on management's discussions with our former parent and our settlement that was reached with the IRS as described above, we believe our portion of the potential accelerated tax liability from the settlement with the IRS by our former parent    23           ranges from approximately $0 to $3.3 million. We have a long-term deferred tax liability of $3.3 million recorded for the settlement of this matter. We do not expect that any penalties will be assessed relating to this matter although we cannot be certain that penalties will not be assessed. See Notes 12 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements.             Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $32 to $35 million in fiscal 2003. These capital expenditures will be primarily for new store openings, store remodeling, store fixtures, information systems, and distribution center facilities. We lease all of our store locations and intend to continue to finance our new stores with long-term operating leases. Based upon stores opened in fiscal 2001, newly constructed superstores require a cash investment of approximately $1.6 million for a 42,000 square foot store and approximately $1.3 million for a 32,000 square foot store. We opened eight new stores and relocated one store in fiscal 2002. We intend to open approximately fifteen new stores in fiscal 2003. The level of capital improvements will be affected by the mix of new construction versus renovation of existing retail space.             We believe that cash generated from operations, combined with funds available under the revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to fund projected capital expenditures, future common share purchases, if any, and other working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We intend to utilize the revolving credit facility to meet seasonal fluctuations in cash flow requirements.            In conjunction with the pending merger with The Sports Authority, we have received a commitment from CIT to provide us with a secured committed credit facility in the amount of $600 million. We believe that the available resources under this credit facility, combined with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund the combined entity, the costs incurred to integrate the companies as well as non-recurring costs incurred as a result of this transaction.    Contractual obligations and commercial commitments             To facilitate an understanding of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, the following data is provided:    Summary of commercial obligations and commitments             Payments due by period          Total     Within  1 year     2-3 years     4-5 years     After  5 years          (in thousands)      Contractual obligations:                                                    Long term debt     $  121,147     $       $  121,147     $       $         Capital lease obligations        2,183        812        765        601        5       Operating Leases        788,983        76,322        147,964        141,641        423,056                             Total contractual cash obligations     $  912,313     $  77,134     $  269,876     $  142,242     $  423,061                                        Amount of commitment expiration per period          Total     Within  1 year     2-3 years     4-5 years     After  5 years          (in thousands)      Other commercial commitments:                                                    Import letters of credit     $  1,436     $  1,436     $       $       $         Standby letters of credit        3,558        3,558                                                     Total commercial commitments     $  4,994     $  4,994     $       $       $                                 24       NAME="page_dm1399_1_25">         Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management             We entered into an interest rate swap agreement on June 28, 2001, expiring on June 30, 2004, and entered into a second interest rate swap agreement on December 11, 2002, expiring on May 31, 2005, to minimize the risks and costs associated with our financing activities. Under the swap agreements, we pay fixed rate interest and receive variable LIBOR interest rate payments periodically over the life of the instrument. The total notional amounts under the interest rate swaps are $60 million, which do not represent the exposure due to credit loss.            Our interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges, qualifying for the short cut method of assessing effectiveness and are considered highly effective, as defined by FASB Statement No. 133. Under the short cut method there is no need to measure effectiveness of the hedges and there is no charge to earnings for changes in the fair value of the swap agreements. Net settlements on the swap agreements are recorded as interest expense. At February 1, 2003 the fair value of the swap agreements was a loss of $903,000, net of the related tax benefit. The unrealized loss from these interest rate swaps are included in other comprehensive income and is shown as a component of stockholders' equity.            Our exposure to foreign currency risk is not material.     Seasonality and Inflation             The following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in fiscal 2002 and 2001. This information is unaudited, but is prepared on the same basis as the annual financial information and, in the opinion of management, reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented. The results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.             Fiscal 2002             First  Quarter     Second  Quarter     Third  Quarter     Fourth  Quarter             (dollars in millions)         Net sales     $  245.0     $  261.7     $  227.8     $  316.8       % of full year net sales        23.3  %     24.9  %     21.7  %     30.1  %    Operating income     $  6.7     $  12.5     $  3.7     $  23.0                  Fiscal 2001             First  Quarter     Second  Quarter     Third  Quarter     Fourth  Quarter             (dollars in millions)         Net sales     $  162.6     $  237.9     $  219.1     $  316.0       % of full year net sales        17.4  %     25.4  %     23.4  %     33.8  %    Operating income (loss)     $  3.2     $  5.3     $  (1.2  )  $  15.2                  The results for the first two quarters of fiscal year 2001 are not comparable to the other periods presented due to the exclusion of Oshman's results of operations, prior to June 7, 2001, the date of acquisition. The fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter. For fiscal 2002 and 2001, the fourth quarter contributed 30.1% and 33.8%, respectively, of net sales. We believe that two primary factors contribute to this seasonality: first, sales of cold weather sporting goods and ski and snowboard merchandise during the fourth quarter are generally strong in anticipation of the ski and snowboard season; and second, holiday sales contribute significantly to our operating results. As a result of these factors, inventory levels, which gradually increase beginning in April, generally reach their peak in November and then decline to their lowest level following the December holiday season. Any decrease in sales for the fourth quarter, whether due to a slow holiday selling season, poor snowfall in ski areas    25           near our markets or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year.             Although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions, we do not believe that inflation has a material impact on our results of operations. We believe that we are generally able to pass along inflationary increases in costs to our customers.    Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements             In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, 64, Amendment of SFAS No. 13, and Technical Corrections." This statement eliminates extraordinary accounting treatment for reporting gain or loss on debt extinguishment. SFAS No. 145 also amends SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases", to require sale-leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions and changes the provisions under SFAS 13 related to original lessees being relieved of primary obligation under an original lease. SFAS No. 145 also makes various technical corrections to existing pronouncements that are not substantive in nature. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 are effective in fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002 with earlier application encouraged. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 related to SFAS No. 13 are effective for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002, with earlier application encouraged. All other provisions of SFAS No. 145 are effective for financial statements issued on or after May 15, 2002, with earlier application encouraged. Our adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.            In May 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for an exit cost or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, whereas under EITF No. 94-3, a liability was recognized at the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this statement has changed the timing of recognition for certain exit costs, so that certain exit costs are recognized over the period in which the exit activities occur.            In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123". SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for employee stock-based compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosure in annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based compensation and its effect on reported results. The disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 are included in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We continue to apply the principles of APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for our stock-based compensation plans.            In November 2002, the EITF of the FASB issued consensus No. 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor ("EITF 02-16"). EITF No. 02-16 addresses how a reseller of a vendor's products should account for cash consideration received from the vendor and addressed two Issues. On Issue 1, the Task Force reached a consensus that cash consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of cost of sales when recognized in the reseller's income statement. This presumption is overcome when the consideration is    26           a reimbursement for specific, incremental, identifiable costs incurred by the reseller to sell the vendor's products, in which case the cash consideration should be characterized as a reduction of that cost when recognized in the reseller's income statement. Additionally, the Task Force concluded on Issue 2 that a refund or a rebate of a specified amount of cash consideration payable only if the reseller completes a specified level of purchases should be recognized as a reduction of cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation of the cash consideration offered to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by the reseller toward earning the refund or rebate, provided the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable. In its January 2003 meeting, the Task Force amended the transition guidance relative to adoption of EITF 02-16 to require that the consensus on Issue 1 be applied to new arrangements, including modifications of existing arrangements, entered into after December 31, 2002. Issue 2 remains applicable to arrangements entered into after November 21, 2002. We have evaluated the arrangements entered into after either December 31, 2002 for Issue 1 or November 21, 2002 for Issue 2 and concluded that, given the effective start dates of such contracts and the seasonality of our operations, the impact on fiscal 2002 is immaterial. We believe that the provisions of EITF 02-16 could impact our fiscal 2003 by requiring recharacterization of amounts received from vendors from reduction of advertising expense to reduction of cost of inventory purchased. We have not yet completed our assessment on fiscal 2003 of the impact of this ruling and are working with our vendors as new arrangements are negotiated to minimize the effects of EITF 02-16 on our results of operations.            In November 2002, FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees and Indebtedness of Others," ("FIN 45") was issued. This interpretation requires the initial recognition and initial measurement, on a prospective basis only, of guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Additionally, certain disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements ending after December 15, 2002. The disclosures required of us by FIN 45 in its fiscal 2002 consolidated financial statements are in note 13. We do not believe that the adoption of this interpretation in 2003 will have a material impact on our financial statements.    NAME="dm1399_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02669">      ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk                 Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from our long-term debt agreement. Our long-term debt bears interest at variable rates that are tied to either the U.S. prime rate or LIBOR at the time of the borrowing. We maintain portions of our debt in LIBOR tranches that mature in one to nine months. As those tranches mature, the interest rates on our outstanding borrowings are changed to reflect current prime or LIBOR rates. Therefore, our interest expense changes as the prime or LIBOR market rates change. We have entered into two interest rate swap instruments, designated as cash flow hedges, as shown in the following table:       Date  Entered Into       Rate paid     Rate received     Notional amount     Fair value  at 02/01/03       June 28, 2001     5.35  %  3-mo. US Libor     $  20,000,000     $  (1,119,000  )    December 11, 2002     2.95  %  3-mo. US Libor     $  40,000,000     $  (350,000  )               Based on our overall interest rate exposure at February 1, 2003, a hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in interest rates applied to borrowings under our revolving credit facility would change our after-tax earnings by approximately $0.6 million over a 12-month period.            Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates is limited because we do not operate any stores outside of the United States. We do not consider the market risk exposure relating to foreign currency exchange to be material. Foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on us during the quarter or year to date periods in fiscal 2002, 2001 or 2000.    27                  The fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities at February 1, 2003 was $49,000. The fair value of these investments will fluctuate as the quoted market prices of such securities fluctuate. As of February 1, 2003, the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities was $49,000 less than the adjusted basis of those investments. During fiscal 2002, we recorded a realized loss of approximately $105,000 due to a writedown of our marketable securities as a result of an other than temporary decline in the value of the securities. Approximately $29,000 of unrealized holding losses, net of tax arose, after the adjustment for the realized loss included in income before taxes. The remaining unrealized holding loss has not been recognized in our consolidated statement of operations, but rather has been recorded as a component of stockholders' equity in other comprehensive income (loss). The actual gain or loss that we will realize when these investments are sold will depend on the fair value of these securities at the time of sale. Based on our marketable equity securities portfolio and quoted market prices at February 1, 2003, a 50% increase or decrease in the market price of such securities would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $24,400 in the fair value of the marketable equity securities portfolio. Although changes in quoted market prices may affect the fair value of the marketable equities securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses, such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold or determined to have a decline in value, which is other than temporary.
