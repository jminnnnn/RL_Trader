PART I  ITEM 1. and ITEM 2. Business and Properties  General    Gart Sports Company (the "Company" or "Gart Sports") is one of the leading sporting goods retailers in the midwest and western United States and the leading full-line sporting goods retailer in the Rocky Mountain region in terms of sales and number of stores. The Company's business strategy is to provide its customers with an extensive selection of high quality, brand name merchandise at competitive prices with exceptional customer service. The Company operated 125 sporting goods stores in 16 states as of January 30, 1999, the end of its 1998 fiscal year. The Company's executive offices are located at 1001 Lincoln Avenue, Denver, Colorado 80203, and its telephone number is (303) 861-1122. The Company's web site, which is not part of this Annual Report is http://www.gartsports.com.    The Company acquired Sportmart, Inc. ("Sportmart") on January 9, 1998 in a transaction involving the issuance of 2,180,656 shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.01 (the "Common Stock"), in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of Sportmart. At the time of the Sportmart acquisition, Sportmart operated 59 stores in the midwest and western United States, none of which overlapped with markets served by Gart Sports stores. With the Sportmart acquisition, the Company became the second largest, publicly traded, full-line sporting goods retailer in the United States, based upon revenues.    Founded in 1928, the Company operates under the Gart Sports and Sportmart names in Colorado, California, Illinois, Utah, Idaho, Minnesota, Washington, Ohio, Wyoming, Montana, Oregon, Wisconsin, Indiana, Iowa, Nevada and New Mexico. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1993 and operates through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Gart Bros. Sporting Goods Company ("Gart Bros.") and Sportmart.  Industry Overview    The retail sporting goods industry is comprised of four principal categories of retailers: (i) large format sporting goods stores, which typically range from 30,000 to 100,000 square feet in size and emphasize high sales volumes and a large number of SKUs in a warehouse-style store, (ii) traditional sporting goods stores, which typically range in size from 5,000 to 20,000 square feet and carry a more limited assortment of merchandise and are often viewed by their customers as convenient neighborhood stores, (iii) specialty sporting goods stores, consisting of specialty stores and pro shops, generally specializing in one product category of sporting goods, and (iv) mass merchandisers, including discount retailers, warehouse clubs and department stores, which although generally price competitive, have limited customer service and a more limited selection.    The sporting goods industry in the United States is characterized by fragmented competition, limited assortments from traditional sporting goods retailers, customer preference for one-stop shopping convenience and the growing importance of delivering value to the customer through selection, service and price. The Company believes that these characteristics of the sporting goods industry make the Company's superstore format particularly well suited to grow and increase the Company's market share relative to traditional sporting goods stores, specialty sporting goods retailers, mass merchandisers and other large format sporting goods retailers.  Business Strategy    The Company's business strategy is to provide its customers with an extensive selection of high quality, brand name merchandise at competitive prices with exceptional customer service. The key elements of the Company's business strategy are the following:      Broad Assortment of Quality, Brand Name Products. The Company offers a   wide selection of quality, brand name apparel and equipment at competitive   prices designed to appeal to both the casual sporting                                         1     goods customer and the sports enthusiast for their complete sporting goods   needs. The Company carries 50,000 active SKUs, including popular brands   such as Coleman, Columbia, K2, Nike, Rawlings, Reebok, Rollerblade,   Rossignol, Spalding, Speedo and Wilson. The Company's customer service,   expert technicians and specialty store presentation enable it to purchase   directly from manufacturers, full product lines that are typically only   available in specialty stores and pro shops, such as Callaway, Cobra,   Taylor Made and Armour Golf golf clubs, The North Face apparel and   equipment, Glock and Weatherby firearms, Volkl and Volant ski equipment and   Burton snowboard equipment.      Exceptional Customer Service. The Company has always made customer   service its top priority in its stores. The Company's strategy is to   provide its customers with a high level of service that is generally   associated with specialty sporting goods stores and pro shops. Efforts are   made to hire sales associates and sports technicians who are knowledgeable   and enthusiastic about the products they sell or service. The Company   supports its sales associates by providing ongoing training with respect to   the performance attributes and technical aspects of its merchandise,   including conducting regular manufacturers' clinics. An initial training   program, "Base Basics," gives the sales associates the resources to   interact with customers. In addition, the Company offers special customer   services such as equipment rental, on-site repair centers, instructional   courses, discounted ski lift tickets and hunting and fishing licenses.      Attractive Shopping Environment. The Company seeks to offer a uniquely   attractive shopping environment that showcases the breadth of the Company's   product offerings and reinforces the Company's distinctive brand image. The   Company's brightly lit stores are designed to project a clean, upscale   atmosphere, with a user-friendly layout featuring wide aisles, well-   organized merchandise displays and clearly defined departments arranged in   a logical and convenient floorplan. The Company believes that this   customer-oriented shopping environment helps distinguish its stores from   the warehouse format offered by many of its competitors.      Customized Merchandise Mix. The Company tailors its product mix to local   demographics and lifestyles based on the Company's experience and market   research. Purchasing decisions are made on a regional, and sometimes a   store by store, basis and store operations work directly with the Company's   buyers to revise the product mix in each store. Various factors typically   influence the product mix in a particular market, such as disposable   income, professional and amateur sports activities, specific regional and   seasonal activities, and recreational licenses.      Promotional Advertising and Marketing. The Company uses a promotional   pricing and advertising strategy focused on the creation of "events" to   drive traffic and sales in its stores. Each event is based upon either a   key shopping period such as the winter holidays, Father's Day, and Back-to-   School or a specific sales or promotional event, including the annual   Sniagrab ("bargains" spelled backwards) sale, which the Company believes is   the largest pre-season ski and snowboard sale in the United States. The   Company's strategy of clustering stores in major markets enables it to   employ an aggressive advertising strategy on a cost-effective basis,   utilizing newspaper, radio and television.    As part of the integration of the Sportmart stores, the Company has established a four year store remodel schedule, expanded the brand name product mix in the Sportmart stores and increased the frequency of Sportmart's advertising.  Merchandising    The Company offers its customers over 50,000 active SKUs of high quality brand name merchandise in over 100 categories of sporting goods and apparel. The Company provides an assortment of products typically found only in a large format sporting goods store with the presentation and service typical of specialty stores and pro shops. As a result of its exceptional customer service, expert technicians and specialty store presentation, the Company has direct vendor access to full lines of brands not typically found in its warehouse format sporting goods competitors.                                         2     Historically, the largest percentage of Gart Sports stores have been based in the Rocky Mountain region, resulting in a heavier concentration of winter sporting equipment and apparel than a typical warehouse format sporting goods store. The Company believes that the quality and breadth of its winter sports merchandise has contributed to its strong reputation in the Rocky Mountain region compared to other large format competitors with less experience marketing winter sporting goods. In addition, the Company believes that its ability to manage the complex inventory requirements of the winter product line, which is characterized by a short selling season and peak selling periods at the beginning and end of the selling season, gives it an important competitive advantage. Hardlines decreased as a percentage of sales in 1998 compared to 1997 due to the warm weather in markets of some of the stores.    The following table sets forth the percentage of total net sales for each major product category for each of the Company's last three fiscal years:                                                            Fiscal Years                                              -----------------------------------                                                 1998       1997(1)     1996(1)                                              ----------- ----------- -----------                                              (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited)             Hardlines................................     47.9%       49.4%       48.7%    Softlines:     Apparel.................................     26.0        30.4        30.9     Footwear................................     26.1        20.2        20.4                                                 -----       -----       -----        Subtotal.............................     52.1        50.6        51.3                                                 -----       -----       -----        Total................................    100.0%      100.0%      100.0%                                                 =====       =====       =====     (1) Historical Gart Sports only balances.   Winter Equipment and Apparel    The Company believes that its stores offer the widest selection of ski and snowboard merchandise in the Rocky Mountain region. This extensive selection consists of winter sports apparel, accessories and equipment, including a broad selection of apparel and equipment for nordic (cross country) skiing. Gart Sports has become a leader in the snowboard industry, which began in the early 1990s, with its wide range of snowboard-related products, including snowboards, boots, bindings and apparel. The Company offers products from a wide variety of well-known winter sports equipment and apparel suppliers, including the following:                 Airwalk       Elan                 Kombi             Quiksilver         Spyder    Atomic        Fisher               Lamar             RD                 Tecnica    Bogner        Gordini              Lange             Roffe              The North Face    Burton        Grandoe              Leki              Rossignol          Thule    Columbia      Head                 Marker            Salomon            Tyrolia    Descente      Helly Hansen         Nils              Santa Cruz         Vans    Duofold       K2                   Nordica           Scott              Volant    Dynastar      Karhu                Obermeyer         Skea               Volkl     In addition to offering the most widely known and available popular brands, Gart Sports stores carry full lines of winter equipment and apparel from manufacturers that are typically only available in specialty stores, such as Volkl, Volant, The North Face and Bogner.    Many stores also rent winter sports equipment, including skis, snowboards, boots and poles. The rental equipment ranges from entry-level products designed for beginners to advanced products for more accomplished skiers and snowboarders. Other services offered in these stores include advanced demo ski programs, custom boot fitting, complete ski and snowboard repair facilities, each with specialized equipment, and the convenience of in-store discounted lift ticket sales to area resorts.                                         3     The Company has strengthened the winter equipment and apparel category in the Sportmart stores as appropriate. In addition, the Company introduced a larger breadth and depth of merchandise, additional quality name brands, and more specialized customer service to the Sportmart stores.   Footwear, In-line Skates and General Apparel    The Company stores carry a complete line of athletic footwear, sportswear and apparel designed for a wide variety of activities and performance levels. Footwear is available for such diverse activities as basketball, baseball, football, soccer, tennis, golf, aerobics, running, walking, cycling, hiking, cross-training, wrestling and snowshoeing. The Company is also a major retailer of in-line skates and ice skates. The Company's wide variety of sportswear and apparel include a broad selection of licensed apparel for professional and college teams. Special services in this area include in-line skate repair, bearing and wheel changes, and training and safety programs designed to help new skate owners safely develop their in-line skating skills. The Company's extensive variety of well-known apparel and footwear vendors includes the following:                 Adidas        Converse        Merrell          Puma          Sorel    Antiqua       Danner          Mitre            Quiksilver    Speedo    Asics         Danskin         Mizuno           Reebok        Starter    Avia          Fila            Moving Comfort   Polo Sport    Tecnica    Bauer         Hi-Tech         Nautica          Rollerblade   Teva    Birkenstock   K2              New Balance      Russell       The North Face    Browning      K-Swiss         Nike             Salomon       Thorlo    Champion      Logo Athletic   No Fear          Saucony       Tyr    Columbia      Marika          Pro Player       Sketchers     Vans     Sportmart historically had higher footwear sales as a percentage of store sales than Gart Sports stores. The Company believes that this success is partially attributable to Sportmart's self-service format and display of footwear and has implemented a modified self-service format in the new Gart Sports stores.

The Company offers a broad range of brand name equipment for traditional team sports, including football, baseball, basketball, hockey, volleyball and soccer.

Based on more than 70 years of experience in the sporting goods retail industry, the Company has developed two superstore prototypes designed to feature the quality and variety of brand name merchandise, the breadth of product selection and the high levels of customer service that are the foundation of the Company's strong reputation. The Company typically penetrates larger, multiple store markets primarily with its 42,000 square foot prototype superstore and smaller single-store markets with its 33,000 square foot prototype superstore. The Company has determined that these superstore formats provide the best opportunity for growth.    The prototype superstore layout features a racetrack configuration with apparel and specialty brand shops in the middle of the store and the specialty hardlines departments along the outside of the racetrack. The lighting, flooring and color scheme is designed to enhance the presentation of the merchandise and avoid a warehouse-type atmosphere. The apparel is displayed prominently to showcase the quality brand names. In addition, many of the Company's stores feature specialized brand shops for vendors such as Nike, Columbia, The North Face and Adidas, which offer a broad array of vendor- specific products in specialized, image-enhancing fixtures. The visibility of the branded apparel and the feature shops emphasize the quality image and brand assortment of the Company's stores.    Specialty departments are located adjacent to other related departments and apparel assortments to increase customer convenience and to stimulate cross- purchasing. The specialty departments display merchandise on low racking to allow customers easy access to products and to promote storewide visibility and easy department identification. The specialty departments use the walls effectively to display merchandise in order to convey the depth and breadth of product selection. Department layouts are adjusted periodically to make room for seasonal products.    The Company's superstores average approximately 42,000 square feet in size. Each store is designed to provide ample space for the store's customers to shop the Company's extensive depth of product. Generally, 80% of store space is dedicated to selling while 20% is used for office and non-retail functions. The Company plans to remodel 17 stores in fiscal 1999. In certain stores, the Company plans to improve the shopping environment with clearer sight lines, warmer flooring and color schemes and improved visual design. In some instances, department size and adjacencies will be tailored to regional and seasonal needs to improve the stores' shopability.                                          6     The Company's 20 non-superstore freestanding and strip center stores more closely resemble traditional sporting goods stores and range in size from 9,000 to 31,000 square feet. The Company's 16 stores in enclosed shopping malls average 13,000 square feet and carry a selection of merchandise that appeals to the mall-oriented shopper, focusing on apparel and footwear. The Company's six resort stores range in size from 7,000 to 27,000 square feet and provide a broader merchandise selection and lower prices than typically available in resort areas, while offering a high level of customer service.   Customer Service    The Company's objective is to provide the exceptional level of service generally associated with specialty sporting goods stores and pro shops. To accomplish this high standard, the Company's strategy is to hire sales associates and sports technicians who are knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the products they sell or service. Sales associates are required to attend product training clinics sponsored by individual vendors as well as Company sponsored seminars on topics such as customer service and selling skills. An independent professional shopping service randomly monitors the stores for compliance with the Company's customer service standards. In addition, the Company offers its customers special services including special order capability, equipment rental, on-site repair centers, instructional courses, discounted ski lift tickets and hunting and fishing licenses. The Company strives to provide the highest level of technical support.   Operations and Training    Typically, the Company's superstores have 55 to 80 sales associates and technicians, while its non-superstore stores employ a staff of approximately 20 to 25. Additional part-time sales associates are hired during the holiday season and for the Sniagrab pre-season ski sale.    The Company employs a store manager, a sales and merchandise manager in each store. Store managers report to a district manager having responsibility for all stores in a limited geographic region. There are currently 17 district managers who report to three regional managers.    The Company's new store managers are either promoted internally or hired as trainees. The Company places significant emphasis on training store-level management. Training new store managers is a two-step process which involves participation in a formalized training program covering, among other things, time management, staff selection, scheduling, employee training, customer service and retail selling skills. The management trainee then becomes a manager in training at one of the Company's stores. Upon completion of this program, management trainees are eligible to be promoted to the position of sales or merchandise manager and later to store manager.    The Company's stores are open seven days a week, generally from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday; and 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on Sunday. Store hours are adjusted for individual markets as necessary.  Site Selection and Location    In choosing appropriate markets, the Company considers the demographic and lifestyle characteristics of a market, including, among other factors, the following: levels of disposable income; local population and buying patterns; enthusiasm for outdoor recreation; popularity of collegiate and professional sports teams; and level of affinity for regional sports activities.                                         7     The following table sets forth the location, by state, of the Company's stores, as of April 7, 1999:                                                                       Total Number    State                    Superstores Resort Stores Other Stores  of Stores    -----                    ----------- ------------- ------------ ------------               Colorado................       8            3           18           29    California..............      27           --           --           27    Illinois................      15           --           --           15    Utah....................       4            2            9           15    Washington..............       9           --           --            9    Idaho...................       1           --            6            7    Minnesota...............       5           --           --            5    Wyoming.................      --            1            3            4    Ohio....................       3           --           --            3    Oregon..................       3           --           --            3    Wisconsin...............       2           --           --            2    Montana.................       2           --           --            2    New Mexico..............       2           --           --            2    Nevada..................       1           --           --            1    Indiana.................       1           --           --            1    Iowa....................       1           --           --            1                                 ---          ---          ---          ---        Total...............      84            6           36          126                                 ===          ===          ===          ===     The Company plans to open new stores primarily in existing markets to further leverage the Company's fixed cost structure, advertising program and distribution system. The Company intends to open four additional stores in fiscal 1999.  Management Information Systems    Over the last five years the Company has installed sophisticated management information systems which use JDA retail software operating on an IBM AS/400 platform. The Company utilizes IBM 4680 and 4690 point-of-sale systems that incorporate scanning, price look-up, zone pricing support and store level access to the Company's merchandise information system. The Company's management information systems fully integrate purchasing and sales reporting and inventory information down to the SKU level and have allowed the Company to improve overall inventory management by identifying individual SKU movement and projecting trends and replenishment needs on a timely basis. These systems have enabled the Company to increase margins by reducing inventory investment, strengthening in-stock positions, reducing the Company's historical shrinkage levels, and creating store level perpetual inventories and automatic inventory replenishment on basic items of merchandise. The Company is continuing to invest in hardware and software, and has hired additional systems staff to assist in the development of enhancements such as data warehousing and electronic data interchange to improve the Company's ability to systematically manage its inventory. In addition, the Company has installed a frame relay data and voice communications system to enhance the overall efficiency of the management information systems.    The Company's continuing development of enhancements to its management information systems includes data warehousing, advanced use of electronic data interchange, radio frequency portable data terminals, and store-level planning and allocation capability. These enhancements are intended to:    . Improve the Company's management of the flow of merchandise from supplier     through distribution facilities and retail stores;    . Improve customer service through the reduction and automation of other     tasks in the stores;    . Reduce distribution costs;    . Provide for more effective store assortments; and    . Provide detailed information on key business performance indicators.                                          8   Advertising and Promotion    The Company's comprehensive marketing program is designed to promote the Company's quality image and extensive selection of brand name products at competitive prices. The program is centered on extensive newspaper advertising supplemented by television, radio and billboard ads. The advertising strategy is focused on weekly newspaper advertising utilizing both four-page pre- printed flyer inserts and standard run of press (ROP) advertising, with additional emphasis on key shopping periods, such as the winter holidays, Father's Day and Back-to-School, and on specific sales and promotional events, including the annual Sniagrab sale, which the Company believes is the largest pre-season ski and snowboard sales event in the United States.    The Company's strategy of clustering stores in major markets enables it to employ an aggressive advertising strategy on a cost-effective basis through the use of newspaper, radio and television advertising. The Company's goal is to be one of the dominant sporting goods advertisers in each of its markets. The Company advertises in major metropolitan newspapers as well as regional newspapers circulated in areas surrounding its store locations. Newspaper advertising typically consists of weekly promotional ads with three-color inserts on a semi-monthly basis. Television advertising is generally concentrated three to four days prior to a promotional event or key shopping period. Radio advertising is used primarily to publicize specific promotions in conjunction with newspaper advertising or to announce a public relations promotion or grand opening. Billboards emphasizing the Company's image and high quality brand name merchandise are strategically located on high traffic thoroughfares near store locations. Vendor payments under cooperative advertising arrangements with the Company as well as vendor buy-ins to sponsor sporting events and programs have significantly contributed to the Company's advertising leverage.    The Company's advertising is designed to create an "event" in the stores and to drive customer traffic with advertisements promoting a wide variety of sale priced merchandise appropriate for the current holiday or event. In addition to holidays, the Company's events include the Sniagrab sale, celebrity autograph sessions, events related to local sports teams, race sponsorships and registrations, vendor demonstrations and other activities that attract customers to its stores. The Company's marketing program is administered by an in-house staff.    The Company sponsors tournaments and amateur competitive events in an effort to align itself with both the serious sports enthusiast and the recreational athlete. The Company is also recognized as a major sponsor of professional sport teams in its markets, including, from time to time, the Denver Broncos, Colorado Rockies, Chicago Bulls, Cubs, Blackhawks and Bears, the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Seattle Supersonics, the Minnesota Twins and Vikings, the Milwaukee Brewers and the San Francisco Giants.  Purchasing and Distribution    The Company's purchasing department is composed of two Senior Vice Presidents of Merchandising, four Vice Presidents and 19 buyers. The buying group has an average of approximately 15 years of retail experience. In addition to merchandise procurement, the buying staff is also responsible for determining initial pricing and working with the allocation and replenishment groups to establish stock levels and product mix. The buying staff also regularly communicates with store operations to monitor shifts in consumer tastes and market trends.    The Company's merchandise allocation and control department (the "MAC Group") is responsible for merchandise distribution, inventory control, and the E3 Replenishment Purchasing and Allocation System. It acts as the central processing intermediary between the buying staff and the Company's stores. The MAC Group also coordinates the inventory levels necessary for each advertising promotion with the buying staff and the advertising department. The MAC Group tracks the effectiveness of each ad to allow the buying staff and the advertising department to determine the relative success of each promotional program. In addition, the MAC Group implements price changes, creates all reorders of basic merchandise purchases, determining minimum/maximum levels for individual stores on particular items.                                          9     The Company purchases merchandise from over 1,000 vendors and has no long- term purchase commitments. During fiscal 1998, Nike, the Company's largest vendor, represented approximately 13.4% of the Company's purchases. No other vendor represented more than 5.0%.    The Company utilizes a "hub and spoke" distribution system in which vendors ship directly to central distribution centers serving regional stores. Management believes that its distribution system has the following advantages as compared to a direct delivery (i.e., drop shipping) system utilized by other retailers: reduced individual store inventory investment; more timely replenishment of store inventory needs; better use of relatively higher cost store floor space; and easier returns to vendors. This "hub and spoke" distribution system is utilized by many major volume retailers such as Wal- Mart, Toys "R" Us and Circuit City.    The Company has three regional distribution centers: (1) a 240,000 square foot facility located in Denver, Colorado, (2) a 202,500 square foot facility located in Fontana, California, and (3) a 141,000 square foot facility located in Woodridge, Illinois. Inventory arriving at the distribution centers is allocated directly to the stores or to the distribution center or to both. Seasonal and limited purchase inventory is fully distributed to all stores. Big ticket and bulk items (such as treadmills, indoor games and bicycles) are allocated to the stores largely on a percentage basis with the balance remaining in the distribution centers for future replenishment. An automated reorder system regularly replenishes the stores by allocating merchandise from the distribution centers based on each store's sales. This system has significantly reduced the need for back-stock in the stores. The E3 replenishment system that generates the purchase of the vast majority of the "basics" that the Company sells utilizes the "hub and spoke" distribution method. The Company plans to continue adding SKUs to this automated reorder system.    The Company operates tractor trailers for delivering merchandise from its Denver distribution center to its Colorado stores and contracts with common carriers to deliver merchandise to its stores outside a 400 mile radius from Denver and to its stores receiving merchandise from the Company's Fontana, California and Woodridge, Illinois distribution centers. The Company believes that its three distribution centers are adequate to service the Company's current and expansion needs for the foreseeable future.  Competition    The retail sporting goods industry is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. While the Company's competition differs by market, there are four general categories of sporting goods retailers with which the Company competes: large format sporting goods stores, traditional sporting goods stores, specialty sporting goods stores and mass merchandisers.    Large Format Sporting Goods Stores. Stores in this category include Galyans, Jumbo Sports, The Sports Authority, Sport Chalet and Oshman's, typically range from 30,000 to 100,000 square feet in size and tend to be destination (freestanding or strip shopping center anchor) locations. Most large format sporting goods stores emphasize high sales volumes and a large number of SKUs.    Traditional Sporting Goods Stores. This category consists of traditional sporting goods chains, such as Big 5 and Hibbetts, as well as local independent sporting goods retailers. These stores typically range in size from 5,000 to 20,000 square feet and are frequently located in regional malls and strip shopping centers. Traditional chains and local sporting goods stores often carry a more limited assortment of merchandise and are commonly viewed by their customers as convenient neighborhood stores.    Specialty Sporting Goods Stores. This category consists of specialty stores and pro shops specializing in certain categories of sporting goods. Examples include such national retail chains as The Athlete's Foot, Champs, Finish Line, Foot Locker, Just for Feet, REI, Pro Discount Golf and Nevada Bob's. These retailers are highly focused, selling generally only one product category such as athletic footwear, ski or snowboard equipment, backpacking and mountaineering, or golf and tennis equipment and apparel.                                        10     Mass Merchandisers. Stores in this category include discount retailers such as Target, Kmart and Wal-Mart, warehouse clubs such as Costco, and department stores such as JC Penney and Sears. These stores range in size from approximately 50,000 to 200,000 square feet and are primarily located in regional malls and strip shopping centers. Sporting goods merchandise and apparel represent a small portion of the total merchandise in these stores and the selection is often more limited than in other sporting goods retailers. Although generally price competitive, the Company believes that discount and department stores have limited customer service because the store personnel often lack product expertise in the selling of sporting goods.    The Company believes that although it will continue to face competition from retailers in each of these categories, the most significant competition will be from the large format sporting goods stores. The Company faces direct competition from large format sporting goods stores, including Sport Chalet in California; The Sports Authority in California, Illinois and Washington; Jumbo Sports in Colorado, Illinois and Iowa; Dick's Clothing and Sporting Goods in Ohio; Galyans (a subsidiary of The Limited) in Indiana, Minnesota and Ohio; and Oshman's in California, Minnesota, New Mexico, Utah and Washington. The principal competitive factors include store location and image, product selection, quality and price, and customer service. Increased competition in markets in which the Company has stores, the adoption by competitors of innovative store formats and retail sales methods or the entry of new competitors or the expansion of operations by existing competitors in the Company's markets could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, certain of the Company's competitors have substantially greater resources than the Company. The Company believes that the principal strengths with which it competes are its broad selection and competitive prices combined with superior customer service and brand names typically available only in specialty stores and pro shops.  Properties    The Company currently leases all of its store locations. Most leases provide for the payment of minimum annual rent subject to periodic adjustments, plus other charges, including a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance. The Company has identified certain markets for strategic repositioning and plans to address the positioning of each store as leases expire and as opportunities arise. Leases for ten of the Company's non- superstore format stores have expired or are expiring by the end of fiscal 1999. Four of such stores are occupied on a month-to-month basis, two of such stores will be closed and four stores are subject to leases with an option to renew or relocate. In addition, the lease for one Sportmart store was terminated in 1998 by mutual agreement. As part of its repositioning strategy, the Company regularly evaluates whether to renew store leases in existing locations or to strategically relocate some of the stores to better locations and replace them with larger stores. The Company believes that at store locations where it chooses to remain and renew expired leases, the Company can do so on favorable terms. Leases for the Company's 84 Superstores expire between 2000 and 2018. The Company anticipates that all of its new stores will have long-term leases, typically 15 years, with multiple five-year renewal options.    Seven of the leases for the Company's stores are with partnerships, the partners of which are certain former officers or directors of Sportmart (including Messrs. Larry and Andrew Hochberg, currently directors of the Company) and their family members (the "Hochberg Partnerships"). In addition, the Company leases from Hochberg Partnerships three stores that the Company no longer occupies but sublets. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."    In addition, as a result of the closing of Sportmart's Canadian subsidiary, the Company remains secondarily liable for two leases the Company has assigned in Canada and has a contingent liability behind two other parties with respect to a portion of a third location in Canada. The Company has sublet the former Sportmart corporate offices in Wheeling, Illinois.    The Company owns a vacant Sportmart store located in Edmonton, Canada, which is being marketed for sale. In December 1998, the Company sold a five-acre tract of land located in Orland Park, Illinois.                                        11     The Company also leases its three regional distribution centers. The lease for the 240,000 square foot distribution center in Denver, Colorado, expires in 2004 with a ten year renewal option. The lease for the 202,500 square foot distribution center in Fontana, California expires in 2008, assuming all options are exercised. The lease for the 141,000 square foot distribution center in Woodridge, Illinois expires in 2007, assuming all options are exercised.    In January 1998, the Company entered into a lease for approximately 22,000 square feet of additional corporate office space located adjacent to the Denver Sportscastle store. This lease expires in 2017.  Employees    At April 7, 1999, the Company employed approximately 5,500 individuals, 47% of whom were employed on a full-time basis and 53% of whom were employed on a part-time (less than 32 hours per week) basis. Due to the seasonal nature of the Company's business, total employment fluctuates during the year. The Company considers its employee relations to be good. None of the Company's employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  Trademarks and Tradenames    The Company uses the Gart Sports(R), Gart Bros. Sporting Goods Company(R), Gart Sports Superstore(R), Sniagrab(R), Sportscastle(R), Gart Sports Company(R) and SWAT(R) trademarks and trade names, which have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Sportmart(R) and Sportmart's corporate logo are federally registered servicemarks of the Company. The Company also owns numerous other trademarks and servicemarks which involve the manufacturing of soft goods, advertising slogans, promotional event names and store names used in its business.  ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings    The Company is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of its business. The Company believes that the outcome of all such pending legal proceedings to which it is a party will not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, or operating results.    On July 24, 1997, the Internal Revenue System proposed adjustments to the 1992 and 1993 consolidated federal income tax returns of the Company and its former parent company, now Thrifty PayLess Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of RiteAid Corporation, and the manner in which LIFO inventories were characterized on such returns. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  ITEM 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders    No matters were put to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998.                                        12                                       PART II  ITEM 5. Market Price of Common Stock and Related Stockholder Matters    The Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq National Market on January 9, 1998 under the symbol "GRTS." As of April 7, 1999, there were approximately 257 holders of record of Common Stock. The number of holders of Common Stock does not include the beneficial owners of Common Stock whose shares are held in the name of banks, brokers, nominees or other fiduciaries. The table below sets forth the reported high and low closing sales prices of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market during the periods presented:                                                                     High     Low                                                                 ------- -------           For Fiscal Year 1999     First quarter (through April 26, 1999)..................... $ 8.125 $ 5.750    For Fiscal Year 1998     First quarter ............................................. $17.250 $12.750     Second quarter............................................. $18.000 $12.500     Third quarter.............................................. $16.375 $ 6.750     Fourth quarter............................................. $10.375 $ 5.625    For the 28 Day Period Ended January 31, 1998................ $14.000 $12.500     The Company has never declared or paid any dividends on its Common Stock. The Company plans to retain earnings, if any, to finance future growth and has no current plans to pay cash dividends to stockholders. The payment of any future cash dividends will be at the sole discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, future earnings, capital requirements, and the general financial condition of the Company. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations --Liquidity and Capital Resources." In addition, the Company's revolving line of credit limits the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on the Common Stock.                                        13   ITEM 6. Selected Financial Data    The selected data presented below under the captions "Statement of Operations Data" and "Balance Sheet Data" for and as of the end of each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 30, 1999, and the 28 day period ended January 31, 1998 are derived from the Company's audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and should be read in conjunction therewith. This data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company, the notes thereto and other financial information of the Company included elsewhere in this report. The "Statement of Operations Data" and "Balance Sheet Data" for each of the fiscal years in the two year period ended January 6, 1996 are derived from audited consolidated financial statements not included in this report.    Management does not believe that the results of operations for the transition period are necessarily indicative of future results, due to the effects of seasonality and costs associated with the Sportmart acquisition. Therefore, the results of operations for the transition period are not comparable to other presented periods. Fiscal year 1998 results are not comparable to the transition period ended January 31, 1998, or fiscal 1997, 1996, 1995 and 1994 which represent the results of Gart Sports only, before the acquisition of Sportmart.                                        28 days ended                Fiscal Years (1)                           Fiscal     January 31,      ------------------------------------------                          Year 1998      1998            1997       1996       1995       1994                          ---------  -------------     ---------  ---------  ---------  ---------                                     (Dollars in thousands, except per share)              STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS  DATA: Net sales............... $ 658,047    $  38,825       $ 228,379  $ 204,126  $ 176,829  $ 171,866 Cost of goods sold,  buying, distribution  and occupancy..........

Accordingly, fiscal 1997 began on      January 5, 1997 and ended on January 3, 1998 and included 52 weeks of      operations; fiscal 1996 began on January 7, 1996 and ended on January 4,      1997 and included 52 weeks of                                        14        operations; and fiscal 1995 began on January 1, 1995 and ended on January      6, 1996 and included 53 weeks of operations. During 1998, the Company      adopted an annual fiscal reporting period that ends on the Saturday closest      to the end of January. Accordingly, fiscal 1998 began on February 1, 1998      and ended on January 30, 1999 and included 52 weeks of operations.  (2)  Stores enter the comparable store sales base at the beginning of their      14th month of operation. The 59 Sportmart stores acquired on January 9,      1998 are included in comparable store sales bases utilizing historical      Sportmart comparable store data.  (3)  EBITDA is earnings (loss) before income taxes plus interest expense and      other financing costs and depreciation and amortization. Gart Sports      believes that, in addition to cash flows from operations and net income      (loss), EBITDA is a useful financial performance measurement for      assessing operating performance as it provides an additional basis to      evaluate the ability of Gart Sports to incur and service debt and to fund      capital expenditures. In evaluating EBITDA, Gart Sports believes that      consideration should be given, among other things, to the amount by which      EBITDA exceeds interest costs for the period, how EBITDA compares to      principal repayments on debt for the period and how EBITDA compares to      capital expenditures for the period. To evaluate EBITDA, the components      of EBITDA such as revenue and operating expenses and the variability of      such components over time should also be considered. EBITDA should not be      construed, however, as an alternative to operating income (loss) (as      determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles      (GAAP)) as an indicator of Gart Sports' operating performance or to cash      flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP)      as a measure of liquidity. Gart Sports' method of calculating EBITDA may      differ from methods used by other companies, and as a result, EBITDA      measures disclosed herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled      measures used by other companies.  (4)  Represents the 59 Sportmart stores acquired on January 9, 1998 and one      new store opened in January 1998.                                        15                       MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF                  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and the notes thereto and the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, included elsewhere in this report.    During 1995, the Company adopted an annual fiscal reporting period that ends on the first Saturday in January. Accordingly, fiscal 1997 began on January 5, 1997 and ended on January 3, 1998 and included 52 weeks of operations. Fiscal 1996 began on January 7, 1996 and ended on January 4, 1997 and included 52 weeks of operations. Fiscal 1995 began on January 1, 1995 and ended on January 6, 1996 and included 53 weeks of operations. During 1998, the Company adopted an annual fiscal reporting period that ends on the Saturday closest to the end of January. Accordingly, fiscal 1998 began on February 1, 1998 and ended on January 30, 1999 and included 52 weeks of operations. The 28 day period following the end of fiscal 1997 through January 31, 1998 has been reported as a transition period.    In fiscal 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information", which establishes annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise's operating segments and related disclosures about its products, services, major customers and the material countries in which the entity holds assets and reports revenues. The Company is a leading retailer of sporting goods in the midwest and western United States. Given the economic characteristics of the store formats, the similar nature of the products sold, the type of customer and method of distribution, the operations of the Company are aggregated in one reportable segment.    Management does not believe that the results of operations for the transition period is necessarily indicative of future results, due to the effects of seasonality and costs associated with the Sportmart acquisition. Therefore, the results of operations for the transition period are not comparable to other presented periods. Fiscal year 1998 results are not comparable to the transition period ended January 31, 1998, or fiscal 1997 and 1996, which represent the results of Gart Sports prior to the acquisition of Sportmart.  Results of Operations    The following table sets forth for the periods indicated, certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales and the number of stores open at the end of each period:                                              28 days ended                           Fiscal 1998    January 31, 1998     Fiscal 1997    Fiscal 1996                          --------------  ------------------  -------------  -------------                          Dollars    %    Dollars      %      Dollars   %    Dollars   %                          -------  -----  ------------------  ------- -----  ------- -----                  Net sales............... $658.0   100.0%  $  38.8     100.0% $228.4  100.0% $204.1  100.0% Cost of goods sold,  buying, distribution  and occupancy..........  503.9    76.6      31.9      82.2   164.3   71.9   148.4   72.7                          ------   -----   -------  --------  ------  -----  ------  ----- Gross profit............  154.1    23.4       6.9      17.8    64.1   28.1    55.7   27.3 Operating expenses......  148.3    22.5      11.4      29.4    52.7   23.2    47.6   23.4 Merger integration  costs..................    2.9     0.4       3.4       8.8     0.4    0.2      --     --                          ------   -----   -------  --------  ------  -----  ------  ----- Operating income  (loss).................    2.9     0.5      (7.9)    (20.4)   11.0    4.7     8.1    3.9 Interest expense, net...    8.8     1.3       0.5       1.3     1.0    0.4     1.6    0.8 Other income............    0.3      --       0.1       0.3     0.8    0.4     0.6    0.4                          ------   -----   -------  --------  ------  -----  ------  ----- Income (loss) before  income taxes...........

The 59 Sportmart stores acquired on January 9, 1998 are included in the comparable store sales base utilizing historical Sportmart comparable store data.    Inventories are stated at the lower of last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost or market. The Company considers cost of goods sold to include the direct costs of merchandise, plus certain internal costs associated with procurement, warehousing, handling and distribution. In addition to the full cost of inventory, cost of goods sold includes related occupancy costs and amortization and depreciation of leasehold improvements and rental equipment. Operating expenses include controllable and non-controllable store expenses (except occupancy), non-store expenses and depreciation and amortization not associated with cost of goods sold.  Fiscal 1998    The Company's fiscal 1998 consists of the 52-week year ended January 30, 1999. Note that these results are not comparable to the transition period ended January 31, 1998, or fiscal 1997 and 1996, which represent the results of Gart Sports prior to the acquisition of Sportmart.    Net Sales. Net sales were $658.0 million for fiscal year 1998 versus $666.3 million on a pro forma combined basis utilizing comparable fiscal periods, for the prior year. The decrease in net sales is attributable to a comparable store sales decrease of 4.5% for the year and an increase of $28.2 million from new stores opened offset by $6.8 million of lost sales from closed stores. Comparable store sales decreased due to weak apparel and winter related product sales. Apparel sales decreased primarily due to weak licensed product sales due to the shift in the timing of Superbowl-related items into the first quarter of fiscal 1999 from the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, as well as the impact of the NBA lockout. Sales of winter-related product decreased due to unseasonably warm weather.    Gross Profit. Gross profit was $154.1 million during fiscal 1998 or 23.4% of net sales compared to $160.1 million or 24.0% on a pro-forma combined basis, utilizing comparable periods for the prior year. Merchandise margins were consistent with the 1997 Company's margins on a pro forma combined basis utilizing comparable fiscal periods. However, gross margin was negatively impacted by higher occupancy costs including the favorable lease amortization established in conjunction with the merger.    Operating Expenses and Merger Integration Costs.  Operating expenses for the year ended January 30, 1999 were $151.3 million, or 23.0% of net sales versus $157.8 million or 23.7% on a pro-forma combined basis, utilizing comparable periods for the prior year. Operating expenses included $6.0 million of merger integration costs that are not recurring. Of these costs, $2.9 million were recorded as a non-recurring charge, and $3.1 million were included in other operating expenses. These costs consist primarily of $0.7 million of professional fees, $1.3 million of stay bonuses to employees at the Sportmart corporate headquarters, $0.5 million of travel and moving expenses, $1.6 million of costs associated with re-ticketing merchandise in the Sportmart stores, and $1.3 million of expenses to keep the Sportmart corporate office open during the first part of 1998.    Operating Income. As a result of the factors described above, operating income for fiscal 1998 was $2.9 million or 0.5% of net sales compared to $2.4 million or 0.4% of net sales on a pro-forma combined basis, utilizing comparable periods for the year. Excluding the integration costs of $6.0 million, operating income would have been $8.9 million, or 1.4% of net sales.    Interest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended January 30, 1999 was 1.3% of net sales or $8.8 million. The increase from prior periods is primarily due to increased debt levels as compared to fiscal 1997 and 1996, due to the refinancing of Sportmart debt under the Credit Agreement.    Income Tax Benefit. The Company's income tax benefit for 1998 was $2.2 million. The Company's effective tax rate was 39%.  Transition Period ended January 31, 1998    The Company's transition period consists of the 28 days of operations for Gart Sports, which includes 22 days of operations for Sportmart (from the date of acquisition on January 9, 1998) (the "Transition Period").                                        17     Net Sales. Net sales were $38.8 million for the Transition Period. Net sales were evenly distributed between the Gart Sports stores and the Sportmart stores. Gart Sports stores were bolstered by licensed promotional apparel sales related to the Denver Broncos' winning of the Super Bowl, contributing to a 31.8% increase in comparable Gart Sports store sales offset by a 3.6% decline in comparable Sportmart stores sales subsequent to the acquisition. The Sportmart acquisition added an additional 59 superstores to the Company's sales base.    Gross Profit. Gross profit was $6.9 million during the Transition Period or 17.8% of net sales. The month of January is an historically slow sales period for Sportmart in which promotional clearance events are held. Such events generally result in higher cost of sales as a percentage of net sales and correspondingly lower gross profit margins.    Operating Expenses. Operating expenses for the period ended January 31, 1998 were $11.4 million, or 29.4% of net sales. Operating expenses associated with the Sportmart stores increased as a percentage of net sales primarily due to the decline in net sales while fixed costs remained constant.    Merger Integration Costs. Merger integration costs were $3.4 million. These costs consist primarily of $653,000 of professional fees, $700,000 of stay bonuses to employees at the Sportmart corporate headquarters, $63,000 of travel expense, $1,153,000 of lease buyouts, $220,000 of obsolete equipment write down, $78,000 of debt fee expense, $505,000 of severance, moving and employee welfare costs, and $5,000 of other costs.    Operating Loss. As a result of the factors described above, the operating loss for the Transition Period was $7.9 million.    Interest Expense. Interest expense for the four week period ended January 31, 1998 was 1.3% of net sales or $0.5 million. In conjunction with the Sportmart acquisition, the Company refinanced the Sportmart debt of approximately $86.2 million under a new credit agreement.    Income Tax Benefit. The Company's income tax benefit for the Transition Period was $0.3 million. The Company's effective tax rate was 3.8% primarily due to the Company recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets generated by the operations of Sportmart for the Transition Period.  Fiscal 1997 as compared to Fiscal 1996    Net Sales.  Net sales increased $24.3 million to $228.4 million or 11.9% in fiscal year 1997 compared to $204.1 million in fiscal year 1996. The increase in net sales is attributable to a comparable store sales increase of 5.6% and an increase of 6.1% from new stores opened offset by $0.6 million in lost sales from closed stores. Comparable store sales increases were partly due to strong sales in golf equipment, snowboards, athletic hardlines and activewear. During the year, the Company opened four superstores and one freestanding store and closed two freestanding stores.    Gross Profit. Gross profit for fiscal 1997 was $64.1 million or 28.1% of net sales as compared to $55.7 million, or 27.3% of net sales for fiscal 1996. This increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of improved margins in hardlines and apparel and lower depreciation expense related to rental goods included in cost of goods sold, buying, distribution and occupancy.    Merger Integration Costs. Merger integration costs of $0.4 million were recognized in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1997. These costs consisted primarily of $309,000 of professional fees and $84,000 of travel expenses related to the Sportmart acquisition.    Operating Expenses. Operating expenses in fiscal 1997 were $52.7 million, or 23.2% of net sales compared to $47.6 million, or 23.4% of net sales for the period ended January 4, 1997. The decrease as a percentage of net sales is due primarily to a decrease in corporate overhead expenses offset by increases in store payroll and advertising costs.                                        18     Operating Income. As a result of the factors described above, operating income for the fiscal year 1997 increased 35.8% to $11.0 million or 4.7% of net sales, from $8.1 million, or 3.9% of net sales in fiscal year 1996.    Interest Expense. Interest expense for the year ending January 3, 1998 decreased 37.5% to $1.0 million or 0.4% of net sales from $1.6 million, or 0.8% of net sales in the year ended January 4, 1997. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in average outstanding debt for the year, combined with more favorable interest rates.    Other Income. Other income for the year ended January 3, 1998 increased $0.2 million or 33.3% over the year ended January 4, 1997 of $0.6 million. The increase was primarily due to proceeds received in connection with a lessor's buy-out of one of the Company's store leases.    Income Taxes. The Company's income tax expense for the fiscal year 1997 was $4.1 million compared to $2.7 million for fiscal year 1996. The Company's effective tax rate increased to 37.9% from 37.6% in fiscal year 1996.  Liquidity and Capital Resources    The Company's primary capital requirements are for inventory, capital improvements, and pre-opening expenses to support the Company's expansion plans, as well as for various investments in store remodeling, store fixtures and ongoing infrastructure improvements.

These sources of cash were offset by increases in inventory, prepaid expenses, receivables, and decreases in accrued expenses.    Cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 1998 was primarily for capital expenditures. These expenditures were primarily for the opening of six new superstores, renovations and improvements to existing stores as well as the purchase of certain information systems.    Cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 1998 was primarily for principal payments made on long-term debt. At the time of the acquisition, the Company refinanced Sportmart debt of $86.2 million under the Credit Agreement. The decrease in long-term debt from the Transition Period is primarily from principal payments made as a result of cash generated by operations, as discussed above. There was $137.0 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement at April 3, 1999. The increase in long-term debt since fiscal year end 1998 is primarily attributable to seasonal purchases of inventory, capital expenditures, and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses.    Historically, the Company's liquidity and capital needs have been met by cash from operations and borrowings under a revolving line of credit with CIT/Business Credit, Inc. ("CIT"). In connection with the                                        19   Sportmart acquisition, this agreement was replaced with a new revolving line of credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") with a group of lenders including CIT as agent. The long term debt currently consists of the Credit Agreement, which allows the Company to borrow up to 70% of its eligible inventories (as defined in the Credit Agreement) during the year and up to 75% of its eligible inventories for any consecutive 90 day period in a fiscal year. Borrowings are limited to the lesser of $175 million or the amount calculated in accordance with the borrowing base, and are secured by substantially all trade receivables, inventories and intangible assets. The lenders may not demand repayment of principal absent an occurrence of default under the Credit Agreement prior to January 9, 2003. The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a specified minimum level of net worth at all times and restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends. Loan interest is payable monthly at Chase Manhattan Bank's prime rate plus a margin rate that cannot exceed 0.25% or, at the option of the Company, at Chase Manhattan Bank's LIBOR rate plus a margin that cannot exceed 1.75%. The margin rate on prime and LIBOR borrowings can be reduced, if certain earnings levels are achieved, to as low as 0.0% and 1.50%, respectively. As of January 30, 1999, the Company had not achieved these specified earnings levels. There was $137 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement at April 3, 1999, and $26.0 million was available for borrowing.    The Internal Revenue Service has proposed adjustments to the 1992 and 1993 consolidated federal income tax returns of the Company and its former parent, now Thrifty PayLess Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of RiteAid Corporation, due to the manner in which LIFO inventories were characterized on such returns. These adjustments could result in up to approximately $9.7 million of a long- term deferred tax liability being accelerated, which would have a negative impact on liquidity in the near term. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    Capital expenditures to support all of the Company's expansion plans as well as various investments in store remodelings, store fixtures, ski rentals and ongoing infrastructure improvements are projected to be approximately $11.4 million in fiscal 1999. These capital expenditures will be for five store openings, fixturing, refurbishing Sportmart stores, remodeling of existing stores, information systems and distribution center facilities. The Company leases all of its store locations and intends to continue to finance its new stores with long-term operating leases. Based upon historical data, newly constructed superstores require a cash investment of approximately $1.8 million for a 45,000 square foot store and $1.5 million for a 33,000 square foot store. Superstores constructed in existing retail space historically have required additional capital investments of approximately $700,000 in leasehold improvements per location. The level of capital improvements will be affected by the mix of new construction versus renovation of existing retail space. The Company expects similar trends in new store investment for the foreseeable future.    The Company believes that cash generated from operations, combined with funds available under the Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to fund projected capital expenditures and other working capital requirements through fiscal 1999. The Company intends to utilize the Credit Agreement to meet seasonal fluctuations in cash flow requirements.  Foreign Currency and Interest Rate Risk Management    In connection with the Sportmart acquisition, certain derivative financial instruments were acquired. The instruments were utilized to reduce interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.    The assumed contracts consisted of one interest rate cap agreement and various foreign currency option contracts. These agreements were transferred from Sportmart's credit agreement to the Company's credit agreement. The interest rate cap agreement is for a notional amount totaling $25.0 million, places an interest rate ceiling on LIBOR at 6.0% and expires in August 1999.    In connection with its Canadian operations (which were closed in 1997), Sportmart had entered into foreign currency contracts to hedge intercompany loans and other commitments in currencies other than its Canadian subsidiary's functional currency. All of these foreign currency contracts expired prior to fiscal 1998.                                        20   Seasonality and Inflation    The following table sets forth the Company's unaudited consolidated quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in fiscal 1998 and 1997. This information is unaudited, but is prepared on the same basis as the annual financial information and, in the opinion of management, reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented. The results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.                                    Fiscal 1998                                                  First   Second    Third   Fourth                                              Quarter  Quarter  Quarter  Quarter                                              -------  -------  -------  -------               Net sales................................ $155.2   $169.1   $142.6   $191.1    % of full year...........................   23.6%    25.7%    21.7%    29.0%    Operating income (loss).................. $ (2.6)  $  5.7   $ (7.7)  $  7.5                                   Fiscal 1997                                                 First   Second    Third   Fourth                                              Quarter  Quarter  Quarter  Quarter                                              -------  -------  -------  -------               Net sales................................ $ 47.4   $ 48.0   $ 55.7   $ 77.3    % of full year...........................   20.8%    21.0%    24.4%    33.8%    Operating income......................... $  1.8   $  0.4   $  0.0   $  8.8     The fourth quarter has historically been the strongest quarter for the Company. For fiscal 1998 and 1997, the fourth quarter contributed 29.0% and 33.8%, respectively, of net sales. Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 were negatively impacted due to weak licensed apparel and winter-related product sales. Licensed apparel sales decreased due to the NBA lockout and the shift in the timing of Super Bowl-related items to fiscal 1999 from the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998. Winter related product sales were negatively impacted by unseasonably warm weather during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998. The Company believes that two primary factors contribute to this seasonality. First, sales of cold weather sporting goods, and purchases of ski and snowboard merchandise during these quarters in anticipation of the ski and snowboard season. As is the case with most retailers, holiday sales contribute significantly to the Company's operating results. As a result of these factors, inventory levels, which gradually increase beginning in April, generally reach their peak in November and then decline to their lowest level following the December holiday season. Any decrease in sales for the fourth quarter, whether due to a slow holiday selling season, poor snowfall in ski areas near the Company's markets or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year.    Although the operations of the Company are influenced by general economic conditions, the Company does not believe that inflation has a material impact on the Company's results of operations. The Company believes that it is generally able to pass along any inflationary increases in costs to its customers.  Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements    Effective February 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which requires the Company to report the change in its net assets from nonowner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive loss is comprised of unrealized holding losses on the Company's marketable securities as of January 30, 1999. The Company has chosen to disclose comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity, and prior year information has been restated to conform to the SFAS No. 130 requirements.    In April 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) issued Statement of Position 98-5 ("SOP 98-5") Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities, effective for fiscal years beginning after                                        21   December 15, 1998 and encouraging earlier adoption. SOP 98-5 broadly defines start-up activities as those one-time activities related to, among other things, opening a new facility. In general, SOP 98-5 requires the Company to expense, as incurred, those costs such as pre-opening payroll and store supplies. Currently, the Company capitalizes such costs and amortizes the balance over the fiscal year in which it opens a new facility. Pursuant to SOP 98-5, the Company will have to incur expenses prior to having available the sales generated to absorb such costs. Generally, the Company incurs approximately $125,000 per new store of pre-opening costs. The Company has not yet adopted SOP 98-5, but will adopt it in fiscal 1999, which will slightly affect quarterly results. On an annual basis, there will be no financial impact.    In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("Statement No. 133"), effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. Statement No.133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. The Company has not yet adopted Statement No. 133, but will comply with the requirements of this Statement when required. As the Company's use of derivatives and hedging is not significant, the Company believes that the adoption of Statement No. 133 will not affect the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.    In the first quarter of 1998, the AICPA's Accounting Standards Executive Committee issued Statement of Position ("SOP 98-1"), Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. This SOP requires that entities capitalize certain internal-use software costs once specific criteria are met. The Company adopted SOP 98-1 in 1998 resulting in $680,000 of capitalized costs that would have otherwise been expensed.    In fiscal 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information", which establishes annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise's operating segments and related disclosures about its products, services, major customers and the material countries in which the entity holds assets and reports revenues. The Company is a leading retailer of sporting goods in the midwest and western United States. Given the economic characteristics of the store formats, the similar nature of the products sold, the types of customer and method of distribution, the operations of the Company are aggregated into one reportable segment.  Year 2000 Compliance    Historically, most computer databases, as well as embedded microprocessors in computer systems and industrial equipment, were designed with date data fields which used only two digits of the year. Most computer programs, computers, and embedded microprocessors controlling equipment were programmed to assume that all two digit dates were preceded by "19", causing "00" to be interpreted as the year 1900. This formerly common practice could cause a computer system ("IT") or embedded microprocessor to fail to properly recognize a year that begins with "20", rather than "19". This in turn could result in computer system miscalculations or failures, as well as failures of equipment controlled by date-sensitive microprocessors ("Non-IT"), and is generally referred to as the "Year 2000 problem."    State of Year 2000 Readiness. In 1995 the Company began to formulate a plan to address its Year 2000 issues that now includes eight phases: Awareness, Inventory, Assessment, Remediation, Testing, Implementation, Certification and Maintenance. Awareness involves ensuring that employees who deal with the Company's computer assets, and all managers, executives and directors, understand the nature of the Year 2000 problem and the adverse effects on the business operations of the Company that would result from the failure to become and remain Year 2000 ready. Inventory involves the identification of all computer assets of the Company (both information technology systems and embedded microprocessors). Assessment involves the determination as to whether such assets will properly recognize a year that begins with "20", rather than "19". Computer hardware, software and firmware, and embedded microprocessors, that, among other things, properly recognize a year beginning with "20" are said to be "Year 2000 ready". Remediation involves the repair or replacement of computer assets that are not Year 2000 ready. Testing involves the validation of the actions taken in the                                        22   Remediation phase. Implementation is the installation and integration of remediated and tested computer assets into an overall information technology and embedded microprocessor system that is Year 2000 ready. Certification is the final testing phase to ensure full interface between systems. Maintenance is the process of ensuring that remediated systems are not corrupted by the installation of new technology.    Awareness.  The Company completed the Awareness phase of its Year 2000 plan in the third fiscal quarter of 1998. The Company believes that all employees who deal with the Company's computer assets, and the Company's management, appreciate the importance of Year 2000 readiness and understand that achieving such readiness is primarily a business problem, not merely a technology problem. The Company has also communicated directly with approximately 27% of its approximately 5,000 vendors of goods and services in an attempt to elicit information from its key vendors regarding the state of their Year 2000 readiness. The Company believes that the vendors contacted represent approximately 80% of its key business partners from both a merchandise and operational perspective.    Internal Computer Systems.  The Company began its assessment of its internal computer systems in 1995. All core applications were identified, assessed and ranked for critical importance to the operations of the Company. Since then, the Company has replaced or modified 76% of its Point of Sale systems and 95% of its Personal Computer and Local/Wide Area Network systems for Year 2000 compliance. Merchandise, Accounting and Sales systems are in various stages of the validation and implementation phases. Some systems have completed the implementation phase and are running in production but will be included in further testing efforts. The Company currently plans to have completed remediation of all computer systems which are critical to its operations by October 1999. Some non-critical systems may not be remediated, however, until after January 2000.    Embedded Microprocessors.  The Company has completed its assessment of the potential for Year 2000 problems with respect to embedded microprocessors in its Non-IT equipment, merchandise inventory, warehouse and distribution facilities, and corporate offices. Based on the Company's assessment, it believes that its equipment and systems that contain embedded computer technology present little Year 2000 exposure or risk. Based on information from its merchandise vendors, the Company believes that its resale merchandise does not have Year 2000 compliance issues. The Company has assessed its mission critical, non-information systems service providers and does not believe that these service providers pose a substantial Year 2000 compliance risk.    Testing and Certification. The Company has not yet begun testing of its critical computer systems in an integrated environment. The Company has begun testing of individual pieces of software related to its Point of Sale software. Certain risks exist if this testing and certification is delayed beyond the existing schedule, including but not limited to, the inability to complete any additional remediation identified in a timely manner.    Vendors.  Fortunately, the Year 2000 problem will not completely materialize until after the Company's peak annual selling period, the December holiday season. The problems that may occur following the December holiday season will be when inventory levels are the lowest. As of the date of this report, the Company is not aware that any of its key vendors will experience a business interruption. The Company has not, however, obtained responses from all of its vendors who received a questionnaire from the Company in its effort to identify a key vendor that may not be Year 2000 ready and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's business.    The Costs to Address the Company's Year 2000 Issues.  The Company has incurred costs of approximately $796,000 as of April 4, 1999 with respect to its Year 2000 plan, excluding internal resources which have been recognized for separately. This amount has come from the general operating budget of the Company's Management Information Systems department and from funds budgeted for capital expenditures. No significant Management Information Systems projects have been deferred due to the Company's Year 2000 plan. The Company currently estimates the total cost of completing its Year 2000 plan will not exceed $2 million. This estimate is based on currently available information, will be updated as the Company completes its assessment of third party relationships and proceeds with its testing and implementation, and may need to be increased upon receipt of more information from vendors of material goods and services and upon the design and implementation of the Company's contingency plan.                                        23     The Company's Year 2000 Risks. If any computer hardware, software applications, or embedded microprocessors critical to the Company's operations have been overlooked in the assessment or remediation phases, if any of the Company's remediated or replaced internal computer systems fail the testing phase, or if some of the Company's key business partners do not become Year 2000 ready in a timely manner, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, liquidity and financial condition of a magnitude which the Company has not yet fully analyzed. In addition, the Company has not yet been assured that (1) the computer systems of all of its key vendors of goods and services will be Year 2000 ready in a timely manner or (2) the computer systems of third parties with which the Company's computer systems exchange data will be Year 2000 ready in a timely manner and in a manner compatible with continued data exchange with the Company's computer systems.    The Company believes that its most significant Year 2000 risks are:    . Failure of its mission critical information systems service providers to     timely make their systems Year 2000 compliant;    . Failure of the Company to timely complete implementation of its new     payroll processing system, which it anticipates completing by July 1999;     and    . Failure of one or more first tier mission critical merchandise vendors or     service providers to supply merchandise or services for an extended     period of time.    The Company's Contingency Plan.  The Company is in the process of developing a business contingency plan to address Year 2000 risks and expects to have it completed by July 1999.  ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    The Company is exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in interest rates in the market value of its investments and foreign currency exchange rates. However, the effects of changes in these market risks on the Company's earnings generally has been small relative to other factors that also affect earnings, such as sales and operating margins.    The Company's primary interest rate risk exposure results from the Company's long-term debt agreement. The Company's long-term debt bears interest at variable rates that are tied to either the U.S. prime rate or LIBOR at the time of the borrowing. At the end of each 90-day period, the interest rates on the Company's outstanding borrowings are changed to reflect current prime or LIBOR rates. Therefore, the Company's interest expense changes as prime or LIBOR change.    Historically, the Company has not relied upon derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, in connection with the Sportmart acquisition, the Company acquired one interest rate cap agreement that Sportmart had used to reduce its interest rate risk. The interest rate cap is used to lock in a maximum rate if interest rates rise, but enables the Company to otherwise pay lower market rates. The cap agreement is for a notional amount totaling $25.0 million, places an interest rate ceiling on LIBOR of 6.0%, and expires in August 1999.    Based on the Company's overall interest rate exposure at January 30, 1999, including the interest rate cap agreement, a hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial instruments would change the Company's after-tax earnings by approximately $600,000 over a 12-month period.    The Company's exposure to foreign currency exchange rates is limited because the Company does not operate any stores outside of the United States. In connection with the acquisition of Sportmart, the Company acquired one store in Canada which Sportmart had closed prior to the acquisition. The Company is currently attempting to sell this store, but until then, the Company is exposed to the risk that a change in exchange rates between the U.S. and Canada would cause the Company's other comprehensive income to change due to foreign                                         24   currency translation gains or losses. However, the Company does not consider the market risk exposure relating to foreign currency change to be material. Foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on the Company during fiscal 1998, the transition period, fiscal 1997 or fiscal 1996.    The fair value of the Company's investments in marketable equity securities at January 30, 1999 was $1.8 million. The fair value of these investments will fluctuate as the quoted market prices of such securities fluctuate. Based on the Company's marketable equity securities portfolio and quoted market prices at January 30, 1999, a 50 percent increase or decrease in the market price of such securities would result in an increase or decrease of $.9 million in the fair value of the marketable equity securities portfolio. Although changes in quoted market prices may affect the fair value of the marketable equities securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses, such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold.    As of January 30, 1999, the fair value of the Company's investments in marketable equity securities was $1.8 million less than the original cost of those investments. Such unrealized holding loss has not been recognized in the Company's consolidated statement of operations, but rather has been recorded as a component of stockholders' equity in other comprehensive loss. The actual gain or loss that the Company will realize when such investments are sold will depend on the fair value of such securities at the time of sale.  ITEM 8.
