ITEM 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with "Selected Consolidated Financial Data" and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors.   Overview             On August 4, 2003, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gart Sports Company completed a merger with The Sports Authority, Inc. In connection with the merger, Gart Sports Company was renamed The Sports Authority, Inc. The references made to the entities herein refer to The Sports Authority, Inc. (formerly Gart Sports Company which includes "Sports Authority" or "Company" or "we" or "our" or "us") and its subsidiaries. "TSA" refers to TSA Stores Inc. (formerly known as The Sports Authority, Inc.). The merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting with Gart Sports Company as the acquirer, and accordingly, the results of operations for fiscal 2003 include the results of TSA since the date of the merger. Prior year results, as well as results for the first 26 weeks of the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2004, reflect the former Gart Sports Company on a stand-alone basis.            At the closing of the TSA merger, we became the nation's largest publicly traded full-line sporting goods retailer, with a presence in most major markets across the United States. At January 31, 2004, we operated 384 stores in 45 states under the Sports Authority, Gart Sports, Oshman's and Sportmart brand names. We also have a licensing agreement with Mega Sports to operate stores in Japan under the Sports Authority name. We believe that our geographic dispersion will benefit top-line sales due to sales of licensed apparel in a broader number of professional team markets, and balancing of seasonal and weather fluctuations, among other factors. In 2003, our efforts were focused on integrating the systems, processes and cultures of the two organizations, while ensuring the continuous flow of merchandise to our stores to maintain top-line sales. Comparable store sales for the post-merger 26 weeks ended January 31, 2004 were slightly positive, a favorable indication that sales volumes were maintained during the merger integration process. We also expect the TSA merger to provide us with synergistic benefits in gross margin as a result of reduced inventory costs and increased vendor entitlements. Additionally, we expect to realize significant cost savings from eliminating redundant back office functions.            In 2004, our focus will be on increasing sales through a number of initiatives, including: improving in-stock positions and rationalizing our merchandise assortment across the chain; growing the ski and snowboard business in the northeastern Sports Authority stores; remodeling a significant number of Sports Authority stores to create a more appealing, customer-friendly environment; realigning stores among the six distribution centers to reduce in-transit time; remodeling the Sports Authority distribution centers and improving information systems to increase product flow-through and data integrity; and continued new store development, with 23 new stores and two relocations planned for the year. In addition, we expect that the closure of a number of underperforming or overlapping Sports Authority stores will enhance our profitability, as negative contributors are eliminated from operating results. We identified 27 Sports Authority stores for closure as part of the merger integration process, of which eleven were closed and two relocated as of January 31, 2004. We expect to close the remaining stores identified for closure within the next 12 to 15 months. The implementation of these initiatives will require significant capital expenditures, which we estimate will approximate $85 million in fiscal 2004, and working capital to fund closed store lease obligations. We believe that our operating cash flows and the availability under our $600 million revolving credit facility provide the liquidity required for these initiatives.    17                  Given the economic characteristics of our store formats, the similar nature of the products sold, the type of customer and method of distribution, our operations are aggregated in one reportable segment as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."     Results of Operations             The following table sets forth for the periods indicated, certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales and the number of stores open at the end of each period (dollars rounded to millions):             Fiscal 2003     Fiscal 2002     Fiscal 2001             Dollars     %     Dollars     %     Dollars     %       Net sales     $  1,760.4     100.0  %  $  1,051.2     100.0  %  $  935.7     100.0  %    Cost of goods sold, buying, distribution and occupancy        1,274.7     72.4        776.3     73.8        696.3     74.4                                       Gross profit        485.7     27.6        274.9     26.2        239.4     25.6       Operating expenses        409.0     23.2        229.0     21.8        204.4     21.8       Merger integration costs        43.8     2.5                     12.5     1.4                                       Operating income        32.9     1.9        45.9     4.4        22.5     2.4       Interest expense        (12.3  )  (0.7  )     (9.2  )  (0.9  )     (11.0  )  (1.2  )    Other income, net        3.5     0.2        1.1     0.1        2.1     0.3                                       Income before income taxes        24.1     1.4        37.8     3.6        13.6     1.5       Income tax expense        (7.7  )  (0.5  )     (14.6  )  (1.4  )     (5.3  )  (0.6  )                                    Net income     $  16.4     0.9  %  $  23.2     2.2  %  $  8.3     0.9  %                                     Number of stores at end of period         384                181                179                         We consider cost of goods sold to include the direct cost of merchandise, plus certain costs associated with procurement, warehousing, handling and distribution. In addition to the full cost of inventory, cost of goods sold includes related occupancy costs and amortization and depreciation of leasehold improvements and rental equipment.            Operating expenses include controllable and non-controllable store expenses (except occupancy), non-store expenses and depreciation and amortization not associated with cost of goods sold.    Fiscal 2003 as compared to Fiscal 2002             Net Sales.     Net sales increased $709.2 million, or 67.5%, to $1,760.4 million in fiscal 2003, compared to $1,051.2 million in fiscal 2002. The sales increase reflects the inclusion of $697.0 million in sales from TSA stores from August 4, 2003, the merger date, versus results for Gart Sports on a stand-alone basis in fiscal 2002. Additionally, non-comparable sales for Gart on a stand-alone basis increased $28.3 million, net, reflecting an increase from store openings in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003 of $45.6 million, offset by a decrease of $17.3 million, primarily from store closings. Comparable store sales in fiscal 2003, which includes TSA stores since August 4, 2003, decreased 0.7%, primarily due to a first quarter decline of 8.8% for Gart on a stand-alone basis. The first quarter was impacted by a comparison to increased sales from the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002 and a decrease in sales due to a major snowstorm in the Denver area in 2003, among other factors. Sales performance improved thereafter, with relatively flat comparable store sales in the second and fourth quarters, and a 1.7% increase in the third quarter. Focusing on results for the Company following the TSA merger, comparable store sales increased $9.9 million or 0.8% for the last half of the 2003 fiscal year. The    18         increase resulted from a positive performance in the team sports, hunting and camping categories, and by strong sales in the ski, snowboard and snow apparel categories in Sports Authority locations in the northeast. The northeast stores benefited from an expanded product offering in these categories, as the broader assortment available in Gart stores was introduced into Sports Authority cold-weather markets. In aggregate, these factors produced a $15.9 million or 8.0% increase in comparable store sales. Partially offsetting these gains were declines in the fitness equipment, trends/gifts and skate categories aggregating $12.7 million or 7.1% decrease in comp store sales.            Gross Profit.     Gross profit for fiscal 2003 was $485.7 million, or 27.6% of net sales, as compared to $274.9 million, or 26.2% of net sales, for fiscal 2002. The increase as a percent of net sales reflected improved merchandise margins for the combined companies as a result of lower inventory costs. Gart Sports results also improved on a stand-alone basis over the prior year, with an increase in merchandise margins of 0.5% of net sales. The increase reflects a somewhat less promotional selling environment in fiscal 2003 than in the prior year combined with reduced inventory costs, which produced improvements in merchandise margin rates in a number of categories. These categories include fitness equipment, snowboards, hunting and camping, which produced a combined increase in merchandise margin rates of 90 basis points. In addition, the application of EITF Consensus No. 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor" ("EITF 02-16") resulted in the recharacterization of $3.0 million of vendor allowances, from a reduction of advertising expense to a reduction of the cost of inventory purchased, of which $2.1 million, or 0.1% of net sales, was recognized in cost of goods sold in fiscal 2003.            Operating Expenses.     Operating expenses in fiscal 2003 were $409.5 million, or 23.3% of net sales, compared to $229.0 million, or 21.8% of net sales, for fiscal 2002. The increase in operating expense dollars primarily reflects the store operating costs associated with 205 TSA stores acquired on August 4, 2003. Operating expenses also increased as a percent of sales due to the following factors:      (i) TSA Stores' overall operating expenses historically trended higher than Gart's. TSA Stores' selling, general and administrative expenses were 26.0%, 25.5% and 24.6% of net sales in 2002, 2001 an 2000, compared to Gart's operating expenses of 21.8% of net sales for each of fiscal 2002 and 2001, and 21.9% of net sales for fiscal 2000. The implementation of consistent operating procedures for the combined company is an ongoing process that we expect to have completed by the end of fiscal 2004; (ii) The higher level of general and administrative costs as a result of the TSA merger, including insurance costs, which increased $2.8 million, and corporate office rent, which increased $1.7 million due to additional leased office space to accommodate our larger corporate offices; (iii) The recharacterization of $3.0 million, or 0.2% of net sales, of cooperative advertising monies from a reduction of advertising expense to a reduction of inventory costs as required by EITF 02-16; and (iv) Establishing a reserve for the settlement of wage and hour class action lawsuits in California totaling $1.5 million, including attorney fees and expenses, recorded in the first quarter of 2003.              Merger Integration Costs.     Merger integration costs for fiscal 2003 were $43.8 million, or 2.5% of net sales, and were related to the TSA merger. Integration costs include only non-recurring, incremental costs arising as a direct result of integrating the two companies following the merger. For fiscal 2003, these costs consisted of $17.7 million of duplicative payroll, benefits and retention payments, $8.4 million of severance costs, $6.7 million of consulting fees, $6.0 million of expense related to winding up the operations of the TSA corporate office in Ft. Lauderdale and closing a Gart store in an overlapping market, $3.0 million for relocation and travel, and $2.0 million of advertising related to rebranding and announcing the combined company.    19                 Operating Income.     As a result of the factors described above, operating income for fiscal 2003 was $32.9 million, or 1.9% of net sales, compared to $45.9 million, or 4.4% of net sales, in fiscal 2002.            Interest Expense.     Interest expense for fiscal 2003 increased to $12.3 million, or 0.7% of net sales, from $9.2 million, or 0.9% of net sales, in the prior year. The increase in interest expense is related to the assumption of TSA Stores' debt upon completion of the merger and to financing of merger and integration costs.            Other Income.     Other income was $3.5 million for fiscal 2003 compared to $1.1 million for fiscal 2002. The increase is primarily attributable to interest income associated with the settlement of the Rite Aid tax dispute totaling $2.1 million.            Income Taxes.     Our income tax expense for fiscal 2003 was $7.7 million compared to $14.6 million in fiscal 2002. Tax expense for fiscal 2003 was offset by a tax benefit of $1.7 million recorded as a result of the settlement with our former parent regarding an IRS examination of our 1992 and 1993 consolidated federal income tax returns. Excluding this one-time benefit, the Company's estimated tax rate was approximately 39% for both fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002.    Fiscal 2002 as compared to Fiscal 2001             Net Sales.     Net sales increased $115.5 million, or 12.3%, to $1,051.2 million in fiscal 2002 compared to $935.7 million in fiscal 2001. Sales in fiscal 2001 include Oshman's results after the June 7, 2001 acquisition date compared to a full year of results for the combined company in fiscal 2002, resulting in an increase of fiscal 2002 net sales of approximately $92.0 million or 8.8%. New stores contributed approximately $23.5 million in net sales, or 2.2%, for fiscal 2002. Comparable store sales in fiscal 2002, which included the Oshman's stores from August 4, 2002, were flat, reflecting several offsetting factors throughout the year. In the first quarter of 2002, comparable store sales were strong due to a strong late ski season in our cold-weather markets, sales of merchandise related to the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and increased exercise equipment promotions. The second quarter reflected a general decline in business, and a significant decline in the camping and hunting departments due to drought and forest fire activity in the Rocky Mountain Region and the western United States. Third quarter 2002 sales increases were driven by licensed apparel sales as teams in our markets were involved in the Major League Baseball World Series and playoffs. However, these increases were offset by a soft selling environment in the fourth quarter of 2002, combined with a mild winter, which impacted our outdoor apparel sales.            Gross Profit.     Gross profit for fiscal 2002 was $274.9 million, or 26.2% of net sales, as compared to $239.4 million, or 25.6% of net sales, for fiscal 2001. The increase as a percent of sales is due to a number of factors including: a less promotional strategy taken during the year; synergies realized from the Oshman's acquisition; systems investments, allowing us to better manage in-stock positions; and the addition of key personnel in the buying organization, particularly in the softlines department. Due to the nature of these items, they cannot be independently quantified.             Operating Expenses.     Operating expenses in fiscal 2002 were $229.0 million, or 21.8% of net sales, compared to $204.4 million, or 21.8% of net sales, for fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2002 reflects a full year of operating expenses related to the Oshman's stores, while fiscal 2001 includes only results after the June 7, 2001, the acquisition date. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were flat year over year, due to a continued focus on controlling costs.            Merger Integration Costs.     Merger integration costs were $12.5 million, or 1.4% of net sales, for fiscal 2001 and related to the Oshman's acquisition. These costs include $3.6 million of duplicative or retention payroll and benefits, $3.0 million of advertising related to rebranding and announcing the combined company, $1.5 million for outside consulting services related to the integration, $2.3 million    20          of costs associated with consolidating and relocating the corporate offices, and the balance principally for other corporate office costs, travel and employee relocation and other personnel costs. We incurred no further merger integration costs related to the Oshman's acquisition since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.             Operating Income.     As a result of the factors described above, operating income for fiscal 2002 was $45.9 million or 4.4% of net sales compared to $22.5 million or 2.4% of net sales in fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2002 operating income increased $10.9 million, or 0.7% of sales, when compared to fiscal 2001 operating income excluding integration costs of $35.0 million or 3.7% of sales.            Interest Expense.     Interest expense for fiscal 2002 decreased to $9.2 million, or 0.9% of net sales, from $11.0 million, or 1.2% of net sales, in the prior year. The decrease in interest expenses is related to lower effective borrowing rates on amounts borrowed in 2002, resulting in approximately $2.7 million in interest savings, a settlement with the IRS in the third quarter of 2002 reducing interest expense by $0.7 million, and an increase to interest expense of $1.6 million due to an overall higher average debt balance, resulting from a decrease in the average debt as a result of the net proceeds from the May 2002 common stock offering, offset by the increased average debt due to the acquisition of Oshman's on June 7, 2001 and the shares repurchased under the 2002 common share repurchase program.            Other Income.     Other income was $1.1 million for fiscal 2002 compared to $2.1 million for fiscal 2001. The decrease is primarily attributable to non-recurring items recorded in fiscal 2001, including $0.7 million of income related to a consulting services agreement, $0.3 million of income recognized on the sales of marketable securities, and a one-time gain of $0.2 million on the sale of certain assets that were held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. These items were offset primarily by increased sales tax handling income in the current year of approximately $0.2 million, due to increased sales volume as a result of the acquisition of Oshman's.            Income Taxes.     Our income tax expense for fiscal 2002 was $14.6 million compared to $5.3 million in fiscal 2001. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2002 was 38.7% compared to 39.0% in fiscal 2001, reflecting changes in certain permanent tax differences as compared to fiscal 2001.     Liquidity and Capital Resources             Our primary capital requirements are for inventory and other seasonal working capital needs, capital improvements, including investments in store remodeling, store fixtures and ongoing infrastructure improvements, and pre-opening expenses to support our expansion plans.    NAME="dc1607_cash_flow_analysis">      Cash Flow Analysis                  Fiscal  2003     Fiscal  2002     Fiscal  2001             (dollars in thousands, except ratios)         Cash provided by operating activities, excluding effects of merger and acquisitions     $  45,921     $  20,807     $  12,079       Cash used in investing activities        (104,927  )     (25,827  )     (64,414  )    Cash provided by financing activities        76,859        3,640        55,764        Capital expenditures     $   67,584     $   25,876     $   23,459       Long-term debt (at end of period)        317,321        121,147        158,474       Working capital (at end of period)        378,909        171,799        142,563        Current ratio (at end of period)         1.76         1.84         1.62       Long-term debt to equity ratio (at end of period)        0.72        0.61        1.17         21                 Cash provided by operating activities increased $25.1 million in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. The increase is primarily due to a higher level of accounts payable financing in fiscal 2003, only partially offset by an increase in inventories, producing a net $39.4 million improvement in operating cash flows year over year. Additionally, net income adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization increased by $8.1 million over fiscal 2002. These increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $13.0 million due to increased vendor entitlement receivables. In fiscal 2002, the increase in cash provided by operations compared to fiscal 2001 is due to an increase in net income adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization.            Cash used in investing activities increased $79.1 million in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. The change reflects an increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 of $41.7 million, combined with TSA merger costs (net of cash acquired) of $42.8 million offset by the receipt of $5.1 million on the sale-leaseback of a TSA store site. Additionally, we entered into a second sale-leaseback transaction of a TSA store site in January 2004, while the proceeds of $10.9 million were received on the first business day of fiscal 2004. Total capital expenditures were $67.6 million in fiscal 2003, and included: $24.2 million for expanding and remodeling the corporate office and improvements and upgrades to our information and POS systems; $20.9 million for the development of 17 new or relocated stores, and for stores planned to be opened in early fiscal 2004; and $20.2 million for refurbishment, remodel and general capital improvements of existing stores. Cash used in investing activities declined $38.6 million in fiscal 2002 versus 2001, reflecting non-recurring acquisition costs in fiscal 2001 of $49.9 million related to the Oshman's acquisition.            Cash provided by financing activities, which typically consists principally of net borrowings or payments under our revolving credit facility, increased $73.2 million in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. The increase reflects additional borrowings required to finance TSA merger costs and the higher level of capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 not otherwise financed by operating cash flows. Proceeds from stock option exercises were $9.9 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $2.7 million in fiscal 2002, consistent with the increase in stock option exercises due to acceleration of vesting of TSA options as a result of the merger. In fiscal 2002, cash flows from financing activities other than stock option exercises were relatively neutral as proceeds from our secondary common stock offering were used to pay down long-term debt. By comparison, financing cash flows of $55.8 million in fiscal 2001 reflected the higher level of borrowings required to finance the Oshman's acquisition.            Working capital was $378.9 million as of January 31, 2004 compared to $171.8 million as of February 1, 2003, an increase of $207.1 million. The increase is due principally to an increase in inventories net of accounts payable of $169.5 million year over year, reflecting additional stores acquired in the TSA merger. Additionally, current deferred income taxes increased $80.0 million, reflecting tax assets generated in connection with the TSA merger and tax assets acquired from the former Sports Authority.            Our liquidity and capital needs have principally been met by operating cash flows and by borrowings under a revolving credit facility with CIT/Business Credit, Inc. ("CIT"), as agent.            Upon consummation of the merger, we entered into a new credit financing agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with CIT, as agent, that allows us to borrow up to $600,000,000, limited to an amount equal to 70% of eligible inventory or 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory (as defined in the agreement). We are also entitled to seasonal increases in the inventory advance rate for up to 120 days during any calendar year as designated by us for the lesser of 80% of eligible inventory or 90% of appraised net orderly liquidation value. Borrowings are secured by substantially all present and future accounts (as defined in the Credit Agreement), inventories, trade receivables, equipment, documents of title and intangible assets. The borrowings mature, absent an occurrence of default under the agreement, on August 4, 2007. The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain a specified minimum level earnings    22         before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest ratios if we do not have at least $50 million available for borrowing in the first year, $60 million in the second year and $75 million thereafter. In addition, the Credit Agreement restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional debt, to merge, consolidate or sell assets, to make loans or advances to others, to guaranty obligations of others, to pledge our assets, to make certain investments, and to engage in transactions with affiliates. Our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock and to repurchase our common stock is limited to $16 million per year under the Credit Agreement. We are in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. In connection with the Credit Agreement, we pledged all of the outstanding common stock of our subsidiaries, including TSA Stores, Inc. our principal operating retail subsidiary, as collateral for the Credit Agreement. Interest is payable monthly at Chase Manhattan Bank's prime rate plus a margin rate ranging from 0% to 0.50% or, at our option, at Chase Manhattan Bank's LIBOR rate plus a margin rate ranging from 1.50% to 2.50%. At January 31, 2004, there was $317.3 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement and $139.5 million was available for borrowing.             Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $85 million in fiscal 2004, primarily for the opening of approximately 23 new stores and relocation of two stores, remodeling of approximately 70 stores, principally Sports Authority stores; completion of a new distribution center in Fontana, California, and refurbishment of the existing Sports Authority distribution centers, and information systems upgrades and enhancements and ongoing Sports Authority systems integration. We lease the majority of our store locations and intend to continue to finance our new store construction with long-term operating leases. Based upon recent store openings, newly constructed superstores require a cash investment of approximately $1.6 million for a 42,000 square foot store and approximately $1.3 million for a 32,000 square foot store. The level of capital improvements will be affected by the mix of new construction versus renovation of existing retail space.            We believe that cash generated from operations, combined with funds available under the revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to fund projected capital expenditures, future common share purchases, if any, and other working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We intend to utilize the revolving credit facility to meet seasonal fluctuations in cash flow requirements.    23        NAME="page_de1607_1_24">        Contractual obligations and commercial commitments             To facilitate an understanding of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, the following data is provided (dollars in thousands):             Payments due by period          Total     Within  1 year     2-3  years     4-5  years     After  5 years          (in thousands)      Contractual obligations:                                                    Long term debt     $  317,321     $       $       $  317,321     $         Capital lease obligations        1,371        396        736        239               Operating leases, net        2,030,005        198,886        390,852        369,043        1,071,224                             Total contractual cash obligations     $  2,348,697     $  199,282     $  391,588     $  686,603     $  1,071,224                                         Amount of commitment expiration per period          Total     Within  1 year     2-3  years     4-5  years     After  5 years          (in thousands)      Other commercial commitments:                                                    Import letters of credit     $  2,403     $  2,403     $       $       $         Standby letters of credit        13,397        13,397                                                     Total commercial commitments (1)     $  15,800     $  15,800     $       $       $                                   (1) We have routine commitments under merchandise inventory purchase orders, which vary in amount from month to month depending on seasonality and other factors. Such purchase orders are cancelable by us without payment. In addition, we have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers. Payments under these employment agreements are dependent on these executives providing future services and certain payments are required to be made upon termination of employment by us without cause, as defined in the employment agreements. These items have not been included in the amounts in the above table.    Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management             We entered into an interest rate swap agreement on June 28, 2001, expiring on June 30, 2004, and entered into a second interest rate swap agreement on December 11, 2002, expiring on May 31, 2005, to minimize the risks and costs associated with our financing activities. Under the swap agreements, we pay fixed rate interest and receive variable LIBOR interest rate payments periodically over the life of the agreements. The total notional amounts under the interest rate swaps are $60 million, which do not represent the exposure due to credit loss.            Our interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and are considered highly effective, as defined by FASB Statement No. 133. Net settlements on the swap agreements are recorded as interest expense. At January 31, 2004, the fair value of the swap agreements was a loss of $759,000, net of the related tax benefit. The unrealized loss from these interest rate swaps is included in other comprehensive income and is a component of stockholders' equity.            Our exposure to foreign currency risk is not material.    24          Seasonality and Inflation             The following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in fiscal 2003 and 2002. This information is unaudited, but is prepared on the same basis as the annual financial information and, in the opinion of management, reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented. The results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.            The results for the last two quarters of fiscal year 2003 are not comparable to the other periods presented due to the inclusion of The Sports Authority results of operations, after August 4, 2003, the date of merger.             Fiscal 2003          First  Quarter (1)     Second  Quarter (1)     Third  Quarter (2)     Fourth  Quarter (2)          (dollars in millions)      Net sales     $228.4     $267.5     $552.5     $712.0    % of full year net sales     13.0%     15.2%     31.4%     40.4%    Operating income (loss)     $4.0     $10.3     $(9.0  )  $27.6                Fiscal 2002 (1)          First  Quarter     Second  Quarter     Third  Quarter     Fourth  Quarter                (dollars in millions)            Net sales     $245.0     $261.7     $227.8     $316.8    % of full year net sales     23.3%     24.9%     21.7%     30.1%    Operating income     $6.7     $12.5     $3.7     $23.0        (1) Amounts reflect the results of Gart Sports on a stand-alone basis for these periods. (2) Amounts include the results of the former Sports Authority, Inc. from August 4, 2004, the date of merger.            The fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter. We believe that two primary factors contribute to this seasonality: first, sales of cold weather sporting goods and ski and snowboard merchandise during the fourth quarter are generally strong in anticipation of the ski and snowboard season; and second, holiday sales contribute significantly to our operating results. As a result of these factors, inventory levels, which gradually increase beginning in April, generally reach their peak in November and then decline to their lowest level following the December holiday season. Any decrease in sales for the fourth quarter, whether due to a slow holiday selling season, poor snowfall in ski areas near our markets or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year.             Although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions, we do not believe that inflation has a material impact on our results of operations. We believe that we are generally able to pass along inflationary increases in costs to our customers.    Critical Accounting Policies             Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the    25          reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to inventory valuation, accounts receivable, the recoverability of long-lived assets including intangible assets, store closing reserves, income taxes, self insured reserves and the estimates used to apply the purchase method of accounting to our mergers and acquisitions. Management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our significant accounting policies.    Valuation of Inventory             We value our inventory at the lower of last-in, first-out ("LIFO") cost or market. Cost is determined using the average cost of items purchased and applying the dollar value LIFO inventory method. Our dollar value LIFO pools are computed using the Inventory Price Index Computation ("IPIC") method. LIFO cost of our inventories is then compared to estimated market value. This assessment of estimated market value is based on the quality and age of merchandise, the rate of sale of merchandise, the quantities on hand, and our assessment of the market conditions. Estimates and judgments are required in the determination of the market value of our inventory and future events, such as changes in customer merchandise preferences or unseasonable weather patterns, could impact the market value of our inventory.            Inventory shrinkage is accrued as a percentage of merchandise sales based on historical inventory shrinkage trends. We perform physical inventories at stores and distribution centers throughout the year. The reserve for inventory shrinkage represents an estimate for inventory shrinkage for each location since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date. These estimates are impacted by internal and external factors and may vary from actual results.    Vendor Allowances             We receive certain allowances from our vendors, which include rebates and cooperative advertising funds. These amounts are negotiated with vendors typically on an annual basis and are, at times, dependent on projected purchase volumes and advertising plans. The amounts are subject to changes in market conditions or marketing strategies of our vendors, and changes in our product purchases. We record an estimate of earned allowances based on the latest information available with respect to purchase volumes, advertising plans and status of our negotiation with vendors. We received $39.0 million, $28.2 million and $22.9 million in vendor allowances for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Of those amounts, $32.8 million, $28.2 million, and $22.9 million, in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, were vendor allowances for advertising costs and were recorded as a reduction of advertising expense, while any remainder was recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory purchased.     Impairment of Assets             We review long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets is impaired.    26          Store Closing Reserves             Prior to December 31, 2002 and the adoption of SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS No. 146"), we recorded a provision for store closing costs when the decision was made by management to close a store. In accordance with SFAS No. 146, for store closing activities initiated after December 31, 2002, the related liability is recorded at fair value when a liability is incurred rather than when the decision to close a store is made. This will change the timing of recognition for certain exit costs, so that certain exit costs will be recognized over the period in which the exit activities occur. We also record store exit reserves arising from our various mergers and acquisitions pursuant to SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and EITF Issue No. 95-3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination" ("EITF 95-3"). Under EITF 95-3, the costs of a plan to exit an activity of the acquired company are recognized as liabilities assumed in the business combination. As such, reserves are recorded in purchase accounting for the net present value of projected costs to be incurred after the store closing date. The costs incurred in connection with store closings primarily consist of post-closing future net lease obligations, utilities, property taxes, and employee costs directly related to the store closing.    Deferred Taxes             Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability based on projections of future operating results, which dictate our ability to realize the tax assets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets when this amount exceeds the amount more likely than not to be realized. As of January 31, 2004, we had no valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.    Self Insured Reserves             We are self-insured for our workers' compensation, general liability and employee medical plans up to a self-insured retention amount. We record a reserve for the estimated cost of both reported and incurred but not reported ("IBNR") claims. The estimate of our current claim obligation requires significant judgment and is based on specific loss estimates for reported claims, and on loss triangulation estimates of future claims payments, including IBNR's. Reserves are regularly evaluated for adequacy based on the most current available information, including historical claims experience and expected future claims costs.    Acquisitions and Mergers Accounting             Our acquisitions and mergers are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the total costs of such transactions are allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. The determination of fair values involves the use of estimates and assumptions, which are subject to adjustment in the future. While we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate, and will not require adjustment in future periods.    Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements             In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". This Statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments    27          and Hedging Activities". The provisions of this Statement are effective for us for all derivatives and hedging activity entered into after June 30, 2003. The adoption of this Statement had no impact on our overall financial position and results of operations.            In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity". This Statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The provisions of this Statement are effective for these financial instruments with our fiscal year beginning February 1, 2004. We expect that the adoption of this Statement will have no material impact on our overall financial position and results of operations.            In November 2002, the EITF of the FASB issued consensus No. 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor" ("EITF 02-16"). EITF 02-16 addresses how a reseller of a vendor's products should account for cash consideration received from the vendor and addresses two Issues. On Issue 1, the Task Force reached a consensus that cash consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of cost of sales when recognized in the reseller's income statement. This presumption is overcome when the consideration is a reimbursement for specific, incremental, identifiable costs incurred by the reseller to sell the vendor's products, in which case the cash consideration should be characterized as a reduction of that cost when recognized in the reseller's income statement. Additionally, the Task Force concluded on Issue 2 that a refund or a rebate of a specified amount of cash consideration payable only if the reseller completes a specified level of purchases should be recognized as a reduction of cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation of the cash consideration offered to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by the reseller toward earning the refund or rebate, provided the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable. In its January 2003 meeting, the Task Force amended the transition guidance relative to adoption of EITF 02-16 to require that the consensus on Issue 1 be applied to new arrangements, including modifications of existing arrangements, entered into after December 31, 2002. Issue 2 remains applicable to arrangements entered into after November 21, 2002.            We receive certain allowances from our vendors, which include rebates and cooperative advertising funds. These amounts are negotiated with vendors typically on an annual basis and are, at times, dependent on projected purchase volumes and advertising plans. The amounts are subject to changes in market conditions or marketing strategies of our vendors, and changes in our product purchases. We record an estimate of earned allowances based on the latest information available with respect to purchase volumes, advertising plans and status of our negotiation with vendors. We have historically treated certain vendor entitlements as a reduction of inventory costs, while cooperative advertising reimbursements have been reflected as a reduction of selling, general, and administrative expense. The impact of EITF 02-16 for fiscal 2002 was immaterial and for fiscal 2003 was a recharacterization of $3.0 million from reduction of advertising expense to reduction of cost of inventory purchased. The net impact of EITF 02-16 for fiscal 2003 was a reduction of net income of $0.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share.    NAME="de1607_risks_and_uncertainties">      Risks and Uncertainties                  Integration of The Sports Authority, Inc. (formerly known as Gart Sports Company) and TSA Stores, Inc. (formerly known as The Sports Authority, Inc.) may be difficult and expensive to achieve.           On August 4, 2003, we completed the merger of equals contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 19, 2003, among Gart Sports Company, Gold Acquisition Corp. and The Sports Authority, Inc. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we changed our name from Gart Sports Company to The Sports Authority, Inc. and the company formerly known as The Sports Authority, Inc. changed its name to TSA Stores, Inc.    28                  The merger involves the integration of companies that have previously operated independently. The integration will be a complex, time consuming and expensive process and may materially harm our business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner. We may not be able to integrate the operations of the companies without encountering difficulties, including possible unanticipated costs, failure to retain key employees, the diversion of management's attention or failure to integrate our information systems. Due to the location of the combined company's headquarters in Colorado, a significant number of the members of the management team of TSA Stores have not remained with the combined company. As a result, we may lose some historical knowledge of the operations and business of TSA Stores. Additionally, we may not realize the increased revenues and cost savings that the pre-merger companies expected to achieve as a result of the merger or that would justify the investment made.            If the benefits of the merger do not exceed the costs associated with the merger, including any dilution to the stockholders resulting from the issuance of shares in connection with the merger, our financial results, including earnings per share, could be adversely affected.             SIZE=2> Intense competition in the sporting goods industry could limit our growth and reduce our profitability.           The sporting goods retail market is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. Our current and prospective competitors include many large companies that have substantially greater market presence, name recognition, financial, marketing and other resources than we do. We compete directly or indirectly with the following categories of companies:       full-line sporting goods retailers;  traditional sporting goods stores and chains;  specialty sporting goods retailers and pro shops;  mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, discount stores and department stores; and  catalog and internet-based sporting goods retailers.              Increased competition in markets in which we have stores, the adoption by competitors of innovative store formats, pricing strategies and retail sale methods, the entry of new competitors in our markets or the expansion of operations by existing competitors in our markets could cause us to lose market share, limit our growth and reduce our profitability.    29                  SIZE=2> If we are unable to predict or react to changes in consumer demand, our sales may decline and we may be required to take significant markdowns in inventory.           Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sporting goods. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Additionally, we often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors several months in advance of the proposed delivery. If we misjudge the market for our merchandise, we may lose sales or we may overstock unpopular products, which may require us to take significant inventory markdowns. In either case, our revenues and profit margins could significantly decline and our business and financial results may suffer.             SIZE=2> We sell products that expose us to a greater risk of product liability and infringement claims, and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages related to those claims. Additionally, we face claims in Illinois relating to the sale of handguns before 1999.           We may be subject to lawsuits resulting from injuries associated with the use of sporting goods equipment that we sell or rent. Among other things, we sell long guns, handguns and air pistols, which are products that are associated with an increased risk of injury and related lawsuits. We may incur losses relating to these claims or the defense of these claims. We may also incur losses due to lawsuits relating to our performance of background checks on firearm purchasers as mandated by state and federal law or the improper use of firearms sold by us, including lawsuits by municipalities or other organizations attempting to recover costs from firearm manufacturers and retailers relating to the misuse of firearms. In addition, in the future there may be increased federal, state or local regulation, including taxation, of the sale of firearms in our current markets as well as future markets in which we may operate. Commencement of these lawsuits against us or the establishment of new regulations could reduce our sales and decrease our profitability. There is a risk that claims or liabilities will exceed our insurance coverage.             TSA Stores is one of thirty-three named defendants, including firearms manufacturers, distributors and retailers, in City of Chicago and County of Cook v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp. et al., Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. This suit was served on TSA Stores in November 1998. The original complaint was based on legal theories of public nuisance and negligent entrustment of firearms and alleged that the defendants created a public nuisance by distributing, marketing and selling firearms in the portion of Cook County outside Chicago knowing or recklessly disregarding that these guns would be illegally transferred and used in Chicago to commit crimes. The complaint sought damages allocated among the defendants exceeding $433 million to compensate the City of Chicago and Cook County for their alleged costs resulting from the alleged public nuisance. The complaint also sought punitive damages and injunctive relief imposing additional regulations on the methods the defendants use to distribute, market and sell firearms in Cook County. In February 2000, the Court dismissed the complaint's negligent entrustment count. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with the Court's permission in March 2000, which contained both the public nuisance and negligent entrustment counts. In September 2000, the Court granted the motions of the defendants to dismiss the amended complaint, in its entirety, with prejudice. In October 2000, the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of their public nuisance claim to the Appellate Court of Illinois, First Judicial District. On November 4, 2002, the Appellate Court reversed the dismissal of the public nuisance claim and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. On November 25, 2002, TSA Stores filed a petition for rehearing with the Appellate Court, which was denied on March 7, 2003. On March 27, 2003, TSA Stores joined in a petition by the other defendants for leave to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court the Appellate Court's decision reversing the trial court's dismissal of the public nuisance claim, which was granted on April 8, 2003. The Illinois Supreme Court heard oral arguments by the parties on September 10, 2003 and has yet to render a decision. We are currently unable to predict the outcome of this case.    30                  There is a risk that claims or liabilities with respect to lawsuits will exceed our insurance coverage. Additionally, we may be unable to purchase adequate liability insurance in the future. Although we have entered into product and infringement liability indemnity agreements with many of our vendors, we cannot assure you that we will be able to collect payments sufficient to offset product liability losses. Furthermore, we are subject to regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and similar state regulatory agencies. If we fail to comply with government and industry safety standards, we may be subject to claims, lawsuits, fines and adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.              SIZE=2> If our suppliers and distributors do not provide us with sufficient quantities of products, or if conditions in any of the foreign countries where they source merchandise adversely change, we may not be able to offer competitively priced merchandise or the quantities or assortment that our customers demand.           We purchase merchandise from over 1,000 vendors. In fiscal 2003, purchases from Nike represented approximately 13.0% of our total purchases. Although purchases from no other vendor represented more than 10.0% of our total purchases, our dependence on our principal suppliers involves risk. We do not have long-term agreements with our suppliers and cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain our relationships with them. If there is a disruption in supply from a principal supplier or distributor, we may be unable to obtain the merchandise that we desire to sell and that consumers desire to purchase. Moreover, many of our suppliers provide us with incentives, such as return privileges, volume purchasing allowances and cooperative advertising allowances. A decline or discontinuation of these incentives could reduce our profits.            Additionally, we believe that a significant portion of the products that we purchase, including those purchased from domestic suppliers, are manufactured abroad. Government regulations, political unrest, war, changes in local economic or labor conditions, trade issues or interruptions or delays in imports could disrupt or delay shipments of merchandise to our stores and cause shortages in our inventory and a decline in our sales. If one or more of these factors occur, our business and financial results could suffer.             SIZE=2> Our comparable store sales will fluctuate and may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance.           Changes in our comparable store sales results could affect the price of our common stock. A number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our comparable store sales results, including:       competition;  our new store openings;  general regional and national economic conditions;  actions taken by our competitors;  consumer trends and preferences;  changes in the other tenants in the shopping centers in which we are located;  new product introductions and changes in our product mix;  timing and effectiveness of promotional events;  lack of new product introductions to spur growth in the sale of various kinds of sports equipment; and  weather.            Our comparable store sales may vary from quarter to quarter, and an unanticipated decline in revenues or comparable store sales may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.    31                   SIZE=2> Our business is seasonal, and our annual results are highly dependent on the success of our holiday selling season.           Our business is highly seasonal in nature. Our highest sales and operating profitability historically occur during the fourth fiscal quarter, which is due, in part, to the holiday selling season and, in part, to our strong sales of cold weather sporting goods and apparel. Any decrease in our fourth quarter sales, whether because of a slow holiday selling season, poor snowfall in ski areas near our markets, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year.       A downturn in the economy could significantly reduce our revenues.               Sales of sporting goods historically depend on consumers' discretionary spending. An economic downturn in any of our major markets, or in general, could reduce consumer spending on discretionary items that could adversely impact our revenues and cause our business and financial results to suffer.            General economic conditions are beyond our control and are affected by:       the impact of an economic recession;  unemployment trends;  interest rates and inflation;  consumer and commercial credit availability;  consumer debt levels;  geopolitical uncertainty;  tax rates and tax policy;  the impact of natural disasters; and  other factors that influence consumer confidence and spending.             Increasing volatility in financial markets may cause the above factors to change with an even greater degree of frequency and magnitude.              SIZE=2> We have a significant amount of debt that could adversely affect our business and growth prospects.           We entered into a credit facility at the completion of the TSA merger that provides for loans of up to $600 million. As of January 31, 2004, we had approximately $317.3 million of long-term debt. This debt could have significant adverse effects on our business. This debt:       makes it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms;  requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of our debt and the interest on our debt;  limits our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities; and  makes us more vulnerable to economic downturns.             If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, we may have to refinance all or a portion of our debt and/or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms could be obtained or that we will be able to operate at a profit.    32                  Additionally, the credit facility entered into upon consummation of the merger imposes operating and financial restrictions that may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to grow our business.             SIZE=2> Our business depends on our ability to satisfy our labor needs.            Many of our employees are in entry-level or part-time positions that historically have high rates of turnover. We may be unable to satisfy our labor needs and control our costs due to external factors such as unemployment levels, minimum wage legislation and wage inflation. If general economic conditions improve, it may be more difficult to attract and retain quality employees. As a result, our business may suffer.       Terrorist attacks or acts of war may seriously harm our business.               Terrorist attacks or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees, facilities, information systems, vendors and customers, which could significantly impact our net sales, costs and expenses and financial condition. The threat of terrorist attacks in the United States since September 11, 2001 continues to create many economic and political uncertainties. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause our business to suffer in ways that we currently cannot predict. The military action taken by the United States and its allies against the government of Iraq could have a short or long term negative economic impact upon the financial markets and our business in general. Additionally, events such as those referred to above could cause or contribute to a general decline in equity valuations, which in turn could reduce the market value of your investment in us.             SIZE=2> Because an equity owner of one of our significant stockholders is a member of the board of directors of one of our competitors, there may be conflicts of interest.           Green Equity Investors, L.P. (we refer to Green Equity Investors, L.P. and its affiliates as Leonard Green) currently holds approximately 8% of our outstanding common stock. Jonathan D. Sokoloff, one of our current directors, and Jonathan A. Seiffer, a former director, are equity owners of Leonard Green, and both previously served on Big 5 Sporting Goods' board of directors. John G. Danhakl, also an equity owner of Leonard Green, currently serves on the board of directors of Big 5 Sporting Goods. Leonard Green does not have formal procedures to prohibit Messrs. Seiffer, Sokoloff and Danhakl from sharing information about us and Big 5 Sporting Goods with each other. Messrs. Seiffer, Sokoloff and Danhakl may have conflicts of interest with respect to various matters affecting us, including the pursuit of business opportunities presented to Leonard Green. Leonard Green does not have procedures in place that are designed to resolve conflicts arising in connection with its investments in entities that compete with each other. All potential conflicts may not be resolved in a manner that is favorable to us. We believe that it is impossible to predict the precise circumstances under which future potential conflicts may arise, and, therefore, we intend to address potential conflicts on a case-by-case basis.             SIZE=2> Anti-takeover provisions may prevent stockholders from realizing a premium return.           Anti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter unfriendly offers or other efforts to obtain control over us. These anti-takeover provisions, among other things:       allow our board of directors to issue "blank check" preferred stock without stockholder approval, and establish the rights, including voting rights, preferences and limitations of the preferred stock;  establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to the board of directors or for stockholder proxy proposals;    33             permit the board of directors to increase its own size and fill the resulting vacancies through a majority vote of directors, even if less than a quorum; and  require that mergers and other business combinations with certain interested stockholders, including any holder of 10% or more of our common stock, be approved by a supermajority of the holders of our common stock that are not interested in the transaction.             Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our common stock.            These measures could make us less attractive to a potential acquirer and deprive stockholders of the opportunity to sell their common stock at a premium price.             SIZE=2> Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate substantially, which may adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock, particularly if our quarterly results fall below the expectations of securities analysts.           Our sales and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future. These fluctuations may adversely affect our business, financial condition and the market price of our common stock, particularly if our quarterly results fall below the expectations of securities analysts. A number of factors, many of which are outside our control, may cause variations in our quarterly net sales and operating results, including:       changes in consumer demand for the products that we offer in our stores;  pre-opening costs associated with new stores;  costs related to the closures of existing stores;  litigation;  changes in merchandise mix;  sales and promotional events sponsored by our competitors; and  general economic conditions.               SIZE=2> Our stock price has been volatile in the past and may remain volatile in the future. The value of our common stock may decline as a result of this volatility.           The market price of our common stock has been in the past, and may in the future be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as:       fluctuations in quarterly operating results;  announcements, by us or our competitors, of actual or expected financial results, significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;  changes in recommendations or financial estimates by securities analysts;  conditions and trends in the sporting goods industry; and  general conditions in the economy or the financial markets.             Additionally, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to the performance or condition of particular companies. Such broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company. If we become subject to this kind of litigation in the future, it could result in substantial litigation costs, damages awards against us and the diversion of our management's attention and resources.    34                   SIZE=2> The loss of key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business.            Our future success depends on the continued services of our senior management, particularly John Douglas Morton, our vice chairman of the board and chief executive officer. Any loss or interruption of the services of our senior management could significantly reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations and implement our key initiatives because we may not be able to find appropriate replacements for our senior management should the need arise. If we were to lose any key senior management, our business could be materially adversely affected.             SIZE=2> We rely on our information systems to operate our business, and if our information systems fail to adequately perform these functions, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.           The efficient operation of our business is dependent on the successful integration and operation of our information systems. In particular, we rely on our information systems to manage effectively our sales, warehousing, distribution, merchandise planning and replenishment and to optimize our overall inventory levels. Most of our information systems are centrally located at our headquarters, with offsite backup at other locations. Following the TSA merger, we continue to focus on the integration of the warehouse management systems and store point-of-sale systems. Some of our systems have not been fully implemented and require additional configuration, testing and user training before they become fully operational. Systems integration issues are complex, time-consuming and expensive. The failure to integrate successfully our information systems or their failure to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business, lead to unanticipated costs, adversely affect our revenues and cause our business and financial results to suffer.             SIZE=2> A disruption in the operation of our distribution centers would affect our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores, which could impact adversely our revenues and harm our business and financial results.           Most of our merchandise is shipped by our vendors to a limited number of distribution centers. Our distribution centers receive and allocate merchandise to our stores. Events such as fire or other catastrophic events, any malfunction or disruption of our centralized information systems or shipping problems may result in delays or disruptions in the timely distribution of merchandise to our stores, which could adversely impact our revenues and our business and financial results.            Our ability to successfully operate the new regional distribution center in Burlington, New Jersey will depend on the successful integration of our warehouse management systems. Additionally, the success of this and other supply chain initiatives is heavily dependent on the implementation and consistent execution of new processes and the use of new systems capabilities by our merchandising and supply chain personnel. The new distribution center may not enable us to improve the flow of merchandise to our stores or improve our inventory management.              SIZE=2> Lack of available retail store sites on terms acceptable to us, rising real estate prices and other costs and risks relating to new store openings could severely limit our growth opportunities.           Our strategy includes opening stores in new and existing markets. We must successfully choose store sites, execute favorable real estate transactions on terms that are acceptable to us, hire competent personnel and effectively open and operate these new stores. Our plans to increase the number of our retail stores will depend in part on the availability of existing retail stores or store sites. We may not have stores or sites available to us for purchase or lease, or available on terms acceptable to us. If additional retail store sites are unavailable on acceptable terms, we may not be able to carry out a significant part of our growth strategy. Rising real estate costs and acquisition, construction and development costs could also inhibit our ability to grow. If we fail to locate desirable sites, obtain lease rights to these sites on terms acceptable to us, hire adequate personnel and open and effectively operate these new stores, our financial performance could be adversely affected.             SIZE=2> We may pursue strategic acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business.   35                  We may from time to time acquire complementary companies or businesses. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities. We may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general store operating procedures. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions, our business could suffer. In addition, the integration of any acquired business, and their financial results, into ours may adversely affect our operating results. We currently do not have any agreements with respect to any such acquisitions.     NAME="de1607_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02669">      ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk           Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from our long-term debt agreement. Our long-term debt bears interest at variable rates that are tied to either the U.S. prime rate or LIBOR at the time of the borrowing. We maintain portions of our debt in LIBOR traunches that mature in one to nine months. As those traunches mature, the interest rates on our outstanding borrowings are changed to reflect current prime or LIBOR rates. Therefore, our interest expense changes as the prime or LIBOR market rates change. We have entered into two interest rate swap instruments, designated as cash flow hedges, as shown in the following table:       Date  Entered Into       Rate paid     Rate received     Notional amount     Fair value  at 01/31/04       June 28, 2001     5.35%     3-mo. US Libor     $  20,000,000     $  (420,000  )    December 11, 2002     2.95%     3-mo. US Libor     $  40,000,000     $  (815,000  )               Based on our overall interest rate exposure at January 31, 2004, a hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in interest rates applied to borrowings under our revolving credit facility would change our after-tax earnings by approximately $1.6 million over a 12-month period prior to considering the effects of our interest rate swaps.            Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates is limited because we do not operate any stores outside of the United States. We do not consider the market risk exposure relating to foreign currency exchange to be material. Foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on us during the quarter or year to date periods in fiscal 2003, 2002 or 2001.
