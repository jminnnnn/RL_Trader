ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                   The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with "Selected Consolidated Financial Data" and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors.   Overview             On August 4, 2003, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gart Sports Company completed a merger with The Sports Authority, Inc., and Gart Sports Company was renamed The Sports Authority, Inc. The references made to the entities herein refer to The Sports Authority, Inc. (formerly Gart Sports Company which includes "Sports Authority" or "Company" or "we" or "our" or "us") and its subsidiaries. "TSA" refers to TSA Stores Inc. (formerly known as The Sports Authority, Inc.). The merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting with Gart Sports Company as the acquirer. Accordingly, the results of operations below for fiscal 2003 include the results of TSA since the date of the merger. The combined company is headquartered in Englewood, Colorado and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "TSA."            Following the TSA merger, we are one of the nation's largest publicly traded full-line sporting goods retailers, with a presence in most major markets across the United States. At January 29, 2005, we operated 392 stores in 45 states under the Sports Authority, Gart Sports, Oshman's and Sportmart brand names. We also have a licensing agreement with Mega Sports Co. Ltd., a joint venture between the Company and AEON Co., Ltd., to operate stores in Japan under the Sports Authority name.            With our major financial and retail systems integrated by the end of fiscal 2003, fiscal 2004 was dedicated to continued integration of processes and merchandise assortments and improving the effectiveness of the Company's supply chain. To ensure that we get the right merchandise to the right store at the right time, we retrofitted the TSA Burlington, New Jersey and McDonough, Georgia distribution centers to conform to consistent company-wide systems, and also commenced operations in our new 616,000 square foot distribution center in Fontana, California late in the first quarter. As of January 29, 2005, we have completed or initiated 46 TSA store remodels since the merger. In addition, we have completed 47 "Golf Day" shops for a total of 66 company-wide. Finally, we now have our full service "Statement Shoe Walls" in over 200 stores company-wide. These Statement Shoe Walls provide a full service environment for higher priced performance footwear. From a merchandise assortment perspective, we have substantially completed our enhanced product offerings in the fitness category and our expansion of winter sports products into the TSA markets. We continue to assess our private label programs for the best ways to optimize these programs on a company-wide basis.            During fiscal 2004 we opened 22 new stores, closed 12 underperforming TSA stores and two smaller format stores and relocated two stores. Our comparable store sales for fiscal 2004 decreased 2.0%. In fiscal 2004 we experienced comparable store sales declines in our team sports, outdoor, fitness and skate categories, which were partially offset by increased sales driven by our remodeled TSA stores and increases in the outdoor apparel and ski categories.            Given the economic characteristics of our store formats, the similar nature of the products sold, the type of customer and method of distribution, our operations are aggregated in one reportable segment as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."    17           Results of Operations             The following table sets forth for the periods indicated, certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales and the number of stores open at the end of each period (dollars rounded to millions):             Fiscal 2004     Fiscal 2003     Fiscal 2002             Dollars     %     Dollars     %     Dollars     %       Net sales     $  2,435.9     100.0  %  $  1,760.5     100.0  %  $  1,051.2     100.0  %    Cost of goods sold, buying, distribution and occupancy        1,756.9     72.1        1,274.5     72.4        776.4     73.9                                       Gross profit        679.0     27.9        486.0     27.6        274.8     26.1       Operating expenses        579.8     23.8        407.5     23.1        227.8     21.7       Merger integration costs        21.8     0.9        43.8     2.5                    Pre-opening expenses        4.0     0.2        1.9     0.1        1.4     0.1                                       Operating income        73.4     3.0        32.7     1.9        45.6     4.3       Interest expense        (20.1  )  (0.8  )     (12.3  )  (0.7  )     (9.2  )  (0.9  )    Other income, net        1.4     0.1        3.5     0.2        1.0     0.1                                       Income before income taxes        54.8     2.2        24.0     1.4        37.5     3.6       Income tax expense        (21.3  )  (0.9  )     (7.7  )  (0.4  )     (14.5  )  (1.4  )                                    Net income     $  33.5     1.4  %  $  16.3     0.9  %  $  23.0     2.2  %                                    Number of stores at end of period        392              384              181                        We consider cost of goods sold to include the direct cost of merchandise, plus certain costs associated with procurement, warehousing, handling and distribution. In addition to the full cost of inventory, cost of goods sold includes related store occupancy costs and amortization and depreciation of leasehold improvements and rental equipment.            Operating expenses include controllable and non-controllable store expenses (except occupancy), non-store expenses and depreciation and amortization not associated with cost of goods sold.    Fiscal 2004 as compared to Fiscal 2003             Net Sales.     Net sales increased $675.4 million, or 38.4%, to $2,435.9 million in fiscal 2004, compared to $1,760.5 million in fiscal 2003. Of the $675.4 million increase, $642.7 million is due to the inclusion of sales from TSA stores acquired in the merger in the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2004 versus results for Gart Sports on a stand-alone basis for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2003. The remaining increase of $32.7 million is attributable primarily to sales from new store openings of $98.2 million, offset by $37.5 million of sales decreases from store closures and lower comparable store sales. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2004 were down 2.0%. However, we had positive performance in the outdoor apparel and ski categories primarily due to our expansion of winter sports products into certain TSA markets. In aggregate, these categories produced a $30.6 million, or a 1.3% increase, in comparable store sales. Additionally, we have experienced strong sales trends in our remodeled TSA stores. Offsetting these gains were declines in the fitness, team sports, outdoor and skate categories aggregating $52.1 million, or a 2.2% decrease, in comparable store sales. During the second fiscal quarter of 2004 we reassigned responsibilities within the merchandising group, which resulted in some short-term disruption in placement and allocation of product orders, which negatively impacted the sales in several categories. In the third fiscal quarter of 2004, we experienced a decline in comparable store sales partially as a result of the hurricanes that impacted the southeastern United States.    18                  Gross Profit.     Gross profit for fiscal 2004 was $679.0 million, or 27.9% of net sales, as compared to $486.0 million, or 27.6% of net sales, for fiscal 2003, or an improvement of 30 basis points. This improvement was due to an increase in gross profit of 117 basis points as a result of improved merchandise margins resulting primarily from lower inventory costs due to the increased buying power of the combined company and improved shrink performance. The application of EITF 02-16 produced an increase in gross profit of $4.4 million, or 15 basis points, for vendor entitlements recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold which would historically have been treated as a reduction of advertising expense. These increases in gross profit were partially offset by higher store occupancy and distribution center costs as a percent of sales.            Operating Expenses.     Operating expenses in fiscal 2004 were $579.8 million, or 23.8% of net sales, as compared to $407.5 million, or 23.1% of net sales, for fiscal 2003. These increases are primarily due to the operating costs associated with the acquired TSA stores and as a result of the application of EITF 02-16 which resulted in the additional recharacterization of $4.2 million, or 0.2% of net sales, in vendor entitlements from a reduction of advertising expense to a reduction of cost of inventory purchased in 2004. Additionally, operating expenses increased as a percentage of sales due to the decrease in comparable store sales.            Merger Integration Costs.     Merger integration costs for fiscal 2004 were $21.8 million, or 0.9% of net sales, compared to $43.8 million, or 2.5% of net sales, for fiscal 2003. Integration costs include only non-recurring, incremental costs arising as a direct result of integrating the two companies following the TSA merger. For fiscal 2004, these costs consisted primarily of $10.2 million of severance, recruitment fees and duplicative payroll and benefits, $7.0 million for consulting fees related to integrating the two companies, $2.0 million in relocation and travel expenses, $1.3 million related to closing the operations of the former TSA corporate office and closure of a Gart distribution center, and $1.0 million in advertising expense related to rebranding. For fiscal 2003, these costs consisted of $17.7 million of duplicative payroll, benefits and retention payments, $8.4 million of severance costs, $6.7 million of consulting fees, $6.0 million of expense related to closing the operations of the former TSA corporate office in Ft. Lauderdale and closing a Gart store in an overlapping market, $3.0 million for relocation and travel, and $2.0 million of advertising related to rebranding and announcing the combined company.            Pre-opening expenses.     Pre-opening expenses in fiscal 2004 were $4.0 million or 0.2% of net sales, as compared to $1.9 million, or 0.1% of net sales for fiscal 2003. Pre-opening expenses in fiscal 2004 were for the addition of 22 new stores and two relocations compared to 14 new stores and three relocations in fiscal 2003.             Operating Income.     As a result of the factors described above, operating income for fiscal 2004 was $73.4 million, or 3.0% of net sales, compared to $32.7 million, or 1.9% of net sales, in fiscal 2003.            Interest Expense.     Interest expense for fiscal 2004 increased to $20.1 million, or 0.8% of net sales, from $12.3 million, or 0.7% of net sales, in the prior year. The increase in interest expense is primarily related to increased debt levels due to the assumption of TSA debt upon completion of the merger, funding of merger and integration costs, and financing increased inventory levels due to the replacement of TSA inventory identified as clearance and non-go-forward at the time of the merger, negative comparable store sales, and our investment in the remodeling of acquired TSA stores. We also paid interest at higher rates in fiscal 2004 versus the prior year as a result of higher 90-day LIBOR rates.            Other Income.     Other income was $1.4 million for fiscal 2004 compared to $3.5 million for fiscal 2003. The prior year included $1.9 million in interest income associated with the settlement of a tax dispute involving Gart's former parent.    19                   Income Taxes.     Our income tax expense for fiscal 2004 was $21.3 million compared to $7.7 million in fiscal 2003. The prior year included a tax benefit of $1.7 million related to the settlement of the tax dispute discussed above. This one-time benefit had the effect of reducing the effective tax rate, which would otherwise have been approximately 39%, compared to approximately 39% for fiscal 2004.     Fiscal 2003 as compared to Fiscal 2002             Net Sales.     Net sales increased $709.3 million, or 67.5%, to $1,760.5 million in fiscal 2003, compared to $1,051.2 million in fiscal 2002. The sales increase reflects the inclusion of $697.0 million in sales from TSA stores from August 4, 2003, the merger date, versus results for Gart Sports on a stand-alone basis in fiscal 2002. Additionally, non-comparable sales for Gart on a stand-alone basis increased $28.3 million, net, reflecting an increase from store openings in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003 of $45.6 million, offset by a decrease of $17.3 million, primarily from store closings. Comparable store sales in fiscal 2003, which includes TSA stores since August 4, 2003, decreased 0.7%, primarily due to a first quarter decline of 8.8% for Gart on a stand-alone basis. The first quarter was impacted by a comparison to increased sales from the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002 and a decrease in sales due to a major snowstorm in the Denver area in 2003, among other factors. Sales performance improved thereafter, with relatively flat comparable store sales in the second and fourth quarters, and a 1.7% increase in the third quarter. Focusing on results for the Company following the TSA merger, comparable store sales increased $9.9 million or 0.8% for the last half of the 2003 fiscal year. The increase resulted from a positive performance in the team sports, hunting and camping categories, and by strong sales in the ski, snowboard and snow apparel categories in Sports Authority locations in the northeast. The northeast stores benefited from an expanded product offering in these categories, as the broader assortment available in Gart stores was introduced into Sports Authority cold-weather markets. In aggregate, these factors produced a $15.9 million or 8.0% increase in comparable store sales. Partially offsetting these gains were declines in the fitness equipment, trends/gifts and skate categories aggregating $12.7 million or 7.1% decrease in comparable store sales.            Gross Profit.     Gross profit for fiscal 2003 was $486.0 million, or 27.6% of net sales, as compared to $274.8 million, or 26.1% of net sales, for fiscal 2002. The increase as a percent of net sales reflected improved merchandise margins for the combined companies as a result of lower inventory costs. Gart Sports results also improved on a stand-alone basis over the prior year, with an increase in merchandise margins of 0.5% of net sales. The increase reflects a somewhat less promotional selling environment in fiscal 2003 than in the prior year combined with reduced inventory costs, which produced improvements in merchandise margin rates in a number of categories. These categories include fitness equipment, snowboards, hunting and camping, which produced a combined increase in merchandise margin rates of 90 basis points. In addition, the application of EITF Consensus No. 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor" ("EITF 02-16") resulted in the recharacterization of $3.0 million of vendor allowances, from a reduction of advertising expense to a reduction of the cost of inventory purchased, of which $2.1 million, or 0.1% of net sales, was recognized in cost of goods sold in fiscal 2003.            Operating Expenses.     Operating expenses in fiscal 2003 were $407.5 million, or 23.1% of net sales, compared to $227.8 million, or 21.7% of net sales, for fiscal 2002. The increase in operating expense dollars primarily reflects the store operating costs associated with 205 TSA stores acquired on August 4, 2003. Operating expenses also increased as a percent of sales due to the following factors:      (i) TSA Stores' overall operating expenses historically trended higher than Gart's. TSA Stores' selling, general and administrative expenses were 26.0%, 25.5% and 24.6% of net sales in 2002, 2001 an 2000, compared to Gart's operating expenses of 21.8% of net sales for each of fiscal 2002 and 2001, and 21.9% of net sales for fiscal 2000. The implementation of consistent operating procedures for the combined company is an ongoing process that we expect to have completed by the end of fiscal 2004;    20             (ii) The higher level of general and administrative costs as a result of the TSA merger, including insurance costs, which increased $2.8 million, and corporate office rent, which increased $1.7 million due to additional leased office space to accommodate our larger corporate offices; (iii) The recharacterization of $3.0 million, or 0.2% of net sales, of cooperative advertising monies from a reduction of advertising expense to a reduction of inventory costs as required by EITF 02-16; and (iv) Establishing a reserve for the settlement of wage and hour class action lawsuits in California totaling $1.5 million, including attorney fees and expenses, recorded in the first quarter of 2003.             Merger Integration Costs.     Merger integration costs for fiscal 2003 were $43.8 million, or 2.5% of net sales, and were related to the TSA merger. Integration costs include only non-recurring, incremental costs arising as a direct result of integrating the two companies following the merger. For fiscal 2003, these costs consisted of $17.7 million of duplicative payroll, benefits and retention payments, $8.4 million of severance costs, $6.7 million of consulting fees, $6.0 million of expense related to closing the operations of the TSA corporate office in Ft. Lauderdale and closing a Gart store in an overlapping market, $3.0 million for relocation and travel, and $2.0 million of advertising related to rebranding and announcing the combined company.            Pre-opening expenses.     Pre-opening expenses in fiscal 2003 were $1.9 million, or 0.1% of net sales, as compared to $1.4 million, or 0.1% of net sales for fiscal 2002. Pre-opening expenses in fiscal 2003 were for the addition of 14 new stores and three relocations compared to eight new stores and one relocation in fiscal 2002.            Operating Income.     As a result of the factors described above, operating income for fiscal 2003 was $32.7 million, or 1.9% of net sales, compared to $45.7 million, or 4.3% of net sales, in fiscal 2002.            Interest Expense.     Interest expense for fiscal 2003 increased to $12.3 million, or 0.7% of net sales, from $9.2 million, or 0.9% of net sales, in the prior year. The increase in interest expense is related to the assumption of TSA Stores' debt upon completion of the merger and to financing of merger and integration costs.            Other Income.     Other income was $3.5 million for fiscal 2003 compared to $1.0 million for fiscal 2002. The increase is primarily attributable to interest income associated with the settlement of the Rite Aid tax dispute totaling $2.1 million.            Income Taxes.     Our income tax expense for fiscal 2003 was $7.7 million compared to $14.5 million in fiscal 2002. Tax expense for fiscal 2003 was offset by a tax benefit of $1.7 million recorded as a result of the settlement with our former parent regarding an IRS examination of our 1992 and 1993 consolidated federal income tax returns. Excluding this one-time benefit, the Company's estimated tax rate was approximately 39% for both fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002.    Liquidity and Capital Resources             Our primary capital requirements are for inventory and other seasonal working capital needs, capital improvements, including investments in store remodeling, store fixtures and ongoing infrastructure improvements, and pre-opening expenses to support our expansion plans.    21          NAME="dc1679_cash_flow_analysis">      Cash Flow Analysis                 The following table presents changes in cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented:             Fiscal  2004     Fiscal  2003     Fiscal  2002             (dollars in thousands, except ratios)         Cash provided by operating activities     $  81,514     $  57,809     $  26,732       Cash used in investing activities        (77,750  )     (116,815  )     (31,752  )    Cash provided by (used in) financing activities        (6,935  )     76,859        3,640        Capital expenditures     $   111,114     $   79,472     $   31,801       Long-term debt (at end of period)        305,383        317,321        121,147       Working capital (at end of period)        355,518        378,909        171,799        Long-term debt to equity ratio (at end of period)         0.63         0.73         0.62                  Cash provided by operating activities increased $23.7 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. Net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization increased by $39.0 million which was offset by an increase in cash used for inventories net of accounts payable of $37.4 million. Additionally, cash used for accounts receivable decreased by $11.5 million and cash used for accrued expenses decreased by $8.9 million resulting in an increase in operating cash flows compared to fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003, the increase in cash provided by operations compared to fiscal 2002 is primarily due to a higher level of accounts payable financing in fiscal 2003, only partially offset by an increase in cash used for inventories.             Cash used in investing activities decreased $39.1 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. The change reflects an increase in cash received from the sale of property and equipment and mortgage notes of $27.8 million and the absence of any direct merger costs which totaled $42.8 million in fiscal 2003, offset by an increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 of $31.6 million. Total capital expenditures in 2004 were $111.1 million, excluding $22.1 million of tenant improvement allowances received from landlords classified as operating cash flows. The net of these amounts is $89.0 million in fiscal 2004 which was used to fund various capital improvements, including: $29.8 million for store remodels and new fixtures; $15.5 million for 22 new store openings and two relocations; $14.3 million for installation of "Golf Day" departments, "Statement Shoe Walls", and miscellaneous store improvements; $8.2 million for distribution center capital spending; and $4.5 million for information systems upgrades.            Cash used in financing activities, which typically consists principally of net borrowings or payments under our revolving credit facility, decreased $83.8 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. This decrease reflects net borrowings of $73.2 million in fiscal 2003 which were used to finance the TSA merger compared to net paydowns of $11.9 million in fiscal 2004.            Our liquidity and capital needs have principally been met by operating cash flows and by borrowings under a revolving credit facility with CIT/Business Credit, Inc. ("CIT"), as agent. Under our credit financing agreement (the "Credit Agreement") the Company may borrow up to $600,000,000, generally limited to an amount equal to 70% of eligible inventory or 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory (as defined in the agreement), but with seasonal increases in the advance rate permitted. Interest on the revolving credit facility is payable monthly at Chase Manhattan Bank's prime rate plus a margin rate ranging from 0% to 0.50% or, at our option, at Chase Manhattan Bank's LIBOR rate plus a margin rate ranging from 1.50% to 2.50%. On September 15, 2004, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Financing Agreement with CIT that modified the terms of the credit facility by providing for an additional $40 million term loan and extending the maturity date of our existing revolving credit line to August 4, 2008. The term loan was drawn in full on September 15, 2004 and is due on September 15, 2006 unless it is extended to August 4, 2008 at our    22           option upon notice given no earlier than 90 days, and no later than 30 days, prior to September 15, 2006, as long as no default has then occurred and is continuing under the Credit Agreement and if certain EBITDA and fixed charge coverage ratio minimums, as defined in the Credit Agreement, are met. Interest on the term loan is payable monthly at Chase Manhattan Bank's prime rate plus 3.25% or, at the option of the Company, at Chase Manhattan Bank's LIBOR rate plus a margin rate ranging from 5.50% to 6.00%. The Company paid one-time fees of approximately $1.2 million in fiscal 2004 to secure the Amended and Restated Financing Agreement, and is amortizing that amount over the life of the agreement on the effective interest method. At January 29, 2005, borrowings under the credit facility were $305.4 million and $186.7 million was available for borrowing.            On April 11, 2005, the Company entered into Amendment One to the Amended and Restated Financing Agreement. This amendment extends the maturity date of the revolving credit line to August 4, 2009 and modifies the method of calculating the margin spread above the applicable interest rates available to us. The pricing grids for both the term loan and the revolving credit line in the loan agreement were also modified to allow us to earn a lower spread if certain financial targets are achieved which is more favorable than the spread in the Amended and Restated Financing Agreements. Interest on the revolving credit line is payable monthly at Chase Manhattan Bank's prime rate or, at our option, at Chase Manhattan Bank's LIBOR rate plus a margin rate ranging from 1.25% to 2.00%. Interest on the term loan is payable monthly at Chase Manhattan Bank's prime rate plus a margin rate ranging from 1.50% to 2.25% or, at the option of the Company, at Chase Manhattan Bank's LIBOR rate plus a margin rate ranging from 3.00% to 4.00%. The Company paid one-time fees of approximately $400,000 to secure Amendment One to the Amended and Restated Financing Agreement            Capital expenditures, net of tenant improvement allowances, are projected to be approximately $85 to $90 million in fiscal 2005, primarily for the opening of approximately 18 new or relocating stores, remodeling of approximately 60 stores, principally Sports Authority stores, and information systems upgrades and enhancements. We lease the majority of our store locations and intend to continue to finance our new store construction with long-term operating leases. Based upon recent store openings, newly constructed stores require a cash investment, net of tenant improvement allowances received from landlords, of approximately $1.7 million for a 42,000 square foot store and approximately $1.6 million for a 32,000 square foot store.            We believe that cash generated from operations, combined with funds available under the revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to fund projected capital expenditures, future common share purchases, if any, and other working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We intend to utilize the revolving credit facility to meet seasonal fluctuations in cash flow requirements.    23        NAME="page_de1679_1_24">        Contractual obligations and commercial commitments             The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments in effect at January 29, 2005 (dollars in thousands):             Payments due by period          Total     Within  1 year     2-3  years     4-5  years     After  5 years          (in thousands)      Contractual obligations:                                                    Long term debt     $  305,383     $       $  40,000     $  265,383     $         Capital lease obligations        975        369        601        5               Operating leases, net(2)        2,013,876        208,239        412,488        380,515        1,012,634                             Total contractual cash obligations     $  2,320,234     $  208,608     $  453,089     $  645,903     $  1,012,634                                          Amount of commitment expiration per period          Total     Within  1 year     2-3  years     4-5  years     After  5 years          (in thousands)      Other commercial commitments:                                                    Purchase commitments     $  3,250     $  3,250                                  Import letters of credit     $  363     $  363     $       $       $         Standby letters of credit        16,634        11,934        4,700                                             Total commercial commitments(1)     $  20,247     $  15,547     $  4,700     $       $                                   (1) We have routine commitments under merchandise inventory purchase orders, which vary in amount from month to month depending on seasonality and other factors. Such purchase orders are cancelable by us without payment. In addition, we have entered into employment agreements with certain employees, primarily those at the vice president level and above. Payments under these employment agreements are dependent on these employees providing future services and certain payments are required to be made upon termination of employment by us without cause, as defined in the employment agreements. These items have not been included in the amounts in the above table. (2) These amounts include future minimum rent payments, net of $22.9 million of non-cancelable sublease payments, and exclude the associated operating costs of our operating leases. In addition to minimum rent payments, our leases typically provide for the payment of associated operating costs, primarily common area maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes. For the year ended January 29, 2005 these associated operating costs for our leases were approximately $55 million.     Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management             We entered into an interest rate swap agreement on December 11, 2002, expiring on May 31, 2005, and entered into a second interest rate swap agreement on June 23, 2004, expiring on June 30, 2007, to minimize the risks and costs associated with our financing activities. Under the swap agreements, we pay fixed rate interest and receive variable LIBOR interest rate payments periodically over the life of the agreements. The total notional amounts under the interest rate swaps are $115 million, which do not represent the exposure due to credit loss.            Our interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and are considered highly effective, as defined by FASB Statement No. 133. Net settlements on the swap agreements are recorded as interest expense. At January 29, 2005, the fair value of the swap agreements was a loss of $250,000, net of the    24           related tax benefit. The unrealized loss from these interest rate swaps is included in other comprehensive income and is a component of stockholders' equity.            Our exposure to foreign currency risk is not material. On April 8, 2005 we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement effective June 1, 2005 and expiring May 31, 2010 with a notional amount of $50 million. Under the swap agreement, we pay fixed rate interest and receive variable LIBOR interest rate payments periodically over the life of the agreement.    Seasonality and Inflation             The following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in fiscal 2004 and 2003. This information is unaudited, but is prepared on the same basis as the annual financial information and, in the opinion of management, reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented. The results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.             The results for the first two quarters of fiscal year 2003 are not comparable to the other periods presented due to the exclusion of The Sports Authority results of operations, prior to August 4, 2003, the date of merger.             Fiscal 2004             First  Quarter     Second  Quarter     Third  Quarter     Fourth  Quarter             (dollars in millions)         Net sales     $  572.0     $  605.0     $  545.0     $  713.8       % of full year net sales        23.5  %     24.8  %     22.4  %     29.3  %    Operating income     $  10.6     $  15.5     $  0.7     $  46.6                    Fiscal 2003             First  Quarter(1)     Second  Quarter(1)     Third  Quarter(2)     Fourth  Quarter(2)             (dollars in millions)         Net sales     $  228.4     $  267.5     $  552.5     $  712.0       % of full year net sales        13.0  %     15.2  %     31.4  %     40.4  %    Operating income (loss)     $  4.3     $  10.1     $  (9.2  )  $  27.5           (1) Amounts reflect the results of Gart Sports on a stand-alone basis for these periods. (2) Amounts include the results of the former Sports Authority, Inc. from August 4, 2004, the date of merger.            The fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter. We believe that two primary factors contribute to this seasonality: first, sales of cold weather sporting goods and ski and snowboard merchandise during the fourth quarter are generally strong in anticipation of the ski and snowboard season; and second, holiday sales contribute significantly to our operating results. As a result of these factors, inventory levels, which gradually increase beginning in April, generally reach their peak in November and then decline to their lowest level following the December holiday season. Any decrease in sales for the fourth quarter, whether due to a slow holiday selling season, poor snowfall in ski areas near our markets or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year.            Although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions, we do not believe that inflation has a material impact on our results of operations. We believe that we are generally able to pass along inflationary increases in costs to our customers.    25           Critical Accounting Policies             Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to inventory valuation, vendor allowances, the recoverability of long-lived assets including intangible assets, store closing reserves, income taxes, self insured reserves and the estimates used to apply the purchase method of accounting to our mergers and acquisitions. Management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our significant accounting policies.    Valuation of Inventory             We value our inventory at the lower of last-in, first-out ("LIFO") cost or market. Cost is determined using the average cost of items purchased and applying the dollar value LIFO inventory method. Our dollar value LIFO pools are computed using the Inventory Price Index Computation ("IPIC") method. LIFO cost of our inventories is then compared to estimated market value. This assessment of estimated market value is based on the quality and age of merchandise, the rate of sale of merchandise, the quantities on hand, and our assessment of the market conditions. Estimates and judgments are required in the determination of the market value of our inventory and future events, such as changes in customer merchandise preferences or unseasonable weather patterns, could impact the market value of our inventory.            Inventory shrinkage is accrued as a percentage of merchandise sales based on historical inventory shrinkage trends. We perform physical inventories at stores and distribution centers throughout the year. The reserve for inventory shrinkage represents an estimate for inventory shrinkage for each location since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date. These estimates are impacted by internal and external factors and may vary from actual results.    Vendor Allowances             We receive certain allowances from our vendors, which include rebates and cooperative advertising funds. These amounts are negotiated with vendors typically on an annual basis and are, at times, dependent on projected purchase volumes and advertising plans. The amounts are subject to changes in market conditions or marketing strategies of our vendors, and changes in our product purchases. We record an estimate of earned allowances based on the latest information available with respect to purchase volumes, advertising plans and status of our negotiation with vendors.    Impairment of Assets             We review long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying    26           amount or fair value less costs to sell. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets is impaired.    Store Closing Reserves             Prior to December 31, 2002 and the adoption of SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS No. 146"), we recorded a provision for store closing costs when the decision was made by management to close a store. In accordance with SFAS No. 146, for store closing activities initiated after December 31, 2002, the related liability is recorded at fair value when a liability is incurred rather than when the decision to close a store is made. This will change the timing of recognition for certain exit costs, so that certain exit costs will be recognized over the period in which the exit activities occur. We also record store exit reserves arising from our various mergers and acquisitions pursuant to SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and EITF Issue No. 95-3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination" ("EITF 95-3"). Under EITF 95-3, the costs of a plan to exit an activity of the acquired company are recognized as liabilities assumed in the business combination. As such, reserves are recorded in purchase accounting for the net present value of projected costs to be incurred after the store closing date. The costs incurred in connection with store closings primarily consist of post-closing future net lease obligations, utilities, property taxes, and employee costs directly related to the store closing.     Deferred Taxes             Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability based on projections of future operating results, which dictate our ability to realize the tax assets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets when this amount exceeds the amount more likely than not to be realized. As of January 29, 2005, we had no valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.     Self Insured Reserves             We are self-insured for our workers' compensation, general liability and employee medical plans up to a self-insured retention amount. We record a reserve for the estimated cost of both reported and incurred but not reported ("IBNR") claims. The estimate of our current claim obligation requires significant judgment and is based on specific loss estimates for reported claims, and on loss triangulation estimates of future claims payments, including IBNR's. Reserves are regularly evaluated for adequacy based on the most current available information, including historical claims experience and expected future claims costs.     Acquisitions and Mergers Accounting             Our acquisitions and mergers are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the total costs of such transactions are allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. The determination of fair values involves the use of estimates and assumptions, which are subject to adjustment in the future. While we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate, and will not require adjustment in future periods.    27           Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements             In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4" ("SFAS No. 151"). SFAS No. 151 clarifies that inventory costs that are "abnormal" are required to be charged to expense as incurred as opposed to being capitalized into inventory as a product cost. SFAS No. 151 provides examples of "abnormal" costs to include costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage). SFAS No. 151 is effective for the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. While we continue to evaluate the impact of SFAS No. 151, we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.            In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004) ("SFAS No. 123R"), "Share Based Payment," which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." SFAS No. 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and amends SFAS No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows". Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values over the period during which the employees are required to provide services in exchange for the equity instruments. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. Under the provisions of this statement, we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption. The transition alternatives include retrospective and prospective adoption methods. Under the retrospective method, prior periods may be restated based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No. 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures (see Note 2(q)) either for all periods presented or as of the beginning of the year of adoption. The prospective method requires that compensation expense be recognized beginning with the effective date for all share-based payments granted after the effective date, and for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of this statement that remain unvested on the effective date. The provisions of this statement are effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. We are currently evaluating the requirements of this revision and have not determined its method of adoption.    Risks and Uncertainties              Intense competition in the sporting goods industry could limit our growth and reduce our profitability.            The sporting goods retail market is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. Our current and prospective competitors include many large companies that have substantially greater market presence, name recognition, financial, marketing and other resources than we do. We compete directly or indirectly with the following categories of companies:       large format full-line sporting goods retailers;  traditional sporting goods stores and chains;  specialty sporting goods retailers and pro shops;  mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, discount stores and department stores; and  catalog and internet-based sporting goods retailers.             Increased competition in markets in which we have stores, the adoption by competitors of innovative store formats, pricing strategies and retail sale methods, the entry of new competitors in our markets or the expansion of operations by existing competitors in our markets could cause us to lose market share, limit our growth and reduce our profitability.    28                    SIZE=2> If we are unable to predict or react to changes in consumer demand, our sales may decline and we may be required to take significant markdowns in inventory.           Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sporting goods. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Additionally, we often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors several months in advance of the proposed delivery. If we misjudge the market for our merchandise, we may lose sales or we may overstock unpopular products, which may require us to take significant inventory markdowns. In either case, our revenues and profit margins could significantly decline and our business and financial results may suffer.             SIZE=2> We sell products that expose us to a greater risk of product liability and infringement claims, and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages related to those claims. Additionally, we face claims in Illinois relating to the sale of handguns before 1999.           We may be subject to lawsuits resulting from injuries associated with the use of sporting goods equipment that we sell or rent. Among other things, we sell long guns, handguns and air pistols, which are products that are associated with an increased risk of injury and related lawsuits. We may incur losses relating to these claims or the defense of these claims. We may also incur losses due to lawsuits relating to our performance of background checks on firearm purchasers as mandated by state and federal law or the improper use of firearms sold by us, including lawsuits by municipalities or other organizations attempting to recover costs from firearm manufacturers and retailers relating to the misuse of firearms. In addition, in the future there may be increased federal, state or local regulation, including taxation, of the sale of firearms in our current markets as well as future markets in which we may operate. Commencement of these lawsuits against us or the establishment of new regulations could reduce our sales and decrease our profitability.            TSA Stores is one of thirty-three named defendants, including firearms manufacturers, distributors and retailers, in City of Chicago and County of Cook v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp. et al., Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. This suit was served on TSA Stores in November 1998. The original complaint was based on legal theories of public nuisance and negligent entrustment of firearms and alleged that the defendants created a public nuisance by distributing, marketing and selling firearms in the portion of Cook County outside Chicago knowing or recklessly disregarding that these guns would be illegally transferred and used in Chicago to commit crimes. The complaint sought damages allocated among the defendants exceeding $433 million to compensate the City of Chicago and Cook County for their alleged costs resulting from the alleged public nuisance. The complaint also sought punitive damages and injunctive relief imposing additional regulations on the methods the defendants use to distribute, market and sell firearms in Cook County. In February 2000, the Court dismissed the complaint's negligent entrustment count. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with the Court's permission in March 2000, which contained both the public nuisance and negligent entrustment counts. In September 2000, the Court granted the motions of the defendants to dismiss the amended complaint, in its entirety, with prejudice. In October 2000, the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of their public nuisance claim to the Appellate Court of Illinois, First Judicial District. On November 4, 2002, the Appellate Court reversed the dismissal of the public nuisance claim and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. While the other defendants filed a petition for leave to appeal before the Illinois Supreme Court, TSA Stores filed a petition for rehearing with the Appellate Court on November 25, 2002. The Appellate Court denied this motion on March 7, 2003. On March 27, 2003, TSA Stores filed an additional petition, as the other defendants had done previously, for leave to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court. On May 5, 2003, the Illinois Supreme Court granted the plaintiffs' subsequent motion to hold the TSA Stores's petition in abeyance, pending resolution of the other defendants' appeal. On September 10, 2003, the Illinois Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the other defendants' appeal, and on November 18, 2004, issued an opinion reversing the Appellate    29           Court's decision and affirming the trial court's dismissal of the case. On January 24, 2005, the Illinois Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' petition for rehearing. On January 26, 2005, the Illinois Supreme Court exercised its supervisory authority to reverse the Appellate Court and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The time period for the plaintiffs to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court has not run so we are currently unable to predict the outcome of this case.             There is a risk that claims or liabilities with respect to lawsuits will exceed our insurance coverage. Additionally, we may be unable to purchase adequate liability insurance in the future. Although we have entered into product and infringement liability indemnity agreements with many of our vendors, we cannot assure you that we will be able to collect payments sufficient to offset product liability losses. Furthermore, we are subject to regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and similar state regulatory agencies. If we fail to comply with government and industry safety standards, we may be subject to claims, lawsuits, fines and adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.              SIZE=2> If our suppliers and distributors do not provide us with sufficient quantities of products, or if conditions in any of the foreign countries where they source merchandise adversely change, we may not be able to offer competitively priced merchandise or the quantities or assortment that our customers demand.           We purchase merchandise from over 1,000 vendors. In fiscal 2004, purchases from Nike represented approximately 13.8% of our total purchases. Although purchases from no other vendor represented more than 10.0% of our total purchases, our dependence on our principal suppliers involves risk. We do not have long-term agreements with our suppliers and cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain our relationships with them. If there is a disruption in supply from a principal supplier or distributor, we may be unable to obtain the merchandise that we desire to sell and that consumers desire to purchase. Moreover, many of our suppliers provide us with incentives, such as return privileges, volume purchasing discounts, rebates and cooperative advertising allowances. A decline or discontinuation of these incentives could reduce our profits.            We believe that a significant portion of the products that we purchase, including those purchased from domestic suppliers, is manufactured abroad in countries such as China, Taiwan and South Korea. In addition, we believe much of our private label merchandise is manufactured abroad. Foreign imports subject us to the risks of changes in import duties, quotas, loss of "most favored nation" or MFN status with the United States for a particular foreign country, work stoppages, delays in shipment, freight cost increases and economic uncertainties (including the United States imposing antidumping or countervailing duty orders, safeguards, remedies or compensation and retaliation due to illegal foreign trade practices). If any of these or other factors were to cause a disruption of trade from the countries in which the suppliers of our vendors are located, our inventory levels may be reduced or the cost of our products may increase. In addition, to the extent that any foreign manufacturers from whom we purchase products directly or indirectly utilize labor and other practices that vary from those commonly accepted in the United States, we could be hurt by any resulting negative publicity or, in come cases, face potential liability. To date, we have not experienced any difficulties of this nature.             Historically, instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in which our vendors or we obtain our products has not had a material adverse effect on our operations. However, we cannot predict the effect that future changes in economic or political conditions in such foreign countries may have on our operations. In the event of disruptions or delays in supply due to economic or political conditions in foreign countries, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect our results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, merchandise purchased from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the merchandise we currently purchase abroad.             Countries from which our vendors obtain these new products may, from time to time, impose new or adjust prevailing quotas or other restrictions on exported products, and the United States may    30           impose new duties, quotas and other restrictions on imported products. The United States Congress periodically considers other restrictions on the importation of products obtained by our vendors and us. The cost of such products may increase for us if applicable duties are raised, or import quotas with respect to such products are imposed or made more restrictive.              SIZE=2> Our comparable store sales will fluctuate and may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance.           Changes in our comparable store sales results could affect the price of our common stock. A number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our comparable store sales results, including:       competition;  our new store openings and remodeling;  general regional and national economic conditions;  actions taken by our competitors;  consumer trends and preferences;  changes in the other tenants in the shopping centers in which we are located;  new product introductions and changes in our product mix;  timing and effectiveness of promotional events;  lack of new product introductions to spur growth in the sale of various kinds of sports equipment; and  weather.            Our comparable store sales may vary from quarter to quarter, and an unanticipated decline in revenues or comparable store sales may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.             SIZE=2> Our business is seasonal, and our annual results are highly dependent on the success of our holiday selling season.            Our business is highly seasonal in nature. Our highest sales and operating profitability historically occur during the fourth fiscal quarter, which is due, in part, to the holiday selling season and, in part, to our strong sales of cold weather sporting goods and apparel. Any decrease in our fourth quarter sales, whether because of a slow holiday selling season, poor snowfall in ski areas near our markets, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year.             SIZE=2> A downturn in the economy could significantly reduce our revenues.            Sales of sporting goods historically depend on consumers' discretionary spending. An economic downturn in any of our major markets, or in general, could reduce consumer spending on discretionary items that could adversely impact our revenues and cause our business and financial results to suffer.            General economic conditions and other factors that affect discretionary spending are beyond our control and are affected by:       the impact of an economic recession;  unemployment trends;  interest rates and inflation;  consumer and commercial credit availability;    31              consumer debt levels;  geopolitical uncertainty;  tax rates and tax policy;  the impact of natural disasters; and  other factors that influence consumer confidence and spending.             Increasing volatility in financial markets may cause the above factors to change with an even greater degree of frequency and magnitude.              SIZE=2> We have a significant amount of debt that could adversely affect our business and growth prospects.           We entered into a credit facility at the completion of the TSA merger that provides for loans of up to $640 million. As of January 29, 2005, we had approximately $305.4 million of long-term debt outstanding. This debt could have significant adverse effects on our business. This debt:       makes it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms;  requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of our debt and the interest on our debt;  limits our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities; and  makes us more vulnerable to economic downturns.             If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, we may have to refinance all or a portion of our debt and/or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms could be obtained or that we will be able to operate at a profit.            Additionally, the credit facility entered into upon consummation of the merger imposes operating and financial restrictions that may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to grow our business.             SIZE=2> Our business depends on our ability to satisfy our labor needs.           Many of our employees are in entry-level or part-time positions that historically have high rates of turnover. We may be unable to satisfy our labor needs and control our costs due to external factors such as unemployment levels, minimum wage legislation and wage inflation. If general economic conditions improve, it may be more difficult to attract and retain quality employees. As a result, our business may suffer.             SIZE=2> Terrorist attacks or acts of war may seriously harm our business.            Terrorist attacks or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees, facilities, information systems, vendors and customers, which could significantly impact our net sales, costs and expenses and financial condition. The threat of terrorist attacks in the United States since September 11, 2001 continues to create many economic and political uncertainties. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause our business to suffer in ways that we currently cannot predict. The military action taken by the United States and its allies against the government of Iraq could have a short or long term negative economic impact upon the financial markets and our business in general. Additionally, events such as those referred to above could cause or contribute to a general decline in equity valuations, which in turn could reduce the market value of your investment in us.    32                    SIZE=2> Anti-takeover provisions may prevent stockholders from realizing a premium return.            Anti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter unfriendly offers or other efforts to obtain control over us. These anti-takeover provisions, among other things:       allow our board of directors to issue "blank check" preferred stock without stockholder approval, and establish the rights, including voting rights, preferences and limitations of the preferred stock;  establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to the board of directors or for stockholder proxy proposals;  permit the board of directors to increase its own size and fill the resulting vacancies through a majority vote of directors, even if less than a quorum; and  require that mergers and other business combinations with certain interested stockholders, including any holder of 10% or more of our common stock, be approved by a supermajority of the holders of our common stock that are not interested in the transaction.             Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our common stock.            These measures could make us less attractive to a potential acquirer and deprive stockholders of the opportunity to sell their common stock at a premium price.             SIZE=2> Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate substantially, which may adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock, particularly if our quarterly results fall below the expectations of securities analysts.           Our sales and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future. These fluctuations may adversely affect our business, financial condition and the market price of our common stock, particularly if our quarterly results fall below the expectations of securities analysts. A number of factors, many of which are outside our control, may cause variations in our quarterly net sales and operating results, including:       changes in consumer demand for the products that we offer in our stores;  lockouts or strikes involving professional sports teams;  adverse weather conditions;  pre-opening costs associated with new stores;  costs related to the closures of existing stores;  litigation;  changes in merchandise mix;  pricing and promotional events sponsored by our competitors; and  general economic conditions.              SIZE=2> Our stock price has been volatile in the past and may remain volatile in the future. The value of our common stock may decline as a result of this volatility.           The market price of our common stock has been in the past, and may in the future be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as:       fluctuations in quarterly operating results;    33              announcements, by us or our competitors, of actual or expected financial results, significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;  changes in recommendations or financial estimates by securities analysts;  conditions and trends in the sporting goods industry; and  general conditions in the economy or the financial markets.             Additionally, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to the performance or condition of particular companies. Such broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company. If we become subject to this kind of litigation in the future, it could result in substantial litigation costs, damages awards against us and the diversion of our management's attention and resources.             SIZE=2> The loss of key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business.           Our future success depends on the continued services of our senior management, particularly John Douglas Morton, our chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president. Any loss or interruption of the services of our senior management could significantly reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations and implement our key initiatives because we may not be able to find appropriate replacements for our senior management should the need arise. If we were to lose any key senior management, our business could be materially adversely affected.             SIZE=2> We rely on our information systems to operate our business, and if our information systems fail to adequately perform these functions, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.           The efficient operation of our business is dependent on the successful integration and operation of our information systems. In particular, we rely on our information systems to manage effectively our sales, warehousing, distribution, merchandise planning and replenishment and to optimize our overall inventory levels. Most of our information systems are centrally located at our headquarters, with offsite backup at other locations. Following the TSA merger, we continue to focus on enhancements to the warehouse management systems and store point-of-sale systems. Systems enhancement issues are complex, time-consuming and expensive. Their failure to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business, lead to unanticipated costs, adversely affect our revenues and cause our business and financial results to suffer.             SIZE=2> A disruption in the operation of our distribution centers would affect our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores, which could impact adversely our revenues and harm our business and financial results.           Most of our merchandise is shipped by our vendors to a limited number of distribution centers. Our distribution centers receive and allocate merchandise to our stores. Events such as fire or other catastrophic events, any malfunction or disruption of our centralized information systems or shipping problems may result in delays or disruptions in the timely distribution of merchandise to our stores, which could adversely impact our revenues and our business and financial results.             SIZE=2> Lack of available retail store sites on terms acceptable to us, rising real estate prices and other costs and risks relating to new store openings could severely limit our growth opportunities.           Our strategy includes opening stores in new and existing markets. We must successfully choose store sites, execute favorable real estate transactions on terms that are acceptable to us, hire competent personnel and effectively open and operate these new stores. Our plans to increase the number of our retail stores will depend in part on the availability of existing retail stores or store sites. We may not have stores or sites available to us for purchase or lease, or available on terms acceptable to us. If additional retail store sites are unavailable on acceptable terms, we may not be able to carry out a    34           significant part of our growth strategy. Rising real estate costs and acquisition, construction and development costs could also inhibit our ability to grow. If we fail to locate desirable sites, obtain lease rights to these sites on terms acceptable to us, hire adequate personnel and open and effectively operate these new stores, our financial performance could be adversely affected.             SIZE=2> We may pursue strategic acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business.           We may from time to time acquire complementary companies or businesses. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities. We may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general store operating procedures. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions, our business could suffer. In addition, the integration of any acquired business, and their financial results, into ours may adversely affect our operating results. We currently do not have any agreements with respect to any such acquisitions.    NAME="de1679_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02669">      ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk                 Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from our long-term debt agreement. Our long-term debt bears interest at variable rates that are tied to either the U.S. prime rate or LIBOR at the time of the borrowing. We maintain portions of our debt in LIBOR traunches that mature in one to nine months. As those traunches mature, the interest rates on our outstanding borrowings are changed to reflect current prime or LIBOR rates. Therefore, our interest expense changes as the prime or LIBOR market rates change. We have entered into two interest rate swap instruments, designated as cash flow hedges, as shown in the following table:       Date  Entered Into       Rate paid     Rate received     Notional amount     Fair value  at 01/29/05       December 11, 2002     2.95%     3-mo. US Libor     $  40,000,000     $  (60,636  )    June 23, 2004     3.76%     3-mo. US Libor     $  75,000,000     $  (356,725  )               Based on our overall interest rate exposure at January 29, 2005, a hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in interest rates applied to borrowings under our revolving credit facility would change our after-tax earnings by approximately $1.9 million over a 12-month period prior to considering the effects of our interest rate swaps.            Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates is limited because we do not operate any stores outside of the United States. We do not consider the market risk exposure relating to foreign currency exchange to be material. Foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on us during the quarter or year to date periods in fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002.
