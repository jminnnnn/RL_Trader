ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe that our estimates and assumptionsare reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.   We believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical. These critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets, impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, and fair value of derivative financial instruments.   Revenue recognition   We lease multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less. Rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned.   We record all gains and losses on real estate in accordance with accounting standards governing the sale of real estate.   Capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets   We carry real estate assets at depreciated cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, 5 years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment, 3 to 5 years for computers and software, and 6 months for acquired leases, all of which are subjective determinations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized. The cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of theproperty to our standards are capitalized as incurred.   Development costs are capitalized in accordance with accounting standards for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects and standards for the capitalization of interest cost.   Impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill   We account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal on long-lived assets and evaluate goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. We periodically evaluate long-lived assets, including investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors suchas operating performance, market conditions, and legal factors.    28          Long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to bedisposed of are separately presented on the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.   Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss for goodwill is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value. This determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. First, we determine the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount. In the apartment industry, the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate. We determine the appropriatecapitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a propertys market or submarket. Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with accounting standards for business combinations. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill.   Fair value of derivative financial instruments   We utilize certain derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and caps, during the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction.   In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective. While our calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations, the historical correlation of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedge are measured by us before entering into the hedging relationship and have been found to be highly correlated.   We measure ineffectiveness using the change in the variable cash flows method for interest rate swaps and the hypothetical derivative method for interest rate caps for each reporting period through the term of the hedging instruments. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and the intrinsic value or fair value of caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders equity.   The valuation of our derivative financial instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate caps are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting thefuture expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. Additionally, we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. Changes in the fair values of our derivatives are primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates. See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.    29          OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009   We experienced a decrease in income from continuing operations before non-operating items in 2009 as the increases in revenues from new acquisitions and renovation projects were more than offset by the decrease in revenues from our same store portfolio of 1.2% over 2008. Our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least 12 months. Communities excluded from the same store portfolio would include recent acquisitions, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities undergoing extensive renovations, and communities identified as discontinued operations.   We have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the Sunbelt region of the United States. We acquired four properties in 2007, five properties in 2008 and four properties in 2009. We also purchased one property through a joint venture in 2009 and two properties in 2008. Offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were five property dispositions in 2007, one of which was through a joint venture, and three property dispositions in 2009.   We benefited from reduced interest expense in 2009 as our twelve month average interest rate dropped from 4.9% in 2008 to 4.3% in 2009.   As of December 31, 2009, the total number of apartment units Mid-America owned or had an ownership interest in was 43,604 in 147 communities, compared to 42,554 apartment units in 145 communities at December 31, 2008, and 40,248 apartment units in 137 communities at December 31, 2007. For communities owned 100% by Mid-America, the average effective rent per apartment unit, excluding units in lease-up, decreased to $715 at December 31, 2009 from $750 at December 31, 2008, and $737 at December 31, 2007. For these same units, overall occupancy at December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 was 95.2%, 93.4%, and 94.7%, respectively.   The following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007. This discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.    30          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2009, to the Year Ended December 31, 2008   Property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased by approximately $8.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2008, due to (i) a $2.6 million increase in property revenues from the four properties acquired in 2009, or the 2009 acquisitions, (ii) a $7.1 million increase in property revenues from the five properties acquired in 2008, or the 2008 acquisitions, and (iii) a $2.5 million increase in property revenues from our development communities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in property revenues of $3.8 million from the properties held throughout both periods. The decrease in property revenues from propertiesheld throughout both periods was due primarily to Mid-Americas same store portfolio and was driven by a 2.2% decrease in average effective rent per unit in 2009 over 2008.   Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased by approximately $4.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2008, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $1.2 million from the 2009 acquisitions, (ii) $2.8 million from the 2008 acquisitions, and (iii) $0.9 million from our development communities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in property operating expenses of $0.5 million from theproperties held throughout both periods. The decrease in property operating expenses from the properties held throughout both periods was due primarily to Mid-Americas same store portfolio and represented real estate tax expense which reflected the favorable impact of successful prior year appeals and assessment challenges.   Depreciation expense increased by approximately $5.9 million primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of (i) $0.6 million from the 2009 acquisitions, (ii) $2.1 million from the 2008 acquisitions, (iii) $0.7 million from our development communities, and (iv) $3.5 million from fixed asset additions at communities held throughout both periods. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $1.0 million from the expiration of the amortization of fair value of in place leases of communities which we previously acquired.   Interest expense decreased approximately $4.9 million in 2009 from 2008 due primarily to the decrease in our average annual borrowing cost from 4.9% in 2008 to 4.3% in 2009. This decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in our average debt outstanding by approximately $34.9 million from 2008 to 2009 to fund acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs.   For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded total gains of approximately $4.6 million from the sale of three communities. We had no property dispositions in 2008.    Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. increased by approximately $7.0 million in 2009 from 2008.   Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2008, to the Year Ended December 31, 2007   Property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, increased by approximately $22.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2008, due to (i) a $7.2 million increase in property revenues from the 2008 acquisitions, (ii) a $5.8 million increase in property revenues from the four properties acquired in 2007, or the 2007 acquisitions, (iii) a $1.7 million increase in property revenues from our development communities, and (iv) a $7.7 million increase in property revenues from the properties held throughout both periods. The increase in property revenues from properties held throughout both periods was generated primarily by our same store portfolioand was driven by a 1.8% increase in average effective rent per unit in 2008 over 2007.   Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008, increased by approximately $12.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2007, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $3.5 million from the 2008 acquisitions, (ii) $2.9 million from the 2007 acquisitions, (iii) $0.8 million from our development communities, and (iv) $5.7 million from the properties held throughout both periods. The increase in property    31          operating expenses from the properties held throughout both periods consisted primarily of our same store portfolio and represented an average 3.5% increase over prior year expenses and included $591,000 of expense related to Hurricane Ike.   Depreciation expense increased by approximately $5.4 million primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of (i) $2.3 million from the 2008 acquisitions, (ii) $1.6 million from the 2007 acquisitions, (iii) $0.3 million from our development communities, and (iv) $3.0 million from fixed asset additions at communities held throughout both periods. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $1.8 million from the expiration of the amortization of fair value of in place leases of communities which we previously acquired.   Property management expenses decreased by approximately $1.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2007, to the year ended December 31, 2008, due to decreased incentive compensation. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.0 million over this same period mainly as a result of increased personnel costs.   Interest expense decreased approximately $1.6 million in 2008 from 2007 due primarily to the decrease in our average annual borrowing cost from 5.4% in 2007 to 4.9% in 2008. This decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in our average debt outstanding by approximately $83.8 million from 2007 to 2008 to fund acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs.   For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded total gains of approximately $5.4 million from the sale of a community owned through a joint venture. The sale of this community resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to us of approximately $1.0 million in 2007. In 2007, we also benefited from a $9.2 million gain resulting from the sale of four communities owned directly by us. We had no property dispositions in 2008.    For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded net casualty gains and other settlement proceeds and gains on sale of land totaling $1.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a loss of $0.3 million for these same items.   Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. decreased by approximately $9.7 million in 2008 from 2007.   Funds from Operations   Funds from operations, or FFO, represents net income (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) excluding extraordinary items, minority interest in operating partnership income, gains on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. This definition of FFO is in accordance with the NAREIT definition. Disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage.   In response to the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Policy Statement relating to EITF Topic D-42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock, we have included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in our FFO calculation.   Our policy is to expense the cost of interior painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties. During the stabilization period for acquisition properties, these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties, and, thus are not deducted in calculating FFO.   FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets. We believe that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciationimplies. Our calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.    32          The following table is a reconciliation of FFO to consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 (dollars and shares in thousands):                         Years Ended December 31,           2009     2008     2007    Consolidated net income     $   39,221        $   32,071        $   43,456       Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests        (2,010  )          (1,822  )          (3,510  )      Net income attributable to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.        37,211           30,249           39,946       Depreciation of real estate assets        94,020           88,555           83,532       Net casualty (gains) loss and other settlement proceeds        (32  )          247           (589  )      Gains on dispositions within real estate joint ventures                   (38  )          (5,388  )      Depreciation of real estate assets of discontinued operations                   706           1,517       (Gains) loss on sales of discontinued operations        (4,649  )          120           (9,164  )      Depreciation of real estate assets of real estate joint ventures        970           953           15       Preferred dividend distribution        (12,865  )          (12,865  )          (13,688  )      Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests        2,010           1,822           3,510       Premiums and original issuance costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock                              (589  )      Funds from operations     $   116,665        $   109,749        $   99,102       FFO increases for both 2009 over 2008, and 2008 over 2007 benefited from the addition of communities from the 2007 acquisitions, 2008 acquisitions and 2009 acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net income discussion above. The FFO increase for 2008 over 2007 also benefited from improved community operations from our same store portfolio.   Trends   During 2009, rental demand for apartments was weaker in most of our markets when compared to 2008. One of the primary drivers of apartment demand is job formation, and the job losses across our markets impacted apartment demand and pricing. However, relative job losses in 2009 for our markets combined were less than the national average.   An important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets across the Sunbelt region of the United States. The diversity of markets tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. We have found that a well diversified portfolio, including both large and select secondary markets, has tended to perform well in up cycles as well as weather down cycles better. At the end of 2009, we were invested in over 48 separate markets, with 59% of our gross assets in large markets and 41% of our gross assets in select secondary markets.   Partially mitigating the severe job losses in 2009 was lower resident turnover, primarily due to fewer move-outs from buying homes. The primary reason that our residents leave us is to buy a house. In 2009, we saw both the number and the percent of total move-outs due to home buying drop as compared to 2008. According to the Census Bureau, homeownership increased from 65% to 69% of households over the ten years ending 2005. Despite the tightened credit market, in 2009 the home ownership rate was still in the 67% to 68% range. The increase from historical levels was driven primarily by the availability of new mortgage products, many requiring nodown-payment and minimal credit ratings. With a reversion of mortgage underwriting back to more traditional standards, it is possible that a long-term correction will occur, and that home ownership may return to more sustainable levels. This could be quite significant for the apartment business, and we believe, if this occurs, it could benefit us for several years.   We also benefited on the supply side, as supply declined from 2008 and ran below historical new supply delivery averages. Competition from condominiums reverting back to rental units, or new condominiums being converted to rental, was not a major factor in our markets because most of our markets and submarkets    33          have not been primary areas for condominium development. We have found the same to be true for rental competition from single family homes. We have avoided committing a significant amount of capital to markets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices has occurred. We saw significant rental competition from condominiums and/or single family houses in only a few submarkets. We expect this relative new supply compression to be an even larger factor over the next several quarters as supply is expected to contract even further.   Our focus during 2009 was on sustaining occupancy as we operated in a weaker leasing market. By focusing on aggressive efforts to build and sustain traffic, and pricing aggressively, we were largely successful at this, as our same store occupancy ended the year 170 basis points over year-end 2008 and dropped only 90 basis points from the record levels of the quarter ended September 30, 2009, despite the normal seasonal decline in traffic.   Overall same store revenues decreased 1.2% compared to 2008. We believe that the decline in same store revenue will continue into 2010, primarily due to the impact of lower rents on leases signed in the latter half of 2009. However, revenue growth should resume after the economic growth returns and, most importantly, when job growth resumes which some economists project could be as soon as the middle to latter part of 2010. We also believe reduced availability of financing for new apartment construction will likely limit new apartment supply, and more sustainable credit terms for residential mortgages should work to favor rental demand at existingmulti-family properties. At the same time, we expect long-term demographic trends, including the growth of prime age groups for rentals, immigration, and population movement to the southeast and southwest will continue to build apartment rental demand for our markets.   While expected continued weak employment growth is expected to keep new demand subdued, we think that the supply of new apartments is not excessive, and that positive absorption of apartments will return for most of our markets later in 2010. Should the economy fall into a deeper recession, the limited new supply of apartments and the more disciplined mortgage financing for single family home buying should lessen the impact.   We continue to develop improved products, operating systems and procedures that enable us to capture more revenues. The continued roll-out of ancillary services (such as re-selling cable television), improved collections, and utility reimbursements enable us to capture increased revenue dollars. We also actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses, such as new web-sites and internet access for our residents that enable them to transact their business with us more simply and effectively.   During 2009, we continued to have the benefit of lower interest rates resulting from an improved market for Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation debt securities. Much of this was due to government action to improve liquidity in the credit markets, and resulted in a lower cost of debt for us. Short term interest rates continue to be at historically low levels, and as a result, we are forecasting a continuation of favorable interest rates in the near term with the expectation of rising rates as the economy improves.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $1.0 million to $136.9 million for 2009, compared to $137.9 million for 2008, mainly related to the decrease in rental rates from 2008 to 2009. Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately $19.3 million to $137.9 million for 2008 compared to $118.6 million for 2007 mainly related to our growth through acquisitions and improved operating results in 2008.   Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $150.5 million, $243.0 million and $108.8 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The change in net cash used in investing activities resulted mainly from the varying levels of acquisition activity. A total of approximately $125.3 million was invested in 2009 to acquire properties, this compares to approximately $156.3 million in 2008 and $88.6 million in 2007. We began limited development activities in 2006, which used net cash of approximately $14.6 million in 2007, $22.7 million in 2008 and $6.8 million in 2009. We have also been renovating select properties using net cash ofapproximately $7.6 million in 2009, $18.2 million in 2008 and $11.3 million in 2007. In 2007 and    34          2009, we received a total of $39.2 million and $29.9 million, respectively, from the disposition of real estate assets, mainly related to property sales. No communities were sold in 2008.   Net cash provided by financing activities was $18.1 million, $97.3 million and $1.9 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The fluctuation in net cash provided by financing activities was mainly impacted by proceeds from issuances of common shares and units. Proceeds from issuances of common shares and units was primarily impacted by sales of common stock through our controlled equity offering program. Mid-America received a total of $32.8 million, $103.6 million and $18.8 million in net proceeds during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, in relation to sales through this program. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 was alsoimpacted by the redemption of our 9¼% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or Series F, for $11.9 million.   During 2009, Mid-America sold 763,000 shares of common stock through our continuous equity offering program generating net proceeds of approximately $32.8 million. In 2008 and 2007, Mid-America sold 1,955,300 shares and 323,700 shares generating net proceeds of approximately $103.6 million and $18.8 million, respectively.   During 2009, Mid-America did not offer a discount through our DRSPP and issued approximately 1,100 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan, generating approximately $39,000 in proceeds. However, during 2008 and 2007, Mid-America offered an average 1.5% discount through our DRSPP and issued approximately 403,000 shares and 120,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan, generating approximately $20 million and $6 million in proceeds, respectively.   On October 16, 2007, Mid-America redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of Series F for the total redemption price of $11.9 million.   The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2009 for the $1.4 billion of debt outstanding was 4.0%, compared to the weighted average interest rate of 4.8% on $1.3 billion of debt outstanding at December 31, 2008. We utilize both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance our activities. Borrowings are made through individual property mortgages as well as company-wide secured credit facilities. We utilize fixed rate borrowings, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage our current and future interest rate risk. More details on our borrowings can be found in the schedules presented later in this section.   At December 31, 2009, we had secured credit facility relationships with Prudential Mortgage Capital which are credit enhanced by the Federal National Mortgage Association, or FNMA, Financial Federal which are credit enhanced by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, and a $50 million bank facility with a syndicate of banks. Together, these credit facilities provided a total line capacity of $1.4 billion with all but $6.0 million collateralized and available to borrow at December 31, 2009. We had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2009.   Approximately 72% of our outstanding obligations at December 31, 2009 were borrowed through facilities with/or credit enhanced by FNMA, also referred to as the FNMA Facilities. The FNMA Facilities have a combined line limit of $1.04 billion, all of which was collateralized and available to borrow at December 31, 2009. We had total borrowings outstanding under the FNMA Facilities of approximately $1.00 billion at December 31, 2009. Various traunches of the FNMA Facilities mature from 2011 through 2018. The FNMA Facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings. The interest rate on the majority of the variable portion is based on the FNMADiscount Mortgage Backed Security, or DMBS, rate which are credit-enhanced by FNMA and are typically sold every 90 days by Prudential Mortgage Capital at interest rates approximating three-month LIBOR less a spread that has averaged 0.16% over the life of the FNMA Facilities, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.49% to 0.67%. We have seen more volatility in the spread between the DMBS and three-month LIBOR since late 2007 than was historically prevalent. While we feel this recent volatility is an anomaly and believe that this spread will return to more historic levels, we cannot forecast when or if the uncertainty and volatility in the market may change.   Approximately 21% of our outstanding obligations at December 31, 2009 were borrowed through facilities with/or credit enhanced by Freddie Mac, also referred to as the Freddie Mac Facilities. The Freddie Mac Facilities have a combined line limit of $300 million, of which $298 million was collateralized and    35          available to borrow at December 31, 2009. We had total borrowings outstanding under the Freddie Mac Facilities of approximately $298 million at December 31, 2009. The Freddie Mac facilities mature in 2011 and 2014. The interest rate on the Freddie Mac Facilities renews every 30 or 90 days and is based on the Freddie Mac Reference Bill Rate on the date of renewal, which has historically approximated the equivalent 30 or 90-day LIBOR, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.65% to 0.69%. The Freddie Mac Reference Bill rate has traded consistently below LIBOR, and the historical average spread has risen to 0.40% below LIBOR.   Each of our secured credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage, and is subject to periodic re-evaluation of collateral. If we were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced. Moreover, if we were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure periods, one or more of our lenders could declare a default, accelerate the due date for repayment of all amountsoutstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing such facilities. Any such event could have a material adverse effect.

To date, these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges. We had also entered into interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately $172 million as of December 31, 2009.

We rely on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities, and on FNMA and Freddie Mac, or the Agencies, who have now been placed into conservatorship by the U.S. Government, and whose securities are now implicitly Government-guaranteed. The Agencies provide credit enhancement for approximately $1.3 billion of our debt as of December 31, 2009. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA, which was appointed conservator of the Agencies, recognizes theimportance of multifamily housing finance for healthy secondary market and housing affordability, and expects FNMA and Freddie MAC to continue underwriting and financing sound multifamily business.   The interest rate markets for FNMA DMBS and Freddie Mac Reference Bills, which in our experience are highly liquid and highly correlated with three-month LIBOR interest rates, are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness. Prudential Mortgage Capital, a DUS lender for Fannie Mae, markets 90-day Fannie Mae Discount Mortgage Backed Securities monthly, and is obligated to advance funds to us at DMBS rates plus a credit spread under the terms of the credit agreements between Prudential and us. Financial Federal, a Freddie Mac Program Plus Lender and Servicer, is obligated to advance funds under the terms of creditagreements between Financial Federal and us.   For the year ended December 31, 2009, our net cash provided by operating activities was in excess of covering funding improvements to existing real estate assets, distributions to unitholders, and dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately $10.2 million, as compared to $12.7 million and $4.1 million for the same periods in 2008 and 2007, respectively. While we had sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings, if necessary, any significant deterioration in    37          operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate.   The following table reflects our total contractual cash obligations which consist of our long-term debt and operating leases as of December 31, 2009, (dollars in thousands):                                     Contractual Obligations (1)     2010     2011     2012     2013     2014     Thereafter     Total    Long-Term Debt (2)     $   1,827        $  181,929        $  82,036        $  170,778        $  536,518        $  426,508        $  1,399,596       Fixed Rate or Swapped Interest (3)        43,120           35,404           26,395           18,911           9,742           19,234           152,806       Operating Lease        18           18           10                                            46       Total     $  44,965        $  217,351        $  108,441        $  189,689        $  546,260        $  445,742        $  1,552,448           (1)  Fixed rate and swapped interest are shown in this table.

(3)  Swapped interest is subject to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges as described in Note 7 to the financial statements.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   At December 31, 2009, and 2008, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Our two joint ventures with Crow Holdings (one terminated in 2005 and one terminated in 2007) were established to acquire approximately $200 million of multifamily properties and to enhance our return on investment through the generation of fee income. Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC, was established to acquire $500 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creationopportunity through capital improvements, operating enhancements and restructuring in-place financing. As of December 31, 2009, Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC owned two properties but does not expect to acquire any additional communities. Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, LLC, was established to acquire $250 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements, operating enhancements and restructuring in-place financing. As of December 31, 2009, Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, LLC, or Fund II, owned one property. In January 2010, Mid-America contributed a property we had acquired in December 2009 to Fund II. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We do not have any relationships or transactions with persons orentities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 13.   Our investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method as we do not have a controlling interest.   Insurance   We renegotiated our insurance programs effective July 1, 2009. We believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operation.   Inflation   Substantially all of the resident leases at the apartment communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable there under, and thus may enable Mid-America to seek rent increases. Almost all leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to Mid-America of the adverse effects of inflation.    38          Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards   In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 105-10,  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  Overall  which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or the Codification, as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants. All guidance contained in theCodification carries an equal level of authority. The Codification superseded all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification is non-authoritative. The FASB will not issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts. Instead, it will issue Accounting Standards Updates, or ASUs. The FASB will not consider ASUs as authoritative in their own right. ASUs will serve only to update the Codification, provide background information about the guidance and provide the bases for conclusions on the change(s) in the Codification. We adopted ASC 105-10 effective July 1, 2009 and all references made to FASB guidance throughout this document have been updated for the Codification.   In September 2006, the FASB issued ASC 820, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. ASC 820-10-65-1 delayed the effective date of ASC 820 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. For these items, the effective date was for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. We adopted ASC 820 effective January 1, 2008 andASC 820-10-65-1 effective January 1, 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.   On December 4, 2007, the FASB revised ASC 805,  Business Combinations . The ASC 805 revision significantly changes the accounting for business combinations. The ASC 805 revision requires an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. The ASC 805 revision changes the accounting treatment for certain specific items, including acquisition costs, which will generally be expensed as incurred. This could have a material impact on the way we account for property acquisitions and therefore will have a material impact on our financialstatements. The ASC 805 revision applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We adopted the ASC 805 revision effective January 1, 2009, and the expensed acquisition costs increased general and administrative expenses by $950,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, respectively. The increased expenses decreased both basic and diluted net income available for common shareholders by $0.04 per share for the year ended December 31, 2009.   On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued ASC 810-10-65,  Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  An Amendment of ARB No. 51 . ASC 810-10-65 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this standard requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent's equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest is included in consolidated net income on the face of the incomestatement. The standard clarifies that changes in a parent's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. This has impacted our financial statement presentation by requiring the interests in the operating partnership not owned by the company (noncontrolling interests) be presented as a component of equity in the companys consolidated financial statements and income contributable to the noncontrolling interests be a component of net income. ASC 810-10-65 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We adopted ASC 810-10-65 effective January 1, 2009 and the retrospective presentation increased total equity by $30,471,000 at December 31, 2008. The adoption did not change basic or diluted earnings per share for common shareholders and its effect on net income and income from continuing operations is asfollows (dollars in thousands):    39                                Year Ended December 31,           2009     2008     2007    Increase in:                                           Income from continuing operations     $  1,907        $  1,718        $  3,226       Net income     $  2,010        $  1,822        $  3,510       On March 19, 2008, the FASB issued ASC 815-10-65,  Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an Amendment of FASB Statement 133.  ASC 815-10-65 enhances required disclosures regarding derivatives and hedging activities, including enhanced disclosures regarding how an entity uses derivative instruments and how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. ASC 815-10-65 iseffective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We adopted ASC 815-10-65 effective January 1, 2009, and the required disclosures are included in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.   In June 2008, the FASB issued ASC 260-10-65,  Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities  to clarify that unvested share-based awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share, or EPS, under the two-class method of computing earnings per share. ASC 260-10-65 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. All prior period EPS data presented are to be adjustedretrospectively (including interim financial statements, summaries of earnings, and selected financial data) to conform with the provisions of this standard. We adopted ASC 260-10-65 effective January 1, 2009 and it had a minor impact on our number of shares. The change in our number of shares decreased net income available for common shareholders by $0.01 per share for the year ended December 31, 2008 and by $0.01 per share for the year ended December 31, 2009.   In September 2008, the FASB ratified ASC 820-10-65-3,  Issuers Accounting for Liabilities Measured at Fair Value with a Third-Party Credit Enhancement . This accounting standard requires that the measurement of liabilities with inseparable, third-party credit enhancements carried at or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis exclude the effect of the credit enhancement. ASC 820-10-65-3 was effective on a prospective basis in the first reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We adopted this accounting standard effective January 1, 2009. This accounting standard removed the effect of the agency credit enhancements fromour calculation of the fair value of our derivative instruments and materially increased the value represented on the balance sheet. The impact of ASC 820-10-65-3 on our financial position upon adoption was approximately a $2.0 million increase to the fair value of our derivative instruments.   In April 2008, the FASB issued ASC 825-10-65-1,  Interim Disclosures About Fair Market Value of Financial Instruments . ASC 825-10-65-1 extends the disclosure requirements concerning the fair value of financial instruments to interim financial statements of publicly traded companies. ASC 825-10-65-1 is effective for interim financial periods ending after June 15, 2009, and the required disclosures are included in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.   In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC 855-10,  Subsequent Events,  which establishes the general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. ASC 855-10 is effective for interim and financial periods ending after June 15, 2009. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we have considered subsequent events through February 25, 2010, which is the date our consolidated financial statements were filed with the Securities andExchange Commission on Form 10-K.   In June 2008, the FASB issued ASC 810-10-05,  Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) . ASC 810-10-05 amends events which would require reconsidering whether an entity is a variable interest entity; it amends the criteria used to determine the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity; and it expands disclosures about an enterprises involvement in variable interest entities. ASC 810-10-05 is effective for    40          annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009 and earlier application is prohibited. Management does not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   Our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates obtainable on our secured borrowings. At December 31, 2009, 46% of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings. Our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve this objective, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and interest rate swaps and caps which mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument and effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of ourvariable debt or on future refinancings. We use our best efforts to ladder fixed rate maturities thereby limiting our exposure to interest rate changes in any one year. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Approximately 81% of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed or capped rates after considering related derivative instruments at December 31, 2009. We regularly review interest rate exposure on outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations.   The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Mid-Americas consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.   Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Mid-America; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of Mid-America are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and directors of Mid-America; and (iii) provide reasonable assuranceregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Mid-Americas assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.   Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   Management conducted an assessment of Mid-Americas internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 using the framework specified in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework , published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such assessment, management has concluded that Mid-Americas internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009.   The effectiveness of Mid-Americas internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is presented herein.    F-1          Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   The Board of Directors and Shareholders of  Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These consolidated financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and schedule based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  /s/ Ernst & Young LLP   Memphis, Tennessee  February 25, 2010    F-2          Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   The Board of Directors and Shareholders of  Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.   We have audited Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Ourresponsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Organization and Formation of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.   Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (Mid-America) is a self-administrated and self-managed real estate investment trust which owns, acquires and operates multifamily apartment communities mainly in the Sunbelt region of the United States. Mid-America owned and operated 144 apartment communities principally through its majority owned subsidiary, Mid-America Apartments, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, as of December 31, 2009. Mid-America also owned a 33.33% interest in two real estate joint ventures, Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC, or Fund I, and Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, LLC, or Fund II, at December31, 2009. Through these joint ventures Mid-America owned interest in an additional 3 communities as of December 31, 2009.   Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation   The consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of Mid-America, the Operating Partnership, and all other subsidiaries. Mid-America owns 51% to 100% of all consolidated subsidiaries.   Mid-America uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in entities for which we exercise significant influence, but do not have the ability to exercise control. Entities not consolidated are not variable interest entities. The factors considered in determining that Mid-America does not have the ability to exercise control included ownership of voting interests, protective rights of investors and participatory rights of investors.   All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   Use of Estimates   Management of Mid-America has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses to prepare these financial statements and notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Revenue Recognition   Mid-America leases multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less. Rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned.   Mid-America records all gains and losses on real estate in accordance with accounting standards governing the sale of real estate.   Rental Costs   Costs associated with rental activities are expensed as incurred. Certain costs associated with the lease-up of development projects, including cost of model units, their furnishings, signs, and grand openings are capitalized and amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. All other costs relating to renting development projects are expensed as incurred.   Earnings Per Share   In accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for earnings per share, basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. All outstanding unvested restricted share awards, which contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends, participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders and, accordingly, are considered participating securities that are included in the two-class method of computing basic earnings    F-9          MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC.     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007   1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (continued)  per share. Both the unvested restricted shares and other potentially dilutive common shares, and the related impact to earnings, are considered when calculating earnings per share on a diluted basis. For periods where Mid-America reports a net loss available for common shareholders, the effect of dilutive shares is excluded from earnings per share calculations because including such shares would be anti-dilutive.   A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 is presented on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.   Cash and Cash Equivalents   Mid-America considers cash, investments in money market accounts and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.   Restricted Cash   Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for property taxes, insurance, debt service and replacement reserves.   Real Estate Assets and Depreciation   Real estate assets are carried at depreciated cost. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and recurring capital replacements are capitalized. Recurring capital replacements typically include scheduled carpet replacement, new roofs, HVAC units, plumbing, concrete, masonry and other paving, pools and various exterior building improvements. These expenditures extend the useful life of the property and increase the propertys fair market value. The cost of interior painting, vinyl flooring and blinds are expensed as incurred.   In conjunction with acquisitions of properties, Mid-Americas policy is to provide in its acquisition budgets adequate funds to complete any deferred capital improvement items to bring the properties to the required standard, including the cost of replacement appliances, carpet, interior painting, vinyl flooring and blinds. These costs are capitalized.   Development projects and the related carrying costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance and allocated development overhead during the construction period, are capitalized and reported in the accompanying balance sheets as construction in progress during the construction period. Upon completion and certification for occupancy of individual units within a development, amounts representing the completed unit's portion of total estimated development costs for the project are transferred to land, buildings, and furniture, fixtures and equipment as real estate held for investment. Capitalization of interest, property taxes, insuranceand allocated development overhead costs cease upon the transfer, and the assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives in accordance with accounting standards governing the capitalization of interest. Total interest capitalized during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $252,000, $826,000 and $795,000, respectively.   Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings and 5 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment and 3 to 5 years for computers and software.   In accordance with accounting standards for business combinations, the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of above and below market leases, resident relationship values and the value of in-place leases.    F-10          MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC.     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007   1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (continued)  The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property (land, building, furniture, fixtures and equipment) is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant. The as-if-vacant value is then allocated to land, building, furniture, fixtures and equipment based on managements determination of the relative fair values of these assets. Management determines the as-if-vacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the period of time that would be required in the currentmarket conditions to lease-up the property to determine the fair value of the in-place leases and resident relationships. Management includes real estate taxes, insurance, operating expenses and lost rentals as well as the costs required to execute similar leases in the estimated carrying costs.   In allocating the fair value of identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, the in-place leases are compared to current market conditions. Based on these evaluations, management believes that the leases acquired on each of its property acquisitions were at market rates since the lease terms generally do not extend beyond one year.   The fair value of the in-place leases and resident relationships is then amortized over the remaining term of the resident leases. The amount of these resident lease intangibles included in gross real estate assets totaled $24.9 million, $23.3 million and $20.7 million as of December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The amortization recorded as depreciation expense was $1.7 million, $2.8 million and $4.6 million for the years ending December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, with accumulated amortization totaling $23.6 million, $20.2 million and $14.8 million as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.   Goodwill and Intangible Assets   Mid-America accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and evaluates goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. Mid-America evaluates its goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. Mid-America periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence ofsuch indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions, and legal factors.   Long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assetsto be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.   Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value. This determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. First, Mid-America determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount. In the apartment industry, the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate. Mid-America determines the appropriatecapitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a propertys market or submarket. Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of    F-11          MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC.     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007   1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (continued)  the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with accounting standards for business combinations. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill.   Land Held for Future Development   Real estate held for future development are sites intended for future multifamily developments and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value in accordance.   Investment In and Advances to Real Estate Joint Ventures   Mid-Americas investments in our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures are recorded on the equity method as we are able to exert significant influence, but do not have a controlling interest in the joint venture.   Deferred Financing Costs   Deferred financing costs are amortized over the terms of the related debt using a method which approximates the interest method.   Other Assets   Other assets consist of deferred rental concessions which are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the leases, receivables and deposits from residents, and other prepaid expenses including prepaid insurance and prepaid interest.   Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities   Accrued expenses consist of accrued real estate taxes, accrued interest payable, other accrued expenses payable, unearned income and the adjustment for the fair market value of Mid-Americas derivative financial instruments.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 105-10,  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  Overall  which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or the Codification, as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants. All guidance contained in theCodification carries an equal level of authority. The Codification superseded all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification is non-authoritative. The FASB will not issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts. Instead, it will issue Accounting Standards Updates, or ASUs. The FASB will not consider ASUs as authoritative in their own right. ASUs will serve only to update the Codification, provide background information about the guidance and provide the bases for conclusions on the change(s) in the Codification. We adopted ASC 105-10 effective July 1, 2009 and all references made to FASB guidance throughout this document have been updated for the Codification.   In September 2006, the FASB issued ASC 820, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. ASC 820-10-65-1 delayed the effective date of ASC 820 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. For these items, the    F-12          MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC.     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007   1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (continued)  effective date was for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. We adopted ASC 820 effective January 1, 2008 and ASC 820-10-65-1 effective January 1, 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.   On December 4, 2007, the FASB revised ASC 805,  Business Combinations . The ASC 805 revision significantly changes the accounting for business combinations. The ASC 805 revision requires an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. The ASC 805 revision changes the accounting treatment for certain specific items, including acquisition costs, which will generally be expensed as incurred. This could have a material impact on the way we account for property acquisitions and therefore will have a material impact on our financialstatements. The ASC 805 revision applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We adopted the ASC 805 revision effective January 1, 2009, and the expensed acquisition costs increased general and administrative expenses by $950,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, respectively. The increased expenses decreased both basic and diluted net income available for common shareholders by $0.04 per share for the year ended December 31, 2009.   On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued ASC 810-10-65,  Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  An Amendment of ARB No. 51 . ASC 810-10-65 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this standard requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent's equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest is included in consolidated net income on the face of the incomestatement. The standard clarifies that changes in a parent's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. This has impacted our financial statement presentation by requiring the interests in the operating partnership not owned by the company (noncontrolling interests) be presented as a component of equity in the companys consolidated financial statements and income contributable to the noncontrolling interests be a component of net income. ASC 810-10-65 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We adopted ASC 810-10-65 effective January 1, 2009 and the retrospective presentation increased total equity by $30,471,000 at December 31, 2008. The adoption did not change basic or diluted earnings per share for common shareholders and its effect on net income and income from continuing operations is asfollows (dollars in thousands):                         Year ended December 31,           2009     2008     2007    Increase in:                                           Income from continuing operations     $  1,907        $  1,718        $  3,226       Net income     $  2,010        $  1,822        $  3,510       On March 19, 2008, the FASB issued ASC 815-10-65,  Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an Amendment of FASB Statement 133.  ASC 815-10-65 enhances required disclosures regarding derivatives and hedging activities, including enhanced disclosures regarding how an entity uses derivative instruments and how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. ASC 815-10-65 iseffective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We adopted ASC 815-10-65 effective January 1, 2009, and the required disclosures are included in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.    F-13          MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC.     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007   1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (continued)  In June 2008, the FASB issued ASC 260-10-65,  Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities  to clarify that unvested share-based awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share, or EPS, under the two-class method of computing earnings per share. ASC 260-10-65 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. All prior period EPS data presented are to be adjustedretrospectively (including interim financial statements, summaries of earnings, and selected financial data) to conform with the provisions of this standard. We adopted ASC 260-10-65 effective January 1, 2009 and it had a minor impact on our number of shares. The change in our number of shares decreased net income available for common shareholders by $0.01 per share for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $0.01 per share for the year ended December 31, 2009.   In September 2008, the FASB ratified ASC 820-10-65-3,  Issuers Accounting for Liabilities Measured at Fair Value with a Third-Party Credit Enhancement . This accounting standard requires that the measurement of liabilities with inseparable, third-party credit enhancements carried at or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis exclude the effect of the credit enhancement. ASC 820-10-65-3 was effective on a prospective basis in the first reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We adopted this accounting standard effective January 1, 2009. This accounting standard removed the effect of the agency credit enhancements fromour calculation of the fair value of our derivative instruments and materially increased the value represented on the balance sheet. The impact of ASC 820-10-65-3 on our financial position upon adoption was approximately a $2.0 million increase to the fair value of our derivative instruments.   In April 2008, the FASB issued ASC 825-10-65-1,  Interim Disclosures About Fair Market Value of Financial Instruments . ASC 825-10-65-1 extends the disclosure requirements concerning the fair value of financial instruments to interim financial statements of publicly traded companies. ASC 825-10-65-1 is effective for interim financial periods ending after June 15, 2009, and the required disclosures are included in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. See also discussions in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6.   In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC 855-10,  Subsequent Events,  which establishes the general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. ASC 855-10 is effective for interim and financial periods ending after June 15, 2009. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we have considered subsequent events through February 25, 2010, which is the date our consolidated financial statements were filed with the Securities andExchange Commission on Form 10-K.   In June 2008, the FASB issued ASC 810-10-05, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). ASC 810-10-05 amends events which would require reconsidering whether an entity is a variable interest entity; it amends the criteria used to determine the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity; and it expands disclosures about an enterprises involvement in variable interest entities. ASC 810-10-05 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009 and earlier application is prohibited. Management does not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition orresults of operations taken as a whole.   Reclassifications   Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2009 presentation. Approximately $193,000, $148,000, $128,000 and $138,000 of certain bulk cable related revenues have been reclassed from Rental Revenues to Other Property Revenues for 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, certain expenses related to bulk cable which were previously netted against revenues were reclassed from Other Property Revenues to Other Operating Expenses.

The reclassifications had no effect on net income available for common shareholders.   2. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION   In accordance with accounting standards governing stock based compensation Mid-American measures the amount of compensation cost based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or the liability instruments issued, and remeasures liability awards at each reporting period. Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award.   Incentive Plans Overview and Summary   Mid-Americas stock compensation plans consist of an employee stock purchase plan and a number of incentives provided to attract and retain independent directors, executive officers and key employees. Incentives are currently granted under the 2004 Stock Plan which was approved at the May 24, 2004 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. This plan replaced the 1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan (collectively, the Plans) under which no further awards may be granted as of January 31, 2004. The 1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan allowed for the grant of restricted stock and stock options up to a total of 2.4 million shares. The2004 Stock Plan allows for the grant of restricted stock and stock options up to a total of 500,000 shares. Mid-America believes that such awards better align the interests of our employees with those of our shareholders. Total compensation costs under the Plans were approximately $1,314,000, $1,022,000 and $697,000 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to the Plans was approximately $2,630,000. This cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of 1.7 years. Information concerning specific grants under the Plans is listed below.   Employee Stock Purchase Plan   The Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, provides a means for employees to purchase common stock of Mid-America at a discounted price. The Board of Directors has authorized the issuance of 150,000 shares for the plan. The ESPP is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors who may annually grant options to employees to purchase annually up to an aggregate of 15,000 shares of common stock at a price equal to 85% of the market price of the common stock. Shares are purchased semi-annually on June 30 and December 31. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, 6,427, 5,581and 4,894 shares, respectively, were purchased through the ESPP. Because it is not possible to reasonably estimate fair value at the grant date, Mid-America estimates the compensation costs based on intrinsic values updated until the date of the settlement. Compensation cost recognized for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, was approximately $38,000, $35,000 and $35,000, respectively.   Options   All option awards made under the Plans have been granted with the exercise price equal to the market price on the day of grant. The options vest over five years of continuous service at a rate of 10%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 30%, and expire 10 years from grant date. Mid-America issues new shares when options are exercised. Dividends are not paid on unexercised options.   The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes method, which utilizes the assumptions noted in the following table. Volatility is based on the historical volatility of Mid-Americas common stock. Expected life of the option is estimated using historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination. Mid-America uses a U.S. constant-maturity Treasury close to the same expected life of the option to represent the risk-free rate. Turnover is based on the historical rate at which    F-15          MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC.     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007   2.

No options were granted during 2009, 2008 or 2007; therefore, no fair value was calculated.   A summary of option activity under the Plans as of December 31, 2009, and the changes during the year then ended follows:                         Options     Shares     Weighted-  Average  Exercise  Price     Weighted-  Average  Remaining  Contractual  Life     Aggregate  Intrinsic Value    Outstanding at December 31, 2008        25,782        $  25.38                                 Granted                                                    Exercised        (2,125  )          25.52                                 Forfeited        (500  )          25.52                                 Expired                                                    Outstanding at December 31, 2009        23,157        $  25.37           2.1        $  530,588       Exercisable at December 31, 2009        23,157        $  25.37           2.1        $  530,588       The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2009, was approximately $29,000. Cash received from the exercise of options for the year ended December 31, 2009, was approximately $54,000.   Executive 2000 Restricted Stock   In 2000, Mid-America issued 10,750 restricted shares of common stock to executive officers with a grant date fair value of $22.1875 per share. The grant date fair value was determined by the closing trading price of Mid-Americas shares on the day prior to the date of the grant. These shares vest 10% each over ten years through 2010. The executive officers have the option to accelerate the vesting in lieu of bonuses. As of December 31, 2009, no shares have been vested early. Recipients receive dividend payments on the shares of restricted stock prior to vesting.   A summary of the status of the Executive 2000 Restricted Stock nonvested shares as of December 31, 2009, and the changes for the year ended December 31, 2009, is presented below:                 Nonvested Shares     Shares     Weighted  Average  Grant-Date  Fair Value    Nonvested at January 1, 2009        2,150        $  22.19       Granted               Vested        (1,075  )       $  22.19       Forfeited                         Nonvested at December 31, 2009        1,075        $  22.19       As of December 31, 2009, there was approximately $4,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested shares granted. This cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of 0.05 years. The total fair value of shares vesting during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, was approximately $24,000, $24,000 and $24,000, respectively.

The grant date fair value was determined by the closing trading price of Mid-Americas shares on the day prior to the date of the grant. As a result of three managers leaving the employment of Mid-America, as of December 31, 2009, only 81,916 shares remain issued. These shares will vest 20% on March 31 of each year for five consecutive years beginning in 2008. Recipients receive dividend payments on the shares of restricted stock prior to vesting.

This cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of 1.5 years. The total fair value of shares vesting during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $420,000 and $420,000, respectively. No shares vested during the year ended December 31, 2007.   Director Restricted Stock Plan   Starting with the 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, non-employee directors elected to the Board of Directors received a grant of $75,000 worth of restricted shares of common stock. The shares vest in three equal installments over the directors three-year term. To begin the program, non-employee directors not sitting for re-election at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders received a pro-rata grant representing the number of years left in their term. Non-employee directors appointed to the Board outside of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders may be issued partial or initial grants. No shares of restricted stock were granted to non-employeedirectors during 2007. At our 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, a proposal was approved to move to annual elections of directors and director grants were increased from what was effectively an annual grant of $25,000 under the previous program to annual grants of $30,000. Directors have the right to receive their grants either in shares of restricted stock that will vest after one year of service on the Board of Directors or have them issued into a deferred compensation plan.

This cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of 0.17 years. The total fair value of shares vesting during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, was approximately $140,000, $150,000 and $187,000, respectively.   Key Managers 2005 Restricted Stock   In 2005, the Board of Directors adopted the 2005 Key Management Restricted Stock Plan, or the 2005 Plan, a long-term incentive program for key managers and executive officers. The 2005 Plan grants shares of restricted stock based on a sliding scale of total shareholder return over three 12-month periods ending in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Any restricted stock earned will vest 100% three years after the date of the restricted stock issuance. Recipients will receive dividend payments on the shares of restricted stock during the restriction periods. There is no automatic vesting of the shares. Based on Mid-Americas performance from July 1, 2005,through June 30, 2006, 25,034 restricted shares of common stock were issued to key managers and executive officers on June 30, 2006. No shares of restricted stock were issued in 2007 or 2008. As a result of three managers leaving the employment of Mid-America, as of January 1, 2009, only 22,532 shares remained issued under this plan.   The fair value of the stock award was estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation with the assumptions noted in the following table. Volatility is based on the historical volatility of Mid-Americas common stock. The expected term of the 2005 Plan is based on the criteria for the plan and the expected life of the awards. Mid-America uses a U.S. constant-maturity Treasury with the same term as the expected term of the 2005 Plan to represent the risk-free rate. Turnover is based on the historical experience for the key managers and executive officers. Mid-America uses its current dividend yield at the time of grant to estimate thedividend yield over the life of the plan.             Volatility        17.10  %      Expected life in years        3       Risk-free rate        3.77  %      Dividend yield        5.20  %      As of December 31, 2009, there was approximately $318,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted. Mid-Americas policy is to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for an entire award (rather than each portion of an award). Accordingly, the $318,000 unrecognized cost will be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of 1.16 years. The total fair value of shares vesting during the year ended December 31, 2009 was approximately $556,000. No shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2008 or 2007 under this plan.

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION   (continued)  Long-Term Performance Based Incentive Plan for Executive Officers   The Compensation Committee, by authorization of the Board of Directors of Mid-America, submitted the Long-Term Performance Based Incentive Plan for Executive Officers (the Long-Term Plan), which was approved by shareholders on June 2, 2003. The Long-Term Plan allowed executive management to earn performance units that converted into shares of restricted stock based on achieving defined total shareholder investment performance levels. Based on Mid-Americas performance from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2005, 74,895 restricted shares of common stock were issued to executive management on March 14, 2006. While these shares ofrestricted stock will be entitled to dividend payments, they will not be transferable or have voting privileges until they vest. Dependent upon the executive officers continued employment with Mid-America, these shares of restricted stock vest 20% annually from 2006 through 2010.   The fair value of the stock award was estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation with the assumptions noted in the following table. Volatility is based on the historical volatility of Mid-Americas common stock. The expected term of the Long-Term Plan is based on the criteria for the plan and the expected life of the awards. Mid-America uses a U.S. constant-maturity Treasury for the same term as the expected term of the Long-Term Plan to represent the risk-free rate. Turnover is based on the historical experience for the key managers and executive officers. Mid-America uses its current dividend yield at the time of grant toestimate the dividend yield over the life of the plan.             Volatility        6.38  %      Expected life in years        3       Risk-free rate        1.99  %      Dividend yield        9.60  %      For the year ended December 31, 2009, compensation costs related to the Long-Term Plan were approximately $41,000. As of December 31, 2009, there was approximately $41,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted. This unrecognized cost will be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of 1.0 years. The total fair value of shares vesting during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, was approximately $66,200, $66,200, and $66,200, respectively.   Key Managers 2008 Restricted Stock   In 2008, the Board of Directors adopted the 2008 Key Management Restricted Stock Plan, or the 2008 Plan, a long-term incentive program for key managers and executive officers. The 2008 Plan consists of both an annual and three year program. Under the annual program participants can earn both service and performance based shares of restricted stock. The service based shares are awarded at the beginning of the 2008 Plan with the timing of vesting dependent on employment and total shareholder return performance. The earning of restricted shares under the performance program is based on employment and total shareholder return performance. Any sharesearned through the annual performance program will be issued on January 1, 2010 and will vest 50% annually beginning on January 1, 2010. Participation in the three year program is limited to the executive officers and awards shares of restricted stock based upon both Mid-Americas total shareholder return performance over a three year period and that performance in relation to that of our peers. Any shares earned through the three year program will be issued on January 1, 2012 and will vest 25% annually beginning on January 1, 2013. Recipients will receive dividend payments on any shares of restricted stock earned and issued during the restriction periods. On July 1, 2008, Mid-America issued 15,920 shares of restricted stock under the annual service based program of the 2008 Plan. As a result of two managers leaving the employment of Mid-America, as of December 31, 2009, 149 shares have been forfeited and 473 shares have early vested.

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION   (continued)  The fair value of the stock award was estimated on the grant date using a multifactor Monte Carlo simulation. The valuation used an interest rate term structure as of July 1, 2008 based on a zero coupon risk-free rate to represent the risk-free rate for the simulation which varied between 1.95% for 0.25 years to 3.24% for 4.00 years. The dividend yield assumption was 4.669% and was based on the closing stock price of $52.69 on July 1, 2008. Volatility for Mid-America and our peers was obtained by using a blend of both historical and implied volatility calculations. Historical volatility was based on the standard deviation of daily total continuousreturns and implied volatility was based on the trailing month average of interpolating between the volatilities implied by stock call option contracts that were closest to the terms and closest to the money. Volatility for Mid-America was 34.87% for year 1, 30.92% for year 2, 29.63% for year 3, and 28.61% for year 4. Volatilities for our peers ranged from 25.05% to 49.94%. The requisite service period of the 2008 Plan is based on the criteria for the separate programs and is 5.5 years for the annual service based program, 2.5 years for the annual performance based program and 7.5 years for the three-year program. Turnover is based on the historical experience for the key managers and executive officers.   As of December 31, 2009, there was approximately $1,769,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted. Mid-Americas policy is to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for an entire award (rather than each portion of an award). Accordingly, the $1,769,000 unrecognized cost will be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of 2.0 years. No shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2009 or 2008.   3.

REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURES   In 2004, Mid-America entered into a joint venture (CH/Realty II) with Crow Holdings with the purchase of the Verandas at Timberglen apartments. Mid-America owned a 33.33% interest in CH/Realty II, and contributed 33.33% of the capital necessary to establish the joint venture. On January 12, 2007, CH/Realty II sold the Verandas at Timberglen apartments and Mid-America sold its ownership interest in CH/Realty II to Crow Holdings. As a result, Mid-America booked a gain on sale of $5.4 million and an incentive fee of $1 million, both of which are recorded in Mid-Americas 2007 consolidated financial statements. Following the sale of theproperty from the joint venture, Mid-Americas relationship with Crow Holdings in CH/Realty II ceased to exist.

BORROWINGS   Mid-America maintains a total of $1,044 millionof secured credit facilities with Prudential Mortgage Capital, credit enhanced by FNMA (the FNMA Facilities). The FNMA Facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings and have traunches with maturities from 2011 through 2018.The interest rate on the majority of the variable portion renews every 90 days and is based on the FNMA discount mortgage backed security rate on the date of renewal, which, for Mid-America, has historically approximated three-month LIBOR less an average of 0.16% over the life of the FNMA Facilities, plus a fee of 0.49% to 0.67%. Borrowings under the FNMAFacilities totaled $1,005 million at December 31, 2009, with no fixed balances outstanding, and the entire $1,005 million under the variable rate portion of the facility at an average rate of 0.8%. The available borrowing base capacity at December 31, 2009, was $1,044 million. Commitment fees related to our unused FNMA Facilities totaled approximately $186 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2009. Mid-America has 21 interest rate swap agreements, totaling a notional amount of $666 million designed to fix the interest rate on a portion of the variable rate borrowings outstanding under the FNMA Facilities at approximately 5.3%. The interest rate swaps have maturities between 2010 and 2015. The swaps are highly effective and are designed as cash flow hedges. Mid-America has also entered into sixteen interest rate caps totaling a notional amount of $157 million which are designated against the FNMA Facilities. These interest rate caps have maturities between 2010 and 2016 and elevenare set at 6.0%, two set at 5.0%, two set at 4.5%, and one is set at 6.5%. The FNMA Facilities are subject to certain borrowing base calculations that can effectively reduce the amount that may be borrowed.   Mid-America has a $300 million credit facility with Freddie MAC (the Freddie Mac Facility). At December 31, 2009, Mid-America had $298 million borrowed against the Freddie Mac Facility at an interest rate of 0.7%. Commitment fees related to our Freddie Mac Facility totaled approximately $11 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2009. Mid-America has thirteen interest rate swap agreements, totaling a notional amount of $217 million designed to fix the interest rate on a portion of the variable rate borrowings outstanding under the Freddie Mac Facility at approximately 5.3%. The interest rate swaps expire between 2011 and 2014.Mid-America has also entered into one interest rate cap totaling a notional amount of $15 million which is designated against the Freddie Mac Facility. This interest rate cap has a 2014 maturity and is set at 5.0%.   Mid-America also maintains a $50 million secured credit facility with two banks led by Regions Bank (the AmSouth Credit Line; formerly with AmSouth Bank before their merger in 2006). The AmSouth Credit Line bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 1.25%. This credit line expires in May 2010 and is subject to certain borrowing base calculations that effectively reduce the amount that may be borrowed. At December 31, 2009, Mid-America had $46 million available to be borrowed under the AmSouth Credit Line agreement with $0 borrowed under this facility at an interest rate of 1.7%. Approximately $2 million of the facility is used forletters of credit.   Each of Mid-Americas credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage. If Mid-America were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which could adversely affect Mid-Americas liquidity. Moreover, if Mid-America were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure periods one or more of its lenders could declare a default, accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing such facilities. Any such event could have a material adverseeffect on Mid-America. Mid-America believes it was in compliance with these covenants and conditions on usage at December 31, 2009.   At December 31, 2009, Mid-America had $70 million of fixed rate conventional individual property mortgages with an average interest rate of 5.9% and an average maturity of 2020, a $15 million variable rate mortgage with an embedded cap rate of 7% at an interest rate of 3.6% with a maturity in 2015, and a $11 million fixed rate tax exempt individual property mortgage with an interest rate of 5.3% and a maturity in 2028.

BORROWINGS   (continued)  At December 31, 2009, Mid-America had $263 million (after considering the impact of interest rate swap and cap agreements in effect) conventional variable rate debt outstanding at an average interest rate of 0.9%, $108 million of capped conventional variable rate debt at an average interest rate of 0.8%, and an additional $64 million of capped tax-free variable rate debt at an average rate of1.1%. The interest rate on all other debt, totaling $964 million, was hedged or fixed at an average interest rate of 5.4%.   As of December 31, 2009, Mid-America estimated that the weighted average interest rate on Mid-Americas debt was 4.0%.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   (continued)  At December 31, 2009, all of Mid-Americas interest rate swaps and interest rate caps were designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a liability for derivatives of approximately $55.4 million and $78.4 million, respectively, to fair market value of interest rate swaps and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. We also recorded approximately $3.4 million and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively, to other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair market value of interest rate swaps, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and other assets lineitems represent the fair values of the interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our variable-rate debt. During 2010, we estimate that an additional $32.0 million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense. See also discussions in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 and Note 7.   7. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and security deposits are carried at amounts which reasonably approximate their fair value due to their short term nature.   Fixed rate notes payable at December 31, 2009, and 2008, total $81 million and $148 million, respectively, and have estimated fair values of $74 million and $142 million (excluding prepayment penalties), respectively, based upon interest rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities as of December 31, 2009, and 2008. The carrying value of variable rate notes payable (excluding the effect of interest rate swap and cap agreements) at December 31, 2009, and 2008, total $1,318 million and $1,175 million, respectively, and have estimated fair values of $1,193 million and $1,078 million (excluding prepaymentpenalties), respectively, based upon interest rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities as of December 31, 2009, and 2008.   In the normal course of business, we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt or to hedge anticipated future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction.   We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Further, we have a policy of entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit rating and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designated to hedge, we have not sustained any material loss from those instruments nor do we anticipate any material adverse effect on our net income attributable to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.   We utilize derivative financial instruments that can be designated as cash flow hedges and which are expected to be highly effective in reducing the interest rate risk exposure that they are designed to hedge. This effectiveness is essential for qualifying for hedge accounting. Instruments that meet the criteria qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are formally designated as hedging instruments at the inception of the derivative contract. We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective, strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, and methods of assessingeffectiveness and measuring ineffectiveness. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives used are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. When it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively.

FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   (continued)  All of our derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value, are represented on the consolidated balance sheet within other assets, fair market value of interest rate swaps, and accrued expenses and other liabilities, and are characterized as cash flow hedges. These transactions hedge the future cash flows of debt transactions through interest rate swaps that convert variable payments to fixed payments and interest rate caps that limit the exposure to rising interest rates. As of December 31, 2009, we have entered into 34 interest rate swaps and 17 interest rate caps with a total notional balance of $883.2 million and $172.3 million,respectively. As of December 31, 2009, and 2008, we recorded a liability for derivatives of approximately $55.4 million and $78.4 million, respectively, to fair market value of interest rate swaps and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

As of December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 the year-to-date ineffective portion of the hedging transactions reclassified to earnings was a $724,000 increase, a $93,000 decrease, and a $470,000 decrease, respectively, to interest expense. The current year increase to interest expense consisted of $131,000 attributable to 2009 interest rate and fair value fluctuations and a $593,000reclassification from other comprehensive income to interest expense. The reclassification resulted from the reversal of prior period realized gains between the derivative instrument and the hedged debt transaction.

If the hedged forecasted debt transaction becomes probable of not occurring, amounts previously deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income will immediately be reclassified to net income. If the hedged forecasted debt transaction remains probable tooccur, these same previously deferred amounts will be amortized over the remaining hedged forecasted debt transactions.   As of December 31, 2009, the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a liability position is $54.5 million. Certain of our derivative contracts are credit enhanced by either FNMA or Freddie Mac. These derivative instrument contracts require that our credit enhancing party maintain credit ratings above a certain level. If the credit rating of the credit enhancing party were to fall below these levels, it would trigger additional collateral to be deposited with the counterparty up to 100 percent of the liability position of the derivative contracts. As of December 31, 2009, the totalmaximum liability was $54.5 million of which our credit enhancing parties would be responsible for posting up to $31.7 million and we would be responsible for posting up to $22.8 million. If our credit enhancing parties are unwilling or unable to post their portion, we could be required to post the full collateral amount. Both FNMA and Freddie Mac are currently rated Aaa by Moodys and AAA by S&P. The following table summarizes the credit ratings that would trigger the credit-risk-related contingent features, along with the combined amount that would be required to post under each credit rating scenario, if triggered, as of December 31, 2009.                 As of December 31, 2009    Credit Rating     Required  Collateral    Moody's     S&P    Aaa        AAA        $         Aa1        AA+        $         Aa2        AA        $         Aa3        AA-        $         A1        A+        $   (3,194,361  )      A2        A        $   (6,703,499  )      A3        A-        $   (46,114,045  )      Baa1        BBB+        $   (54,497,461  )       F-27          MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC.     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007   7. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   (continued)  Certain of our derivative contracts contain a cross default provision under which a default under certain of our other indebtedness in excess of a threshold amount causes an event of default under the agreement. Threshold amounts range from $1 million to $75 million. As of December 31, 2009, the fair value of derivatives containing cross default provisions was in a liability position of $14.2 million. Following an event of default, a termination event may occur, and we would be required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination value of $14.7 million as of December 31, 2009. Although our derivative contracts are subject tomaster netting arrangements which serve as credit mitigants to both us and our counterparties under certain situations, we do not net our derivative fair values or any existing rights or obligations to cash collateral on the consolidated balance sheet.   In accordance with accounting standards for determining fair values, we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, we have determined that the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of our own default as well as the default of our counterparties. As of December 31, 2009, we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the creditvaluation adjustments are significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.   The table below presents the Mid-Americas assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2008, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall.

The fair value of these instruments is reported on the balance sheet in Other assets, Fair market value of interest rate swaps, and Accrued expenses and other liabilities, with a corresponding adjustment for the unrealized gains/losses to Accumulated other comprehensive income, with any ineffective portion of the hedging transactions reclassified to interest expense. We use three major banks to provide approximately80% of our swaps, JP Morgan Chase, Royal Bank of Canada, and Deutsche Bank, all of which have high investment grade ratings from Moodys and S&P. Our interest rate swaps with JP Morgan Chase, Royal Bank of Canada, and Deutsche Bank had liability positions on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets of $5.6 million, $20.8 million and $22.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2009.   Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair value of positions that Mid-America has classified within the Level 3 category. As a result, the unrealized gains and losses for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category presented in the tables above may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs.   The fair value estimates presented herein are based on information available to management as of December 31, 2009, and 2008. These estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts Mid-America could ultimately realize. See also discussions in Item 8.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   Mid-America is not presently subject to any material litigation nor, to Mid-Americas knowledge, with advice of legal counsel, is any material litigation threatened against us. We are subject to routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which is expected to be covered by liability insurance and none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.   Mid-America had operating lease expense of approximately $17,600, $13,000 and $11,300 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Mid-America has commitments of approximately $18,200 in 2010, $17,600 in 2011 and $9,700 in 2012 under operating lease agreements outstanding at December 31, 2009.   9. INCOME TAXES   No provision for federal income taxes has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Mid-America has made an election to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust, or REIT, under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a REIT, Mid-America is generally not subject to federal income tax to the extent that we distribute 100% of our taxable income to our shareholders. We must meet certain requirements, including the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income, to maintain REIT status. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, Mid-America will be subject to the federal income tax(including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Even though we qualify for taxation as a REIT, Mid-America may be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise tax on our undistributed income.   Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of dividends to shareholders, differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes primarily because of differences in depreciable lives, bases of certain assets and liabilities and in the timing of recognition of earnings upon disposition of properties. For federal income tax purposes, the following summarizes the taxability of cash distributions paid on the common shares in 2008 and 2007 and the estimated taxability for 2009:                         2009     2008     2007    Per common share                                           Ordinary income     $   1.61        $   1.43        $   1.44       Capital gains        0.17                      0.47       Return of capital        0.68           1.03           0.51       Total     $   2.46        $   2.46        $   2.42       In June 2006, the FASB issued ASC 740-10-50 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements. Mid-America adopted ASC 740-10-50 effective January 1, 2007. ASC 740-10-50 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the recognition and measurement of tax positions taken in tax returns. Mid-America has identified and examined our tax positions, including our status as a real estate investment trust, for all open tax years through December 31, 2006, and concluded that the full benefit of each tax position taken should be recognized in the financial statements. There has been nosignificant changes in unrecognized tax benefits following the adoption date.   ASC 740-10-50 requires that an enterprise must calculate interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. The decision regarding where to classify interest and penalties on the income statement is an accounting policy decision that should be consistently applied. Interest and penalties calculated on any future uncertain tax positions will be presented as a component of income tax expense. No interest and penalties are accrued on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.   Mid-Americas tax years that remain subject to examination for U.S. federal purposes range from 2006 through 2008. Our tax years that remain open for state examination vary but range from 2005 through 2008.

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY   Noncontrolling Interest   Noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to the ownership interest in the Operating Partnership by the holders of Class A Common Units of the Operating Partnership, or Operating Partnership Units. Mid-America is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. Net income is allocated to the noncontrolling interest based on their respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership. Issuance of additional common shares or Operating Partnership Units changes the ownership of both the noncontrolling interest and Mid-America. Such transactions and the related proceeds are treated as capitaltransactions and result in an allocation between shareholders equity and noncontrolling interest to account for the change in the respective percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.   Mid-Americas Board of Directors established economic rights in respect to each Operating Partnership Unit that were equivalent to the economic rights in respect to each share of common stock. The holder of each unit may redeem their units in exchange for one share of common stock or cash, at the option of Mid-America. At December 31, 2009, a total of 2,305,652 units were outstanding and redeemable to Mid-America by the holders of the units for 2,305,652 shares of common stock or approximately $111,317,000, based on the closing price of Mid-Americas common stock on December 31, 2009 of $48.28 per share, at Mid-Americas option. AtDecember 31, 2008, a total of 2,403,515 units were outstanding and redeemable to Mid-America by the holders of the units for 2,403,515 shares of common stock or approximately $89,315,000, based on the closing price of Mid-Americas common stock on December 31, 2008 of $37.16 per share, at Mid-Americas option.   The Operating Partnership has followed the policy of paying the same per unit distribution in respect to the units as the per share distribution in respect to the common stock. Operating Partnership net income for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was allocated approximately 8.2%, 8.7% and 9.4%, respectively, to holders of Operating Partnership Units and 91.8%, 91.3% and 90.6%, respectively, to Mid-America.   Series F Preferred Stock   In 2002, Mid-America issued Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or Series F Preferred Stock, with a $25.00 per share liquidation preference and a preferential cumulative annual distribution of $2.3125 per share, payable monthly. On October 16, 2007, Mid-America redeemed all of the 474,500 issued and outstanding shares of the Series F Preferred Stock for $11.9 million.   Series H Preferred Stock   In 2003, Mid-America issued the Series H Preferred Stock with a $25.00 per share liquidation preference and a preferential cumulative annual distribution of $2.075 per share, payable quarterly. Mid-America has outstanding 6,200,000 Series H Preferred Stock shares for which it received net proceeds of $150.1 million. On and after August 11, 2008, the Series H Preferred Stock shares became redeemable for cash at the option of Mid-America, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference plus dividends owed and unpaid to the redemption date.   Direct Stock Purchase and Distribution Reinvestment Plan   Mid-America has a Dividend and Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan, or DRSPP, pursuant to which Mid-America's shareholders have the ability to reinvest all or part of their distributions from Mid-Americas common stock, preferred stock or limited partnership interests in Mid-America Apartments, L.P. into Mid-Americas common stock. The plan also provides the opportunity to make optional cash investments in common shares of at least $250, but not more than $5,000 in any given month, free of brokerage commissions and charges. Mid-America, in our absolute discretion, may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excessof $5,000.

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY   (continued)  either issue additional shares of common stock or repurchase common stock in the open market. We have registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission the offer and sale of up to 7,600,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the DRSPP. We may elect to sell shares under the DRSPP at up to a 5% discount.   Common stock shares totaling 25,406 in 2009, 421,794 in 2008 and 136,483 in 2007 were acquired by shareholders under the DRSPP. Mid-America offered an average of a 1.5% discount for optional cash purchases in 2008 and 2007. We did not offer a discount for optional cash purchases through the DRSPP in 2009.   Controlled Equity Offering   On November 3, 2006, Mid-America entered into a sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. to sell up to 2,000,000 shares of our common stock, from time to time in at-the-market offerings or negotiated transactions through a controlled equity offering program. On July 3, 2008, Mid-America entered into a second agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. with materially the same terms for an additional 1,350,000 shares and on November 5, 2009 we entered into a third agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. with materially the same terms for an additional 4,000,000 shares.   During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, Mid-America sold 763,000, 1,955,300 and 323,700 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $32.8 million, $103.6 million and $18.8 million, respectively.   Stock Repurchase Plan   In 1999, Mid-Americas Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan to acquire up to a total of 4.0 million shares of Mid-Americas common stock. Through December 31, 2009, Mid-America has repurchased and retired approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock for a cost of approximately $42 million at an average price per common share of $22.54. No shares were repurchased in 2002 through 2009 under the plan.   11. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS   Following are details of employee benefit plans not previously discussed in Item 8.
