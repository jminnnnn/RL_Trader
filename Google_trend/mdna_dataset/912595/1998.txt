ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  The   following  is  a  discussion  of  the  consolidated  financial condition  and  results of operations of the Company for  the  years ended  December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995. This discussion should  be read in conjunction with all of the financial statements included in this  Annual Report on Form 10-K. These financial statements include all  adjustments which are, in the opinion of management,  necessary to  reflect a fair statement of the results for the interim  periods presented,  and  all  such adjustments are  of  a  normal  recurring nature.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS  Funds  from  operations ("FFO") represents net income  (computed  in accordance  with  GAAP)  excluding  extraordinary  items,   minority interest   in  Operating  Partnership  income,  gain  or   loss   on disposition  of  real  estate assets, and  certain  non-cash  items, primarily  depreciation  and  amortization,  less  preferred   stock dividends.  The  Company  computes FFO in accordance  with  NAREIT's current   definition,  which  eliminates  amortization  of  deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets as  items added  back  to  net income when computing FFO. The Company  adopted this  method of calculating FFO effective as of the NAREIT-suggested adoption date of January 1, 1996. FFO should not be considered as an alternative  to  net  income  or  any  other  GAAP  measurement   of performance,  as  an  indicator of operating performance  or  as  an alternative  to cash flows from operating, investing, and  financing activities as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes that  FFO is  helpful in understanding the Company's results of operations  in that  such  calculation reflects cash flow from operating activities and  the  Company's ability to support interest payments and general operating expenses before the impact of certain activities  such  as changes  in  other  assets  and  accounts  payable.   The  Company's calculation  of FFO may differ from the methodology for  calculating FFO  utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.  For   the   year    ended  December  31,  1997,  FFO  increased   by approximately  $8,102,000 or 22%, when compared to  the  year  ended December  31,  1996. The increase was primarily attributable  to  an approximate  $27,233,000 increase in revenues, which  was  partially offset  by increases in expenses mainly associated with the increase in  the  number of apartment units owned by the Company.  On  a  per share basis, FFO increased approximately 3% from $2.66 per share for the  year  ended December 31, 1996 to $2.73 per share for  the  same period in 1997.  For   the   year    ended  December  31,  1996,  FFO  increased   by approximately $6,809,000 or 23.7%, when compared to the year earlier (adjusted  only for the new NAREIT definition of FFO). The  increase was primarily attributable to an approximate $16,919,000 increase in revenues, which was partially offset by increases in expenses mainly associated with the increase in the number of apartment units  owned by  the Company. On a per share basis, FFO increased 8.6% from $2.44 per share (restated for the effect of adoption of the current NAREIT FFO  definition and the change in accounting policy)  for  the  year ended  December 31, 1995 to $2.65 per share for the same  period  in 1996.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996  During   the  1997  period,  the  Company  acquired  12  communities containing 3,314 apartment units.  In addition, through the November 25,  1997  merger  with Flournoy Development Company  ("FDC"),   the Company  acquired  32 communities containing 8,641  apartment  units including 950 apartment units under development. The total number of apartment  units  owned  at December 31,  1997  was  30,468  in  115 apartment  communities,  compared to 19,280  in  73  communities  at December  31,  1996.  Average  monthly  rental  per  apartment  unit increased  to  $549 at December 31, 1997 from $529 at  December  31, 1996 for the Company's properties owned prior to the merger. For the communities  owned  prior to the merger, average occupancy  for  the years  ended   December  31,  1997 and 1996  was  94.5%  and  95.4%, respectively.  For the properties acquired through the  FDC  Merger, average  monthly  rental per apartment unit  was  $613  and  average occupancy was 92.2% at December 31, 1997.  Total revenues for 1997 increased by approximately $27,234,000,  due primarily  to (i) approximately $12,743,000 from the 12  Communities acquired  in  1997,  (ii)  approximately  $5,342,000  from  the   30 completed  Communities  acquired  through  the  FDC  Merger,   (iii) approximately  $6,759,000 from a full years  operation  of  the  six Communities  acquired in 1996, (iii) approximately  $2,113,000  from the   Communities   owned   throughout  both   periods,   and   (iv) approximately  $277,000  from The Woods at Post  House  in  Jackson, Tennessee  which  completed development in  the  Fall  of  1995  and Lincoln  on the Green phase II in Memphis, Tennessee which completed development early 1998.  Property  operating  expenses for 1997  increased  by  approximately $9,834,000, due primarily to (i) approximately $4,929,000  from  the 12  Communities acquired in 1997, (ii) approximately $1,938,000 from the  30 completed Communities acquired through the FDC Merger, (iii) approximately  $2,298,000 from a full years  operation  of  the  six Communities acquired in 1996, (iii) approximately $583,000 from  the Communities  owned  throughout both periods, and (iv)  approximately $86,000 from The Woods at Post House  which completed development in the  Fall  of 1995 and Lincoln on the Green phase II. Utility  costs decreased from 5.5% of revenue to 4.6% of revenue for the year ended December  31,  1997 compared to the same period a year earlier,  due primarily  to over 13,000 units now submetered for water  usage  and continued  benefits  from  the  1996 completion  of  the  individual apartment unit electricity metering at Sailwinds at Lake Magdalene.  General and  administrative expense increased $448,000 for the  year ended  December 31, 1997 compared to December 31, 1996 and decreased from  5.5% of revenue to 4.8% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 1997 compared to the same period a year earlier.  The reductions result  from  $122,000  transfer of landscape overhead  to  property costs,   $156,000  reduced  state  and  local  taxes  and  increased operating efficiencies of a larger operation.  Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to (i) approximately $2,503,000 from the 12 Communities acquired  in  1997, (ii)  approximately  $1,247,000 from the  30  completed  Communities acquired  through  the  FDC Merger, (iii)  approximately  $1,493,000 from a full years operation of the six Communities acquired in 1996, (iii)  approximately $1,224,000 from additional capital expenditures on    Communities   owned   throughout  both   periods,   and   (iv) approximately  $54,000 from The Woods at Post House and  Lincoln  on the  Green  phase II.  Amortization of deferred financing costs  and unamortized costs in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for 1997   were   approximately  $888,000  and  approximately  $309,000, respectively.  Interest expense increased approximately $3,177,000 during 1997  due primarily to apartment acquisitions. The Company reduced its average borrowing cost to 7.41% at December 31, 1997 as compared to 7.92% on December  31, 1996. The average maturity on the Company's  debt  was 10.2 and 9.9 years at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.   In 1997,  the Company recorded an approximate $8,622,000 loss on  early extinguishment of debt, net of minority interest, primarily from the repayment of certain debt in connection with the FDC Merger.  Income before minority interest for the year ended December 31, 1997 increased  approximately $5,069,000 over  the  same  period  a  year earlier.   COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995  During   the  1996  period,  the  Company  acquired  six   apartment communities  and sold three apartment communities. The total  number of  apartment  units owned at December 31, 1996  was  19,280  in  73 apartment  communities,  compared to 18,219  in  70  communities  at December  31,  1995.  Average  monthly  rental  per  apartment  unit increased  to  $529 at December 31, 1996 from $508 at  December  30, 1995.  Average occupancy for the years ended  December 31, 1996  and 1995 was 95.4% and 95.2%, respectively.  Total revenues for 1996 increased by approximately $16,919,000,  due primarily  to (i) approximately $4,833,000 from the six  Communities acquired  in 1996, (ii)  approximately $7,156,000 from a full  years operation  of  the  15 Communities acquired in 1995,  including  the Communities   acquired  in  the  AFR  Merger,  (iii)   approximately $4,363,000  from the Communities owned throughout both periods,  and (iv)  approximately  $567,000 from   The  Woods  at  Post  House  in Jackson, Tennessee  which completed development in the Fall of 1995.  Property  operating  expenses for 1996  increased  by  approximately $4,616,000, due primarily to (i) approximately $1,686,000  from  the six  Communities  acquired  in 1996, (ii)  approximately  $2,746,000 from  a  full  year's operations of the 15 Communities  acquired  in 1995,  including  the Communities acquired in the  AFR  Merger,  and (iii)  approximately $234,000 from The Woods at  Post  House.  These increases  were offset by a decrease of approximately  $51,000  from the   Communities   owned  throughout  both  periods.   Repair   and maintenance expense decreased primarily due to the Company's  change in the capitalization policy to conform with policies currently used by  the  majority  of  the largest apartment  REITs.  Utility  costs decreased from 6.1% of revenue to 5.5% of revenue for the year ended December  31,  1996 compared to the same period a year earlier,  due primarily  to  the installation of 6,400 individual  apartment  unit water  meters  and the completion of the individual  apartment  unit electricity metering at Sailwinds at Lake Magdalene.  General  and  administrative expense increased in 1996 approximately $1,303,000  primarily due to the opening of the new training  center and other expenses due to the continued growth of the company.  Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to (i) approximately  $893,000 from the six apartment communities  acquired in  1996,  (ii)   approximately $1,346,000  from  the  15  apartment communities acquired in 1995, including the Communities acquired  in the  AFR  Merger,  (iii)  approximately $2,187,000  from  additional capital  expenditures on Communities owned throughout both  periods, and  (iv)  approximately $443,000 from  The Woods at Post  House  in Jackson, Tennessee  which completed development in the Fall of 1995. Amortization  of deferred financing costs and unamortized  costs  in excess  of  fair  value  of  net  assets  acquired  for  1996   were approximately $661,000 and approximately $192,000, respectively.  Interest expense increased approximately $3,082,000 during 1996  due primarily to apartment acquisitions. The Company reduced the average borrowing cost to 7.92% at December 31, 1996 as compared to 8.15% on December  31, 1995. The average maturity on the Company's  debt  was 9.9 years at both December 31, 1996 and 1995.  In 1996, the Company recorded an approximate $2,185,000 gain for the disposition  of three apartment communities.  The dispositions  were structured as tax-deferred exchanges for federal tax purposes.  As a result  of  the foregoing, income before minority interest  for  the year ended December 31, 1996 increased approximately $5,166,000 over the same period a year earlier.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Net   cash    provided  by  operating  activities   increased   from approximately $38,018,000 for the year ended December  31,  1996  to approximately $44,797,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997.  The increase  in  net  cash flow was primarily due  to  an  increase  in depreciation  and amortization less an extraordinary  loss  recorded due to the early extinguishment of certain debt.  Net  cash  used in investing activities increased from approximately $70,436,000  for  the year ended December 31, 1996 to  approximately $138,263,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997. The increase  was primarily  due to the acquisition of 3,314 apartment units  in  1997 for  approximately  $76,287,000 as compared to  the  acquisition  of 1,760  apartment  units in 1996 for approximately $66,258,000.  This increase in net cash flow used in investing activities was partially offset  by  the  sale  of three apartment communities  in  1996  for approximately   $17,096,000.  Capital   improvements   to   existing properties  totaled  approximately $20,205,000 for  the  year  ended December  31,  1997, compared to approximately $18,437,000  for  the same  period  in  1996.  Of  the  $20,205,000  capital  improvements approximately  $7,743,000  was for recurring  capital  expenditures, including  carpet and appliances, approximately $6,112,000  was  for revenue   enhancing  projects,  approximately  $5,557,000  was   for acquisition   capital   with  the  remaining   balance   for   other miscellaneous  expenditures, including corporate. Recurring  capital expenditures  averaged  $0.47 per share  in  1997.  Construction  in progress  for  new  apartment  units  increased  from  approximately $2,837,000  for  the year ended December 31, 1996  to  approximately $16,093,000 for the comparable period in 1997, due primarily to  the completion  of the 234-unit development at Lincoln on the  Green  in Memphis,  Tennessee  which  began leasing  during   1997  and  other developments including $1,685,000 for the 254-unit Reserve at Dexter Lake,  $1,273,000 for the 288-unit Mandarin, $879,000 for  the  154- unit phase II addition for Whisperwood Spa and $789,000 for the 316- unit Terraces at Fieldstone.  Net  cash  provided  by  financing activities  increased  from approximately $33,425,000 during the year ended December 31, 1996 to approximately  $104,218,000 for the year ended  December  31,  1997. During  1997, approximately $202,320,000 was provided by  borrowings under   the   Credit  Line  and  notes  payable  and   approximately $46,635,000 was provided from the issuance of preferred shares.  The principal  uses  of the cash included approximately $30,021,000  for the  repayment  of notes payable and approximately  $39,771,000  for dividends and distributions.  At  December  31,  1997,  the Company had approximately  $45,225,000 outstanding  on the Credit Line. At December 31, 1997,  the  Company had  approximately  $63,200,000  (including  the  Credit  Line)   of floating  rate debt at an average interest rate of 6.5%;  all  other debt was fixed rate term debt at an average interest rate of 7.8%.  The weighted average interest rate and weighted average maturity  at December  31,  1997  for  the approximately  $632,213,000  of  notes payable were 7.4% and 10.2 years, respectively. The Company used the approximately  $46,635,000 of net proceeds from the Preferred  Stock Offering, which closed in November, for the acquisitions of the 192- unit Sterling Ridge apartment community in Augusta, Georgia and  the 184-unit  Colony at South Park apartment community in  Aiken,  South Carolina  and  used the balance to reduce the amount outstanding  on the  Credit Line. In November 1997, the Company increased its credit limit under the Credit Line from $90,000,000 to $110,000,000 and  in March  1998 increased the credit limit to $200,000,000.  The Company expects to use the Credit Line for future acquisitions, development, and  to  provide letters of credit as credit enhancements  for  tax- exempt bonds.  In March 1997 the Company issued 2,300,000 shares  of Common  Stock in an underwritten public offering.  The net  proceeds from  such offering were approximately $62.5 million, all  of  which were  contributed to the Operating Partnership and utilized to repay outstanding borrowings under the Credit Line.   The Credit  Line  is secured   and  is  subject  to  borrowing  base  calculations   that effectively reduce the maximum amount that may be borrowed under the Credit  Line  to approximately $44,300,000 as of the  date  of  this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The  Company  believes that cash provided by operations is  adequate and  anticipates that it will continue to be adequate  in  both  the short  and  long-term  to  meet  operating  requirements  (including recurring  capital expenditures at the Communities) and  payment  of distributions  by  the Company in accordance with REIT  requirements under the Code.  During  1997,  capital  expenditures were approximately  $20,205,000 for   property  improvements  and  $16,093,000   for   the development  of  new  units. For 1998,  the  Company  plans approximately  $27,000,000 for property  improvements  and $120,000,000  for development of new units. The Company  expects  to meet  its  long  term  liquidity  requirements,  such  as  scheduled mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, expansions and non- recurring   capital  expenditures,  through  long  and   medium-term collateralized and uncollateralized fixed rate borrowings,  issuance of  debt  or  additional equity securities in the  Company  and  the Credit Line.  INSURANCE  In  the opinion of management, property and casualty insurance is in place   which  provides  adequate  coverage  to  provide   financial protection against normal insurable risks such that it believes that any  loss  experienced would not have a significant  impact  on  the Company's liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.  INFLATION  Substantially  all of the resident leases at the Communities  allow, at  the  time  of  renewal,  for adjustments  in  the  rent  payable thereunder, and thus may enable the Company to seek rent  increases. The  substantial majority of these leases are for one year or  less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the Company of the adverse effects of inflation.  YEAR 2000  The  Company  is aware of the issues associated with the programming code  in  existing  computer systems as the millennium  (Year  2000) approaches.   The  "Year  2000" issue is pervasive  and  complex  as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some  way  by the  rollover  of  the two digit year value to  00.   The  issue  is whether  computer  systems  will properly recognize  date  sensitive information  when  the year changes to 2000.  Systems  that  do  not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail.  The  Company  is utilizing both internal and external  resources  to identify,  correct or reprogram, and test the systems for  the  Year 2000  compliance.  During 1997, the Company developed a plan to deal with  the Year 2000 issue.  Management has conducted a comprehensive review  of  the Company's computer systems to identify  the  systems that  could be affected by the Year 2000 issue and has developed  an implementation  plan to resolve potential issues.  The  Company  has reviewed  our core mainframe systems and application subsystems  and have  obtained  the Year 2000 compliant releases and are  developing the  installation  and testing plan for each of these  applications. The  Company has corresponded with our third party service providers and  other  providers of software and hardware for certification  of their compliance with Year 2000 issues.  It is anticipated that  all reprogramming  efforts  will  be completed  by  December  31,  1998, allowing  adequate time for testing.  Management  has  assessed  the Year  2000 compliance expense and believe that the related potential effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations should be immaterial. The Company is expensing all  costs associated with the Year 2000 as the costs are incurred.  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  The  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results  of  Operations contains certain forward-looking  statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,  as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  as amended,  which  are  intended to be covered  by  the  safe  harbors created  thereby. These statements include the plans and  objectives of  management for future operations, including plans and objectives relating  to  capital expenditures and rehabilitation costs  on  the apartment  communities.  Although  the  Company  believes  that  the assumptions   underlying   the   forward-looking   statements    are reasonable,  any  of  the  assumptions  could  be  inaccurate   and, therefore,  there  can  be  no assurance  that  the  forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will prove to be  accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent  in the  forward-looking statements included herein,  the  inclusion  of such  information should not be regarded as a representation by  the Company  or  any other person that the objectives and plans  of  the Company will be achieved.
