ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS            OF OPERATIONS.       THIS REPORT CONTAINS CERTAIN STATEMENTS OF A FORWARD-LOOKING NATURE RELATING TO FUTURE EVENTS OR THE FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY.  PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED THAT SUCH STATEMENTS ARE ONLY PREDICTIONS AND THAT ACTUAL EVENTS OR RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY.  IN EVALUATING SUCH STATEMENTS, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD SPECIFICALLY CONSIDER VARIOUS FACTORS IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING THE MATTERS SET FORTH BELOW UNDER THE CAPTION "RISK FACTORS," WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  GENERAL       Overland Data designs, develops, manufactures, markets and supports  magnetic tape data storage systems used by businesses for backup, archival  and data interchange functions. The Company's primary products are currently  based on three different half-inch magnetic tape technologies: (i) DLT, (ii) 18 & 36-track and (iii) 9-track.  In March 1996, the Company introduced the  LibraryXpress, a scaleable automated tape library system incorporating DLT  tape drives, and began shipping the LXB base module.  In the second half of  fiscal 1997, the Company introduced two additional modules: the LXG global  control unit and the LXC capacity module. In May 1997, the LXS MiniLibrary, a  single-drive, non-scalable version of the LibraryXpress, was introduced to  serve the lower end of the network market.  The Company's second product  line, TapeXpress, consists of 18 and 36-track products based on the IBM  3480/3490/3490E technologies. Its third product line, TapePro, consists of  9-track reel-to-reel tape drives which are used exclusively for data  interchange. The Company also distributes a line of DLT products manufactured  by Quantum and markets other items supplied by third parties including  controller cards, interchange software, storage management software, spare  parts and tape media.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following tables set forth certain data as a percentage of net sales:            STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS:                                           Fiscal Years Ended June 30,                                           ----------------------------                                             1997      1996      1995                                           -------   --------  --------           Net sales                        100.0%    100.0%    100.0%           Cost of goods sold                65.6      65.9      70.9                                           -------   --------  --------           Gross profit                      34.4      34.1      29.1                                           -------   --------  --------           Operating expenses:              Sales and marketing            12.3      12.6      12.8              Research and development        7.0       7.8       8.1              General and administrative      7.1       6.2       5.7                                           -------   --------  --------           Total Expenses                    26.4      26.6      26.6                                           -------   --------  --------           Income from operations             8.0       7.5       2.5           Interest and other, net             .4       (.3)      (.5)                                           -------   --------  --------           Income before income taxes         8.4       7.2       2.0           Provision for income taxes         3.2        .5        .7                                           -------   --------  --------           Net income                        5.2%       6.7%      1.3%                                           -------   --------  --------                                           -------   --------  --------                                          13         PRODUCT MIX TABLE:                                            Fiscal Years Ended June 30,                                           ----------------------------                                            1997       1996      1995                                           -------   --------  --------      Company products:        LibraryXpress                        28.6%      2.6%       .0%        36-track                             28.1      19.6       6.1        18-track                              9.7      15.3      20.3        9-track                              18.2      29.4      48.0        Spare parts, controllers, other       8.4      10.3       7.0       Other parts:        DLT distributed products              6.9      21.5      17.8        Other distributed products             .1       1.3        .8                                           -------   --------  --------      Total                                 100.0%    100.0%    100.0%                                           -------   --------  --------                                           -------   --------  --------  FISCAL 1997 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1996       NET SALES.  The Company's net sales of $59.1 million in fiscal year 1997 grew by $11.9 million or 25.2% over net sales of $47.2 million in fiscal year 1996.  Sales growth in certain of the Company's products were partially offset by declines in other product lines.  The strongest growth over the prior year was experienced in the LibraryXpress product line, which began shipping in March 1996.  Sales of LibraryXpress in fiscal year 1997, the first full year of shipments,  amounted to $16.9 million compared to $1.2 million in 1996.  Although the majority of the growth was generated by sales of the LibraryXpress LXB base module, additional sales were generated in the last half of the year when the Company introduced three new products: the LXG global control unit, the LXC capacity module and the LXS mini-library.  Offsetting this growth, however, was a $6.1 million decline in sales of DLT distributed product, due principally to a replacement of sales of Quantum DLT loaders by sales of the Company's own LibraryXpress products.  Sales of the Company's 36-track products of $16.6 million in fiscal year 1997 grew by $7.3 million or 78.5% from $9.3 million in 1996.  This growth resulted principally from increased sales to IBM of the L490E model pursuant to a new supply agreement entered into in the second quarter of fiscal year 1997.  Sales of 18-track products of $5.7 million fell by $1.5 million or 20.8% from $7.2 million in the prior year.  This decline was the result of an upward migration by the Company's customers from 18-track products to its 36-track products and to a general decline in the use of 18-track products in favor of other technologies.  Sales of 9-track products of $10.9 million in fiscal year 1997 fell by $3.5 million or 24.3% from $14.4 million in 1996.  This reflects the general maturity of the 9-track technology, a trend which the Company expects to continue in the foreseeable future.  Additionally, during fiscal year 1997, the Company made end-of-life announcements on certain of its 9-track products to narrow its 9-track product offerings.       GROSS PROFIT.  The Company's gross profit amounted to $20.4 million in fiscal year 1997, up from $16.1 million in fiscal year 1996, which represented gross margins of 34.4% and 34.1%, respectively.  The gross margins were improved by the shift from sales of DLT distributed product at lower margins, to sales of LibraryXpress products at relatively higher margins.  However, this was offset by growth in sales to the Company's OEM customers, which are typically at relatively lower margins than offered to its other customers.       SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES.  Sales and marketing expenses amounted to $7.3 million or 12.3% of net sales in fiscal year 1997 compared to $5.9 million or 12.6% of sales in 1996. This increase in total expenditures resulted from costs needed to support the higher sales level, including salaries and benefits, sales commissions, advertising and promotion and travel and related costs.       RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.  R&D expenses amounted to $4.1 million or 7.0% of net sales in fiscal year 1997 compared to $3.7 million or 7.8% of net sales in 1996. The R&D efforts during 1997 and the                                          14    increased expenses compared to 1996 related to the development of the LXG,  LXC and LXS products within the LibraryXpress product family.  The Company  also incurred expenses in both years related to the development of its new  tape recording technology and coding scheme using the concept of partial  response maximum likelihood.       GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  General and administrative expenses amounted to $4.2 million or 7.1% of net sales in fiscal year 1997 compared to $2.9 million or 6.2% of net sales in 1996. The higher level of expenses in 1997 included an increase in support personnel, computer related expenses, legal fees related to the class action lawsuits filed against the Company and to patent work related to the Company's new tape coding technique, increased bad debt reserves related to the higher level of sales and increased facility costs.       INTEREST INCOME/EXPENSE.  In fiscal year 1997, the Company generated net  interest income of $223,000, compared to fiscal year 1996 when net interest  expense amounted to $154,000.  The net interest income in 1997 resulted from  earnings on investment of funds generated by the Company's initial public  offering and elimination of interest expense after repayment of bank  borrowings. The interest expense in 1996 included $124,000 related to  borrowings under the Company's revolving bank line of credit and $30,000 of  interest expense related to an installment note which was repaid in full in  November 1995. Average borrowings under the Company's bank line of credit in  fiscal year 1996 amounted to $1.4 million.       INCOME TAXES.  The Company's fiscal year 1997 provision for state and  federal income taxes amounted to $1.9 million or an effective tax rate of  37.8%, which the Company believes to be representative of its normalized  effective tax rate.  In fiscal year 1996, the tax provision amounted to  $254,000, resulting in an abnormally low effective tax rate of 7.4%. The low  tax rate in 1996 was the result of the release of a deferred tax valuation  allowance of $997,000 in the fourth fiscal quarter which is discussed below  and in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  FISCAL 1996 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1995       NET SALES.  The Company's net sales of $47.2 million in fiscal year 1996  grew by $9.0 million or 23.6% over net sales of $38.2 million in fiscal year  1995. This sales growth was driven by new product introductions which more  than offset declines in both 18-track and 9-track sales. In particular, the  first shipments of the LXB, the base unit product in the Company's new  LibraryXpress product line, were made in March 1996. Shipments of the LXB  during the last four months of fiscal year 1996 generated $1.2 million in  sales. An additional $3.4 million in fiscal year 1996 growth was generated  from a 50.0% increase in sales of DLT distributed products, including the DLT  4500/4700 loaders which were introduced during the year by Quantum. The  largest portion of sales growth, $7.0 million, was reported in the Company's  36-track products, with fiscal year 1996 sales of $9.3 million growing to  four times its fiscal year 1995 level of $2.3 million. This growth was the  result of (i) strong sales of the inaugural 36-track product, the L490E,  which was introduced midway through fiscal year 1995, and (ii) two new  36-track product introductions, the 60-cartridge L60E, which began shipping  in November 1995, and the single cartridge T490E, which began shipping in  March 1996. In the 18-track product line, sales declined by 6.8% in fiscal  year 1996, reflecting the market's general migration to 36-track products.  Sales of 9-track products of $14.4 million in fiscal year 1996 declined by  $4.2 million or 22.6% from $18.6 million in fiscal year 1995, reflecting the  general maturity of the 9-track technology. Finally, fiscal year 1996 sales  of controllers, spare parts, software and other products amounted to $4.9  million, an increase of 81.5% over the fiscal year 1995 level of $2.7  million. This growth was attributable to increased sales of spare parts and  tape media, mainly DLT tape.       GROSS PROFIT.  The Company's gross profit amounted to $16.1 million in  fiscal year 1996, up from $11.1 million in fiscal year 1995, which  represented gross margins of 34.1% and 29.1%, respectively. The increased  profitability resulted from higher margins on newly introduced products, and  improved margins on DLT distributed product because more product was sold  through the VAR and European channels compared to a concentration in the  distributor channel in the prior year. In addition, gross margins in fiscal  year 1996 were significantly improved on 18-track products as material cost  savings were realized from an investment in re-engineering certain electrical  components.                                         15         SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES.  Sales and marketing expenses amounted to  $5.9 million or 12.6% of net sales in fiscal year 1996 compared to $4.9  million or 12.8% of sales in 1995. This increase in total expenditures  resulted from costs needed to support the higher sales level, including  salaries and benefits, sales commissions, advertising and promotion and  travel and related costs. In addition, higher costs were incurred for  prototype units, advertising and promotions related to new product  introductions.       RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.  R&D expenses amounted to $3.7  million or 7.8% of net sales in fiscal year 1996 compared to $3.1 million or  8.1% of net sales in 1995. The increased expenses related to the development  of the Company's two new 36-track products, the T490E and the L60E, and to a  greater extent, the development of the new LibraryXpress products. The  development of the two 36-track products required a lower level of expense  than the LibraryXpress products because they were derivative products using  common electrical components and robotics. The Company also incurred expenses  in fiscal year 1996 related to the development of a new tape recording  technology and coding scheme using the partial response maximum likelihood  concept.       GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  General and administrative  expenses amounted to $2.9 million or 6.2% of net sales in fiscal year 1996  compared to $2.2 million or 5.7% of net sales in 1995. The higher level of  expenses in 1996 included legal fees related to the filing of a number of  patent applications, increased bad debt reserves related to the higher level  of sales and increased facility costs and computer related expenses.       INTEREST EXPENSE.  Net interest expense amounted to $154,000 in fiscal  year 1996 and included $124,000 of interest expense related to borrowings  under the Company's revolving bank line of credit and $30,000 of interest  expense related to the final installment of a note which was repaid in full  in November 1995. Average borrowings under the Company's bank line of credit  in fiscal year 1996 amounted to $1.4 million. In fiscal year 1995, net  interest expense amounted to $204,000 consisting of $214,000 of interest  expense and $10,000 of interest income. The portion of the interest expense  relating to the installment note amounted to $145,000 and the remaining  $69,000 of interest expense related to borrowings under the Company's  revolving bank line of credit, which borrowings averaged $725,000 in fiscal  year 1995.       INCOME TAXES.  The Company's fiscal year 1996 provision for state and  federal income taxes amounted to $254,000 or an effective tax rate of 7.4%.  In fiscal year 1995, the tax provision amounted to $269,000 resulting in a  more normalized effective tax rate of 35%. The low tax rate in 1996 was the  result of the release of a deferred tax valuation allowance of $997,000 in  the fourth fiscal quarter. As discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated  Financial Statements, in prior years the Company established the reserve in  accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires  that a valuation allowance be recorded "when it is more likely than not" that  any portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The reserve had  been established to reduce the net deferred tax asset to a minimal amount,  because of the Company's past history of operating losses and marginal  profitability and due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasts of future  events and operating results. However, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  1996, due to the significant profitability in that quarter and based on  management's expectations of future results, the Company determined that it  was more likely than not that deferred tax assets would be realized through  future taxable earnings or alternative tax strategies. As a result, the  valuation allowance was reduced to zero in that quarter.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       During fiscal year 1997, the Company used $3.4 million to fund its  operating activities, primarily to build receivables and inventories in  support of the higher sales levels.  An additional $2.3 million was invested  in capital expenditures, primarily for the Company's new enterprise wide  computer system, leasehold improvements and tooling.  The Company raised  $25.8 million in February 1997 in its initial public offering, of which $1.5  million was used to repay outstanding bank indebtedness.       At June 30, 1997, the Company had $18.9 million of cash and cash  equivalents, $36.7 million of net working capital, an unused bank line of  credit of $5 million and no other funded debt.  The Company believes that  these resources will be sufficient to fund its operations and to provide for  its growth for the foreseeable future.                                         16    INFLATION       Inflation has not had a significant negative impact on the Company's  operations during the periods presented.  With the exception of its OEM  contracts, which contain fixed pricing for up to one year, the Company has  historically been able to pass on to its customers increases in raw material  prices caused by inflation. There can be no assurance, however, that the  Company will be able to continue to pass on any future increases should they  occur. Although the Company's exposure to the effects of inflation will be  magnified by the expected increase in OEM business, the Company believes that  its continuous efforts at material and labor cost reductions will minimize  such effects.  SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA       The following table presents selected quarterly financial information  for the periods indicated. This information has been derived from unaudited  consolidated financial statements which, in the opinion of management,  include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments)  necessary for a fair presentation of such information. These operating  results are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period.
