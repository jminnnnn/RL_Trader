ITEM 7.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Resultsof Operations.     Thediscussion in this section contains certain statements of aforward-looking nature relating to future events or our future performance. Wordssuch as expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimatesand similar expressions or variations of such words are intended to identifyforward-looking statements, but are not the only means of identifyingforward-looking statements. Such statements are only predictions and actualevents or results may differ materially. In evaluating such statements, youshould specifically consider various factors identified in this Report,including the matters set forth under the caption Risk Factors, which couldcause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by suchforward-looking statements.     Overview     Infiscal 2005, revenue decreased by 1.0%, net income by 56.9% and diluted earningsper share by 56.8%. Our performance reflects a 9.5% decrease in revenue fromour OEM customers partially offset by a 17.3% growth in revenue from ourbranded channel customers. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 54.3%of total net revenue in fiscal 2005 compared to 58.8% in fiscal 2004. Our grossprofit margin decreased from 27.1% in fiscal 2004 to 25.8% in fiscal 2005. Thedecline in gross profit included $2.1 million of transition costs related tothe outsourcing of our manufacturing process. While we experienced a decline inrevenue and gross profit, operating expenses grew by 17.0%. The spending increasewas in (i) sales and marketing expenses, reflecting an increase inheadcount primarily to support the growth in our branded channel, (ii) researchand development which included continued investment in REO TM  developmentand (iii) general and administrative expenses as a result of increasedcosts associated with compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-OxleyAct of 2002.     We ended the year with approximately $76.9 million incash, cash equivalents and short-term investments compared to $69.7 million infiscal 2004. At the end of fiscal years 2005 and 2004 we had no debtoutstanding on our credit facility. During fiscal 2005 we generated cash fromoperations of $8.2 million and generated $2.6 million from the exercise ofstock options and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP);offset by capital expenditures of approximately $3.4 million.     15            Our strategy is to become a market leader and innovativesupplier of a complete portfolio of tiered data storage solutions by providingintelligent appliances and software modules designed to work together to ensurethat information is automatically safe, readily available and always there.  We intend to deliver products to address allthree tiers of data storage:  primary protecteddisk, secondary disk-based backup and tertiary automated tape libraries forarchival.  Our focus will continue to beon mid-range solutions that can be easily sold worldwide through our indirectnetwork of resellers.  We intend toleverage our leadership position in mid-range tape automation into a similarposition in primary and secondary intelligent disk-based appliances.     In September 2004, in order to enhance ourstrategic competitiveness and increase our flexibility, we announced a plan tooutsource all of our manufacturing, currently located in California, to a U.S.third party manufacturer. In November 2004, the contract with theoutsource manufacturer was finalized and all employees were notified oftermination dates and benefits. We completed the transfer all of ourmanufacturing operations in August 2005. We expect to incur between $2.5million and $3.0 million of pretax charges for outsourcing severance costs andother obligations. We recorded $2.1 million of these charges in fiscal 2005 asa cost of revenue, and expect up to an additional $900,000 in charges in the firstquarter of fiscal 2006. The charges in fiscal 2005 include an expense of $1.5million representing one-time termination benefits and $523,000 of othertransition costs which were recorded as incurred.     In August 2005,Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) informed us of its decision not to purchase itsnext-generation, mid-range tape automation production line from Overland. HPwill continue to purchase the tape automation products currently supplied by usfor some time; however, the new product will eventually replace the majority ofthose purchases. We cannot predict how quickly this transition will occur, but webelieve the impact to our revenue during fiscal 2006 will be minimal. Theimpact to our revenues in fiscal 2007 is expected to be significant. In lightof this anticipated loss in future revenue, we intend to focus heavily on thedelivery of new higher-margin products to our branded channel during fiscal2006. Our current three-year contract with HP expires in July 2006. Thecontract does not commit HP to buy specific quantities of product at any time.     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates     Our discussion and analysis of our financial conditionand results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generallyaccepted in the United States of America. The preparation of consolidatedfinancial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affectthe reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and relateddisclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate ourestimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts,inventories, income taxes, warranty obligations and contingencies. We base ourestimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that webelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form thebasis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilitiesthat are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differfrom these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.     We believe the following accounting policies affect ourmore significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of ourconsolidated financial statements.     Revenue Recognition     Revenueon direct product sales (excluding sales to distributors and certain OEMcustomers) is recognized upon shipment of products to such customers. Thesecustomers are not entitled to any specific right of return or price protection,except for any defective product that may be returned under our warranty policy.Title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when the product leaves ourdock. Product sales to distribution customers are subject to certain rights ofreturn, stock rotation privileges and price protection. Because we are unableto estimate our exposure for returned product or price adjustments, revenuefrom shipments to these customers is not recognized until the related productsare in turn sold to the ultimate customer by the distributor. As part of ourexisting agreements with certain OEM customers, we ship products to variousdistribution hubs around the world and retain ownership of that inventory untilit is pulled by these OEM customers to fulfill their customer orders, at whichtime, generally the same business day, the Overland sale is recorded.     16            We have entered into various licensing agreements relatingto our Variable Rate Randomizer (VR 2 )technology. These agreements typically call for royalty fees based on sales bylicensees of products containing VR 2 . Royaltieson sales by licensees of products containing VR 2  are recorded when earned, generally in theperiod during which the licensee ships the products containing VR 2   technology. In certain instances, thecustomer has elected to purchase, from us, the Applications Specific IntegratedCircuit (ASIC) chips embodying VR 2 , which arepriced to include the cost of the chip plus an embedded royalty fee. In theseinstances, revenue on ASIC chip sales are recorded as product revenue whenearned, which is upon the shipment of the underlying ASIC chip incorporatingthe VR 2   technology to the customer.     Allowance for Doubtful Accounts     Weestimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of thecollectibility of specific accounts and the overall condition of the accountsreceivable portfolio. When evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtfulaccounts, we analyze specific trade and other receivables, historical baddebts, customer credits, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness,current economic trends and changes in customers payment terms and/orpatterns. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate,resulting in an impairment of their ability to make additional payments, thenwe may need to make additional allowances. Likewise, if we determine that wecould realize more of our receivables in the future than previously estimated,we would adjust the allowance to increase income in the period we made thisdetermination. We review the allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterlybasis and record adjustments as deemed necessary.     Inventory Valuation     We record inventories at the lower of cost or marketvalue. We assess the value of our inventories periodically based upon numerousfactors including expected product or material demand, current marketconditions, technological obsolescence, current cost and net realizable value.If necessary, we adjust our inventory for obsolete or unmarketable inventoryequal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimatedmarket value. Likewise, we record an adverse purchase commitment liability whenanticipated market sales prices are lower than committed costs. If actualmarket conditions are less favorable than what we projected, we may need torecord additional inventory adjustments and adverse purchase commitments.     Income Taxes     We estimate our tax liabilitybased on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which we operate.These estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilitiesresulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognizedfor financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes,as well as about the realization of deferred tax assets. If we cannot realizecertain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably, we couldexperience potential significant losses in excess of provisions established.Likewise, if we can realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax lawschange favorably, we could experience potential significant gains.     17            Warranty Obligations     We generally provide a three-year advance replacementreturn-to-factory warranty on our NEO SERIES, PowerLoader and LoaderXpressproducts and a one year advance replacement return-to-factory warranty on ourREO SERIES. We also provide on-site service for the first warranty year of theNEO SERIES products for which we contract with third-party service providers. Formost products, we offer a program called XchangeNOW as part of ourreturn-to-factory warranty which enables customers to receive an advance replacementunit shipped within two business days after placing a service request. Thecustomer ships the defective unit back to us using the shipping materials fromthe replacement unit. We record a provision for estimated future warranty costsat the time of shipment for both the return-to-factory and on-site warranties.Separately priced on-site warranties are offered for sale to customers of otherproduct lines. We contract with outside vendors to provide service relating toall on-site warranties. Warranty revenue and amounts paid in advance to outsideservice organizations are recognized in the financial statements in revenue andcost of revenue, respectively, over the warranty period.     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets     We also consider potential impairment of both tangibleand intangible long-lived assets when circumstances indicate that the carryingamount of an asset may not be recoverable. In such circumstances, we may incurmaterial charges relating to the impairment of such asset. We would measure anyrequired impairment loss as the amount by which the assets carrying valueexceeds its fair value and we would record it as a reduction in the carryingvalue of the related assets and charge it to results of operations.     Results of Operations     Thefollowing tables set forth certain financial data as a percentage of net revenue:                  Fiscal Year                     2005         2004         2003                                                     Net revenue         100.0    %    100.0    %    100.0    %      Cost of revenue         74.2         72.9         72.4           Gross profit         25.8         27.1         27.6           Operating expenses:                                         Sales and marketing         14.6         13.0         13.6           Research and development         4.5         3.0         3.8           General and administrative         5.2         4.6         4.9                     24.3         20.6         22.3           Income from operations         1.5         6.5         5.3           Other income (expense), net         0.7         0.3         (0.1    )      Income before income taxes         2.2         6.8         5.2           Provision for income taxes         0.3         2.3         1.8           Net income         1.9         4.5         3.4             FiscalYear 2005 Compared to Fiscal Year 2004     Net Revenue.  Net revenue decreased from $238.1million in fiscal 2004 to $235.7 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease of $2.4million or 1.0% is primarily due to a 9.5% decrease in revenue from OEMcustomers, as a group. This decrease is primarily a result in declining salesto HP attributed to the decrease of NEO2000 products and spare parts. Net revenuefrom HP represented approximately 54.3% of net revenue in fiscal 2005 comparedto approximately 58.8% in fiscal 2004.     Net revenuefrom Overland branded products increased from $79.4 million in fiscal 2004 to$93.2 million in fiscal 2005. The increase of $13.8 million or 17.3% wasprimarily the result of an increase in sales of REO disk-based products and a $4.0million increase in revenue from Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) relatedto shipments under a large contract with a European governmental agency. Fiscal2004 product sales represent less than an entire year of REO sales as we beganshipping the first REO product in August 2003. In addition, in October 2004,we introduced a new REO product which resulted in sales of approximately $7.1 millionfor fiscal 2005.     18            Inaddition, VR 2  revenue in fiscal 2005 decreased from $3.8million in fiscal 2004 to $2.2 million in fiscal 2005. This decrease of $1.6million or 42% was the result of declining chip sales. In fiscal 2005,royalties represented $1.9 million of VR 2  revenue compared to $1.7 million in fiscal2004. During fiscal 2005 chip sales decreased to $240,000 from $2.0 million infiscal 2004.     We project that revenue will grow in fiscal 2006 byapproximately 6% over fiscal 2005. This projection includes 40% growth in ourbranded business, driven largely by sales of new products including our newprotected primary storage offering and new scalable REO products we plan tointroduce in the second quarter of fiscal 2006, and our new tape automationproducts beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. We estimate that thisgrowth in branded revenue will be partially offset by a 16% decline in sales toOEM customers, primarily HP.     A summary of the sales mix by product for the periodspresented in the statement of operations follows:                  Fiscal Year                     2005         2004         2003           LibraryXpress products:                                         NEO Series         68.0    %    68.8    %    66.1    %      Loaders         8.9         10.3         15.3                     76.9         79.1         81.4           Spare parts, drives, other         17.9         18.6         16.8           Disk based         4.2         0.7         0.0           VR 2         1.0         1.6         1.8                     100.0    %    100.0    %    100.0    %        Gross Profit.  Gross profit decreased from $64.7million in fiscal 2004 to $60.9 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease of approximately$3.8 million or 5.8% is primarily due to an overall decrease in our net revenueof $2.4 million, as described above, and an increase of $2.1 million in cost ofrevenue associated with the outsourcing of our manufacturing activities. In addition,during fiscal 2005 warranty costs increased by $2.6 million as a result of moreproducts under warranty compared to the prior year. These cost increases werepartially offset by favorable product mix within our branded channel and alarger concentration of higher margin sales of branded products versus lowermargin OEM products.     Excludingthe impact of outsourcing charges in fiscal 2005 and amortization in fiscal2006 of acquisition costs associated with the Zetta acquisition, we expect ourgross margin percentage in fiscal 2006 to be relatively unchanged from fiscal2005. Although sales of branded products are expected to represent a higherpercentage of total revenue in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, we expectthat the gross margin percentage on our new products will initially be lowerthan our existing products, which is consistent with our past experience. Infiscal 2007 we will focus on cost reductions, which we expect will result in grossmargin improvements.     Sales and Marketing Expenses.  Sales and marketingexpenses increased to $34.4 million in fiscal 2005 from $30.8 million in fiscal2004. The increase of approximately $3.6 million or 11.5% is primarily associatedwith an expansion of our branded sales force. We expect that sales and marketingexpenses in fiscal 2006 will grow 15% to 20% over fiscal 2005 representingincremental spending to introduce and promote our new products introduced duringthe year, and to increase our sales and technical support services.     Research and Development Expenses.  Research anddevelopment expenses increased to $10.7 million in fiscal 2005 from $7.3million in fiscal 2004. The increase of approximately $3.4 million or 47.2% isprimarily due to an increase of approximately $1.4 million associated with anincrease in headcount for further development of REO and other new products,and a related increase in development costs of approximately $1.2 million. Weanticipate heavy R&D spending in fiscal 2006 for completion of thedevelopment of our new tape library platform, the new scalable REO products, andthe new protected primary storage offerings. We also expect heavy research anddevelopment spending related to the integration of the development team fromthe August 2005 acquisition of Zetta Systems. R&D spending for fiscal2006 is expected to grow by approximately 65% over fiscal 2005.     19            General and Administrative Expenses . General andadministrative expenses increased to $12.3 million in fiscal 2005 from $10.9million in fiscal 2004. The increase of approximately $1.4 million or 12.6% isprimarily due to a $1.3 million increase in consulting and auditing feesassociated with compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of2002, and an increase of approximately $555,000 associated with an increase in generaloperating activities during fiscal 2005. These increases were offset by a$639,000 decrease in legal fees in fiscal 2005, which primarily resulted fromthe settlement of the Raytheon patent infringement lawsuit in April 2004.We anticipate that general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 will berelatively flat compared to the spending in fiscal 2005.     Interest Income, net . Interest income increasedto $1.5 million in fiscal 2005 from $533,000 in fiscal 2004. The increase ofapproximately $1.0 million or 181.4% is due to higher average cash balancescombined with higher average yields when compared to fiscal 2004.     Provision for Income Taxes.  Provision for incometaxes decreased from $5.6 million in fiscal 2004 to $490,000 in fiscal 2005.The decrease of approximately $5.1 million or 91.2% is primarily the result of the decrease in fiscal 2005 earnings compared to fiscal 2004 and changesin prior year estimates due to the favorable settlement of IRS audits and statuteexpirations. Due to the expected taxable loss in fiscal 2006, weexpect to receive a benefit at the statutory rate. In addition, we expect abenefit comparable to fiscal 2005 related to the research and development taxcredit, and a reduced Extraterritorial Income Benefit (ETI), compared to fiscal2005, as a result of the phase out of the ETI exclusion.     FiscalYear 2004 Compared to Fiscal Year 2003     Net Revenue .  Netrevenue of $238.1 million in fiscal year 2004 was $42.2 million or21.6% above net revenue of $195.9 million in fiscal 2003. This revenuegrowth was driven by increased unit sales and generally reflected the continuedstrong performance of our NEO SERIES line of tape library products. Saleswithin our library product lines (NEO, LibraryXpress®, LibraryPro®, Loaders andPowerLoaders) grew 18.9% to $189.8 million, compared to$159.6 million in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2004 sales to OEM customers were up22.5 % compared to fiscal 2003. The increase in revenue from our OEM customerswas driven largely by depressed quarters in the first part of fiscal 2003 dueto the uncertainty surrounding the HP/Compaq merger. While post mergerquarterly revenue steadily grew to a peak in the second quarter of fiscal 2004,revenue from HP declined slightly from this peak in the second half of the year.Sales to HP accounted for 58.8% of total net revenue in fiscal 2004, comparedto 58.4% in fiscal 2003.     Net revenue from Overland branded products during fiscal2004 grew 20.5% over fiscal 2003 from $65.9 million to $79.4 million. Thisincrease reflected our increased focus on the Overland branded channel over thepast two years. Sales of Overland branded library products increased 16.7% overfiscal 2003, driven primarily by NEO SERIES library revenue with the largestincrease coming from our domestic customers. Also contributing to the increasein branded channel results was revenue of $1.7 million generated from ourdisk-based REO products. Partially offsetting these increases was a 3.0%decrease in revenue from loader products.     Net revenue from spare parts of$27.7 million in fiscal 2004 were $7.1 million or 34.4% above net revenueof $20.6 million in fiscal 2003. This increase was driven primarily by ourOEM customers.     VR 2  revenue during fiscal 2003 amounted to$3.8 million and was comprised of chip sales of $2.0 million, engineeringservice fees of $50,000 and royalties of $1.7 million. VR 2  revenueduring fiscal 2003 amounted to $3.5 million and was comprised of chip sales of$785,000, engineering service fees of $775,000 and royalties of $1.9 million.     Gross Profit . Gross profit amounted to $64.7million in fiscal 2004, an increase of $10.7 million or 19.7% from $54.0million in fiscal 2003, resulting from a combination of higher sales volumes somewhatoffset by slightly lower gross margins. The gross margin percentage decreased slightlyto 27.1% in fiscal 2004, down from 27.6% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in grossmargin percentage was due primarily to $1.8 million of amortization related tothe Okapi technology asset. We also experienced higher warranty costs during fiscal2004 as our domestic warranty policy, which includes one year of on-sitewarranty with the purchase of many of our products, was extended to ourEuropean customers. Although product mix and channel mix had little effect onthe gross margin percentage when compared to the prior year, the increasedcosts discussed above were partially offset as material cost reductionsoutpaced average selling price degradation during fiscal 2004 and our pool ofrelatively fixed overhead costs was spread across a larger revenue base.     Sales and Marketing Expenses . Sales and marketingexpenses amounted to $30.9 million, representing 13.0% of net revenue in fiscal2004, compared to $26.7 million or 13.6% of net revenue in fiscal 2003. Theincreased expenditures resulted primarily from salary and related expensesassociated with the expansion of our Overland branded sales force, increasedspending associated with lead generation activities and increased marketdevelopment funding related to our OEM customers. Also contributing to theincrease were incremental expenses associated with promoting awareness aroundour disk-based products launched in early fiscal 2004.     20            Research and Development Expenses.  R&Dexpenses amounted to $7.3 million or 3.0% of net revenue in fiscal 2004,compared to $7.4 million or 3.8% of net revenue in fiscal 2003. This decrease in absolute dollars was dueto the elimination of expenses for our wound down Longmont operations combinedwith the restructure of our advanced research group during the fourth quarterof fiscal 2003. Also, the fiscal 2003 period included an adjustment to theaccrued restructuring charges for the Longmont facility that did not repeat in fiscal2004. Offsetting these decreases were increased salaries and related costsassociated with our disk-based development team and increased developmentexpenses associated with our NEO8000 and future tape based products.     General and Administrative Expenses . General andadministrative expenses amounted to $10.9 million or 4.6% of net revenue in fiscal2004, compared to $9.6 million or 4.9% of net revenue in fiscal 2003. Thisincrease was due primarily to incremental legal fees associated with theRaytheon lawsuit, which was settled in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Alsocontributing to the increase were consulting fees associated with compliancewith Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and corporate strategydevelopment.     Interest Income . In fiscal 2004, we generatedinterest income of $601,000, compared to interest income of $427,000 in fiscal2003. The increase was due to higher average cash balances.     Interest Expense . In fiscal 2004, we incurredinterest expense of $68,000, compared to interest expense of $212,000 in fiscal2003. This decrease of interest expense was due to the repayment of alloutstanding balances on our long-term debt arrangement in the second quarter offiscal 2004.     Other Expense/Income . In fiscal 2004, wegenerated net other income of $68,000, compared to net other expense of$332,000 in fiscal 2003. These amounts primarily related to foreign currencytransaction fluctuations related to our United Kingdom operations.     Provision for Income Taxes . Our fiscal 2004provision for state federal and foreign income taxes amounted to$5.6 million. This equated to an effective tax rate of 34.4% in fiscal2004, flat when compared to fiscal 2003.     Liquidityand Capital Resources     At the end of fiscal 2005, we had $76.9 million ofcash, cash equivalents and short-term investments compared to $69.7 million at theend of fiscal 2004. In addition, we had $10.0 million available on our unusedbank line of credit. We believe these resources will be sufficient to fund ouroperations and to provide for our growth the next twelve months and into theforeseeable future. We have no other unused sources of liquidity at this time.     Our primary source of liquidity has historically beencash generated from operations. During fiscals 2005, 2004 and 2003, wegenerated $8.2 million, $14.6 million and $9.0 million, respectively, fromoperations. In addition to cash generated from operations in fiscal 2003, weraised an aggregate of $20.6 million in net proceeds through the sale of ourcommon stock.  The decrease of $6.4 million in cash provided by operatingactivities compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of a decrease innet income and an increase in accounts receivable of $4.0 million. The growthin operating cash flow in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 resulted fromsignificantly improved profitability, a decrease in inventories resulting frombetter supply chain and buffer inventory management, as well as a larger taxbenefit from an increased volume of stock option exercises. Offsetting this wasthe use of operating cash to fund an increase in income taxes receivable andprepaid third-party warranty contracts and a decrease in accounts payable. Theincrease of income taxes receivable was primarily a result of the tax benefitreceived from the exercise of stock options. The increase in prepaidthird-party warranty contracts is a result of an increased focus on the sale ofwarranty upgrades and renewals. In fiscal 2003, operating cash flows wereprovided by increases in accounts payable and income taxes payable, net income,depreciation and amortization and tax benefits from the exercise of stockoptions. In fiscal 2003, operating cash was used to fund an increase inaccounts receivable and inventories. These increases in accounts receivable,inventory and accounts payable were related to increases in sales, primarily toHP.     Cashused in investing activities was $18.0 million in fiscal 2005, $59.2 millionfor fiscal 2004 and $3.7 million for fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2005, wepurchased short-term investments of approximately $114.2 million and receivedproceeds of approximately $99.6 million for the maturity and sale of similarinvestments. During fiscal 2004 we purchased $132.7 million of marketable debtsecurities and received proceeds of $75.6 million from the maturity ofmarketable debt securities.     21            Capital expendituresduring fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 were approximately $3.4 million, $2.1million and $1.4 million, respectively, and were comprised primarily of purchasesof computers and related equipment. During fiscal 2003, we invested cash of $2.4million, in addition to issuing 134,551 shares of Overland common stock, toacquire the Okapi assets.     Cashprovided by financing activities was $2.6 million for fiscal 2005, $2.3 millionfor fiscal 2004, and $22.7 million for fiscal 2003. Cash provided by financingactivities was due to $2.9 million in proceeds from the issuance of commonstock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) and upon exercise of stockoptions; offset by $309,000 used to repurchase shares of our common stock onthe open market under our share repurchase authorization plan. Proceeds fromthe issuance of common stock under our ESPP and the exercise of stock optionswere $6.3 million and $2.8 million in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively.During fiscal 2003 we received proceeds of $20.6 million from the issuance ofcommon stock sold in a private placement. During fiscal 2003, principalpayments of $698,000 were made towards the term note and in fiscal 2004 theoutstanding balance of $4.0 million was paid in full.     We have  a credit facilityconsisting of a $10.0 million revolving line of credit for working capitalpurposes that expires on November 30, 2006. The line of credit iscollateralized by a general security interest in our assets. Interest on theline of credit is set at the banks prime rate (6.50% on September 12, 2005)in effect from time to time minus 0.25% or, at our option, a rate equal toLIBOR plus 2.25%. The loan agreementgoverning the credit facility requires us to comply with several financial andnon-financial covenants. At the end of fiscal 2005, we were in compliance withall covenants under the facility. A violation of one or more of these covenantswould constitute a default under the credit facility, which would enable thelender, at its option without notice, to accelerate all then outstandingindebtedness under the credit facility and/or terminate the lenders obligationto extend credit under the credit facility. Under the terms of thecredit facility, we have a financial covenant that states we cannot incur aloss for two consecutive quarters. We recorded a loss during the fourth quarterof fiscal 2005. If we record a loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, wewould be in default under the terms of the credit facility, absent a waiver ofsuch covenant. At the end of fiscal 2005, no amounts were outstanding under thecredit facility.     On August 11, 2004, our board of directorsauthorized the purchase of up to $10.0 million of our common stock on the openmarket or through negotiated transactions. This repurchase authority allows us toselectively repurchase our common stock from time to time in the open market orin privately negotiated transactions depending on market price and otherfactors. The share repurchase authorization has no stated expiration date. During fiscal 2005,an aggregate of 32,500 shares were repurchased at a total cost of $309,000.     In August 2005, we used $9.0 million of cash forthe purchase of Zetta Systems, Inc.     Off-BalanceSheet Arrangements     We have no off-balance sheet arrangements orsignificant guarantees to third parties not fully recorded in our BalanceSheets or fully disclosed in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.     ContractualObligations     The following schedule summarizesour contractual obligations to make future payments (in thousands) :        Contractual Obligations         Total         Less than   1 year         1-3 years         3-5 years         After 5   years           Operating lease obligations         $    30,730         $    3,251         $    6,471         $    6,728         $    14,280           Purchase obligations         24,552         24,552                                      Total contractual obligations         $    55,282         $    27,803         $    6,471         $    6,728         $    14,280                                   22            Inflation     Inflationhas not had a significant impact on our operations during the periods presented.Historically we have been able to pass on to our customers increases in rawmaterial prices caused by inflation. If at any time we cannot pass on suchincreases, our margins could suffer. Our exposure to the effects of inflation couldbe magnified by the concentration of OEM business.     RecentlyIssued Accounting Pronouncements     SeeNote 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements.     ITEM 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk     Market risk representsthe risk of loss that may impact our financial position, results of operationsor cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market pricesand rates. We are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in UnitedStates interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates asmeasured against the U.S. dollar. These exposures are directly related to ournormal operating and funding activities. Historically, we have not usedderivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities.     InterestRate Risk.  Allof our fixed income investments are classified as available-for-sale andtherefore reported on the balance sheet at market value. Changes in the overalllevel of interest rates affect our interest income that is generated from ourinvestments. For fiscal 2005, total interest income was $1.6 million withinvestments yielding an annual average of 2.2% on a worldwide basis. Theinterest rate level was up approximately 120 basis points from 1.0% in fiscal2004. If a comparable decline in overall interest rates (120 basis points) wereto occur in fiscal 2006, our interest income would decline approximately $923,000,assuming consistent investment levels.     The table below presentsthe cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances and related weighted-averageinterest rates at the end of fiscal 2005. The cash, cash equivalents and short-terminvestment balances approximate fair value(in thousands):                  Approximate   Market Value         Weighted-Average   Interest Rate           Cash and cash equivalents         $    5,498         2.4    %      Short-term investments:                               Less than 1 year         2,937         2.1    %      Due in 1  2 years         749         6.3    %      Due in 2-5 years         1,931         4.1    %      Due after 5 years         65,772         3.2    %                $    76,887         3.1    %        The table above includesthe United States dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and short-terminvestments, including $117,000, and $903,000 equivalents denominated in theBritish Pound Sterling and the Euro, respectively.     ForeignCurrency Risk.  Weconduct business on a global basis and essentially all of our products sold ininternational markets are denominated in U.S. dollars. Historically, exportsales have represented a significant portion of our sales and are expected tocontinue to represent a significant portion of sales.     Our wholly-ownedsubsidiaries in the United Kingdom, France and Germany incur costs and maintaininter-company balances which are denominated in local currencies. As exchangerates vary, these results when translated into U.S. dollars may vary fromexpectations and adversely impact overall expected results. The effect ofexchange rate fluctuations on our results during fiscal 2005 was not material.     ITEM 8.   Financial Statements and
