ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.            SIZE=2> This Report contains certain statements of a forward-looking nature relating to future events or the future performance of the Company. Prospective investors are cautioned that such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. In evaluating such statements, prospective investors should specifically consider various factors identified in this Report, including the matters set forth under the caption "Risk Factors," which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates             Overland's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, income taxes, warranty obligations and contingencies. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.             The Company believes the following accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.    17          Revenue Recognition             Revenue on direct product sales (excluding sales to commercial distributors and HP) is recognized upon shipment of products to such customers. These customers are not subject to any specific right of return or price protection, except for any defective product which may be returned under the Company's warranty policy. Title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when the product leaves the Company's dock. Product sales to commercial distribution customers are subject to certain rights of return, stock rotation privileges and price protection. Revenue from shipments to these customers is not recognized until the related products are in turn sold to the ultimate customer by the commercial distributor. At June 30, 2002, approximately $885,000 of product had been shipped to the Company's commercial distributors, but not yet shipped to ultimate customers. As part of its existing agreement with Compaq/HP, the Company ships products to various distribution hubs around the world and retains ownership of that inventory until it is pulled by HP to fulfill its customer orders, at which time, generally the same business day, the Overland sale is recorded.            The Company has entered into various licensing agreements relating to its VR 2  technology. These agreements typically call for royalty fees based on sales by licensees of products containing VR 2 . Royalties on sales by licensees of products containing VR 2  are recorded when earned, generally in the period during which the licensee ships the products containing VR 2  technology. In certain instances, the customer has elected to purchase from the Company the ASIC chips embodying VR 2 , which are priced to include the cost of the chip plus an embedded royalty fee. In these instances, revenues on ASIC chip sales are recorded as product revenue when earned, which is upon the shipment of the underlying ASIC chip incorporating the VR 2  technology to the customer.            In some cases, these licensing agreements include initial payments to the Company for the delivery of the VR 2  technology platform, consulting services or both. The Company recognizes revenues related to the transfer of the technology platform upon delivery and acceptance by the customer, which entitles the Company to the initial fee and eliminates any further obligations under the agreement. The Company recognizes revenue related to consulting services as earned, typically based on time committed to the project.             The Company recognizes software revenues in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) Statement of Position 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition" ("SOP 97-2"), as amended by SOP 98-9, "Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions" ("SOP 98-9"). The Company licenses software under noncancelable perpetual agreements. License revenues are recognized in the period in which the license agreement is in place, the fee is fixed and determinable, delivery of the technology has occurred and collectibility is probable. Sales through the Company's resellers are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders digitally/electronically placed on the Company's business to business ordering system. The license is considered delivered, and the license revenue is recognized, when the reseller is issued a license key in the name of a specifically identified end user.            For software arrangements that include multiple elements, SOP 97-2 requires the Company to allocate the fee to the individual elements based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ("VSOE"), regardless of the prices stated within the contract. VSOE is limited to the price charged when the element is sold separately or, for an element that is not yet sold separately, the price established by management having the relevant authority. When there is VSOE for the undelivered elements in multiple-element arrangements that are not accounted for using contract accounting, the Company allocates revenue to the delivered elements of the arrangement using the residual value method. Therefore, the Company defers revenues from the arrangement fee equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements. The    18           fair value of maintenance and postcontract customer support ("PCS") obligations are based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts.             When VSOE does not exist to allocate revenue to each of the various elements of an arrangement and revenue cannot be allocated using the residual value method, the entire fee from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the establishment of VSOE or the delivery of all the elements of the arrangement.    Allowance for Doubtful Accounts             The Company's allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate prepared by management based on identification of the collectibility of specific accounts and the overall condition of the receivable portfolio. The Company specifically analyzes trade and other receivables, and analyzes historical bad debts, customer credits, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customers payment terms and/or patterns, when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make additional payments, additional allowances may be required. Likewise, should the Company determine that it could realize more of its receivables in the future than previously estimated, an adjustment to the allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjustments are recorded as deemed necessary.     Inventory Valuation             The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value. The Company assesses the value of its inventories periodically based upon numerous factors including expected product or material demand, current market conditions, technological obsolescence, current cost and net realizable value. If necessary, the Company adjusts its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value. Likewise, the Company records an adverse purchase commitment liability when anticipated market sales prices are lower than committed costs. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments and adverse purchase commitment liabilities may be required.    Income Taxes             The Company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates. These estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes, as well as about the realization of deferred tax assets. If the Company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably, the Company could experience potential significant losses in excess of provisions established. Likewise, if the Company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably, the Company could experience potential significant gains.    Warranty Obligations             The Company's standard warranty is a three-year return-to-factory policy that covers both parts and labor. For products that it distributes and for drives and tapes used in its products that are manufactured by a third party, the Company passes on to the customer the warranty provided by the manufacturer. The Company also provides on-site service for the first warranty year of its enterprise-class products, for which it contracts with third-party service providers. For certain products, the Company offers a program called XchangeNOW as part of its return-to-factory warranty which enables    19           customers to receive an advance replacement unit shipped within two business days after placing a service request. The defective unit is then shipped back to Overland using the shipping materials from the replacement unit.            The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company's warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage or service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the Company's estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.    Impairment of Assets             The Company also considers potential impairment of both tangible and intangible assets when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In such circumstances, the Company may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of such asset. Any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value and would be recorded s a reduction in the carrying value of the related assets and be charged to results of operations.     Results of Operations             The following tables set forth certain financial data as a percentage of net revenues:             Fiscal Years Ended June 30,             2002     2001     2000       Net revenues     100.0  %  100.0  %  100.0  %    Cost of revenues     74.0  %  74.9  %  75.2  %                        Gross profit     26.0  %  25.1  %  24.8  %                         Operating expenses:                               Sales and marketing     12.9  %  10.5  %  11.6  %       Research and development     4.0  %  6.5  %  5.9  %       General and administrative     5.1  %  5.7  %  5.0  %                              22.0  %  22.7  %  22.5  %                        Income from operations     4.0  %  2.4  %  2.3  %    Other income, net     0.2  %  0.2  %  0.5  %                        Income before income taxes     4.2  %  2.6  %  2.8  %    Provision for income taxes     1.4  %  1.0  %  1.1  %                        Net income     2.8  %  1.6  %  1.7  %                           Fiscal Year 2002 Compared to Fiscal Year 2001             Net Revenues.     Net revenues of $163.4 million in fiscal year 2002 were $7.7 million or 4.9% above net revenues of $155.7 million in fiscal year 2001. This revenue growth reflects the continued strong performance of the Company's Neo series line of tape library products. Sales within the Company's Library product lines (Neo, LibraryXpress®, LibraryPro, Autoloaders and MinilibraryXpress) grew 2.9% to $129.6 million, compared to $125.9 million in fiscal year 2001. Fiscal year 2002 sales to OEM customers were flat compared to fiscal year 2001 and sales to HP were up 3.6%. The increase in HP Neo series revenues directly offset the decrease in sales to HP of the Company's predecessor    20          LibraryXpress products and accounted for 64.6% of total library sales to HP during fiscal year 2002. Sales to HP accounted for 62.5% of total net revenues in fiscal year 2002, compared to 63.0% in fiscal year 2001.            Net revenues from Overland branded products during the fiscal year 2002 grew 13.8% over fiscal year 2001 from $49.7 million to $56.5 million. Excluding the DAT/Travan/Ditto products that the Company no longer sells, branded sales were up 20.6% over fiscal year 2001. Reflected in this growth is the transition from LibaryXpress to the Neo series products with the increase in Neo more than offsetting the decrease in LibraryXpress. Also contributing to the increase, the Company's branded Autoloader products increased 50.4% when compared to fiscal year 2001 due to an increased focus with our domestic direct marketers and a number of significant deals in Europe where the end-user is deploying the products in multiple branch offices and other small environments.            Net revenues from spare parts of $17.7 million in fiscal year 2002 were $9.4 million or 112.4% above net revenues of $8.3 million in fiscal year 2001. This increase was due primarily to the sales of spare parts for the Company's Neo series products as OEM partners, branded channel partners and service providers placed stocking orders of Neo series spare parts.            VR 2  revenues during fiscal year 2002 amounted to $2.6 million and were comprised of chip sales of $1.2 million, engineering service fees of $1.0 million and royalties of $431,000. VR 2  revenues during fiscal year 2001 amounted to $1.3 million and were comprised of chip sales of $504,000, engineering service fees of $630,000 and royalties of $168,000.            Revenues of $6.9 million from the Company's legacy 36-track products during fiscal year 2002 decreased $2.6 million or 27.0% compared to fiscal year 2001. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2002 the Company made the final shipments of its legacy 36-track products as low product demand prompted the Company to shift the products to end-of-life status. Sales of the Company's discontinued DAT/Travan based products in fiscal year 2002 declined by $3.0 million or 87.1% from the prior year.            A summary of the sales mix by product for the periods presented in the statement of operations follows:             Fiscal Years Ended June 30,             2002     2001     2000       LibraryXpress products:                            Neo series     43.5  %  3.8  %  0.0  %       LibraryXpress     15.7  %  57.5  %  62.1  %       Autoloaders     8.9  %  7.4  %  8.8  %       LibraryPro     8.2  %  9.2  %  1.0  %       MinilibraryXpress     3.0  %  3.0  %  6.0  %                              79.3  %  80.9  %  77.9  %        Spare parts, drives, other      14.6  %   10.0  %   9.6  %       36-track     4.2  %  6.1  %  10.2  %       Discontinued products     0.3  %  2.2  %  2.0  %       VR 2     1.6  %  0.8  %  0.3  %                              100.0  %  100.0  %  100.0  %                                   Gross Profit.     The Company's gross profit amounted to $42.4 million in fiscal year 2002, an increase of $3.4 million or 8.7% from $39.0 million in fiscal year 2001, resulting primarily from higher sales volumes. The gross margin percentage increased to 26.0% in fiscal year 2002 from 25.1% in fiscal year 2001. Excluding the non-recurring charges discussed below under the caption entitled "Fiscal Year    21           2001 Compared to Fiscal Year 2000Non-recurring Charges", gross margin as a percent of revenue fell slightly from 26.4% in fiscal year 2001 to 26.0% in fiscal year 2002. This decrease was due primarily to a higher concentration of revenues generated from the Company's newest products, which initially generated lower gross margins until their costs were reduced by economies realized from increasing production volumes. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2002, the Company consumed many of the expensive early production components and margins continued to improve throughout the fiscal year as the Company benefited from the lower unit costs of higher volume purchasing and cost reduction programs. Partially offsetting the lower margins as a result of the high concentration of the Company's newest products was (i) an increased concentration of higher margin spare parts revenue, (ii) an increased concentration of higher margin Overland branded product sales, and (iii) the increase in VR 2  contract engineering services revenue, Seagate chip sales and royalties, all which carry a significantly higher margin than the Company's revenue from product sales.            Sales and Marketing Expenses.     Sales and marketing expenses amounted to $21.0 million, representing 12.9% of net revenues in fiscal year 2002, compared to $16.4 million or 10.5% of net revenues in fiscal year 2001. Increased expenditures were due primarily to salary and related expenses associated with the expansion of the Company's commercial distribution channel and its continued focus on building its brand name. Also contributing to the increase, to a lesser extent, were the costs associated with the launch of the Company's open storage management software products, which occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002.            Research and Development Expenses.     R&D expenses amounted to $6.6 million or 4.0% of net revenues in fiscal year 2002, compared to $10.1 million or 6.5% of net revenues in fiscal year 2001. This decrease reflects the elimination of development expenses resulting from the sale of the Company's Travan based WS-30 and EDT-40 tape drive designs in June 2001, along with lower material and non-recurring engineering fees primarily related to the completion of the development of the Neo series products during fiscal year 2001. Partially offsetting this decrease was a $228,000 charge reflecting an adjustment in the Company's estimated liability related to the closure of the Longmont facility. This adjustment was based upon the increased amount of time that the Company believes will be required to sublease the facility, given the weakening real estate market in Longmont, Colorado. Also, included in the fiscal year 2001 amount were the costs associated with the effective termination of the Longmont operations as a result of the sale of the Company's Travan-based products design and the discontinuance of the remaining Travan-based products discussed below under the caption entitled "Fiscal Year 2001 Compared to Fiscal Year 2000Non-recurring Charges".            General and Administrative Expenses.     General and administrative expenses amounted to $8.4 million or 5.1% of net revenues in fiscal year 2002, compared to $8.9 million or 5.7% of net revenues in fiscal year 2001. The decrease is due primarily to the absence of severance expenses resulting from the reduction in force in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001 and legal fees related to the settlement of two lawsuits, each of which were included in the fiscal year 2001 amounts. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in bad debt expense compared to fiscal year 2001 due primarily to the bankruptcy of one of the Company's European distributors.             Interest Income/Expense.     In fiscal year 2002, the Company generated net interest income of $269,000, compared to net interest income of $473,000 in fiscal year 2001. The decrease was due to interest expense as a result of the Company's outstanding term loan combined with lower yields on the Company's investments notwithstanding higher average cash balances.            Income Taxes.     The Company's fiscal year 2002 provision for state and federal income taxes amounted to $2.3 million. This equated to an effective tax rate of 34.3% in fiscal year 2002, down from 37.9% in fiscal year 2001. The decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year is due primarily to increased benefit from foreign sales qualifying for foreign sales corporation treatment compared to prior years, as well as the generation of research and development tax credits.    22          Fiscal Year 2001 Compared to Fiscal Year 2000             Net Revenues.     The Company's net revenues of $155.7 million in fiscal year 2001 grew by $32.7 million or 26.6% over net revenues of $123.0 million in fiscal year 2000. Sales within the Company's LibraryXpress product line grew 31.3% to $125.9 million, compared to $95.9 million in fiscal year 2000, due to increased shipments to HP and the incremental growth of the LibraryPro and the recently launched Neo series products. Sales to HP accounted for 63% of total net revenues in fiscal year 2001, compared to 54% in fiscal year 2000. As expected, sales of the Company's 36-track products continued to decline and amounted to $9.5 million in fiscal year 2001, compared to $12.4 million in fiscal year 2000, due primarily to lower shipments to IBM.            Non-recurring Charges.     During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, the Company incurred several one-time pre-tax charges, including a $2.5 million charge related to the sale of its Travan-based WS30 and EDT40 tape drive designs and related assets and the exit of the entry-level tape drive business, a $711,000 charge as a result of the Company's reduction in force in April 2001 and a $406,000 charge related to the write-off of an optical product design and two lawsuit settlements. The charge related to the sale of the Travan design and exit of the entry-level tape drive business included a $2.0 million inventory write down, recorded in costs of revenues related to the remaining Travan-based inventory, $365,000 classified as research and development related to the closing of the Company's Longmont, Colorado facility, including severance expenses associated with the remaining employees formerly employed by Tecmar and other costs including the write-down of the remaining Travan-based fixed assets and legal fees associated with the sale. The severance costs resulting from the reduction of the Company's workforce included one officer and 26 middle manager and staff level positions. The severance costs were classified as follows: $485,000 to general and administrative expense; $114,000 to cost of revenues; $65,000 to sales and marketing expense; and $47,000 to research and development expense. These severance costs include payments under the Company's severance policy or, in the case of the officer, an individual severance agreement, related payroll taxes and outplacement expenses.            The Company incurred a $1.7 million write down within cost of goods sold for discontinued Ditto® inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000.             Gross Profit.     The Company's gross profit amounted to $39.0 million in fiscal year 2001, an increase of $8.5 million or 27.9% from $30.5 million in fiscal year 2000, resulting primarily from higher sales volumes. Including the non-recurring charges discussed above, the gross margin percentage increased slightly to 25.1% in fiscal year 2001 from 24.8% in fiscal year 2000. Excluding such charges, gross margin as a percent of revenue rose slightly from 26.2% in fiscal year 2000 to 26.4% in fiscal year 2001. Although average selling prices decreased in fiscal year 2001, product cost reductions and a favorable product mix towards higher margin products offset the lower average selling prices.            Sales and Marketing Expenses.     Sales and marketing expenses amounted to $16.4 million, representing 10.5% of net revenues in fiscal year 2001, compared to $14.3 million or 11.6% of net revenues in fiscal year 2000. Increased expenditures were due primarily to a full year of salary and related expenses associated with employees hired near the end of fiscal year 2000 and costs associated with the launch of the new Neo series product line during the year. The Company continued to focus efforts in fiscal year 2001 on building its brand name and the expansion of its commercial distribution channel.             Research and Development Expenses.     R&D expenses amounted to $10.1 million or 6.5% of net revenues in fiscal year 2001, compared to $7.3 million or 5.9% of net revenues in fiscal year 2000. The increased expenses were attributable to a full year of costs associated with the personnel formerly employed by Tecmar and higher developmental material costs related primarily to the Neo series development program. Also included in the fiscal year 2001 amount were the costs associated with the    23           effective termination of the Longmont operations as a result of the sale of the Company's Travan-based products design and the discontinuance of the remaining Travan-based products.            General and Administrative Expenses.     General and administrative expenses amounted to $8.9 million or 5.7% of net revenues in fiscal year 2001, compared to $6.2 million or 5.0% of net revenues in fiscal year 2000. The increased level of expenses in fiscal year 2001 included an increase in salary and related expenses associated with the hiring of a new president and chief executive officer, additional information technology resources to support the increased level of business, an increase in bad debt expense due primarily to a reversal of bad debt expense during fiscal year 2000, severance expenses resulting from the fourth quarter reduction in force and increased legal fees related primarily to the settlement of two lawsuits.            Interest Income/Expense.     In fiscal year 2001, the Company generated net interest income of $473,000, compared to net interest income of $714,000 in fiscal year 2000. The lower net interest income in fiscal year 2001 is due to reduced cash balances during the year combined with lower yields on the Company's investments.            Income Taxes.     The Company's fiscal year 2001 provision for state and federal income taxes amounted to $1.5 million. This equated to an effective tax rate of 37.9% in fiscal year 2001, down from 39.5% in fiscal year 2000. The decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year is due primarily to a larger benefit from the Company's foreign sales corporation as a result of an increase in qualified export sales.    Liquidity and Capital Resources             The primary source of liquidity for the Company has historically been cash generated from operations. In the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2002, the Company supplemented cash generated from operations by borrowing on a term loan under its new credit facility (described below) to fund tenant improvements and equipment purchases for its new headquarter facilities. During fiscal year 2002, the Company's cash and cash equivalents increased by $16.0 million as operating cash inflows of $15.1 million and inflows from financing activities of $7.4 million exceeded capital expenditures of $6.5 million. Operating cash inflows during fiscal year 2002 resulted from a decrease in inventories, net income during the period and the collection of receivables, all of which were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Capital expenditures during fiscal year 2002 were comprised primarily of tenant improvements and machinery and equipment related to the construction of the Company's new headquarter facilities. At June 30, 2002 the Company's new headquarter facilities were complete and occupied. Financing cash inflows during fiscal year 2002 were primarily a result of borrowings under the Company's new credit facility to fund the capital expenditures related to the construction of the new headquarter facilities.            At June 30, 2002, the Company had a credit facility consisting of a $5.0 million five-year term note for capital equipment purchases that matures on August 28, 2007 and a $10.0 million two-year revolving line of credit for working capital purposes that expires on November 30, 2003. Both the term note and the line of credit are collateralized by a general security interest in the Company's assets. Interest on the term note is set at variable rates equal to the bank's prime rate (4.75% on June 30, 2002) in effect from time to time. Interest on the line of credit is set at the bank's prime rate in effect from time to time minus 0.25% or, at the Company's option, a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25%. The loan agreement that governs the credit facility contains certain financial and non-financial covenants. The term note provides for a nine-month draw period through August 28, 2002, during which period only interest is paid. Upon expiration of the draw period, all amounts outstanding under the note will be payable in 60 equal payments of principal plus interest. At June 30, 2002, $4,655,000, including $776,000 due within one year, was outstanding under the term note and no amounts were outstanding    24           under the line of credit. Under a prior revolving credit facility, no borrowings were outstanding during fiscal year 2001.            In fiscal year 2001, the Company entered into a lease for its new headquarters in San Diego, California. The new headquarters comprise two buildings, representing approximately 160,000 total square feet. The buildings were completed in March 2002 at which time the Company occupied the buildings and the lease commenced. The lease is for a period of 12 years and can be renewed for one additional five-year period. The total approximate future minimum lease payments under this agreement will be $2.6 million in fiscal 2003, $2.7 million in fiscal 2004, $2.8 million in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006, $2.9 million in fiscal 2007 and $21.1 million thereafter.            At June 30, 2002, the Company had $26.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $54.5 million of working capital, and an unused bank line of credit of $10.0 million. The Company believes that these resources will be sufficient to fund its operations and to provide for its growth into the foreseeable future. However, the Company's inability to collect its accounts receivable in a timely manner and/or a material decrease in demand for the Company's products (i) would materially and adversely affect the Company's cash generated from operations, which in turn would materially and adversely impact the Company's liquidity, results of operations and financial position, and (ii) could constitute or result in default under the Company's credit facility, which would enable the lender under the credit facility, at its option without notice, to accelerate all then outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility and/or terminate the lender's obligation to extend credit under the credit facility, either of which could materially and adversely impact the Company's liquidity, results of operation and financial position.            In addition, the credit facility requires the Company to comply with several financial and non-financial covenants. A violation of one or more of these covenants would constitute a default under the credit facility, which would enable the lender, at its option without notice, to accelerate all then outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility and/or terminate the lender's obligation to extend credit under the credit facility, either of which could materially and adversely impact the Company's liquidity, results of operation and financial position.            The following schedule summarizes the Company's contractual obligations to make future payments as of June 30, 2002: (in thousands)             Payments Due by Period    Contractual Obligations       Total     Less than  1 year     2-3 years     4-5 years     After 5  years    Operating Leases        39,042     $  3,092     $  6,254     $  6,266     $  23,430    Debt        4,655        776        1,862        1,862        155                             Total Contractual Cash Obligations     $  43,697     $  3,868     $  8,116     $  8,128     $  23,585                                Inflation             Inflation has not had a significant negative impact on the Company's operations during the periods presented. With the exception of its OEM contracts, which contain fixed pricing for up to one year, the Company historically has been able to pass on to its customers increases in raw material prices caused by inflation. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to continue to pass on any future increases should they occur. Although the Company's exposure to the effects of inflation will be magnified by the expected increase in OEM business, the Company believes that its continuous efforts at material and labor cost reductions will minimize such effects.    25          Recent Accounting Pronouncements             In August 2001, the FASB issued FAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." FAS 144 replaces FAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." The FASB issued FAS 144 to establish a single accounting model, based on the framework established in FAS 121, as FAS 121 did not address the accounting for a segment of a business accounted for as a discontinued operation under APB 30, "Reporting the Results of OperationsReporting The Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions." FAS 144 also resolves significant implementation issues related to FAS 121. Companies are required to adopt FAS 144 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, but early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt FAS 144 as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. The Company does not expect the adoption of FAS 144 to have a material impact on its operating results and financial position.            In June 2002, the FASB issued FAS 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities". FAS 146 replaces EITF 94-3 "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)". The FASB issued FAS 146 to address the accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities because entities increasingly are engaging in exit and disposal activities and certain costs associated with those activities were recognized as liabilities at a plan (commitment) date under Issue 94-3 that did not meet the definition of a liability in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, "Elements of Financial Statements". Companies are required to adopt FAS 146 for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early application encouraged. The Company does not expect the adoption of FAS 146 to have a material impact on its operating results and financial position.    ITEM 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk           Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates. The Company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in United States interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the U.S. dollar. These exposures are directly related to its normal operating and funding activities. Historically, the Company has not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities.            Interest Rate Risk.     The Company's financial instruments with market risk exposure are the Company's cash equivalents, short-term investments, term note and, to the extent utilized, revolving line of credit. At June 30, 2002, $4,655,000, including $776,000 due within one year, was outstanding under the term note and no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The primary objective of the Company's investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, the Company currently maintains a portfolio of high-grade commercial paper and money market funds.            Interest on the Company's term note is set at variable rates equal to the bank's prime rate in effect from time to time. Interest on the line of credit is set at the bank's prime rate in effect from time to time minus 0.25% or, at the Company's option, a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25%. The Company's objective in maintaining access to these variable rate borrowings is the flexibility obtained regarding early repayment without penalties and lower overall costs as compared with fixed rate borrowings.             Under the Company's current policies, it does not use interest rate derivatives instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate changes. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would result in no material change in the Company's pre-tax earnings and cash flow.    26                  Foreign Currency Risk.     The Company conducts business on a global basis and essentially all of its products sold in international markets are denominated in U.S. dollars. Historically, export sales have represented a significant portion of the Company's sales and is expected to continue to represent a significant portion of sales.            The Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, France and Germany incur costs which are denominated in local currencies. As exchange rates vary, these results when translated into U.S. dollars may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected results. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the Company's results during fiscal year 2002 was not material.    ITEM 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
