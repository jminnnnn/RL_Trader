ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS.           THIS REPORT CONTAINS CERTAIN STATEMENTS OF A FORWARD-LOOKING NATURE RELATING TO FUTURE EVENTS OR THE FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY. PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED THAT SUCH STATEMENTS ARE ONLY PREDICTIONS AND THAT ACTUAL EVENTS OR RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY. IN EVALUATING SUCH STATEMENTS, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD SPECIFICALLY CONSIDER VARIOUS FACTORS IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING THE MATTERS SET FORTH UNDER THE CAPTION "RISK FACTORS," WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  GENERAL           Overland Data designs, develops, manufactures, markets and supports magnetic tape data storage systems used by businesses for backup, archival and data interchange functions. The Company's primary products are currently based on three different half-inch magnetic tape technologies: (i) DLT, (ii) 18 & 36-track and (iii) 9-track. In March 1996, the Company introduced the LibraryXpress, a scaleable automated tape library system incorporating DLT tape drives, and began shipping the LXB base module. In the second half of fiscal 1997, the Company introduced two additional modules: the LXG global control unit and the LXC capacity module. In May 1997, the LXS MiniLibrary, a single-drive, non-scalable version of the LibraryXpress, was introduced to serve the lower end of the network market. In February 1998, the Company commenced shipment of the LoaderXpress, a single-drive DLT tape loader which offers a five or ten cartridge magazine, designed for the commercial distribution channel. The Company's second product line, TapeXpress, consists of 18 and 36-track products based on the IBM 3480/3490/3490E technologies. During fiscal year 1998, the Company announced end-of-life on all of its 18-track products and its L60E 36-track data vault. Its third product line, TapePro, consists of 9-track reel-to-reel tape drives which are used exclusively for data interchange. The Company also distributes products manufactured by other OEM's and markets other items supplied by third parties including controller cards, interchange software, storage management software, spare parts and tape media. Finally, the Company licenses a new proprietary tape encoding technology which it developed and patented under the name Variable Rate Randomizer or "VR2". One license agreement was announced during fiscal year 1998; however, because the licensee has not completed the development project which uses VR2, no royalty revenues have yet been received.                                         14     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS           The following tables set forth certain data as a percentage of net sales:           STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS                                                 FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 30,                                             ---------------------------                                               1998      1997     1996                                             -----     -----     -----              Net sales                              100.0%    100.0%    100.0%      Cost of goods sold                      69.2      65.6      65.9                                             -----     -----     -----       Gross profit                            30.8      34.4      34.1                                             -----     -----     -----       Operating expenses:        Sales and marketing                   12.2      12.3      12.6        Research and development               5.5       7.0       7.8        General and administrative             8.3       7.1       6.2                                             -----     -----     -----                                               26.0      26.4      26.6                                             -----     -----     -----       Income from operations                   4.8       8.0       7.5      Interest and other, net                  1.3        .4       (.3)                                             -----     -----     -----       Income before income taxes               6.1       8.4       7.2      Provision for income taxes               2.4       3.2        .5                                             -----     -----     -----       Net income                               3.7%      5.2%      6.7%                                             -----     -----     -----                                              -----     -----     -----            PRODUCT MIX TABLE                                                 FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 30,                                              ---------------------------                                                1998      1997      1996                                               -----     -----     -----                   Company products:              LibraryXpress                      49.9%     28.6%      2.6%              36-track                           26.1      28.1      19.6              18-track                            2.8       9.7      15.3              9-track                             7.4      18.2      29.4              Spare parts, controllers, other     7.2       8.4      10.3            Other parts:              DLT distributed products            6.6       6.9      21.5              Other distributed products          0.0       0.1       1.3                                                -----     -----     -----                                                 100.0%    100.0%    100.0%                                                -----     -----     -----                                                 -----     -----     -----                                           15   FISCAL 1998 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1997           NET SALES. The Company's net sales of $75.2 million in fiscal year 1998 grew by $16.1 million or 27.2% over net sales of $59.1 million in fiscal year 1997. Significant growth in sales of the Company's flagship LibraryXpress product line, together with modest growth of 36-track product sales, more than offset declines in other mature product lines. LibraryXpress sales grew by 122% to $37.5 million compared to $16.9 million in fiscal year 1997, due principally to strong demand from DEC/CPQ for the LXB7110 model. Although DEC had been a buyer of the Company's 9-track products since 1993, it did not begin ordering LibraryXpress products until late in the first quarter of fiscal year 1998. Also contributing to the LibraryXpress growth were sales of several new products. The LXG global control unit, the LXC capacity module and LXS MiniLibrary were all introduced late in fiscal year 1997, but contributed a full year of revenues in 1998. Another new product, the LoaderXpress, was introduced in February 1998, and made a small contribution to fiscal year 1998 revenues. Sales of the Company's 36-track products grew by 18.1% to $19.6 million in fiscal year 1998 compared to $16.6 million in fiscal year 1997. This growth resulted principally from increased sales to IBM of the L490E model pursuant to a new supply agreement entered into in the second quarter of fiscal year 1997. Sales of 18-track products of $2.1 million in fiscal year 1998 fell by $3.6 million or 63.2% from $5.7 million in the prior year. This decline was the result of an upward migration by the Company's customers from 18-track products to its 36-track products and the Company's announced end-of-life on all 18-track products at the end of fiscal year 1998. Sales of 9-track products of $5.6 million in fiscal year 1998 fell by $5.3 million or 48.6% from $10.9 million in fiscal year 1997. This reflects the general maturity of the 9-track technology, a trend which the Company expects will continue. As of the end of fiscal 1998, the 9-track product line has been narrowed to two products.           GROSS PROFIT. The Company's gross profit amounted to $23.2 million in fiscal year 1998, up from $20.4 million in fiscal year 1997, as a result of the higher sales volumes. The gross margin, however, fell from 34.4% in fiscal year 1997 to 30.9% in fiscal year 1998 due principally to a higher concentration of OEM business, which is typically at lower margins compared to other channel business. Sales to OEM customers rose from 23% of revenues in fiscal year 1997 to 40% of revenues in fiscal year 1998. Also contributing to lower margins was the effect of competitive pressures which resulted in reduced selling prices for certain products.           SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES. Sales and marketing expenses amounted to $9.2 million or 12.2% of net sales in fiscal year 1998 compared to $7.3 million or 12.3% of net sales in 1997. This increase in total expenditures resulted primarily from a higher level of advertising and promotional programs, additional personnel and greater travel expenses. The Company's marketing efforts are focused on creating an awareness in the marketplace at both the reseller and end-user level for the Overland name and the Company's new products, including the LoaderXpress. The goal is to create pull-through for the new commercial distribution channel and for the existing volume sales channel.           RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. R&D expenses were flat with the prior year and amounted to $4.1 million or 5.5% of net sales in fiscal year 1998 compared to $4.1 million or 7.0% of net sales in 1997. In fiscal year 1998, the R&D efforts included the design and support of the new LoaderXpress product, design of a new automated tape library based on a new tape technology, and the joint development project with Tandberg Data announced in April 1998 to implement the Company's VR2 technology onto Tandberg's SLR tape drives.           GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and administrative expenses amounted to $6.2 million or 8.3% of net sales in fiscal year 1998 compared to $4.2 million or 7.1% of net sales in 1997. The higher level of expenses in 1998 included an increase in depreciation for the Company's new ERP system, increased legal fees, increased MIS staffing levels, higher facility  costs and other incremental costs incidental to being a public company for  a full year.           INTEREST INCOME/EXPENSE. In fiscal year 1998, the Company generated net interest income of $940,000, compared to net interest income of $223,000 in fiscal 1997. The higher income in fiscal 1998 resulted from earnings on investment of funds generated by the Company's initial public offering and the elimination of interest expense on bank borrowings. Immediately following the IPO in February 1997, the Company fully repaid the borrowings under its revolving bank line of credit.           INCOME TAXES. The Company's fiscal year 1998 provision for state and  federal income taxes amounted to $1.8 million, or an effective tax rate of  38.5%. The effective rate in 1998 was higher than the fiscal year 1997 rate  of 37.8% due primarily to reduced state R&D tax credits.                                         16     FISCAL 1997 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1996           NET SALES. The Company's net sales of $59.1 million in fiscal year 1997 grew by $11.9 million or 25.2% over net sales of $47.2 million in fiscal year 1996. Sales growth in certain of the Company's products were partially offset by declines in other product lines. The strongest growth over the prior year was experienced in the LibraryXpress product line, which began shipping in March 1996. Sales of LibraryXpress in fiscal year 1997, the first full year of shipments, amounted to $16.9 million compared to $1.2 million in 1996. Although the majority of the growth was generated by sales of the LibraryXpress LXB base module, additional sales were generated in the last half of the year when the Company introduced three new products: the LXG global control unit, the LXC capacity module and the LXS MiniLibrary. Offsetting this growth, however, was a $6.1 million decline in sales of DLT distributed product, due principally to a replacement of sales of Quantum DLT loaders by sales of the Company's own LibraryXpress products. Sales of the Company's 36-track products of $16.6 million in fiscal year 1997 grew by $7.3 million or 78.5% from $9.3 million in 1996. This growth resulted principally from increased sales to IBM of the L490E model pursuant to a new supply agreement entered into in the second quarter of fiscal year 1997. Sales of 18-track products of $5.7 million fell by $1.5 million or 20.8% from $7.2 million in the prior year. This decline was the result of an upward migration by the Company's customers from 18-track products to its 36-track products and to a general decline in the use of 18-track products in favor of other technologies. Sales of 9-track products of $10.9 million in fiscal year 1997 fell by $3.5 million or 24.3% from $14.4 million in 1996. This reflects the general maturity of the 9-track technology, a trend which the Company expects to continue in the foreseeable future. Additionally, during fiscal year 1997, the Company made end-of-life announcements on certain of its 9-track products to narrow its 9-track product offerings.           GROSS PROFIT. The Company's gross profit amounted to $20.4 million in fiscal year 1997, up from $16.1 million in fiscal year 1996, which represented gross margins of 34.4% and 34.1%, respectively. The gross margins were improved by the shift from sales of DLT distributed product at lower margins, to sales of LibraryXpress products at relatively higher margins. However, this was offset by growth in sales to the Company's OEM customers, which are typically at relatively lower margins than offered to its other customers.            SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES. Sales and marketing expenses amounted to $7.3 million or 12.3% of net sales in fiscal year 1997 compared to $5.9 million or 12.6% of net sales in 1996. This increase in total expenditures resulted from costs needed to support the higher sales level, including salaries and benefits, sales commissions, advertising and promotion and travel and related costs.           RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. R&D expenses amounted to $4.1 million or 7.0% of net sales in fiscal year 1997 compared to $3.7 million or 7.8% of net sales in 1996. The R&D efforts during 1997 and the increased expenses compared to 1996 related to the development of the LXG, LXC and LXS products within the LibraryXpress product family. The Company also incurred expenses in both years related to the development of its new tape recording technology and coding scheme using the concept of partial response maximum likelihood.           GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and administrative expenses amounted to $4.2 million or 7.1% of net sales in fiscal year 1997 compared to $2.9 million or 6.2% of net sales in 1996. The higher level of expenses in 1997 included an increase in support personnel, computer related expenses, legal fees related to the class action lawsuits filed against the Company and to patent work related to the Company's new tape coding technique, increased bad debt reserves related to the higher level of sales and increased facility costs.           INTEREST INCOME/EXPENSE. In fiscal year 1997, the Company generated net interest income of $223,000, compared to fiscal year 1996 when net interest expense amounted to $154,000. The net interest income in 1997 resulted from earnings on investment of funds generated by the Company's initial public offering and elimination of interest expense after repayment of bank borrowings. The interest expense in 1996 included $124,000 related to borrowings under the Company's revolving bank line of credit and $30,000 of interest expense related to an installment note which was repaid in full in November 1995. Average borrowings under the Company's bank line of credit in fiscal year 1996 amounted to $1.4 million.           INCOME TAXES. The Company's fiscal year 1997 provision for state and federal income taxes amounted to $1.9 million or an effective tax rate of 37.8%. In fiscal year 1996, the tax provision amounted to $254,000, resulting in an abnormally low effective tax rate of 7.4%. The low tax rate in 1996 was the result of the release of a deferred tax valuation allowance of $997,000 in the fourth fiscal quarter which is discussed below and in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.                                         17     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           During fiscal year 1998, the Company used $1.5 million to fund its operating activities, primarily to build receivables and inventories in support of the higher sales levels. An additional $2.1 million was invested in capital expenditures, primarily for the Company's new enterprise wide computer system, network computers, leasehold improvements and tooling.           At June 30, 1998, the Company had $15.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, $39.5 million of net working capital, an unused bank line of credit of $5 million and no other funded debt. The Company believes that these resources will be sufficient to fund its operations and to provide for its growth for the foreseeable future.  INFLATION           Inflation has not had a significant negative impact on the Company's operations during the periods presented. With the exception of its OEM contracts, which contain fixed pricing for up to one year, the Company has historically been able to pass on to its customers increases in raw material prices caused by inflation. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to continue to pass on any future increases should they occur. Although the Company's exposure to the effects of inflation will be magnified by the expected increase in OEM business, the Company believes that its continuous efforts at material and labor cost reductions will minimize such effects.  YEAR 2000           Many computer systems experience problems handling dates in and beyond the year 1999. Therefore, some computer hardware and software will need to be modified prior to the year 2000 in order to remain functional. During fiscal year 1998 the Company replaced its internal enterprise wide computer system and believes that the system is year 2000 compliant. The Company's internally manufactured products have no date functionality built into them with the  exception that certain products have a display-only date/time function. This function, which is year 2000 compliant, allows the operator to set the LCD  front panel display date and time from the front panel. Although not used in any way when reading/writing data or otherwise operating the products, it is also used for date/time stamping entries into the internal history and error logs.            The Company is also assessing and addressing the possible effects on the Company's operations of the year 2000 readiness of its other internal  systems and the systems of its key suppliers and subcontractors. The Company's reliance on suppliers and subcontractors, and therefore, on the proper functioning of their information systems and software, means that their failure to address year 2000 issues could have a material impact on the Company's operations and financial results. The potential impact and related costs of year 2000 readiness for both the remaining internal and external systems are not known at this time.             It is unknown how customer spending patterns may be impacted by year 2000 programs. As customers focus on preparing their business for the year 2000 in the near term, capital budgets may be spent on remediation efforts,  potentially delaying the purchase and implementation of new systems, thereby creating less demand for the Company's products and services. Conversely,  demand for the Company's products could accelerate as customers focus on the need to protect their stored data by enhancing their backup capabilities. The impact on the Company's revenues is not known at this time.                                        18   SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA           The following table presents selected quarterly financial information for the periods indicated.
