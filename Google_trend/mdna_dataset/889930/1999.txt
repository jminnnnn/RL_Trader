ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.           THIS REPORT CONTAINS CERTAIN STATEMENTS OF A FORWARD-LOOKING NATURE RELATING TO FUTURE EVENTS OR THE FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY. PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED THAT SUCH STATEMENTS ARE ONLY PREDICTIONS AND THAT ACTUAL EVENTS OR RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY. IN EVALUATING SUCH STATEMENTS, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD SPECIFICALLY CONSIDER VARIOUS FACTORS IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING THE MATTERS SET FORTH UNDER THE CAPTION "RISK FACTORS," WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  GENERAL           Overland Data designs, develops, manufactures, markets and supports magnetic tape data storage systems used by businesses for backup, archival and data interchange functions in high-availability network computing environments, from entry level to the enterprise. The Company's primary products are automated tape libraries, minilibraries and loaders, which combine electromechanical robotics, electronic hardware and firmware developed by the Company. Currently, the Company's products are based on two different half-inch magnetic tape technologies - DLT and 36-track. Its DLT products began in March 1996 when the Company introduced the LibraryXpress, a scalable automated tape library system                                       13     incorporating DLT tape drives, and began shipping the LXB base module. In the second half of fiscal year 1997, the Company introduced two additional modules: the LXG global control unit and the LXC capacity module. In May 1997, the Company introduced the LXS MiniLibrary, a single-drive, 15-cartridge, non-scalable version of the LibraryXpress, to serve the lower end of the network market. In February 1998, the Company commenced shipment of the LoaderXpress, a single-drive DLTtape loader, which offers a 5 or 10-cartridge magazine, designed for the commercial distribution channel. The Company introduced the non-scalable, 15-cartridge, dual-drive MinilibraryXpress in February 1999 and the EnterpriseXpress, with versions from two drives and 26 cartridges to six drives and 100 cartridges, in May 1999 to serve the enterprise market. The Company's second product line, TapeXpress, consists of 36-track products based on the IBM 3480/3490/3490E technologies. These technologies are maturing and sales are expected to decline in the upcoming fiscal year. During fiscal year 1998, the Company announced end-of-life on all of its 18-track products and its L60E 36-track data vault. During fiscal year 1999, the Company discontinued sales of its TapePro line of products, which consisted of 9-track reel-to-reel tape drives used exclusively for data interchange. The Company also distributes products manufactured by other OEM's and markets other items supplied by third parties including controller cards, interchange software, storage management software, spare parts and tape media. Finally, the Company licenses its proprietary tape encoding technology, which it developed and patented under the name VR2. One license agreement was announced during fiscal year 1998 and another was announced in March 1999. A small amount of developmental royalty revenues were recognized in the last half of fiscal year 1999. Further sales-based royalties will be dependent upon shipments by the licensees of tape drives incorporating VR2.     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS           The following tables set forth certain data as a percentage of net sales:                STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS                                                               Fiscal Years Ended June 30,                                                        ------------------------------------------                                                         1999             1998              1997                                                        --------        --------          --------                        Net sales.............................    100.0%           100.0%           100.0%               Cost of goods sold....................     69.8             69.2             65.6                                                        --------        --------          --------                Gross profit..........................     30.2             30.8             34.4                                                        --------        --------          --------               Operating expenses:                 Sales and marketing.................     12.8             12.2             12.3                 Research and development............      5.8              5.5              7.0                 General and administrative..........      5.5              8.3              7.1                                                        --------        --------          --------                                                          24.1             26.0             26.4                                                        --------        --------          --------               Income from operations................      6.1              4.8              8.0               Interest and other, net...............      1.0              1.3               .4                                                        --------        --------          --------               Income before income taxes............      7.1              6.1              8.4               Provision for income taxes............      2.8              2.4              3.2                                                        --------        --------          --------               Net income............................      4.3%             3.7%             5.2%                                                        --------        --------          --------                                                        --------        --------          --------                                        14                      PRODUCT MIX TABLE                                                              Fiscal Years Ended June 30,                                                      -----------------------------------------                                                        1999             1998            1997                                                      --------        --------         --------                         Company products:                   LibraryXpress......................  57.2%          49.9%             28.6%                   36-track...........................  26.3           26.1              28.1                   18-track...........................   0.1            2.8               9.7                   9-track............................   4.2            7.4              18.2                   Spare parts, controllers, other....   5.5            7.2               8.4                   VR2 royalties......................   0.5              -                 -                 Other:                   DLT distributed products...........   6.2            6.6               6.9                   Other distributed products........      -              -               0.1                                                      --------        --------         --------                                                       100.0%         100.0%            100.0%                                                      --------        --------         --------                                                      --------        --------         --------     FISCAL YEAR 1999 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 1998           NET SALES. The Company's net sales of $92.2 million in fiscal year 1999 grew by $17.1 million or 22.7% over net sales of $75.2 million in fiscal year 1998. Sales of the Company's LibraryXpress product line grew 40.5% to $52.7 million compared to $37.5 million in fiscal year 1998. This included strong sales of the LoaderXpress product, primarily through the commercial distribution channel, and initial sales of the new MinilibraryXpress product. Sales of the Company's 36-track products, which were extremely strong in the first half of fiscal year 1999, grew by 24.0% to $24.3 million in fiscal year 1999 compared to $19.6 million in fiscal year 1998. Sales of the Company's 9-track products fell 30.4% to $3.9 million in fiscal year 1999 compared to $5.6 million in fiscal year 1998. The Company discontinued this product line in June 1999.           GROSS PROFIT. The Company's gross profit amounted to $27.9 million in fiscal year 1999, an increase of $4.7 million from $23.2 million in fiscal year 1998 resulting from the higher sales volumes. The gross margin percentage declined to 30.2% in fiscal year 1999 from 30.8% in fiscal year 1998, reflecting a greater mix of sales to OEM and commercial distribution customers, which are typically at lower margins compared to other channel business.           SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES. Sales and marketing expenses amounted to $11.8 million, representing 12.8% of net sales in fiscal year 1999 compared to $9.2 million or 12.2% of net sales in fiscal year 1998. Increased expenditures were due primarily to additional personnel, a higher level of advertising and promotional programs, and greater travel expenses. The Company continued to focus in fiscal year 1999 on building its brand name and expansion of its commercial distribution channel. Incremental expenses also were incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999 relating to the introduction of the Company's LibraryXpress product into the Compaq sales channels after Compaq selected Overland in June 1999 to be the supplier of its departmental secondary automated storage products supporting the Compaq ProLiant server line.           RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. R&D expenses amounted to $5.4 million or 5.8% of net sales in fiscal year 1999 compared to $4.1 million or 5.5% of net sales in fiscal year 1998. The increased expenses included additional personnel and developmental materials relating to the design and support of the new MinilibraryXpress product, Web TLC, the EnterpriseXpress, and SLR Loader, as well as ASIC production and design assistance provided to licensees of VR2.           GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and administrative expenses amounted to $5.1 million or 5.5% of net sales in fiscal year 1999 compared to $6.2 million or 8.3% of net sales in fiscal year 1998. The decreased level of expenses in 1999 reflects a reduction of recruiting and legal fees, as well as reduced computer-related expenses. Additionally, the Company's bad debt provision was lower than in the prior year, reflecting the higher concentration of OEM customers with reduced credit risk.           INTEREST INCOME/EXPENSE. In fiscal year 1999, the Company generated net interest income of $810,000, compared to net interest income of $940,000 in fiscal year 1998. The lower income in fiscal year 1999 resulted from reduced cash balances caused by increased working capital requirements and repurchases of Company stock.                                       15              INCOME TAXES. The Company's fiscal year 1999 provision for state and federal income taxes amounted to $2.6 million, or an effective tax rate of 39.5%. The effective rate in 1999 was higher than the fiscal year 1998 rate of 38.5% due primarily to reduced state R&D tax credits.  FISCAL YEAR 1998 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 1997           NET SALES. The Company's net sales of $75.2 million in fiscal year 1998 grew by $16.1 million or 27.2% over net sales of $59.1 million in fiscal year 1997. Significant growth in sales of the Company's flagship LibraryXpress product line, together with modest growth of 36-track product sales, more than offset declines in other mature product lines. LibraryXpress sales grew by 122% to $37.5 million compared to $16.9 million in fiscal year 1997, due principally to strong demand from DEC (acquired by Compaq in 1998) for the LXB7110 model. Although DEC had been a buyer of the Company's 9-track products since 1993, it did not begin ordering LibraryXpress products until late in the first quarter of fiscal year 1998. Also contributing to the LibraryXpress growth were sales of several new products. The LXG global control unit, the LXC capacity module and LXS MiniLibrary were all introduced late in fiscal year 1997, but contributed a full year of revenues in 1998. Another new product, the LoaderXpress, was introduced in February 1998, and made a small contribution to fiscal year 1998 revenues. Sales of the Company's 36-track products grew by 18.1% to $19.6 million in fiscal year 1998 compared to $16.6 million in fiscal year 1997. This growth resulted principally from increased sales to IBM of the L490E model pursuant to a new supply agreement entered into in the second quarter of fiscal year 1997. Sales of 18-track products of $2.1 million in fiscal year 1998 fell by $3.6 million or 63.2% from $5.7 million in the prior year. This decline was the result of an upward migration by the Company's customers from 18-track products to its 36-track products and the Company's announced end-of-life on all 18-track products at the end of fiscal year 1998. Sales of 9-track products of $5.6 million in fiscal year 1998 fell by $5.3 million or 48.6% from $10.9 million in fiscal year 1997, reflecting the general maturity of the 9-track technology. At the end of fiscal year 1998, the 9-track product line had been narrowed to two products.           GROSS PROFIT. The Company's gross profit amounted to $23.2 million in fiscal year 1998, up from $20.4 million in fiscal year 1997, as a result of the higher sales volumes. The gross margin, however, fell from 34.4% in fiscal year 1997 to 30.8% in fiscal year 1998 due principally to a higher concentration of OEM business, which is typically at lower margins compared to other channel business. Sales to OEM customers rose from 23% of revenues in fiscal year 1997 to 40% of revenues in fiscal year 1998. Also contributing to lower margins was the effect of competitive pressures, which resulted in reduced selling prices for certain products.           SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES. Sales and marketing expenses amounted to $9.2 million or 12.2% of net sales in fiscal year 1998 compared to $7.3 million or 12.3% of net sales in fiscal year 1997. This increase in total expenditures resulted primarily from a higher level of advertising and promotional programs, additional personnel and greater travel expenses. The Company's marketing efforts focused on creating awareness in the marketplace at both the reseller and end-user level for the Overland name and the Company's new products, including the LoaderXpress. Significant resources were expended to create pull-through for the new commercial distribution channel and for the existing volume sales channel.           RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. R&D expenses were flat with the prior year and amounted to $4.1 million or 5.5% of net sales in fiscal year 1998 compared to $4.1 million or 7.0% of net sales in fiscal year 1997. In fiscal year 1998, R&D efforts included the design and support of the new LoaderXpress product, design of a new automated tape library based on a new tape technology, and the joint development project with Tandberg Data announced in April 1998 to implement the Company's VR2 technology onto Tandberg's SLR tape drives.           GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and administrative expenses amounted to $6.2 million or 8.3% of net sales in fiscal year 1998 compared to $4.2 million or 7.1% of net sales in fiscal year 1997. The higher level of expenses in fiscal year 1998 included an increase in depreciation for the Company's new ERP system, increased legal fees, increased MIS staffing levels, higher facility costs and other incremental costs incidental to being a public company for a full year.           INTEREST INCOME/EXPENSE. In fiscal year 1998, the Company generated net interest income of $940,000, compared to net interest income of $223,000 in fiscal year 1997. The higher income in fiscal year 1998 resulted from earnings on investment of funds generated by the Company's initial public offering and the elimination of interest expense on bank borrowings. Immediately following the IPO in February 1997, the Company fully repaid the borrowings under its revolving bank line of credit.                                       16               INCOME TAXES. The Company's fiscal year 1998 provision for state and federal income taxes amounted to $1.8 million, or an effective tax rate of 38.5%. The effective rate in fiscal year 1998 was higher than the fiscal year 1997 rate of 37.8% due primarily to reduced state R&D tax credits.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           During fiscal year 1999, the Company generated $5.1 million in cash from its operations. Capital expenditures during the year for machinery and tooling equipment consumed $1.9 million of that amount, of which a portion was used to purchase all of the assets related to a CD optical storage robotics technology from a major CD robotics automation company. An additional $2.5 million was consumed to repurchase shares of the Company's Common Stock, net of proceeds received from the sale of shares under its Employee Stock Purchase Plan and from the exercise of stock options.           At June 30, 1999, the Company had $16.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, $41.0 million of net working capital, an unused bank line of credit of $5 million and no other funded debt. The Company believes that these resources will be sufficient to fund its operations and to provide for its growth for the foreseeable future.  INFLATION           Inflation has not had a significant negative impact on the Company's operations during the periods presented. With the exception of its OEM contracts, which contain fixed pricing for up to one year, the Company historically has been able to pass on to its customers increases in raw material prices caused by inflation. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to continue to pass on any future increases should they occur. Although the Company's exposure to the effects of inflation will be magnified by the expected increase in OEM business, the Company believes that its continuous efforts at material and labor cost reductions will minimize such effects.  YEAR 2000           THIS STATEMENT IS INTENDED AS A YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE.           The year 2000 computer issue arises because certain computer systems experience problems handling dates in and beyond the year 1999. Consequently, some computer hardware and software will need to be modified prior to the year 2000 in order to remain functional. The widespread use and dependency on computer technology in all areas of modern commerce may pose significant risks to companies, including Overland, from year 2000 issues. These risks include potential disruptions or failures within products and operations of Overland and its suppliers, customers and service providers. Because a large part of the risk is indirect through suppliers, service providers and customers, the Company cannot accurately predict the impact of the year 2000 issue on the Company, its financial condition and results of operations.           The Company is in the process of addressing year 2000 issues both within and outside of Overland and has made significant progress to date. The Company's approach has included four major phases consisting of inventory, assessment, resolution and internal testing/certification.           The Company has completed its analysis of its own internally manufactured products and concluded that none of the products sold by the Company has any date functionality built into it, with the exception of certain products that employ a display-only date/time function. This function, which is year 2000 compliant, allows the operator to set the LCD front panel display date and time from the front panel.           The Company then focused on the year 2000 functionality of its internal computer systems and operating equipment. Overland completed its year 2000 preparations for its primary business systems in October 1997 when the Company replaced its internal enterprise wide computer system, which it believes to be year 2000 compliant. This system replacement included material forecasting, inventory management, manufacturing management, order administration, accounts payable, accounts receivable and financial management. The Company then undertook a year 2000 assessment of its secondary business systems, both information technology ("IT") and non-IT systems. This assessment is substantially complete and no significant issues have arisen. The Company remedied all year 2000 issues as they were revealed. The Company has substantially completed all remediation efforts and expects to complete testing and certification by October 18, 1999.                                        17             The Company's final year 2000 focus was on external elements. As indicated above, the Company's risk assessment included understanding the year 2000 readiness of its suppliers. The Company's risk assessment process associated with suppliers included soliciting and analyzing responses to questionnaires distributed to these suppliers, as well as web-site and SEC filing research, telephone surveys, and onsite interviews with certain critical suppliers. The Company has completed interviews with all of its critical suppliers. All of the critical suppliers surveyed have year 2000 plans in place. No suppliers appear to present major year 2000 issues at this time. All critical suppliers are currently certified.           The year 2000 readiness of the Company's key supplier, Quantum Corporation, is of particular importance. Quantum has implemented a year 2000 compliance program using a resolution approach based on the U.S. General Accounting Office Year 2000 Assessment Guide. Quantum's program included the evaluation of all of its products and internal systems and a review of the readiness of its suppliers and service providers. On August 11, 1999, Quantum indicated in its Form 10-Q filing with the SEC that it expected to be year 2000 compliant and certified by August 31, 1999.           The Company also is working closely with key customers to evaluate their readiness for year 2000 and will perform site visits if deemed necessary. The ability of customers to deal with year 2000 issues may affect their operations and their ability to order and pay for products. Based on the level of risk assessed, the Company may develop contingency plans to address possible changes in customer order patterns. The Company does not know how year 2000 programs may impact customer spending patterns. As customers focus on preparing their business for the year 2000 in the near term, capital budgets may be spent on remediation efforts, potentially delaying the purchase and implementation of new systems, thereby creating less demand for the Company's products and services. The Company does not know the resulting impact on its revenues at this time.           Overland believes that its most likely worst case scenario would be attributed to third party factors, rather than its internal systems and applications. Because the Company relies heavily on third parties to manufacture and transport products and services, a failure of third party systems could disrupt service, which could delay shipments of Overland's products.           Although not directly related to the year 2000 issue, the cost of installing and implementing the Company's new ERP system in October 1997 was approximately $1.5 million. The Company has had a policy since 1995 of purchasing year 2000 compliant products where possible. To date, the Company has incurred less than $100,000 of other costs to address the year 2000 issue. Based on assessment and remediation projects underway, the Company expects that the total cost of addressing the year 2000 issue will not exceed $200,000, amounting to less than 10% of the Company's IT budget. No significant system projects have been deferred due to the year 2000 program.           Based on assessment and remediation completed to date, the Company does not expect any significant disruption to its operations or operating results as a result of year 2000 issues. The Company is taking all steps that it believes are appropriate to identify and resolve any year 2000 issues. However, the Company is uncertain to what extent it may be affected by such matters. Because of the complexity and inherent uncertainty of the year 2000 issue, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to assess, identify and correct year 2000 issues in a timely or successful manner. In addition, there can be no assurance that the failure to ensure year 2000 capability by suppliers, service providers, customers, or other third parties would not have a material adverse affect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.           The foregoing statements are based on management's best estimates at the present time, which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events and conditions, including third party modification plans, third party assurances of year 2000 compliance and other factors. There can be no assurance that these assumptions will be accurate, that the estimates will be achieved, and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated.                                       18       SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA           The following table presents selected quarterly financial information for the periods indicated.
