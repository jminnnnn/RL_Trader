ITEM 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.          General             Unless the context indicates otherwise, when we refer to "we," "us" or the "Company" in this Form 10-K, we are referring to Guess?, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.     Business Segments             In fiscal 2011, the Company revised its segment reporting whereby the North American wholesale and Asia segments are now separate segments for reporting purposes. The Company's businesses are now grouped into five reportable segments for management and internal financial reporting purposes: North American retail, Europe, Asia, North American wholesale and licensing. Information relating to these segments is summarized in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management evaluates segment performance based primarily on revenues and earnings from operations. The Company believes this segment reporting better reflects how its five business segments are managed and each segment's performance is evaluated. The North American retail segment includes the Company's retail operations in North America. The Europe segment includes the Company's wholesale and retail operations in Europe and the Middle East. The Asia segment includes the Company's wholesale and retail operations in Asia. The North American wholesale segment includes the Company's wholesale operations in North America. The licensing segment includes the worldwide licensing operations of the Company. The business segment operating results exclude corporate overhead costs which consist of shared costs of the organization. These costs are presented separately and generally include, among other things, the following unallocated corporate costs: information technology, human resources, global advertising and marketing, accounting and finance, executive compensation, facilities and legal.            We acquired Focus Europe S.r.l. ("Focus"), our former licensee for GUESS by MARCIANO products in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, in December 2006. We also acquired BARN S.r.l. ("Barn"), our former kids licensee in Europe, in January 2008. Each of these entities is reported in our Europe segment. G by GUESS is a relatively new retail brand concept that was launched in early fiscal 2008 and is included in our North American retail segment. Our South Korea and China businesses, which we have operated directly since January 2007 and April 2007, respectively, are reported in our Asia segment. Our international jewelry license agreement, which expired in December 2009, was not renewed as the Company decided to directly operate this business going forward. Beginning in January 2010, the operating results of our international jewelry business are included in our Europe segment. Prior to that date, we recorded the related royalty income in our licensing segment.     Products             We derive our net revenue from the sale of GUESS?, GUESS by MARCIANO, GUESS Kids and G by GUESS men's and women's apparel, and our licensees' products through our worldwide network of retail stores, wholesale customers and distributors, as well as our on-line sites. We also derive royalty revenues from worldwide licensing activities.     Recent Global Economic Developments             Economic conditions remain uncertain in many markets around the world and consumer behavior remains cautious. In North America in particular, the relatively weaker levels of consumer confidence and the highly promotional conditions among retailers may persist for some time. These conditions could affect both our growth and our profitability.            The Company anticipates that potential inflationary pressures on raw materials, labor, freight or other commodities including oil, could begin to negatively impact the cost of product purchases primarily in the second half of the fiscal year 2012. The Company has plans to mitigate some of these effects through price    30             increases on select items, supply chain initiatives, reduced markdowns and mix. However, there can be no assurances that these actions will be successful. In addition, increased prices could lead to reduced customer demand.            We also continue to experience significant volatility in the global currency markets. Since the majority of our international operations are conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the euro, Canadian dollar and Korean won), currency fluctuations can have a significant impact on the translation of our international revenues and earnings into U.S. dollar amounts. During fiscal 2011, the average U.S. dollar rate was stronger against the euro while weaker against the Canadian dollar and Korean won versus the comparable prior-year periods. This had an overall negative impact on the translation of our international revenues and earnings for the year ended January 29, 2011.            In addition, some of our transactions that occur in Europe, Canada and South Korea are denominated in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and British pounds exposing them to exchange rate fluctuations when converted to their functional currencies. These transactions include U.S. dollar denominated purchases of merchandise, U.S. dollar and British pound intercompany liabilities and certain sales, operating expenses, and tax liabilities denominated in Swiss francs. Fluctuations in exchange rates can impact the profitability of our foreign operations and reported earnings and are largely dependent on the transaction timing and magnitude during the period that the currency fluctuates. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exchange risk on certain foreign currency transactions. However, the Company does not hedge all transactions denominated in foreign currency.     Long-Term Growth Strategy             Despite the economic conditions described above, our key long-term strategies remain unchanged. Global expansion continues to be the cornerstone of our growth strategy. Our combined revenues outside of the U.S. and Canada represented roughly half of the total Company's revenues in fiscal 2011, compared to one-fifth in fiscal 2005. We expect to continue to expand in both Europe and Asia. Expanding our retail business across the globe is another important part of our growth strategy. We see opportunities to increase the number of GUESS? branded retail stores in Europe and Asia. In North America, we also see opportunities, particularly with our newer store concepts. We will continue to regularly evaluate and implement initiatives that we believe will build brand equity, grow our business and enhance profitability.            Our North American retail growth strategy is to increase retail sales and profitability by expanding our network of retail stores and improving the productivity and performance of existing stores. We will continue to emphasize our new G by GUESS store concept and our accessories business. This includes greater focus on our accessories line in our existing stores and the expansion of our GUESS? Accessories store concept. We currently plan to open between 40 and 45 retail stores across all concepts in the U.S. and Canada during fiscal 2012. In addition, we plan to reinvest in key existing locations as part of the roll-out of our new store designs. In February 2011, we opened our largest flagship store in the world in New York City with over 13,000 square feet.            In Europe, we will continue to focus on developing new markets in Northern Europe where our brand is well known but under-penetrated and expand on our recent success in Western and Southern Europe. The Company is planning to increase the number of directly operated GUESS? retail stores in Europe. We recently opened flagship stores in Knightsbridge, London and Paseo di Gracia, Barcelona and we have expanded our existing flagship store in Milan, Italy. Together with our licensee partners, we plan to continue our international expansion in Europe by opening between 125 and 130 retail stores in fiscal 2012, about a quarter of which will be owned and operated directly by us.            We see significant market opportunities in Asia and we are dedicating capital and human resources to support the region's growth and development. We and our partners have opened flagship stores in key cities such as Seoul, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Macau, Taipei and Beijing and have partnered with licensees to    31             develop our business in the second tier cities in this region. We and our partners plan to open 70 retail stores across all concepts in Asia during fiscal 2012.            The Company's capital expenditures for the full fiscal year 2012 are planned at approximately $150 million (before deducting estimated lease incentives of approximately $10 million), which includes key money investments for new European stores. The planned capital expenditures are primarily for expansion of our retail businesses in Europe and North America, store remodeling programs, expansion of our Asia business, investments in information systems, and other infrastructure investments.     Other             The Company reports National Retail Federation ("NRF") calendar comparable store sales on a quarterly basis for our full-price retail and factory outlet stores in the U.S. and Canada. A store is considered comparable after it has been open for 13 full months. If a store remodel results in a square footage change of more than 15%, or involves a relocation or a change in store concept, the store is removed from the comparable store base until it has been opened at its new size, in its new location or under its new concept for 13 full months.     Executive Summary      The Company             Net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. increased 19.3% to $289.5 million, or diluted earnings of $3.11 per common share, for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. of $242.8 million, or diluted earnings of $2.61 per common share, for the year ended January 30, 2010. The fiscal 2011 results included a benefit to revenues related to a revision in the estimated liability from the Company's loyalty program of $6.7 million before taxes (or $0.05 per diluted share) and an unfavorable impact related to the acceleration of pension cost amortization as a result of the curtailment in the Company's supplemental executive retirement plan ("SERP") resulting from the departure of Carlos Alberini, our former President and Chief Operating Officer, of $5.8 million before taxes (or $0.04 per diluted share).            Total net revenue increased 16.9% to $2,487.3 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from $2,128.5 million in the prior year. Revenues increased in all our segments and our international businesses drove the majority of our revenue growth. On a combined basis, our Europe and Asia segments represented 63.2% of the revenue increase. In constant U.S. dollars, revenues increased by 18.2% as currency translation fluctuations relating to our foreign operations unfavorably impacted reported net revenue for the year ended January 29, 2011 by $28.1 million compared to the prior year.            Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total net revenues) declined 40 basis points to 43.8% for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to 44.2% in the prior year. The negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on product purchases, increased occupancy costs due to retail expansion in Europe, lower initial markups in Europe, and higher markdowns in our North American retail segment were the main factors contributing to the lower gross margin.             Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses, including asset impairment charges, increased 16.7% to $679.8 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $582.7 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by higher expenses and infrastructure costs to support our global retail expansion, higher volume driven expenses and higher marketing investments to enhance our brand's awareness around the world. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our foreign operations favorably impacted SG&A compared to the same prior-year period. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues ("SG&A rate"), including asset impairment charges, remained flat at 27.3% for the year ended January 29, 2011 compared to the prior year.    32                   In fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a supplemental executive retirement plan curtailment expense of $5.8 million before taxes related to the accelerated amortization of prior service cost resulting from the departure of Carlos Alberini, the Company's former President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Alberini's departure resulted in a significant reduction in the total expected remaining years of future service of all participants combined, triggering the pension curtailment.             Earnings from operations increased 12.8% to $404.6 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $358.8 million in the prior year. Operating margin declined 60 basis points to 16.3% for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to 16.9% in the prior year as a result of the lower gross margin. Currency translation fluctuations relating to all our foreign operations unfavorably impacted earnings from operations by $7.3 million.            Other income, net, (including interest income and expense) totaled $16.7 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to other income, net, of $3.1 million in the prior year. Other income, net, in the year ended January 29, 2011 primarily consisted of net mark-to-market revaluation gains on foreign currency balances and contracts and net gains on non-operating assets.            Our effective income tax rate decreased 180 basis points to 30.1% for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to 31.9% in the prior year, primarily due to a larger mix of taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions in fiscal 2011.            The Company had $442.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities as of January 29, 2011, down $60.0 million, compared to $502.1 million as of January 30, 2010. Dividends paid to shareholders during fiscal year 2011, including a special dividend of $2.00 per common share paid during the fourth quarter, were $247.1 million compared to $41.6 million paid during fiscal year 2010. Total borrowings as of January 29, 2011, primarily related to our capital lease in Europe, was $14.4 million, down $2.1 million from $16.5 million as of January 30, 2010. Accounts receivable increased by $74.8 million, or 26.3%, to $358.5 million at January 29, 2011, compared to $283.7 million at January 30, 2010. This increase was primarily driven by the sales growth in our European wholesale business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Inventory increased by $41.5 million, or 16.4%, to $294.7 million as of January 29, 2011, compared to $253.2 million as of January 30, 2010. The increase in inventory primarily supports the expansion of our European business, including a significant increase in our retail store base, as well as growth in our North American businesses.     North American Retail             Our North American retail segment, comprising North American full-price retail stores, factory outlet stores and e-commerce, generated net sales of $1,069.9 million during the year ended January 29, 2011, an increase of $86.0 million, or 8.7%, from $983.9 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by a larger store base, which represented a net 4.4% increase in average square footage compared to the year ended January 30, 2010, positive comparable store sales of 2.9% (1.1% in local currency, which excludes the favorable translation impact of currency fluctuations relating to our Canadian retail stores) and the benefit to revenues of $6.7 million related to a revision in the estimated liability from the Company's loyalty program. North American retail earnings from operations decreased by $9.7 million, or 7.3%, to $122.6 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $132.3 million in the prior year. Operating margin decreased by 190 basis points to 11.5% for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to 13.4% for the year ended January 30, 2010. The decrease in both earnings from operations and operating margin was due primarily to higher expenses to support our retail store expansion, the impact of higher markdowns on product margins and higher marketing costs, partially offset by the favorable impact to earnings from the higher sales and the benefit to revenues related to a revision in the estimated liability from the Company's loyalty program. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our non-U.S. retail stores favorably impacted earnings from operations by $3.2 million.    33                   In fiscal 2011, we opened 59 new stores in the U.S. and Canada and closed 10 stores. At January 29, 2011, we operated 481 stores in the U.S. and Canada, comprised of 192 full-price GUESS? retail stores, 118 GUESS? factory outlet stores, 60 GUESS? Accessories stores, 57 GUESS by MARCIANO stores, and 54 G by GUESS stores. This compares to 432 stores as of January 30, 2010.     Europe             In Europe, revenues increased by $173.1 million, or 23.2%, to $920.3 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $747.2 million in the prior year. All of our European businesses contributed to this growth. We expanded our base of directly operated stores and our existing stores generated positive comparable store sales. Our existing wholesale business also grew in the year, which included sales from our new international jewelry business and earlier deliveries of our spring product, primarily in our accessories business, which resulted in a favorable shift of orders delivered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 which would have normally occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2012. The increase was partially offset by the unfavorable currency translation impact on revenues of $62.0 million caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At January 29, 2011, we directly operated 141 stores in Europe compared to 84 stores at January 30, 2010, excluding concessions. Earnings from operations from our Europe segment increased $20.1 million, or 11.6%, to $193.3 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $173.2 million in the prior year. Operating margin declined 220 basis points to 21.0% for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to 23.2% for the prior year. The decline resulted from lower gross margins due to the stronger U.S. dollar's impact on product purchases, higher occupancy costs, given our retail expansion in the region and lower initial markups in our wholesale business. These were partially offset by the improved product margins in our directly operated retail stores as well as the favorable impact of product and channel mix. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our Europe business unfavorably impacted earnings from operations by $13.6 million.     Asia             In Asia, revenue increased by $53.6 million, or 36.4%, to $200.9 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $147.3 million in the prior year. All of our Asia businesses contributed to this growth, led by our South Korea business. We continued to grow our Asia business, where we, along with our partners, opened 43 stores and 80 concessions during the year ended January 29, 2011. Our Greater China business also increased revenues as we continue to develop our business in this region in both first and second tier cities. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our South Korea operations favorably impacted net revenue in our Asia segment by $9.8 million. Earnings from operations from our Asia segment increased by $12.8 million, or 80.9%, to $28.6 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $15.8 million in the prior year. Operating margin increased 360 basis points to 14.3% for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to 10.7% for the prior year. The improvement was driven by the leveraging of occupancy and SG&A expenses, and overall higher product margins. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our South Korea business favorably impacted earnings from operations by $1.6 million.     North American Wholesale             Our North American wholesale segment revenue increased by $28.3 million, or 18.5%, to $181.0 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from $152.7 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by higher sales in all our businesses, led by the U.S. wholesale business. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our non-U.S. wholesale businesses favorably impacted net revenue in our North American wholesale segment by $4.8 million. North American wholesale earnings from operations increased by $11.0 million, or 31.2%, to $46.2 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $35.2 million in the prior year. Operating margin improved by 250 basis points to 25.5% for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to 23.0% for the year ended January 30, 2010. The operating margin    34             expansion was primarily driven by SG&A expense leverage compared to the prior year. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our non-U.S. wholesale businesses favorably impacted earnings from operations by $1.5 million.     Licensing             Our licensing royalty revenues increased by $17.8 million, or 18.4%, to $115.2 million, compared to $97.4 million in the prior year, driven by royalties from higher sales in our watches, handbags, footwear and eyewear categories, partially offset by the loss of royalties as a result of the direct operation of our international jewelry business since January 2010. Earnings from operations increased by $17.6 million to $104.2 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $86.6 million for the year ended January 30, 2010.     Corporate Overhead             Corporate overhead expenses increased by $5.9 million, or 7.0%, to $90.2 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from $84.3 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the pension curtailment expense.      Global Store Count             In fiscal 2011, together with our partners, we opened 237 new stores worldwide, consisting of 125 stores in Europe and the Middle East, 59 stores in the U.S. and Canada, 43 stores in Asia and 10 stores in Central and South America. Together with our partners we closed 74 stores worldwide, including 39 stores in Europe and the Middle East, 21 stores in Asia, 10 stores in the U.S. and Canada and 4 stores in Central and South America.             We ended fiscal 2011 with 1,373 stores worldwide, comprised as follows:                                 Region          Total Stores      Directly  Operated Stores      Licensee Stores          United States and Canada        481        481                 Europe and the Middle East        474        141        333         Asia        357        28        329         Other        61        19        42                                   Total        1,373        669        704                                               This store count does not include 267 concessions located primarily in South Korea and Greater China because of their smaller store size in relation to our standard international store size. Of the total 1,373 stores, 942 were GUESS? stores, 267 were GUESS? Accessories stores, 101 were GUESS by MARCIANO stores and 63 were G by GUESS stores.      Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates             The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the valuation of inventories, accounts receivable allowances, sales return allowances, loyalty and gift card accruals, the useful life of assets for    35             depreciation, restructuring expense and accruals, evaluation of asset impairment, recoverability of deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, workers compensation accruals, litigation reserves, pension obligations and share-based compensation.            The Company believes that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. In addition to the accounting policies mentioned below, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for other significant accounting policies.       Accounts receivable reserves               In the normal course of business, the Company grants credit directly to certain wholesale customers after a credit analysis is performed based on financial and other criteria. Accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the inability of its wholesale customers to make their required payments. The Company bases its allowances on analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements, assessments of historical collection trends, an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions and whether the Company has obtained credit insurance or other guarantees.            Costs associated with customer markdowns are recorded as a reduction to revenues, and any unapplied amounts are included in the allowance for accounts receivable. Historically, these markdown allowances resulted from seasonal negotiations with the Company's wholesale customers, as well as historical trends and the evaluation of the impact of economic conditions.       Sales returns reserves               The Company accrues for estimated sales returns in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. To recognize the financial impact of sales returns, the Company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned based on historical experience and reduces sales and cost of sales accordingly based on historical return experience. The Company's policy allows retail customers in certain regions a 30 day period to return merchandise following the date of sale. Substantially all of these returns are considered to be resalable at a price that exceeds the cost of the merchandise.       Inventory reserves               Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (primarily weighted average method) or market. The Company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving product as well as prior seasons' inventory. Market value of aged inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for each product line category, the impact of market trends, an evaluation of economic conditions, available liquidation channels and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory. The Company closely monitors off-price sales to ensure the actual results closely match initial estimates. Estimates are regularly updated based upon this continuing review.       Valuation of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets               The Company assesses the impairment of its long-lived assets (i.e., goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment), which requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. An asset is considered to be impaired if the Company determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon its assessment of the asset's ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods or if significant changes in the Company's strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets occurred. If the assets (other than goodwill) are assessed to be recoverable, they are depreciated or amortized over the periods benefited. If the assets are considered to be impaired, an impairment charge is recognized representing the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of those assets. Fair value is    36           determined based upon the discounted cash flows derived from the underlying asset. We use various assumptions in determining current fair market value of these assets, including future expected cash flows and discount rates. Future expected cash flows for store assets are based on management's estimates of future cash flows over the remaining lease period or expected life, if shorter. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations. See Notes 1 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.       Pension benefit plan actuarial assumptions               The Company's pension obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, within the authoritative guidance framework. The discount rate and estimated future compensation are both important elements of expense and/or liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions annually which enables us to state expected future payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan related information.       Litigation reserves               Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the expected favorable or unfavorable outcome of each claim. As additional information becomes available, the Company assesses the potential liability related to new claims and existing claims and revises estimates as appropriate. As new claims arise or existing claims evolve, such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position.       Share-based compensation               Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of authoritative guidance using the modified prospective transition method. Under this method, compensation cost recognized after January 1, 2006 includes: (a) compensation expense for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value and (b) compensation expense for all share-based payments granted on or after January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with authoritative guidance. The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for new grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time of grant. The expected volatility is determined based on an average of both historical volatility and implied volatility. Implied volatility is derived from exchange traded options on the Company's common stock. The expected life used prior to November 2007 was based on the "simplified" method described in authoritative guidance. For options granted beginning November 2007, the expected term is determined based on historical trends. The dividend yield for 2006 and prior years was assumed to be zero since the Company had not historically declared and did not have a plan to declare dividends on an ongoing basis until the Board of Directors authorized and approved the initiation of quarterly dividends in February 2007. The expected dividend yield starting from 2007 is based on the Company's history and expectations of dividend payouts. The expected forfeiture rate is determined based on historical data. Compensation expense for nonvested stock options and stock awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.            In addition, the Company grants certain nonvested stock awards and stock options that require the recipient to achieve certain minimum performance targets in order for these awards to vest. If the minimum performance targets have not been achieved or are not expected to be achieved, no expense is recorded during the period.    37              Income taxes               The Company adopted authoritative guidance in January 2007, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Guidance was also provided on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations. The Company's continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.            Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized. As all earnings from the Company's foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed, the Company's income tax provision does not include additional U.S. taxes on foreign operations.       Hedge accounting               The Company operates in foreign countries, which exposes it to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company has entered into certain forward contracts to hedge the risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations. The Company has elected to apply the hedge accounting rules in accordance with authoritative guidance for certain of these hedges.            The Company's objective is to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flows due to the foreign currency risk. Various transactions that occur in Canada, Europe and South Korea are denominated in U.S. dollars, British pounds or Swiss francs and thus are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to their functional currencies. These types of transactions include U.S. dollar denominated purchases of merchandise and U.S. dollar and British pound intercompany liabilities. In addition, certain sales, operating expenses, and tax liabilities are denominated in Swiss francs and are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to the functional currency. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts to manage exchange risk on certain of these anticipated foreign currency transactions. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in cost of product sales, SG&A or other income and expenses in the period which approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold or the hedged operating expense and hedged intercompany liability is incurred.            The Company also has foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expenses.       Gift card breakage               Gift card breakage is income recognized due to the non-redemption of a portion of gift cards sold by the Company for which a liability was recorded in prior periods. Estimated breakage amounts are accounted for under the redemption recognition method and are classified as additional net revenues as the gift cards are redeemed. The Company determined a gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns, which represented the cumulative estimated amount of gift card breakage from the inception of the electronic gift card program in late 2002. Any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage income recognized in future periods. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the recognition of gift card breakage.    38        NAME="page_dq49901_1_39">                                               Loyalty programs               The Company launched customer loyalty programs for its G by GUESS, GUESS? and GUESS by MARCIANO stores in July 2009, August 2008 and September 2007, respectively. The GUESS? and GUESS by MARCIANO loyalty programs were merged in May 2009. Under the programs, customers accumulate points based on purchase activity. Once a loyalty program member achieves a certain point level, the member earns awards that may only be redeemed for merchandise. The programs have expiration dates for the points and awards. Prior to fiscal 2011, all unexpired, unredeemed points and awards were accrued in current liabilities and recorded as a reduction of net sales as points were accumulated by the member. In fiscal 2011, the Company revised its approach to estimate the value of future award redemptions under the existing loyalty program by incorporating historical redemption rates. In connection with this revision, the Company recorded a cumulative adjustment of $6.7 million to increase net revenue and to adjust the current liability balance to an amount reflecting estimated future award redemptions. This adjustment had a favorable impact of $0.05 per share. The aggregate dollar value of the loyalty program accruals included in accrued liabilities was $2.7 million and $9.8 million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively. Future revisions to the estimated liability may result in changes to net revenue.     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS             The following table sets forth actual operating results for the fiscal years ended January 29, 2011, January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009 as a percentage of net revenue:                                        Year Ended              Jan. 29,  2011      Jan. 30,  2010      Jan. 31,  2009          Product sales        95.4  %     95.4  %     95.2  %      Net royalties        4.6        4.6        4.8                                      Total net revenue        100.0        100.0        100.0         Cost of product sales        56.2        55.8        55.9                                   Gross profit        43.8        44.2        44.1         Selling, general and administrative expenses        27.1        27.1        27.2         Pension curtailment expense        0.2                         Asset impairment charges        0.2        0.2        1.2                                      Earnings from operations        16.3        16.9        15.7         Interest expense        (0.1  )     (0.1  )     (0.2  )      Interest income        0.1        0.1        0.3         Other income (expense), net        0.6        0.1        (0.6  )                                   Earnings before income taxes        16.9        17.0        15.2         Income taxes        5.1        5.4        5.0                                      Net earnings        11.8        11.6        10.2         Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests        0.2        0.2                                              Net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc.         11.6  %     11.4  %     10.2  %                                     Year Ended January 29, 2011 Compared to Year Ended January 30, 2010       NET REVENUE.     Net revenue for the year ended January 29, 2011 increased by $358.8 million, or 16.9%, to $2,487.3 million, from $2,128.5 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. Revenues increased in all our segments and our international business drove the majority of our revenue growth. On a combined basis, our Europe and Asia segments represented 63.2% of the revenue increase. In constant U.S. dollars,    39           revenues increased by 18.2% as currency translation fluctuations relating to our foreign operations unfavorably impacted net revenue by $28.1 million compared to the prior year.             Net revenue from our North American retail operations increased by $86.0 million, or 8.7%, to $1,069.9 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from $983.9 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. This increase was primarily due to a larger store base, positive comparable store sales of 2.9% (1.1% in local currency, which excludes the favorable translation impact of currency fluctuations relating to our Canadian retail stores) and a $6.7 million increase to revenues related to a revision in the estimated liability from the Company's loyalty program. The store base increased by an average of 22 net additional stores during the year ended January 29, 2011 compared to the prior year, resulting in a net 4.4% increase in average square footage. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our non-U.S. retail stores favorably impacted net revenue in our retail segment by $19.3 million.            Net revenue from our Europe operations increased by $173.1 million, or 23.2%, to $920.3 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from $747.2 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. All of our European businesses contributed to this growth. We expanded our base of directly operated stores and our existing stores generated positive comparable store sales. Our existing wholesale business also grew in the year, which included sales from our new international jewelry business and earlier deliveries of our spring product, primarily in our accessories business, which resulted in a favorable shift of orders delivered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 which would have normally occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2012. At January 29, 2011, we directly operated 141 stores in Europe compared to 84 stores at the prior year end, excluding concessions. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our European operations unfavorably impacted net revenue by $62.0 million.            Net revenue from our Asia operations increased by $53.6 million, or 36.4%, to $200.9 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from $147.3 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. We continued to grow our Asia business, where we, along with our partners, opened 43 stores and 80 concessions during the year ended January 29, 2011. Our South Korea business continued to drive the growth in this region with a greater number of doors compared to the same prior-year period and stronger existing door performance. Our Greater China business also increased revenues as we continue to develop our business in this region in both first and second tier cities. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our South Korea operations favorably impacted net revenue in our Asia segment by $9.8 million.            Net revenue from our North American wholesale operations increased by $28.3 million, or 18.5%, to $181.0 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from $152.7 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase was driven by higher sales in all our businesses, led by the U.S. wholesale business. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our non-U.S. wholesale businesses favorably impacted net revenue in our North American wholesale segment by $4.8 million.            Net royalty revenue from licensing operations increased by $17.8 million, or 18.4%, to $115.2 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from $97.4 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. This increase was driven by royalties on higher sales in our watches, handbags, footwear and eyewear categories, partially offset by the loss of royalties as a result of the direct operation of our international jewelry business since January 2010.     GROSS PROFIT.     Gross profit increased by $148.7 million, or 15.8%, to $1,090.2 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from $941.5 million for the year ended January 30, 2010 due to the growth in revenue, partially offset by higher occupancy costs. While all segments contributed to the growth, the largest increase in gross profit came from our Europe segment.            Gross margin declined 40 basis points to 43.8% for the year ended January 29, 2011, from 44.2% for the year ended January 30, 2010. The negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on product purchases, increased occupancy costs due to retail expansion in Europe, lower initial markups in Europe, and higher    40             markdowns in our North American retail segment were the main factors contributing to the lower gross margin.            The Company's gross margin may not be comparable to other entities since some entities include all of the costs related to their distribution in cost of product sales and others, like the Company, exclude the wholesale related distribution costs from gross margin, including them instead in SG&A expenses.      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.     SG&A expenses, including asset impairment charges, increased by $97.1 million, or 16.7%, to $679.8 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from $582.7 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase was driven by higher expenses and infrastructure costs to support our global retail expansion, higher volume driven expenses and higher marketing investments to enhance our brand's awareness around the world. The SG&A rate, including asset impairment charges, remained flat at 27.3% for the year ended January 29, 2011 compared to the prior year.      PENSION CURTAILMENT EXPENSE.     In fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a supplemental executive retirement plan curtailment expense of $5.8 million before taxes related to the accelerated amortization of prior service cost resulting from the departure of Carlos Alberini, the Company's former President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Alberini's departure resulted in a significant reduction in the total expected remaining years of future service of all participants combined, triggering the pension curtailment.      EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS.     Earnings from operations increased by $45.8 million, or 12.8%, to $404.6 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from $358.8 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase in earnings from operations primarily resulted from the following:       Earnings from operations for the North American retail segment decreased by $9.7 million to $122.6 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $132.3 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The decrease in earnings from operations was due primarily to higher expenses to support our retail store expansion, the impact of higher markdowns on product margins and higher marketing costs, partially offset by the favorable impact to earnings from the higher sales and the $6.7 million benefit to revenues related to a revision in the estimated liability from the Company's loyalty program. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our non-U.S. retail stores favorably impacted earnings from operations by $3.2 million.       Earnings from operations for the Europe segment increased $20.1 million to $193.3 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $173.2 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase was driven by sales growth from all of our European businesses, led by the expansion of our directly operated retail store base, improved product margins in our directly operated stores and higher sales from our new jewelry business. This increase was partially offset by lower gross margins due to the stronger U.S. dollar's impact on product purchases, higher occupancy costs, given our retail expansion in the region and lower initial markups. Currency translation fluctuations unfavorably impacted earnings from operations by $13.6 million.       Earnings from operations for the Asia segment increased by $12.8 million to $28.6 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $15.8 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase was driven by growth in all of our businesses in the region, the leveraging of occupancy and SG&A expenses, and overall higher product margins. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our South Korea business favorably impacted earnings from operations by $1.6 million.       Earnings from operations for the North American wholesale segment increased by $11.0 million to $46.2 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $35.2 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase in earnings from operations was mainly due to sales growth and the leveraging of SG&A expenses. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our non-U.S. wholesale businesses favorably impacted earnings from operations by $1.5 million.    41              Earnings from operations for the licensing segment increased by $17.6 million to $104.2 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $86.6 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase was driven by increased royalties due to higher licensed product sales, partially offset by the loss of royalties as a result of the direct operation of our international jewelry business since January 2010.       Unallocated corporate overhead increased by $5.9 million to $90.2 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $84.3 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase was primarily driven by the pension curtailment expense.             Operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 16.3% for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to 16.9% for the year ended January 30, 2010. The operating margin decrease was primarily due to the overall lower gross margins.     INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME.     Interest expense decreased to $1.2 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $2.2 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. At January 29, 2011, total borrowings, primarily related to our capital lease in Europe was $14.4 million, compared to $16.5 million at January 30, 2010. The decrease was due to lower average debt balances in Europe. The average debt balance for the year ended January 29, 2011, was $14.7 million, versus an average debt balance of $42.5 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, which included the use of certain lines of credit during the prior year. Interest income decreased slightly to $1.6 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $1.7 million for the year ended January 30, 2010.      OTHER INCOME, NET.     Other income, net, was $16.4 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to other income, net, of $3.6 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. Other income, net, in the year ended January 29, 2011 primarily consisted of net mark-to-market revaluation gains on foreign currency balances and contracts and net gains on non-operating assets. Other income, net, for the year ended January 30, 2010 primarily resulted from net mark-to-market gains related to our insurance policy investments, partially offset by net mark-to-market losses related to the revaluation of foreign currency balances and contracts.      INCOME TAXES.     Income tax expense for the year ended January 29, 2011 was $126.9 million, or a 30.1% effective tax rate, compared to income tax expense of $115.6 million, or a 31.9% effective tax rate, for the year ended January 30, 2010. The lower tax rate in the current year was primarily due to a larger mix of taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions in fiscal 2011.      NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS.     Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended January 29, 2011 was $5.0 million, net of taxes, as compared to $3.6 million, net of taxes, for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase was due to higher earnings from our Mexico operations.      NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GUESS?, INC.     Net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. increased by $46.7 million, or 19.3%, to $289.5 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from $242.8 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. Diluted earnings per common share increased to $3.11 per share for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $2.61 per share for the year ended January 30, 2010.     Year Ended January 30, 2010 Compared to Year Ended January 31, 2009       NET REVENUE.     Net revenue for the year ended January 30, 2010 increased by $35.1 million, or 1.7%, to $2,128.5 million, from $2,093.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. Our Europe, Asia, and North American retail segments increased revenues for the year ended January 30, 2010, while North American wholesale revenues and royalty revenues in our licensing business declined. Currency translation    42           fluctuations relating to all our foreign operations unfavorably impacted net revenue by $47.0 million compared to the prior year.            Net revenue from our North American retail operations increased by $5.9 million, or 0.6%, to $983.9 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $978.0 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The slight increase was driven by an average of 26 net additional stores during the year ended January 30, 2010, resulting in a net 5.6% increase in average square footage compared to the prior year. This growth was partially offset by a decline in comparable stores sales of 4.5%. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our Canadian retail stores unfavorably impacted net revenue in our retail segment by $5.6 million.            Net revenue from our Europe operations increased by $28.2 million, or 3.9%, to $747.2 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $719.0 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase was driven primarily by our retail business in Europe. Wholesale revenues in Europe increased slightly, resulting from the addition of our new international jewelry business, which before January 2010, was operated as a licensed business. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our European operations unfavorably impacted net revenue by $29.5 million. At January 30, 2010, we directly operated 84 stores in Europe compared to 61 stores at the prior year end.            Net revenue from our Asia operations increased by $27.4 million, or 22.9%, to $147.3 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $119.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. All of our Asia businesses contributed to this growth, with a greater number of doors compared to the prior year. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our South Korea operations unfavorably impacted net revenue in our Asia segment by $8.6 million.             Net revenue from our North American wholesale operations decreased by $23.6 million, or 13.4%, to $152.7 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $176.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. Our U.S. wholesale business continued to be impacted by the economic downturn as department stores continued to manage their inventories tightly. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our non-U.S. businesses unfavorably impacted net revenue in our North American wholesale segment by $3.3 million.            Net royalty revenue from licensing operations decreased by $2.9 million, or 2.9%, to $97.4 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $100.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. This decrease was driven primarily by lower royalties resulting from lower watch product sales.      GROSS PROFIT.     Gross profit increased by $18.9 million, or 2.0%, to $941.5 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $922.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. This increase was primarily driven by our North American retail, Asia and Europe segments, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations and a decline in sales from our North American wholesale segment.             Gross margin increased slightly by 10 basis points to 44.2% for the year ended January 30, 2010, from 44.1% for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase was attributable to higher product margins in our North American retail and Asia segments, offset by occupancy deleverage in our Europe and North American retail segments as a result of a larger mix of European retail stores and negative comparable store sales.      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.     SG&A expenses, including asset impairment charges, decreased by $11.1 million, or 1.9%, to $582.7 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $593.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The decrease was driven by lower asset impairment charges related to our retail stores of $4.7 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $24.4 million of impairment charges for the year ended January 31, 2009. The decrease was also driven by lower marketing expenses during fiscal year 2010 as compared to the prior year and the favorable impact of the stronger dollar versus the prior year when translating SG&A expenses for our foreign operations into U.S. dollars. The decrease was partially offset by higher store selling expenses, due    43             to our retail expansion in Europe, as well as higher performance-based and other compensation related costs.            The SG&A rate improved by 100 basis points to 27.4% for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to 28.4% in the prior year. The net impact of the asset impairment charges during the year ended January 30, 2010 and the prior year accounted for all this improvement.      EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS.     Earnings from operations increased by $30.0 million, or 9.1%, to $358.8 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $328.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase in earnings from operations primarily resulted from the following:       Earnings from operations for the North American retail segment increased by $39.1 million to $132.3 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $93.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase in earnings from operations was driven by higher gross profit, lower asset impairment charges, and lower operating and marketing expenses.       Earnings from operations for the Europe segment increased $4.6 million to $173.2 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $168.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase was due primarily to sales growth in our retail business and lower marketing expenses, partially offset by higher store selling expenses to support the expansion of our retail business in the region. The currency translation fluctuations unfavorably impacted earnings from operations by $5.9 million.       Earnings from operations for the Asia segment increased by $10.1 million to $15.8 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $5.7 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase was driven by growth in all of our businesses in the region, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses to support that growth and the unfavorable translation impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on the South Korean business. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our South Korea business unfavorably impacted earnings from operations by $1.1 million.       Earnings from operations for the North American wholesale segment decreased by $4.6 million to $35.2 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $39.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The decrease in earnings from operations was mainly driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by lower operating and marketing expenses. Currency translation fluctuations relating to non-U.S. wholesale businesses unfavorably impacted earnings from operations by $0.6 million.       Earnings from operations for the licensing segment increased by $0.2 million to $86.6 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $86.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase was the result of lower marketing expenses, partially offset by lower royalty revenues.       Unallocated corporate overhead increased by $19.4 million to $84.3 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $64.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher performance-based and other compensation related costs, and higher professional fees, partially offset by lower brand marketing expenses.             Operating margin improved 120 basis points to 16.9% for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to 15.7% for the year ended January 31, 2009, primarily as a result of the lower SG&A rate.      INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME.     Interest expense decreased to $2.2 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $4.7 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The decrease was due to a combination of lower average debt balances in Europe and lower average interest rates on the debt. Total debt at January 30, 2010 was $16.5 million, and was primarily related to our capital lease in Europe. The average debt balance for the year ended January 30, 2010, was $42.5 million, versus an average debt balance of $59.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. Interest income decreased to    44             $1.7 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $6.1 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, due to lower interest rates on invested cash, partially offset by higher average invested cash balances.      OTHER INCOME OR EXPENSE, NET.     Other income, net, was $3.6 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to other expense, net, of $11.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. Other income, net, in the year ended January 30, 2010, primarily consisted of net mark-to-market gains related to our insurance policy investments, partially offset by net mark-to-market losses related to the revaluation of foreign currency balances and contracts. Other expense, net, for the year ended January 31, 2009 primarily resulted from the decline in value of insurance policy investments and other non-operating assets.      INCOME TAXES.     Income tax expense for the year ended January 30, 2010 was $115.6 million, or a 31.9% effective tax rate, compared to income tax expense of $103.8 million, or a 32.6% effective tax rate, for the year ended January 31, 2009. The lower tax rate in fiscal year 2010 was due to a higher proportion of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.      NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS.     Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended January 30, 2010 was $3.6 million, net of taxes, as compared to $1.5 million, net of taxes, for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase was due to higher earnings from our Focus and Mexico operations.      NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GUESS?, INC.     Net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. increased by $29.2 million, or 13.7%, to $242.8 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $213.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. Diluted earnings per common share increased to $2.61 per share for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $2.25 per share for the year ended January 31, 2009.      LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES             We need liquidity primarily to fund our working capital, the expansion and remodeling of our retail stores, shop-in-shop programs, concessions, systems, infrastructure, other existing operations, international growth, potential acquisitions, potential share repurchases and payment of dividends to our stockholders. During the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011, the Company relied on trade credit, available cash, real estate leases, and internally generated funds to finance our operations and expansion. The Company anticipates that we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements during the next twelve months for working capital, capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on our debt, potential acquisitions, potential share repurchases and dividend payments to stockholders, primarily with cash flow from operations and existing cash balances supplemented by borrowings, if necessary, under the Credit Facility and bank facilities in Europe, as described below under "Credit Facilities." There are no borrowings relating to the existing Credit Facility. As of January 29, 2011, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $427.0 million and short-term investments of $15.1 million. Excess cash and cash equivalents, which represent the majority of our outstanding cash and cash equivalents balance, are held primarily in three diversified money market funds. The funds are all AAA rated by national credit rating agencies and are generally comprised of high-quality, liquid investments. As of January 29, 2011, we do not have any exposure to auction-rate security investments in these funds. Please see "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors" for a discussion of risk factors which could reasonably be likely to result in a decrease of internally generated funds available to finance capital expenditures and working capital requirements.            The Company has presented below the cash flow performance comparison of the year ended January 29, 2011, versus the year ended January 30, 2010.    45            Operating Activities             Net cash provided by operating activities was $346.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $358.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010, or a decrease of $11.8 million. The decrease was driven by the unfavorable timing impact of working capital changes on operating cash flows as a result of the higher growth in accounts receivable, inventory and related indirect tax receivables during the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to the prior year period, where we had experienced a slow down in growth due to the global economic conditions at the time. The trend was most evident in our European operation which is our largest wholesale business and represents the majority of our accounts receivable balance. This was partially offset by higher net earnings and the favorable benefit of the growth in accounts payable and accrued expenses relative to the prior year.            At January 29, 2011, the Company had working capital (including cash and cash equivalents) of $732.6 million compared to $781.4 million at January 30, 2010. The Company's primary working capital needs are for inventory and accounts receivable. Accounts receivable at January 29, 2011 amounted to $358.5 million, up $74.8 million, compared to $283.7 million at January 30, 2010. This increase was primarily driven by the sales growth in our European wholesale business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Approximately $171.6 million of our receivables, or 47.9% of the $358.5 million in accounts receivable at January 29, 2011, were insured for collection purposes or subject to certain bank guarantees or letters of credit. Inventory at January 29, 2011 amounted to $294.7 million compared to $253.2 million at January 30, 2010. The increase in inventory primarily supports the expansion of our European business, including a significant increase in our retail store base, as well as growth in our North American businesses.      Investing Activities             Net cash used in investing activities was $146.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $90.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010. Cash used in investing activities related primarily to the expansion of our European and North American retail businesses, capital expenditures incurred on existing store remodeling programs in North America and Europe, purchase of short-term investment securities, investments in information systems, expansion of our Asia business, improvements to our headquarter buildings and other enhancements.            The increase in cash used in investing activities related primarily to the higher spending on new stores and remodeling of existing stores during the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011 versus the prior year and the purchase of short-term investment securities in the current year, partially offset by higher spending on improvements to headquarter buildings in the prior year and the favorable settlement of foreign currency forward contracts compared to the prior year. During the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011, the Company opened 126 owned stores compared to 43 owned stores that were opened in the prior year.     Financing Activities             Net cash used in financing activities was $277.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $61.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in the current period compared to the prior year was due primarily to higher dividends during the current period and higher repurchases of shares of the Company's common stock under the 2008 Share Repurchase Program, partially offset by higher repayments of borrowings in the prior year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company paid a special cash dividend of $2.00 per share and increased its regular quarterly cash dividend from $0.16 to $0.20 per share.    46        NAME="page_ds49901_1_47">                                                Contractual Obligations and Commitments             The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations at January 29, 2011 and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands):                                              Payments due by period              Total      Less than  1 year      1-3  years      3-5  years      More than  5 years          Contractual Obligations:                                                      Short-term borrowings     $  524     $  524     $       $       $           Capital lease obligations(1)        16,664        2,864        4,409        4,308        5,083         Operating lease obligations(2)        1,134,115        168,789        310,712        264,259        390,355         Purchase obligations(3)        160,711        160,711                                 Benefit obligations(4)        101,783        683        1,203        3,741        96,156                                                  Total     $  1,413,797     $  333,571     $  316,324     $  272,308     $  491,594                                               Other commercial commitments(5)     $  1,400     $  1,400     $       $       $                                                          (1) Includes interest on capital lease obligations. (2) Does not include insurance, taxes and common area maintenance charges. In fiscal 2011, these variable charges totaled $50.9 million. (3) Purchase obligations represent open purchase orders for merchandise at the end of the fiscal year. These purchase orders can be impacted by various factors, including the scheduling of market weeks, the timing of issuing orders, the timing of the shipment of orders and currency fluctuations. Accordingly, a comparison of purchase orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful. (4) Includes expected payments associated with the deferred compensation plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan through fiscal 2045. (5) Consists of standby letters of credit for guarantee of foreign subsidiary's borrowings, workers' compensation and general liability insurance.            Excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $17.0 million. This liability for unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded because the Company cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever.     Dividends             During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company announced the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share of the Company's common stock. Since that time, the Company has continued to pay a quarterly cash dividend, which has subsequently increased to $0.20 per common share.             During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company paid a special cash dividend of $2.00 per share of the Company's common stock, totaling approximately $184 million, and a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share. For the years ended January 29, 2011, January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, the Company paid dividends of $247.1 million, $41.6 million and $34.0 million, respectively.            On March 16, 2011, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share of the Company's common stock. The dividend will be payable on April 15, 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2011.             The payment of cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based on a number of business, legal and other considerations, including our cash flow from    47             operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes, earnings, share repurchases and liquidity.      Capital Expenditures             Gross capital expenditures totaled $123.1 million, before deducting lease incentives of $14.2 million, for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011. This compares to gross capital expenditures of $82.3 million, before deducting lease incentives of $5.4 million, for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010. The Company's capital expenditures for the full fiscal year 2012 are planned at approximately $150 million (before deducting estimated lease incentives of approximately $10 million), which includes key money investments for new European stores. The planned capital expenditures are primarily for expansion of our retail businesses in Europe and North America, store remodeling programs, investments in information systems, expansion of our Asia business and other infrastructure investments.             In addition, we periodically evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances and pursue those that we believe will support and contribute to our overall growth initiatives.     Credit Facilities             On September 19, 2006, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit facility led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders (the "Credit Facility"). The Credit Facility provides for an $85 million revolving multicurrency line of credit and is available for direct borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit, subject to certain letters of credit sublimits. The Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on September 30, 2011. The Company is in discussions with potential lenders and fully expects to have a replacement facility in place prior to the scheduled maturity on September 30, 2011. The size, rates and other key terms of the replacement facility have yet to be determined. At January 29, 2011, the Company had $1.4 million in outstanding standby letters of credit, no outstanding documentary letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the terms of the Credit Facility.            The Company, through its European subsidiaries, maintains short-term borrowing agreements, primarily for working capital purposes, with various banks in Europe. Under these agreements, which are generally secured by specific accounts receivable balances, the Company can borrow up to $208.1 million, limited primarily by accounts receivable balances at the time of borrowing. Based on the applicable accounts receivable balances at January 29, 2011, the Company could have borrowed up to approximately $201.5 million under these agreements. However, the Company's ability to borrow through foreign subsidiaries is generally limited to $185.0 million under the terms of the Credit Facility. At January 29, 2011, the Company had no outstanding borrowings and $6.6 million in outstanding documentary letters of credit under these credit agreements. The agreements are primarily denominated in euros and provide for annual interest rates ranging from 0.9% to 3.1%. The maturities of the short-term borrowings are generally linked to the credit terms of the underlying accounts receivable that secure the borrowings. With the exception of one facility for $20.4 million that has a minimum net equity requirement, there are no other financial ratio covenants.             The Company entered into a capital lease in December 2005 for a new building in Florence, Italy. At January 29, 2011, the capital lease obligation was $13.9 million. The Company entered into a separate interest rate swap agreement designated as a non-hedging instrument that resulted in a swap fixed rate of 3.55%. This interest rate swap agreement matures in 2016 and converts the nature of the capital lease obligation from Euribor floating rate debt to fixed rate debt. The fair value of the interest rate swap liability at January 29, 2011 was approximately $0.6 million.            From time to time the Company will obtain other short term financing in foreign countries for working capital to finance its local operations.    48            Share Repurchases             In March 2008, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the previously authorized 2001 share repurchase program and authorized a new program to repurchase, from time to time and as market and business conditions warrant, up to $200 million of the Company's common stock (the "2008 Share Repurchase Program"). During the year ended January 29, 2011, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares under the 2008 Share Repurchase Program at an aggregate cost of $49.3 million, all of which occurred in the second quarter ended July 31, 2010. At January 29, 2011, the Company had remaining authority under the 2008 Share Repurchase Program to purchase an additional $84.9 million of its common stock.            On March 14, 2011, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase, from time-to-time and as market and business conditions warrant, up to $250 million of its common stock. The newly authorized $250 million program (the "2011 Share Repurchase Program") includes $84.9 million remaining under the Company's previously authorized 2008 Share Repurchase Program. Repurchases may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or other available means. There is no minimum or maximum number of shares to be repurchased under the program and the program may be discontinued at any time, without prior notice.     Other             On August 23, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") which became effective January 1, 2006. The SERP provides select employees who satisfy certain eligibility requirements with certain benefits upon retirement, termination of employment, death, disability or a change in control of the Company, in certain prescribed circumstances. The participants in the SERP were Maurice Marciano, Chairman of the Board, Paul Marciano, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman of the Board, and Carlos Alberini, the Company's former President and Chief Operating Officer. In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a $5.8 million charge related to the accelerated amortization of prior service cost resulting from the departure of Mr. Alberini from the Company. As a non-qualified pension plan, no dedicated funding of the SERP is required; however, the Company has and expects to continue to make periodic payments into insurance policies held in a rabbi trust to fund the expected obligations arising under the non-qualified SERP. The amount of future payments may vary, depending on the future years of service, future annual compensation of the participants and investment performance of the trust. The cash surrender values of the insurance policies were $32.9 million and $22.1 million as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively and were included in other assets. As a result of a change in value of the insurance policy investments, the Company recorded gains (losses) of $2.7 million, $3.1 million and $(3.2) million in other income and expenses during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively.            In January 2002, the Company established a qualified employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP"), the terms of which allow for qualified employees (as defined) to participate in the purchase of designated shares of the Company's common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing price at the beginning or end of each quarterly stock purchase period. On January 23, 2002, the Company filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-8 registering 4,000,000 shares of common stock for the ESPP. During the year ended January 29, 2011, 42,695 shares of the Company's common stock were issued pursuant to the ESPP at an average price of $30.69 per share for a total of $1.3 million.     INFLATION             The Company does not believe that inflation trends in the U.S. and internationally over the last three years have had a significant effect on net revenue or profitability. However, the Company anticipates that potential inflationary pressures on raw materials, labor, freight or other commodities including oil, could begin to negatively impact the cost of product purchases primarily in the second half of the fiscal year 2012.    49             The Company has plans to mitigate some of these effects through price increases on select items, supply chain initiatives, reduced markdowns and mix. However, there can be no assurances that these actions will be successful. In addition, increased prices could lead to reduced customer demand. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.     SEASONALITY             The Company's business is impacted by the general seasonal trends characteristic of the apparel and retail industries. The U.S., European and Canadian retail operations are generally stronger during the second half of the fiscal year, and the U.S. and Canadian wholesale operations generally experience stronger performance from July through November. The European wholesale businesses operate with two primary selling seasons: the Spring/Summer season, which primarily ships from November to March and the Fall/Winter season, which primarily ships from May to September. The remaining months of the year are relatively smaller wholesale shipping months in Europe. However, customers retain the ability to request early shipment of backlog orders or delay shipment of orders depending on their needs. Accordingly, a certain amount of orders in the backlog may be shipped outside of the traditional shipping months. The Company's goal is to take advantage of early-season demand and potential reorders by offering a pre-collection assortment for apparel.     RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE             In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that expands the required disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance provides for new disclosures requiring the Company to (a) disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers, and (b) present separately information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance also provides clarification of existing disclosures requiring the Company to (i) determine each class of assets and liabilities based on the nature and risks of the investments rather than by major security type, and (ii) for each class of assets and liabilities, disclose the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 31, 2010, except for the presentation of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of the first phase of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the second phase of this guidance on its disclosures in the Company's consolidated financial statements.     NAME="ds49901_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02650">         ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.          Exchange Rate Risk             Approximately half of product sales and licensing revenue recorded for the year ended January 29, 2011 were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company's primary exchange rate risk relates to operations in Europe, Canada and South Korea. Changes in currencies affect our earnings in various ways. For further discussion on currency related risk, please refer to our risk factors under "Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors."             Various transactions that occur in Canada, Europe and South Korea are denominated in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and British pounds and thus are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to their functional currencies. These types of transactions include U.S. dollar denominated purchases of merchandise, U.S. dollar and British pound denominated intercompany liabilities and certain sales, operating expenses, and tax liabilities denominated in Swiss francs that are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to the functional currency. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exchange risk on certain    50             anticipated foreign currency transactions. The Company does not hedge all transactions denominated in foreign currency.     Forward Contracts Designated as Cash Flow Hedges             During the year ended January 29, 2011, the Company purchased U.S. dollar forward contracts in Europe and Canada totaling US$97.9 million and US$67.9 million, respectively, to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases and intercompany royalties that were designated as cash flow hedges. As of January 29, 2011, the Company had forward contracts outstanding for its European and Canadian operations of US$71.6 million and US$52.3 million, respectively, which are expected to mature over the next 12 months. The Company's derivative financial instruments are recorded in its consolidated balance sheet at fair value based on quoted market rates. Changes in the fair value of the U.S. dollar forward contracts, designated as cash flow hedges for forecasted merchandise purchases, are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in cost of product sales in the period which approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold. Changes in the fair value of the U.S. dollar forward contracts, designated as cash flow hedges for forecasted intercompany royalties, are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in other income and expense in the period in which the royalty expense is incurred.            From time to time, Swiss franc forward contracts are used to hedge certain anticipated Swiss operating expenses over specific months. Changes in the fair value of the Swiss franc forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in SG&A in the period which approximates the time the expenses are incurred.            As of January 29, 2011, accumulated other comprehensive income included a net unrealized loss of approximately US$1.8 million, net of tax, of which US$1.7 million will be recognized in other expense or cost of product sales over the following 12 months at the then current values on a pre-tax basis, which can be different than the current year-end values. At January 29, 2011, the net unrealized loss of the remaining open forward contracts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet was approximately US$0.5 million.            At January 30, 2010, the Company had forward contracts outstanding for its European and Canadian operations of US$62.4 million and US$27.7 million, respectively. At January 30, 2010, the unrealized net gain of these open forward contracts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet was approximately US$3.2 million.            The following table summarizes net after-tax derivative activity recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (in thousands):                                    Year  Ended  Jan. 29, 2011      Year  Ended  Jan. 30, 2010          Beginning balance gain (loss)     $  1,845     $  8,763         Net (losses) gains from changes in cash flow hedges        295        (1,641  )      Net (gains) losses reclassified to income        (3,929  )     (5,277  )                          Ending balance gain (loss)     $  (1,789  )  $  1,845                                  Forward Contracts Not Designated as Cash Flow Hedges             The Company also has foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expense. For the year ended January 29, 2011, the Company recorded a net loss of US$0.1 million for the Canadian dollar, euro, British pound and Swiss    51             franc foreign currency contracts, which has been included in other income and expense. At January 29, 2011, the Company had euro foreign currency contracts to purchase US$70.0 million expected to mature over the next eight months, Canadian dollar foreign currency contracts to purchase US$67.7 million expected to mature over the next eleven months, Swiss franc foreign currency contracts to purchase US$30.1 million expected to mature over the next eleven months and GBP11.3 million of foreign currency contracts to purchase euros expected to mature over the next eight months. At January 29, 2011, the net unrealized loss of these open forward contracts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet was approximately US$4.1 million.            At January 30, 2010, the Company had euro foreign currency contracts to purchase US$117.6 million, Canadian dollar foreign currency contracts to purchase US$22.3 million and GBP14.0 million foreign currency contracts to purchase euros. At January 30, 2010, the net unrealized gain of these open forward contracts recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheet was approximately US$3.9 million.     Sensitivity Analysis             At January 29, 2011, a sensitivity analysis of changes in the foreign currencies when measured against the U.S. dollar indicates that, if the U.S. dollar had uniformly weakened by 10% against all of the U.S. dollar denominated foreign exchange derivatives totaling US$291.7 million, the fair value of the instruments would have decreased by US$32.4 million. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened by 10% against all of the U.S. dollar denominated foreign exchange derivatives, the fair value of these instruments would have increased by US$26.5 million. Any resulting changes in the fair value of the hedged instruments may be more than or partially offset by changes in the fair value of certain balance sheet positions (primarily U.S. dollar denominated liabilities in our foreign operations) impacted by the change in the foreign currency rate. The ability to reduce the exposure of currencies on earnings depends on the magnitude of the derivatives compared to the balance sheet positions during each reporting cycle.     Interest Rate Risk             At January 29, 2011, approximately 96% of the Company's indebtedness related to a capital lease obligation which is covered by a separate interest rate swap agreement with a swap fixed interest rate of 3.55% that matures in 2016. Changes in the related interest rate that result in an unrealized gain or loss on the fair value of the swap are reported in other income or expenses. The change in the unrealized fair value of the interest swap increased other income, net by $0.3 million during fiscal year 2011. Substantially all of the Company's remaining indebtedness is at variable rates of interest. Accordingly, changes in interest rates would impact the Company's results of operations in future periods. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense for the year ended January 29, 2011 by approximately $0.1 million. This increase would be partially offset by a favorable gain on the interest rate swap.            The fair value of the Company's debt instruments are based on the amount of future cash flows associated with each instrument discounted using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. At January 29, 2011, the carrying value of all financial instruments was not materially different from fair value, as the interest rate on the Company's debt approximates rates currently available to the Company.
