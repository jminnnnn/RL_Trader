ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS   OF OPERATION  GENERAL      We derive our net revenue from the sale of GUESS? men's, women's, boys and girls' apparel and our licensees' products through our network of retail and factory outlet stores primarily in the United States, from the sale of GUESS men's, women's, boys' and girls' apparel worldwide to wholesale customers and distributors, from net royalties from worldwide licensing activities, from the sale of GUESS? apparel through the retail and wholesale channels of our 60% owned Canadian subsidiary, GUESS? Canada Corporation ("GUESS Canada"), and from the sale of GUESS? men's, women's, boys' and girls' apparel and our licensee products through our on-line store at www.guess.com.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      The following table sets forth actual operating results for the 1997 and 1998 and 1999 periods as a percentage of net revenue.

NET REVENUE.  Net revenue decreased $43.5 million or 8.4% to $471.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $515.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. Net revenue from retail operations increased $6.7 million or 3.1% to $222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $215.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1997, as a result of the volume generated by our new store openings, partially offset by a $10.7 million decrease or 5.6% decrease in comparable store net revenue. The decrease in comparable store net revenue was primarily due to product assortment changes in the our outlet stores and softening Pacific Rim tourism, which significantly impacted West Coast business during the first half of 1998. During the second half of 1998, our full-priced stores experienced positive comparable store net revenue, primarily due to our improved merchandising and store operational initiatives implemented by a new retail management team. Net revenue from wholesale operations decreased $37.5 million or 15.0% to $212.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $250.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. Domestic and international wholesale operations net revenue for the year ended December 31, 1998 decreased by $18.2 million and $19.3 million, respectively. Our domestic wholesale operations net revenue declined primarily as a result of increased competition in branded basic denim apparel. International wholesale operations net revenue decreased due primarily to the sale of the GUESS? Italia wholesale operations in June 1997, which had contributed $13.5 million during the first five months of 1997, as well as soft performance in the Asian and South American markets. Net royalties decreased $12.7 million or 25.6% to $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, from $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. The decline in net royalties was primarily the result of us terminating our various under-performing licenses, discontinuing certain licenses which we brought back in-house, continuing economic turmoil and currency devaluation in the Asian markets and the financial difficulty of one of our domestic licensees. Net revenue from our international operations comprised 8.0% and 11.5% of our net product revenue during 1998 and 1997, respectively.      GROSS PROFIT.  Gross profit decreased 11.9% to $199.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $227.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. The decline in gross profit resulted from lower net royalties, as well as decreased net revenue from product sales. Gross profit from product sales decreased 8.1% to $163.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $177.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total net revenue) decreased to 42.3% for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to 44.0% for the year ended December 31, 1997. Gross margin from product sales decreased to 37.5% for the year ended December 31, 1998 compared to 38.1% for the year ended December 31, 1997. The decrease for gross margin from product sales was primarily the result of our fixed store occupancy costs being spread over a lower comparable store revenue base, partially offset by a favorable mix in retail net revenue, which generally carries a higher gross margin rate, and lower wholesale markdowns and allowances.      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses decreased 8.6% to $142.8 million, or 30.3% of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 1998, from $156.3 million, or 30.3% of net revenue, for the year ended December 31, 1997. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to our cost reduction initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of 1997.      EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS.  Earnings from operations decreased 19.3% to $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, from $70.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue.      INTEREST EXPENSE, NET.  Net interest expense decreased 6.0% to $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. This decrease resulted primarily from a lower outstanding average debt, partially offset by a slightly higher average effective interest rate. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the average debt balance was $135.5 million, with an average effective interest rate of 9.0%. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the average debt balance was $148.4 million, with an average effective interest rate of 8.8%.                                         17      OTHER EXPENSES.  Other non-operating expenses were $0.9 for the year ended December 1998 as compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.4 million write-down to the lower cost or market of an equity investment during 1997.      INCOME TAXES.  The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 1998 was $18.2 million, or a 42.0% effective tax rate. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 1997 was $21.3 million, or a 38.9% effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for 1998 was adversely impacted primarily by Federal and state income taxes related to a dividend declared to us by one of our foreign subsidiaries.      NET EARNINGS BEFORE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE.  Net earnings before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle decreased by 25.2% to $25.1 million, or 5.3% of net revenue, for the year ended December 31, 1998 from $33.5 million, or 6.5% of net revenue, for the year ended December 31, 1997.      NET EARNINGS.  Net earnings decreased to $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, from $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998      NET REVENUE.  Net revenue increased $127.7 million or 27.1% to $599.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $471.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Net revenue from retail operations increased $76.7 million or 34.5% to $299.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, from a 26.8% increase in comparable store net revenue and from the volume generated by our new store openings. The strong increase in comparable store net revenue was primarily attributable to our improved merchandising and our fashioned-focused product mix. The retail segment is benefiting from our improved customer service levels resulting from our enhanced personnel training and incentive programs that have been offered to our associates.      Net revenue from wholesale operations increased $48.1 million or 22.6% to $260.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $212.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Domestic and international wholesale operations net revenue increased, for the year ended December 31, 1999, by $40.6 million to $228.7 million and by $7.4 million to $31.9 million, respectively. Our domestic wholesale net revenue increased primarily as a result of the increased demand for fashion products in both of our women's and men's lines. International wholesale operations net revenue increased due primarily to increased sales from the European market, partially offset by soft performance in the Asian and South American markets. GUESS Canada contributed $12.1 million in international net revenues during the second half for the year ended December 31, 1999. Net royalties increased $2.8 million or 7.7%, to $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase in net royalties was primarily due to settlements and adjustments related to us terminating licensees, partially offset by us discontinuing certain licenses that were brought back in-house, continuing economic turmoil and currency devaluation in Asian markets. Net revenue from international operations comprised 6.7% and 5.6% of net product revenue during 1999 and 1998, respectively.      GROSS PROFIT.  Gross profit increased 34.1% to $268.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $199.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase in gross profit resulted from higher net revenue from product sales. Gross profit from product sales increased 40.1% to $228.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $163.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total net revenue) increased to 44.7% for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to 42.3% for the year ended December 31, 1998. Gross margin from product sales increased to 40.8% for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to 37.5% for the year ended December 31, 1998.      The increase in our gross margin from product sales was primarily the result of fixed store occupancy costs being spread over a larger comparable store revenue base, a favorable mix in retail net revenue,                                         18  which generally carries a higher gross margin rate, lower off-price sales and a decrease in wholesale markdowns and allowances as a percentage of wholesale net revenues.      Furthermore, during the fourth quarter of 1999, we enhanced our ability to estimate reserves through improved processes and more current and accurate data. As a result, we revised our estimate of certain reserves. This resulted in a reduction of cost of sales of $2.3 million and increase of gross margin of $2.3 million or 2.4%.      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses of $171.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 decreased to 28.5% of net revenue, from 30.3% of net revenue or $142.8 million, in the year ended December 31, 1998. The decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due to our ability to leverage certain expenses against a higher revenue base, as well as the success of our ongoing cost containment programs.      GAIN ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.  We realized a non-recurring pre-tax gain of $3.8 million on the disposition of property and equipment.      SEVERANCE COSTS RELATED TO DISTRIBUTION FACILITY.  In accordance with the requirements of EITF 94-3, "Liability for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)", we recorded a $3.2 million charge for future severance costs related to the relocation of our distribution operations from Los Angeles, California to Louisville, Kentucky. We anticipate the payment of these severance costs to occur in the second quarter of fiscal year 2000.      EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS.  Earnings from operations increased 64.4% to $93.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase was primarily due to higher revenue.      INTEREST EXPENSE, NET.  Net interest expense decreased 27.1% to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. This decrease resulted primarily from a lower outstanding average debt. For the year ended December 31, 1999, the average debt balance was $93.1 million, with an average effective interest rate of 9.5%. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the average debt balance was $135.5 million, with an average effective interest rate of 9.0%.      INCOME TAXES.  The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $35.2 million, or a 40.4% effective tax rate. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 1998 was $18.2 million, or a 42.0% effective tax rate. The effective tax for 1998 was adversely impacted by Federal and state income taxes related to a dividend declared to us by one of our foreign subsidiaries.      NET EARNINGS.  Net earnings increased to $51.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, from $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1998.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      During 1999, we relied primarily on internally generated funds and trade credit to finance our operations and expansion. At December 31, 1999, we had working capital of $97.9 million compared to $101.3 million at December 31, 1998. The $3.4 million decrease in working capital is due primarily to a $15.2 million increase in short-term investments, a $17.1 million increase in inventories, a $3.2 million increase in prepaid expenses offset by a $40.8 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. With the acquisition of the additional interest in GUESS Canada, our current portion of notes payable and long-term debt increase $7.5 million      On December 3, 1999, we entered into a $125,000,000 Credit Agreement ("Credit Facility") with Chase Manhattan Bank that replaced our $100.0 million revolving credit facility entered into in March 1997. The Credit Facility provides us with a $125.0 million revolving credit facility including a                                         19  $50.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The Credit Facility expires on October 31, 2000. At December 31, 1999, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility, $15.2 million in outstanding commercial letters of credit and $32.0 million in standby letters of credit. At December 31, 1999, we had $77.8 million available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants requiring among other things, the maintenance of certain financial ratios. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 1999.      Capital expenditures, net of lease incentives granted, totaled $63.5 million for 1999 and $13.7 million for 1998. The increase in capital expenditures was due primarily to our increase in store openings, costs associated with our new distribution facility in Louisville, Kentucky, the launching of our on-line store in April 1999, and the retail expansion of GUESS Canada. We estimate that our capital expenditures for 2000 will be approximately $80.0 million, primarily for retail store expansion and remodeling and shop-in-shop expansion and enhancements.      We anticipate we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements through 2000, including retail expansion plans and interest payments on our senior subordinated notes due 2003 (such interest payments paid by us during 1999 amounted to $9.2 million), primarily with cash flow from operations, supplemented by borrowings under our Credit Facility.  IMPORTANT FACTORS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS      Various forward-looking statements have been made in this Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements may also be in our other reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in our press releases and in other documents. In addition, from time to time, we, through our management, may make oral forward-looking statements.      Forward-looking statements are only expectations, and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results in future periods and other future events to differ materially from what is currently anticipated. Certain statements in this Form 10-K, including those relating to our expected results, the accuracy of data relating to, and anticipated levels of, our future inventory and gross margins, our anticipated cash requirements and sources, the relocation of our distribution center, our cost containment efforts, our plans regarding store openings and closings and our business seasonality, are forward-looking statements. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements. In addition to the factors discussed below, the economic and other factors identified elsewhere in this Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors discussed in our previously filed public documents, could affect the forward-looking statements contained herein and therein.      Forward-looking statements generally refer to future plans and performance, and are identified by the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "optimistic," "intend," "aim," "will" or the negative thereof and similar expressions. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of which they are made. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements.      Important factors that could cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, as well as affect our ability to achieve our financial and other goals, include, but are not limited to, the following:      - The continued availability of sufficient working capital, which could have       a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of       operations.      - Our successful integration of new stores into existing operations, which       could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and       results of operations.                                         20      - The continued desirability and customer acceptance of our existing and       future products, which could have a material adverse effect on our       financial condition and results of operations.      - Possible cancellation of wholesale orders, which could have a material       adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.      - The success of our competitive products, which could have a material       adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.      - The success of our programs to strengthen our inventory cost accounting       controls and procedures, which could have a material adverse effect on our       financial condition and results of operations.      - The success of technology to be used in our new distribution center, which       could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and       results of operation.      - The availability of adequate sources of capital, which could have a       material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of       operations.      - Our inability to identify and respond appropriately to changing consumer       demands and fashion trends, which could have a material adverse effect on       consumer acceptance of GUESS? products.      - A decision by the controlling owner of a group of department stores or any       other significant customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to       cease carrying GUESS? products, which could have a material adverse effect       on our financial condition and results of operations.      - Our inability to control the quality, focus, image, financial stability or       distribution of our licensed products, which could impact consumer       receptivity to our products generally and, therefore, could have a       material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of       operations.      - Our failure to continue to enhance operating control systems, which could       have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of       operations.      - Factors beyond our control, such as which could have a material adverse       effect on our ability to expand our network of retail stores. Our general       failure to maintain and control our existing distribution and licensing       arrangements or to procure additional distribution and licensing       relationships could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy,       which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and       results of operations.      - The extended loss of the services of one or more of our principal       executive officers, which could have a material adverse effect on our       financial condition and results of operations.      - Political instability resulting in the disruption of trade with the       countries in which our contractors, suppliers or customers are located,       the imposition of additional regulations relating to imports, the       imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on imports,       significant fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign       currencies or restrictions on the transfer of funds, which could have a       material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of       operations. Also, a substantial increase in customs duties, which could       have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of       operations. These factors may be exacerbated by our increasing use of       packaged purchase sourcing from non-United States vendors.      - The inability of a manufacturer to ship our products in a timely manner or       to meet our quality standards, which could have a material adverse effect       on our ability to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner.      - No assurance can be given that others will not assert rights in, or       ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of GUESS?. In       addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect proprietary       rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.                                         21  SEASONALITY      Our business is impacted by general seasonal trends characteristic of the apparel and retail industries. Our retail operations are generally stronger in the third and fourth quarters, while our wholesale operations generally experience stronger performance in the first and third quarters. As the timing of the shipment of products may vary from year to year, the result for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year. We have not had significant overhead and other costs generally associated with large seasonal variations.  INFLATION      We do not believe the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in the United States over the last three years have had a significant effect on our net revenue or profitability. Although higher rates of inflation have been experienced in a number of foreign countries in which our products are manufactured, we do not believe they have had a material adverse effect on our net revenue or profitability.  IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS      In June 1998, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133") was issued. SFAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. It is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. We believe the adoption of SFAS 133 will not have a material impact on our financial reporting.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS      We receive United States dollars for substantially all of our product sales and our licensing revenues. Inventory purchases from offshore contract manufacturers are primarily denominated in United States dollars; however, purchase prices for the products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers, which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods in the future. In addition, royalties received from our international licensees are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations as a result of the net sales of the licensee being denominated in local currency and royalties being paid to us in United States dollars. During the last three fiscal years, exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on our inventory costs.      We may enter into derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts, to manage foreign exchange risk on foreign currency transactions. These financial instruments can be used to protect us from the risk that the eventual net cash inflows from the foreign currency transactions will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Unrealized gains and losses on outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts, used to hedge future revenues and purchases, are not recorded in the financial statements but are included in the measurement of the related hedged transaction when realized.
