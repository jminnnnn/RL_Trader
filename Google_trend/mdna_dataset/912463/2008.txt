ITEM 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.         Summary             The business segments of the Company are retail, wholesale, European and licensing operations. Information relating to these segments is summarized in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes this segment reporting reflects how its four business segments are managed and each segment's performance is evaluated. The retail segment includes the Company's retail operations in North America. The wholesale segment includes the wholesale operations in North America and our Asian operations. The European segment includes both wholesale and retail operations in Europe. The licensing segment includes the worldwide licensing operations of the Company. The business segments operating results exclude corporate overhead costs, which consist of shared costs of the organization. These costs are presented separately and generally include, among other things, the following unallocated corporate costs: information technology, human resources, accounting and finance, executive compensation, facilities and legal.            We derive our net revenue from the sale of GUESS? men's and women's apparel, MARCIANO women's apparel, G by GUESS men's and women's apparel, GUESS by MARCIANO men's and women's apparel, and our licensees' products through our worldwide network of retail stores, wholesale customers and distributors, as well as our on-line stores. We also derive royalty revenues from worldwide licensing activities.            Unless the context indicates otherwise, when we refer to "we," "us" or the "Company" in this Form 10-K, we are referring to Guess?, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.            On January 18, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a change in the Company's fiscal year end from December 31 to the Saturday nearest January 31 of each year. The change, which aligned the Company's reporting cycle with the National Retail Federation ("NRF") fiscal calendar and is expected to provide for more consistent year-to-year comparisons, is effective for the Company's 2008 fiscal year. The Company's 2008 fiscal year began on February 4, 2007 and ended on February 2, 2008, resulting in a one-month transition period that began January 1, 2007 and ended February 3, 2007. The audited results for the one month ended February 3, 2007 are included in ITEM 15. Exhibits and Financial Statements.            Unless specifically indicated otherwise, any reference to "fiscal 2008" relates to the twelve-months ended February 2, 2008 and any reference to "fiscal 2007" relates to the unaudited twelve months ended February 3, 2007.            For purposes of this MD&A, the Company has presented the financial performance comparison of the 2008 fiscal year versus the 2007 fiscal year. The Company has also presented the financial performance between the one-month audited transition period ended February 3, 2007 and the comparable one-month unaudited period ended January 28, 2006. Finally, the Company has presented the financial performance between the twelve-months ended December 31, 2006 and the twelve-months ended December 31, 2005.            Fiscal years 2008 and 2007 include 52 weeks and 53 weeks, respectively.            The Company reports NRF calendar comparable store sales on a quarterly basis for its full-price retail and factory outlet stores in the U.S. and Canada. A store is considered comparable after it has been open for 13 full months. If a store remodel results in a square footage change of more than 15%, or involves a relocation or a change in store concept, the store is removed from the comparable store base until it has been opened at its new size, in its new location or under its new concept for 13 full months.    28           Executive Summary     The Company             The Company's operations generated net earnings of $186.5 million, or diluted earnings of $1.99 per share, for the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to net earnings of $131.2 million, or diluted earnings of $1.42 per share, for the year ended February 3, 2007.            Total net revenues increased 39.7% to $1,749.9 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, from $1,252.7 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. All of our business segments contributed to this growth. The European segment was the largest contributor to the growth in revenues representing roughly half of the consolidated revenue growth. The revenue growth also reflected higher comparable store sales and retail store expansion in the retail segment. In addition, our wholesale segment increased revenues, driven by our new South Korea operation and stronger product performance in our North American wholesale business, while our licensing business increased revenues across all key accessories categories and footwear.            Gross margin increased 120 basis points to 45.3% for the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to the same prior year period. The improvement in the overall gross margin was attributable to a higher mix of European net revenues, which generated a relatively higher gross margin than the other businesses, higher mark-ups in our wholesale segment, higher product margins in our retail segment and the recognition of gift card breakage. This improvement was partially offset by the lower product margin in Europe.             Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased 39.4% to $483.6 million for the year ended February 2, 2008 compared to $347.0 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. This increase in SG&A expenses was driven by investments in our new businesses, higher variable costs to support the higher sales in our existing businesses, higher performance-based expenses and investments in infrastructure in Europe. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expense decreased 10 basis points to 27.6% for the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to the prior-year.            Overall, the higher gross margin and the decrease in SG&A spending as a percentage of net revenues, resulted in an increase in the Company's operating margin to 17.7% for the year ended February 2, 2008, up 130 basis points from 16.4% for the year ended February 3, 2007.            Net interest income increased $4.1 million for the year ended February 2, 2008 primarily due to the early redemption of the Company's 6.75% secured notes of $32.8 million at the end of 2006 and higher average invested cash balances. The Secured Notes were redeemed in December 2006 resulting in $1.9 million related to the write-off of debt issuance costs and payment of redemption premium, which are included in interest expense for the year ended February 3, 2007.             Other expense was $1.8 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, versus other income of $4.7 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. Other expense in the year ended February 2, 2008 was primarily due to net losses related to changes in foreign exchange rates on forward contracts and other foreign currency transactions. Other income in the prior year period comprised gains on sale of land and other long-term investments.            Our effective income tax rate increased 260 basis points to 39.8% for the year ended February 2, 2008 compared to 37.2% in the prior year primarily due to a higher mix of profits in higher tax jurisdictions and a change to the Italian tax rate effective in fiscal 2009 that unfavorably impacted our net deferred tax asset position at the end of fiscal 2008.             The Company had $275.6 million in cash and cash equivalents as of February 2, 2008, compared to $207.6 million as of February 3, 2007. Total debt, including capital lease obligations, as of February 2, 2008, was $54.0 million, up $15.9 million from $38.1 million as of February 3, 2007. The increase in debt was driven primarily by the increase in short-term borrowings from GUESS? Europe. Accounts receivable    29           increased by $111.7 million, or 78.3%, to $254.4 million at February 2, 2008, compared to $142.7 million at February 3, 2007. The increase in accounts receivable primarily supported the revenue growth in Europe, South Korea and Greater China. Accounts receivable also increased due to the acquisition of BARN in January 2008. Currency translation fluctuations accounted for $24.3 million of the increase in accounts receivable. Inventory increased by $58.5 million, or 33.7%, to $232.2 million as of February 2, 2008, compared to $173.7 million as of February 3, 2007. Approximately $31.0 million of this increase was attributable to new businesses including Focus, BARN, our new South Korea operation, our Mexico and Greater China operations and our new G by GUESS store concept. The remaining inventory increase was related to anticipated sales growth in our existing European and North American operations. Currency fluctuations resulted in a higher translation impact on the current year's ending inventory of approximately $15.7 million compared to the year ago amount.    Retail             Our retail segment, comprising North American full-priced retail and factory outlet stores and e-commerce, generated net sales of $862.4 million during the year ended February 2, 2008, an increase of 16.4% from $741.1 million in the prior year period. This growth was driven by a comparable store sales increase of 14.6% and a larger store base, which represented a net 5.3% increase in average square footage compared to the year ended February 3, 2007. All of our product categories contributed to this growth. Retail earnings from operations increased by $23.0 million to $128.5 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to $105.5 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales volume, higher product margin and occupancy leverage, partially offset by increased investments in infrastructure to support our new G by GUESS brand concept and higher advertising expense. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 14.9% in the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to 14.2% in the year ended February 3, 2007.            In the year ended February 2, 2008, we opened 49 new stores and closed ten underperforming stores in the U.S. and Canada. At February 2, 2008, we operated 373 stores in the U.S. and Canada, comprised of 187 full-priced retail stores, 97 factory outlet stores, 38 Marciano stores, 17 GUESS? Accessories stores and 34 G by GUESS stores. This compares to 334 stores as of February 3, 2007. We have continued to develop our new concept stores, which includes our Marciano branded stores and our G by GUESS stores, and we believe that over time these concepts can grow to become significant chains in North America. The MARCIANO brand, a contemporary line that commands higher price points, is also available in approximately a quarter of our full-price GUESS? retail stores in the U.S. and Canada. G by GUESS, which launched in early 2007, is a new brand and store concept that offers a full line of apparel for women and men and a full line of accessories and footwear to support the lifestyle of this customer and is aimed to capture a market demographic that is younger and shops price points between our factory and full-priced retail stores.    Wholesale             Wholesale segment revenues increased by $105.8 million, or 69.3%, to $258.4 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, from $152.6 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to international expansion, including South Korea (which we began to operate directly in January 2007), coupled with growth in the North American wholesale business. Earnings from operations for the wholesale segment improved by $24.7 million, or 98.3%, to $49.9 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, from $25.2 million for the prior year period. This improvement was driven by increased sales in Asia and North America and higher gross margin as a result of higher mark-ups in the North American wholesale business, partially offset by increased spending on infrastructure to support the growth of the new businesses in Asia. Operating margin increased 280 basis points to 19.3% in the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to 16.5% for the year ended February 3, 2007.    30          Europe             In Europe, revenues increased by $246.6 million, or 84.5%, to $538.4 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to $291.8 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. The majority of the revenue growth was generated by the European wholesale business, driven by growth in both our existing accessories and apparel businesses and our acquisition of a 75% equity interest in Focus on December 31, 2006, the Company's licensee for GUESS by MARCIANO contemporary apparel for women and men in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In addition, at February 2, 2008, we directly operated 40 stores in Europe, which includes the four stores acquired as part of the Focus acquisition, compared to 24 stores in the prior year. Earnings from operations from our European segment increased by $47.6 million, or 65.1%, to $120.8 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, from $73.2 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. Operating margin decreased 270 basis points to 22.4% in the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to 25.1% for the year ended February 3, 2007 due to lower product margin and increased spending to support the growth of our infrastructure in the European region, including our investment in the new European headquarters based in Lugano, Switzerland.    Licensing             Our licensing business revenues increased by $23.6 million, or 35.1%, to $90.7 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, from $67.1 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. This increase was driven by growth in sales of several product categories, especially handbags, footwear and watches, and the increased recognition of licensing revenues as a result of the amortization of fixed cash rights payments received from licensees in connection with previously renegotiated contracts based on the periods these contracts represent. The increase in net royalties was partially offset by the loss of royalty revenue from our GUESS by MARCIANO and South Korean licensees, both of which we now operate directly and are, therefore, no longer a part of the licensing segment. Licensing segment earnings from operations increased $19.3 million, or 32.9%, to $77.9 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, from $58.7 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. Operating margin decreased 150 basis points to 85.9% for the year ended February 2, 2008 compared to 87.4% for the year ended February 3, 2007 due to higher spending in advertising and higher performance based compensation expense for the year compared to the prior year period.            Outside of the U.S. and Canada, in the year ended February 2, 2008, together with our partners we opened 184 new stores, including 83 in Europe, 93 in Asia and eight stores in Mexico, Central and South America. We ended the year with 579 stores outside of the U.S. and Canada, of which 421 were GUESS? stores, 36 were GUESS by MARCIANO stores, and 122 were GUESS? Accessories stores. Of the 579 stores, 60 were operated by the Company and 519 were operated by licensees or distributors. This store count does not include 82 jean and accessory concessions located in South Korea and China because of their smaller store size in relation to our standard international store size.    Corporate Overhead             Corporate overhead increased by $11.0 million, or 19.3%, to $68.0 million in the year ended February 2, 2008, from $57.0 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. This increase was primarily due to increased performance-based compensation costs, including share based payment expense.     Application of Critical Accounting Policies             The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other    31           relevant factors, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the valuation of inventories, accounts receivable allowances, sales return allowances, the useful life of assets for depreciation, restructuring expense and accruals, evaluation of impairment, recoverability of deferred taxes, workers compensation accruals, litigation accruals, pension obligations and stock-based compensation.            The Company believes that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. In addition to the accounting policies mentioned below, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for other significant accounting policies.    Accounts receivable reserves             In the normal course of business, the Company grants credit directly to certain wholesale customers after a credit analysis based on financial and other criteria is performed. Accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the inability of its wholesale customers to make their required payments. The Company bases its allowances through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements, assessments of historical collection trends and an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions.            Costs associated with customer markdowns are recorded as a reduction to net revenues, and are included in the allowance for accounts receivable. Historically, these markdown allowances resulted from seasonal negotiations with the Company's wholesale customers, as well as historical trends and the evaluation of the impact of the economic conditions. During fiscal 2008, the Company renegotiated its arrangements with its major customers in the U.S. to fix the percentage of sales that will be expensed as markdown allowances. The negotiation of a fixed rate allows the Company to process credit memos against the outstanding balance immediately which has resulted in a reduction of our outstanding markdown allowance accrual relative to the prior year.    Sales returns reserves             The Company accrues for estimated sales returns in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. To recognize the financial impact of sales returns, the Company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned based on historical experience and reduces sales and cost of sales accordingly based on historical return experience. The Company's policy allows retail customers a 30 day period to return merchandise following the date of sale. Substantially all of these returns are considered to be resalable at a price that exceeds the cost of the merchandise.    Inventory reserves             Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (primarily weighted average method) or market. The Company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving product as well as prior seasons' inventory. Market value of aged inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for this category of inventory of the Company's individual product lines, the impact of market trends, an evaluation of economic conditions and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory. The Company closely monitors its off-price sales to ensure the actual results closely match initial estimates. Estimates are regularly updated based upon this continuing review.    Valuation of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets             The Company assesses the impairment of its long-lived assets (i.e., goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment), which requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances    32           indicate that the assets might be impaired. An asset is considered to be impaired if the Company determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon its assessment of the asset's ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods or if significant changes in the Company's strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets occurred. If the assets (other than goodwill) are assessed to be recoverable, they are depreciated or amortized over the periods benefited. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of those assets. Fair value is determined based upon the discounted cash flows derived from the underlying asset. See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.    Pension benefit plan actuarial assumptions             The Company's pension obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, within the framework of the amendment of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87 "Employer's Accounting for Pensions." The discount rate is an important element of expense and/or liability measurement. We evaluate this critical assumption annually which enables us to state expected future payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. Refer to Note 10 for Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan related information.    Litigation reserves             Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation. Both the amount and range of loss on any remaining pending litigation is uncertain. As additional information becomes available, the Company will assess the potential liability related to pending litigation and will revise estimates as appropriate. Such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position.     Stock-based compensation             Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under this method, compensation cost recognized for the year ended December 31, 2006 included: (a) compensation expense for all stock-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, December 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," ("FAS123") and (b) compensation expense for all stock-based payments granted on or after January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for new grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time of grant. The expected volatility is determined based on an average of both historical volatility and implied volatility. Implied volatility is derived from exchange traded options on the Company's common stock. The expected life used prior to November 2007 was based on the "simplified" method described in the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. For options granted beginning November 2007, the expected term is determined based on historical trends. The dividend yield for the one month period ended February 3, 2007 and prior years was zero. In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Board of Directors authorized and approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend. The expected forfeiture rate is determined based on historical data. Compensation expense for new stock options and nonvested stock awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated.    33          Taxes             The Company adopted FASB Interpretation 48 ("FIN 48"), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, in January 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109 and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations. The Company's continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. See Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the adoption of FIN 48.    Hedge Accounting             The Company operates in foreign countries, which exposes it to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company has entered into certain forward contracts and swaps to hedge the risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations. The Company has elected to apply the hedge accounting rules as required by SFAS No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," for certain of these hedges. The Company's objective is to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flow due to the foreign currency risk (USD/Canadian exchange rate) associated with certain anticipated inventory purchases on a first dollar basis for specific months. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash-flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in cost of goods sold in the period which approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold.            The Company has foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expenses.     Gift Card Breakage             The Company completed its analysis of unredeemed electronic gift card liabilities in the quarter ended August 4, 2007 for the U.S. retail business. Gift card breakage is income recognized due to the non-redemption of a portion of gift cards sold by the Company for which a liability was recorded in prior periods. Beginning with the quarter ended August 4, 2007, these amounts are accounted for under the redemption recognition method and are classified as additional net revenues as the gift cards are redeemed. The Company determined a gift card breakage rate of approximately 6.5% in the quarter ended August 4, 2007 based upon historical redemption patterns, which represented the cumulative estimated amount of gift card breakage from the inception of the electronic gift card program in late 2002. Based upon historical redemption trends, the Company recognizes estimated gift card breakage as a component of net revenue in proportion to actual gift card redemptions, over the period that remaining gift card values are redeemed. As of February 2, 2008, the Company has recognized $3.5 million gift card breakage to revenue, of which $3.1 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, was a one-time cumulative adjustment recognized in the quarter ended August 4, 2007. Any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage income recognized in future periods.    34        NAME="page_do48501_1_35">                   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS             The following table sets forth actual operating results for the 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 fiscal years and one-month periods ended February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006 as a percentage of net revenue:             Year Ended     One Month Ended     Year Ended             Feb. 2,  2008     Feb. 3,  2007     Feb. 3,  2007     Jan. 28,  2006     Dec. 31,  2006     Dec. 31,  2005       Product sales     94.8  %  94.6  %  95.0  %  92.9  %  94.5  %  94.8  %    Net royalties     5.2     5.4     5.0     7.1     5.5     5.2                                          Total net revenue     100.0     100.0     100.0     100.0     100.0     100.0       Cost of product sales     54.7     55.9     59.0     67.0     56.2     59.3                                       Gross profit     45.3     44.1     41.0     33.0     43.8     40.7       Selling, general and administrative expenses     27.6     27.7     31.8     33.0     27.5     29.8                                          Earnings from operations     17.7     16.4     9.2          16.3     10.9       Interest expense     0.2     0.6     0.5     0.6     0.6     0.7       Interest income     (0.4  )  (0.5  )  (0.5  )  (0.6  )  (0.4  )  (0.2  )    Other, net     0.1     (0.4  )  (0.2  )       (0.4  )                                            Earnings before income taxes     17.8     16.7     9.4          16.5     10.4       Income taxes     7.1     6.2     3.6          6.1     4.1       Minority interest               (0.1  )                                                      Net earnings     10.7  %  10.5  %  5.9  %    %  10.4  %  6.3  %                                       Year Ended February 2, 2008 Compared to Year Ended February 3, 2007.     NET REVENUE.     Net revenue for the year ended February 2, 2008 increased by $497.2 million, or 39.7%, to $1,749.9 million, from $1,252.7 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. All segments contributed to this revenue growth with double-digit percentage increases. The largest contribution to this revenue growth was generated by our European segment.            Net revenue from retail operations increased by $121.3 million, or 16.4%, to $862.4 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, from $741.1 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. The increase was driven by a comparable store sales growth of 14.6% and an average of 26 net additional stores during the year ended February 2, 2008 resulting in a 5.3% increase in average square footage compared to the prior year period. Currency translation fluctuations accounted for $14.3 million of the increase in net revenue relating to our Canadian retail stores.            Net revenue from wholesale operations increased by $105.8 million, or 69.3%, to $258.4 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, from $152.6 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. Approximately 80.0% of this revenue growth was generated outside of the U.S., primarily in Asia. Our North American wholesale net revenue growth was primarily attributable to strong product performance. Our products were sold in the U.S. in approximately 1,006 major doors as of February 2, 2008, compared to 961 major doors at the end of the prior year period. Currency translation fluctuations accounted for $2.8 million of the increase in net revenue relating to our Canadian wholesale business.            Net revenue from European operations increased by $246.6 million, or 84.5%, to $538.4 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, from $291.8 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. The majority of the revenue growth was generated by the European wholesale business, driven by our continued growth in both our existing accessories and apparel businesses and our acquisition of a 75% equity interest in Focus on December 31, 2006. The growth is also attributable to same store sales growth in our existing retail    35           stores and the addition of new retail stores. Currency translation fluctuations accounted for $48.1 million of the increase in net revenue relating to our European operations.            Net royalty revenue from licensing operations increased by $23.6 million, or 35.1%, to $90.7 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, from $67.1 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. The increase was the result of the strength of the accessories business, particularly handbags, footwear and watches, and the increased recognition of licensing revenues as a result of the amortization of fixed cash rights payments received from licensees in connection with previously renegotiated contracts based on the periods these contracts represent. Licensing revenues in the current year did not include any royalty revenue from our GUESS by MARCIANO and South Korean licensees, both of which we now operate directly, as the associated sales are now reported as revenue in the European and wholesale segments, respectively.     GROSS PROFIT.     Gross profit increased by $240.3 million, or 43.5%, to $792.8 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, from $552.5 million in the prior period. The increase in gross profit primarily resulted from sales growth in all segments.       Gross profit for the retail segment increased by $50.2 million, or 17.9%, to $330.1 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, from $279.9 million in the prior period, primarily due to higher sales volume and higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher occupancy costs.  Gross profit for the wholesale segment increased by $44.1 million, or 79.6%, to $99.4 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, from $55.3 million in the prior year period, primarily due to the increase in sales volume in Asia, and increased sales and higher mark-ups in North America driven by stronger product performance.  Gross profit for the European operations increased by $122.4 million, or 81.5%, to $272.6 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, from $150.2 million in the prior year period. The European gross profit increase resulted from higher sales volumes in the existing European operations and the acquisition of a 75% equity interest in Focus at the end of 2006.  Gross profit for the licensing segment increased by $23.6 million, or 35.1%, to $90.7 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, from $67.1 million in the prior year period. The licensing gross profit improvement was primarily the result of the strong sales performance of accessories, especially handbags, footwear and watches.             Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total net revenues) increased 120 basis points to 45.3% for the year ended February 2, 2008, from 44.1% for the year ended February 3, 2007. The improvement in the overall gross margin was attributable to a higher mix of European net revenues, which generated a relatively higher gross margin than the other businesses, higher mark-ups in our wholesale segment, and higher product margins in our retail segment due to higher mark-ups and gift card breakage income. This improvement was partially offset by the lower product margin in Europe compared to the prior year.            The Company's gross margin may not be comparable to other entities since some entities include all of the costs related to their distribution in cost of product sales and others, like the Company, exclude the wholesale related distribution costs from gross margin, including them instead in selling, general and administrative expenses.    SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.     SG&A expenses increased by $136.6 million, or 39.4%, to $483.6 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, from $347.0 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. Approximately $68.0 million of the increase was attributable to incremental spending required to support new businesses including Focus, our new European headquarters in Lugano, Switzerland, the new G by GUESS brand initiative, the South Korea operation, expansion in Greater China and Mexico, and BARN in Europe. In addition, the increase was also attributable to growth in store selling, merchandising and distribution costs of $41.8 million, incremental compensation expenses (primarily performance-based) of $12.5 million, and additional advertising and marketing spending in our    36           existing businesses of $8.3 million. As a percentage of net revenue, SG&A expenses improved to 27.6% for the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to 27.7% for the prior year period.    EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS.     Earnings from operations increased by $103.6 million, or 50.4%, to $309.1 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, compared with earnings from operations of $205.5 million for the year ended February 3, 2007.       Earnings from operations for the retail segment were $128.5 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to earnings from operations of $105.5 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. The increase in earnings from operations for the retail segment was driven by the higher sales volume, higher product margin and occupancy leverage, partially offset by increased investments in infrastructure to support our new G by GUESS brand concept and higher advertising expense. Currency translation fluctuations accounted for $3.5 million of the increase in earnings from operations for our Canadian retail stores.  Earnings from operations for the wholesale segment were $49.9 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to earnings from operations of $25.2 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. This increase was principally due to incremental sales and gross profit from our new South Korea operation and higher sales and improved gross profit in North America, partially offset by additional SG&A expenses in Asia, including South Korea, to build infrastructure in this region and support the increased sales. Currency translation fluctuations accounted for $0.8 million of the increase in earnings from operations for our Canadian wholesale business.  Earnings from operations for the European segment were $120.8 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to $73.2 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. The increase was primarily due to higher sales and gross profit in the existing accessories and apparel wholesale businesses combined with the sales and gross profit resulting from our acquisition of a 75% equity interest in Focus in late 2006. In addition, our existing Company-owned retail business in Europe continued to improve, generating strong sales growth and increasing profits. The growth in sales and gross profit was partially offset by higher volume related and infrastructure expansion expenses. Currency translation fluctuations accounted for $10.4 million of the increase in earnings from operations for our European operations.  Earnings from operations for the licensing segment were $77.9 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to $58.7 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. The improvement was the result of higher revenues generated by our accessories product licensees and the recognition of additional licensing revenues relating to the amortization of fixed cash rights payments received from licensees in connection with previously renegotiated contracts. These increases were partially offset by the loss of royalty revenue from the GUESS by MARCIANO and South Korean licensees in the period compared to the prior year period.  Unallocated corporate overhead was $68.0 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to $57.0 million for the year ended February 3, 2007, mainly due to higher performance-based compensation costs, including share based payment expense.              The higher gross margin and lower SG&A spending as a percentage of net revenues resulted in an increase in operating margin of 130 basis points to 17.7% for the year ended February 2, 2008 from 16.4% for the prior year period.    INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME.     Interest expense decreased to $3.4 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to $7.7 million for the year ended February 3, 2007, primarily due to the early redemption of the Company's 6.75% secured notes of $32.8 million at the end of 2006. The Secured Notes were redeemed in December 2006 resulting in a $1.4 million write-off of debt issuance costs and a $0.5 million redemption premium, which are included in interest expense for the year ended February 3, 2007. On a comparable basis, the average debt balance for the year ended February 2, 2008    37           was $48.6 million versus an average debt balance of $79.4 million, for the year ended February 3, 2007. Interest income increased to $7.5 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to $6.2 million for the year ended February 3, 2007, due to higher average invested cash balances.     OTHER INCOME, NET.     Other expense was $1.8 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, versus income of $4.7 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. Other expense in the year ended February 2, 2008 was primarily due to net losses related to changes in foreign exchange rates on forward contracts and other foreign currency transactions. Other income in the prior year period comprised gains on sale of land and other long-term investments.    INCOME TAXES.     Income tax expense for the year ended February 2, 2008 was $124.1 million, or a 39.8% effective tax rate, compared to income tax expense of $77.6 million, or a 37.2% effective tax rate, for the year ended February 3, 2007. This year's higher tax rate was due to a higher mix of profits in higher tax jurisdictions, the utilization of capital loss carryforwards in the prior year, favorable tax audit settlements last year and a recent decline in the Italian statutory tax rate, effective in fiscal 2009, that resulted in a devaluation of deferred tax assets in the current year.    MINORITY INTEREST.     The minority interest expense of $0.9 million, net of taxes, primarily represents the portion of earnings of Focus for the year ended February 2, 2008 allocated to the minority interest shareholders. The Company acquired a 75% interest in Focus on December 31, 2006.    NET EARNINGS.     Net earnings increased by $55.3 million, or 42.2%, to $186.5 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, from $131.2 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. Diluted earnings per share increased to $1.99 per share for the year ended February 2, 2008 compared to $1.42 per share for the year ended February 3, 2007.    One-Month Audited Transition Period Ended February 3, 2007 ("January 2007") Compared to the One-Month Unaudited Period Ended January 28, 2006 ("January 2006").             The Company reported net earnings of $8.0 million, or diluted earnings of $0.09 per share, for January 2007 (which included 34 days), compared to $0.00 per share for January 2006 (which included 28 days). Net revenue for January 2007 increased by $67.5 million, or 98.6%, to $136.0 million, from $68.5 million for January 2006. Gross profit increased by $33.1 million, or 146.6%, to $55.7 million for January 2007, from $22.6 million for January 2006. SG&A expenses increased by $20.6 million, or 91.2%, to $43.3 million for January 2007, from $22.6 million for January 2006. Earnings from operations increased by $12.5 million to $12.5 million for January 2007, compared to the approximately break-even results from operations for January 2006. These results reflect the impact of the significant growth in our existing European operations, the comparable store sales growth of 12.7% in our retail store operations in North America for January 2007 compared to the prior-year period, the greater number of days in the one month ended January 2007 compared to the prior-year period and the acquisition of a 75% majority interest in Focus, our European GUESS by MARCIANO licensee, in late 2006.    Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005.     NET REVENUE.     Net revenue increased $249.1 million, or 26.6%, to $1,185.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $936.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. All segments contributed to this growth, with the largest contributions from our retail and European segments.             Net revenue from retail operations increased $108.4 million, or 17.7%, to $721.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $612.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was driven by sales for stores that were open for more than one year which grew 12.8% and accounted for $67.9 million of the increase and a $40.5 million increase due to an average of 24 net new stores during 2006 with a 5.3% increase in average square footage compared to 2005. While the majority of this $67.9 million increase was generated in our U.S. stores, the most significant store sales rate increases were    38            in our Canadian retail stores. Currency fluctuations accounted for $7.5 million of the increase in net revenue relating to our Canadian retail stores.            Net revenue from wholesale operations increased $25.2 million, or 20.8%, to $146.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $121.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. U.S. wholesale net revenue increased $16.4 million, or 19.4%, to $101.1 million in 2006 from $84.7 million in 2005. The increase in U.S. wholesale revenue was primarily attributable to strong product performance which drove higher sales volume and lower markdown allowances as a percentage of revenue. Our products were sold domestically in approximately 970 and 965 major doors at the end of 2006 and 2005, respectively. Approximately 44.7% of this revenue growth was generated outside of the U.S., primarily in Asia. Currency fluctuations accounted for $1.5 million of the increase in net revenue relating to our Canadian wholesale business.            Net revenue from European operations increased $98.6 million, or 64.1%, to $252.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $153.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was due to growth in our accessories and footwear businesses, higher sales in our apparel wholesale business, and additional sales in our owned retail stores. Currency fluctuations accounted for $1.1 million of the increase in net revenue relating to our European operations.             Net royalties from licensing operations increased by $16.9 million, or 35.0%, to $65.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $48.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was the result of the strength of the accessories business, particularly handbags, watches, and the impact of incremental sales from our new footwear and fragrance licensees. The number of licensees remained consistent in 2006 as compared to 2005.    GROSS PROFIT.     Gross profit increased $138.5 million, or 36.4%, to $519.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $380.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in gross profit primarily resulted from increased sales in all segments and improved gross margin in the European, wholesale and retail segments. Gross profit for the retail segment increased $55.5 million, or 26.0%, to $269.4 million primarily due to higher retail sales volumes and higher margins due to increases in average selling price partially offset by the additional occupancy cost of operating an incremental average 24 net new stores. Gross profit for the wholesale segment increased $12.8 million, or 32.4%, to $52.4 million as a result of increased sales volume and lower markdown allowances. Gross profit for our European operations increased $53.2 million to $132.4 million primarily attributable to the increase in sales. Higher licensing revenue increased overall gross profit by $17.0 million.            Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total net revenues) increased 310 basis points to 43.8% for the year ended December 31, 2006, from 40.7% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The improvement in the overall gross margin was attributable to a higher mix of European and licensing segment revenues, both of which generate higher gross margin than our retail and wholesale segments. Gross margin improved in both Europe and retail due to better product margins and improved occupancy leverage. Gross margin improved in our wholesale business, due mainly to lower markdown allowances.            The Company's gross margins may not be comparable to other entities since some entities include all of the costs related to their distribution in cost of product sales and others, like the Company, exclude the wholesale related distribution costs from gross margin, including them instead in selling, general and administrative expenses.    SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.     SG&A expenses increased $47.3 million, or 16.9%, to $326.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $279.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to a $17.1 million increase in our European operations driven by selling and distribution costs, growth in North America for store selling, merchandising and distribution costs of $12.9 million, incremental compensation expenses (primarily performance-based) of $13.5 million, and additional advertising and marketing spending in our existing    39           businesses of $1.7 million, a $1.4 million increase in professional fees, and a $1.0 million accrual for the settlement of a class action lawsuit. As a percentage of net revenue, SG&A expenses decreased 230 basis points to 27.5% in 2006 from 29.8% in 2005 reflecting lower expenses in the wholesale and licensing segments and improved leverage in both our European and retail segments. The licensing segment included a special performance bonus in 2005 of $4.6 million which did not reoccur in 2006.     EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS.     Earnings from operations increased $91.2 million, or 89.6%, to $193.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of improved profitability in all of our segments. The retail segment generated earnings from operations of $100.4 million in 2006 versus earnings from operations of $65.3 million in 2005. The increase in earnings from operations for the retail segment was due to higher sales, improved gross margin and better expense leverage. Earnings from operations for the wholesale segment were $24.0 million in 2006 compared to $7.3 million in 2005. This increase was principally due to higher U.S. wholesale sales and gross margin, and lower operating expenses. The European segment increased its earnings from operations to $64.2 million in 2006 from $28.1 million in 2005 primarily due to increased sales, improved gross margin and better expense leverage. Earnings from operations for the licensing segment increased to $57.2 million in 2006 from $37.8 million in 2005 due primarily to higher revenues generated by our accessories and footwear licensees and lower SG&A costs. The cost of unallocated corporate overhead increased to $52.8 million in 2006 from $36.7 million in 2005 mainly due to higher compensation related costs including stock-based compensation expense. The combination of higher sales, increased gross margin and lower SG&A expense rate resulted in an increase in operating margin of 540 basis points from 10.9% to 16.3%.    INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME.     Interest expense increased 10.5% to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total debt at December 31, 2006 was $52.4 million which comprised approximately $32.9 million and $19.5 million of bank debt and capital lease obligations in our European operations, respectively, compared to total debt of $88.3 million at December 31, 2005 which included $45.9 million of European borrowings and $40.7 million of the Company's 6.75% Secured Notes. The Secured Notes were redeemed in December 2006 resulting in a $1.4 million write-off of debt issuance costs and a $0.5 million redemption premium which are included in interest expense. On a comparable basis, the average debt balance for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $86.5 million, versus an average debt balance of $91.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Interest income increased to $5.9 million in 2006 from $2.6 million in 2005 due to higher average invested cash balances and higher interest rates on this invested cash.    OTHER INCOME, NET.     Other income was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus zero for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other income in the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily due to gain on the sale of long-term investments, gain on the sale of land, increase in cash surrender value of long-term investments and unrealized gain from interest rate swap contracts.    INCOME TAXES.     Income tax for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $72.7 million, or a 37.1% effective tax rate, compared to income tax of $38.9 million, or a 39.8% effective tax rate, for the year ended December 31, 2005. The change in the effective tax rate compared to the prior year was due to the lower impact of permanent tax differences as a result of increased earnings, the generation of capital gains which allowed the Company to realize capital loss carryforwards and favorable tax audit settlements.    NET EARNINGS.     Net earnings increased by $64.4 million, or 109.4%, to $123.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from earnings of $58.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES             We need liquidity primarily to fund our working capital in Europe, the expansion and remodeling of our retail stores, shop-in-shop programs, systems, infrastructure, other existing operations, international growth, potential acquisitions, potential share repurchases, and payment of dividends to our shareholders. During the year ended February 2, 2008, the Company relied on trade credit, available cash, short-term    40           borrowings from our European bank facilities, real estate leases and internally generated funds to finance its operations and expansion. The Company anticipates that it will be able to satisfy its ongoing cash requirements during the next twelve months for working capital, capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on its debt, potential acquisitions, potential share repurchases and dividend payments to shareholders, primarily with cash flow from operations supplemented by borrowings, if necessary, under the Credit Facility (defined below) and bank facilities in Europe. As of February 2, 2008, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $275.6 million. Excess cash and cash equivalents, which represent the majority of our outstanding cash and cash equivalents balance, are held primarily in one diversified municipal money market fund. The fund, which is AAA rated, is comprised of high-quality, liquid investments. As of February 2, 2008, the Company does not have any exposure to auction-rate security investments in this fund. Please see "Important Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" for a discussion of risk factors which could reasonably be likely to result in a decrease of internally generated funds available to finance capital expenditures and working capital requirements.             The Company has presented below the cash flow performance comparison of the 2008 fiscal year versus the 2007 fiscal year.    Operating Activities             Net cash provided by operating activities was $175.5 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to $141.7 million for the year ended February 3, 2007, or an increase of $33.8 million. The increase was driven by a $55.3 million growth in net income for the year ended February 2, 2008 versus the prior year period, the increase in non-cash items of $34.3 million such as depreciation, share-based compensation expense, deferred taxes and other items. The increase was partially offset by net investments in working capital including increases in accounts receivable to support growth in Europe and Asia, increases in inventory which were offset by increases in accounts payable, and the timing of tax payments.            At February 2, 2008, the Company had working capital (including cash and cash equivalents) of $426.4 million compared to $283.9 million at February 3, 2007. The Company's primary working capital needs are for inventory and accounts receivable. Accounts receivable at February 2, 2008 amounted to $254.4 million, up $111.7 million, compared to $142.7 million at February 3, 2007. Approximately $57.1 million of the increase resulted from the growth in accounts receivable related to our existing European business, which totaled $141.8 million at February 2, 2008, versus $84.7 million at February 3, 2007. Approximately $69.8 million of this $141.8 million of European receivables were insured for collection purposes. Our new Focus, BARN, South Korea, Mexico and Greater China operations accounted for approximately $36.8 million of the remaining growth in receivables, of which $13.3 million was insured. Currency translation fluctuations accounted for $24.3 million of the increase in accounts receivable. The Company's inventory increased $58.5 million to $232.2 million at February 2, 2008 from $173.7 million at February 3, 2007. Approximately $31.0 million of this increase was attributed to the Company's new businesses, including Focus, BARN, our new South Korea, Greater China and Mexico operations, and our new G by GUESS store concept, with the remaining increase driven by our existing North American retail, European and other international operations to support anticipated sales growth in fiscal 2009.    Investing Activities             Net cash used in investing activities increased to $111.9 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to $75.7 million for the year ended February 3, 2007, or an increase of $36.2 million. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was driven by the opening of 49 new stores in North America during the 2008 fiscal year compared to 33 new stores that were opened in the comparable prior year period, the conversion of 20 stores to the new G by GUESS concept, retail store remodeling programs, expansion in Europe and Asia, investments in information systems and enhancements in other infrastructure during the 2008 fiscal year. The increase in cash used in investing activities was partially    41           offset by the net proceeds received related to the assignment of an aircraft purchase agreement in fiscal 2008.    Financing Activities             Net cash used in financing activities decreased to $0.1 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, compared to $25.9 million for the year ended February 3, 2007, or a decrease of $25.8 million. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the payments relating to the Company's 6.75% secured notes in the prior year period, partially offset by the payment of cash dividends of $26.3 million during the year ended February 2, 2008.    Contractual Obligations and Commitments             The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations at February 2, 2008 and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands):             Payments due by period          Total     Less than  1 year     1-3  years     3-5  years     More than  5 years    Contractual Obligations:                                                 Short-term borrowings     $  32,427     $  32,427     $       $       $      Debt obligations(1)        1,189        643        546                    Capital lease obligations(1)        24,854        2,868        4,989        4,880        12,117    Operating lease obligations(2)        647,651        102,403        175,881        141,418        227,949    Purchase obligations        122,658        122,658                            Benefit obligations (3)        110,448                        7,253        103,195    Other long-term liabilities (4)        8,421        7,878        543                                                Total     $  947,648     $  268,877     $  181,959     $  153,551     $  343,261                             Other commercial commitments(5)     $  23,827     $  23,827     $       $       $                                   (1) Includes interest on long-term debt and capital lease obligations. (2) Does not include insurance, taxes and common area maintenance charges. In fiscal 2008, these variable charges totaled $36.5 million. (3) Includes expected payments associated with deferred compensation plan and SERP through fiscal 2037. (4) Includes FIN 48 tax liabilities. The Company is unable to determine when these open items will be resolved. For purposes of this table, the full FIN 48 liability has been included in payments due in less than 1 year. (5) Consists of standby letters of credit for guarantee of foreign subsidiary's borrowings, workers' compensation and general liability insurance.    Dividend Policy             During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share on the Company's common stock. Since that time, the Company has continued to pay a quarterly cash dividend, with a $0.06 per share dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 and an $0.08 per share dividend paid in each subsequent fiscal quarter.    42                  In continuation of this practice, on March 19, 2008, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share on the Company's common stock. The dividend will be payable on April 18, 2008 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 2, 2008.             The payment of cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based upon a number of business, legal and other considerations, including our cash flow from operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes, earnings, share repurchases and liquidity.    Capital Expenditures             Gross capital expenditures totaled $100.2 million, before deducting lease incentives of $11.0 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. This compares to gross capital expenditures of $52.3 million, before deducting lease incentives of $5.2 million, for the year ended February 3, 2007. The Company's capital expenditures for the full fiscal year 2009 are planned at approximately $137.0 million (before deducting estimated lease incentives of approximately $11.0. million) primarily for retail store expansion of approximately 60 stores in the U.S. and Canada, store remodeling programs, expansion in Europe and Asia, investments in information systems and enhancements in other infrastructure.            The Company evaluates strategic acquisitions and alliances and pursues those that we believe will support and contribute to our overall growth initiatives. The combined purchase price for Focus and Focus Spain was finalized in October 2007 in the amount of €19.4 million ($25.6 million) which included an initial payment of €10.0 million in cash, €2.0 in GUESS? common stock and €7.4 in final payments after resolving certain purchase price adjustments and other contingencies with the Seller.            Effective January 16, 2008, the Company, through a subsidiary, acquired 100% of the capital stock of BARN for a purchase price of approximately €5.0 million ($7.4 million), subject to certain purchase price adjustments which are expected to be finalized as part of the pending audit of the acquired balance sheet. The acquisition included inventory, trade receivables, payables, debt and certain long term assets used to operate the business including leasehold interests related to four GUESS KIDS stores.     Credit Facilities             On September 19, 2006, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit facility led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders (the "Credit Facility"). The Credit Facility provides for an $85 million revolving multicurrency line of credit and is available for direct borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit, subject to certain letters of credit sublimits. The Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on September 30, 2011. The Credit Facility replaced the (a) Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement by and among Wachovia Capital Finance Corporation (Western) (formerly known as Congress Financial Corporation (Western)) and Guess, Guess? Retail, Inc. and Guess.com, Inc., dated as of December 20, 2002, as amended, and (b) Canadian Loan and Security Agreement by and among Wachovia Capital Finance Corporation (Canada) (formerly known as Congress Financial Corporation (Canada)) and Guess Canada, dated as of December 20, 2002, as amended (together, the "Prior Credit Facility").            The obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries, and such obligations, including the guarantees, are secured by (a) substantially all present and future property and assets of the Company and each guarantor and (b) the equity interests of certain of the Company's direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the equity interests of the Company's first tier foreign subsidiaries.             Direct borrowings under the Credit Facility will be made, at the Company's option, as (a) Eurodollar Rate Loans, which shall bear interest at the published LIBOR rate for the respective interest period plus an applicable margin (which was 0.75% at February 2, 2008) based on the Company's leverage ratio at the time, or (b) Base Rate Loans, which shall bear interest at the higher of (i) for domestic loans, 0.50% in    43           excess of the federal funds rate, and for Canadian loans, 0.50% in excess of the average rate for 30 day Canada dollar bankers' acceptances, or (ii) the rate of interest as announced by Bank of America as its "prime rate," in each case as in effect from time to time, plus an applicable margin (which was 0.0% at February 2, 2008) based on the Company's leverage ratio at the time. The Company is also obligated to pay certain commitment, letter of credit and other fees customary for a credit facility of this size and type. At February 2, 2008, the Company had $23.8 million in outstanding standby letters of credit, $15.2 million in outstanding documentary letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.            The Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the Company and its subsidiaries' ability to: incur liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets, make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Credit Facility and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (some of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods), including, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults and material judgment defaults.             The Company, through its European subsidiaries, maintains short-term borrowing agreements, primarily for working capital purposes, with various banks in Europe. Under these agreements, which are generally secured by specific accounts receivable balances, the Company can borrow up to $222.3 million, limited by accounts receivable balances at the time of borrowing, except for one borrowing agreement which is secured by a $15.0 million standby letter of credit issued under the Company's Credit Facility. Based on the applicable accounts receivable balances at February 2, 2008, the Company could have borrowed up to approximately $194.6 million under these agreements. However, the Company's ability to borrow through foreign subsidiaries is generally limited to $185.0 million under the terms of our Credit Facility. At February 2, 2008, the Company had $32.1 million of outstanding borrowings and $1.7 million in outstanding documentary letters of credit under these agreements. The agreements are denominated in Euros, have no financial ratio covenants and provide for annual interest rates ranging from 4.6% to 6.1%. The maturities of the short-term borrowings are linked to the credit terms of the underlying accounts receivable that secure the borrowings.            The Company entered into a capital lease of approximately $16.0 million in December 2005 for a new building in Florence, Italy, with subsequent build-outs which were completed in 2006. Key functions related to the Company's Italian operation are located in this building, including design and merchandising. This transaction resulted in a capital lease obligation of $20.4 million as of February 2, 2008. The Company entered into separate interest rate swap agreements designated as non-hedging instruments resulting in a fixed rate of 3.55%. These interest rate swap agreements mature through 2016 and convert the nature of the capital lease obligation from Euribor floating rate debt to fixed rate debt. The fair value of the interest rate swap asset as of February 2, 2008 was approximately $0.5 million.            From time to time the Company will obtain other short term financing in foreign countries for working capital to finance its local operations.     Other             On August 23, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") which became effective January 1, 2006. The SERP provides select employees who satisfy certain eligibility requirements with certain benefits upon retirement, termination of employment, death, disability or a change in control of the Company, in certain prescribed circumstances. The initial participants in the SERP are Maurice Marciano, Chairman of the Board, Paul Marciano, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman of the Board, and Carlos Alberini, President and Chief Operating Officer. As a non-qualified pension plan, no funding of the SERP is required; however, the Company    44           expects to make annual payments into an insurance policy held in a rabbi trust to fund the expected obligations arising under the SERP. The cash surrender value of the insurance policy was $13.3 million and $7.7 million, respectively, as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007 and is included in other assets. The amount of future payments may vary, depending on the future years of service, future annual compensation of the participants and investment performance of the trust.            In January 2002, the Company established a qualified employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP"), the terms of which allow for qualified employees (as defined) to participate in the purchase of designated shares of the Company's common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing price at the beginning or end of each quarterly stock purchase period. On January 23, 2002, the Company filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-8 registering 4,000,000 shares of common stock for the ESPP. During the year ended February 2, 2008, 32,659 shares of the Company's common stock were issued out of its treasury shares and 21,584 shares were issued out of its common shares pursuant to the ESPP at an average price of $33.18 per share for a total of $1.8 million.            In March 2008, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the previously authorized 2001 share repurchase program and authorized a new program to repurchase, from time-to-time and as market and business conditions warrant, up to $200 million of our common stock. Repurchases may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or other available means. There is no minimum or maximum number of shares to be repurchased under the program and the program may be discontinued at any time, without prior notice.    SEASONALITY             The Company's business is impacted by the general seasonal trends characteristic of the apparel and retail industries. U.S. retail operations are generally stronger from July through December, and U.S. wholesale operations generally experience stronger performance in July, August and September. The European operations are largely wholesale driven and operate with two primary selling seasons. Spring/Summer primarily ships in January, February and March and Fall/Winter primarily ships in July, August and September. The remaining months of the year are relatively small shipping months in Europe. Due to the seasonality of the business, the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year.    INFLATION             The Company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in the U.S. and Europe over the last three years have had a significant effect on net revenue or profitability. Although higher rates of inflation have been experienced in a number of foreign countries in which the Company's products are manufactured and sold, management does not believe that foreign rates of inflation have had a material adverse effect on the Company's net revenue or profitability.    IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS             In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 ("SFAS 157"), "Fair Value Measurement", which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS 157 are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 157-1 and FSP SFAS 157-2. FSP 157-1 amends SFAS 157 to exclude SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases", and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions. FSP FAS 157-2 will delay the effective date of SFAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). FSP FAS 157-2 partially defers the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of FSP 157-2. Effective for fiscal 2009, the Company will adopt SFAS 157 except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial    45           liabilities as noted in FSP FAS 157-2. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect that the adoption of SFAS 157 could have on its financial position and results of operations.            In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 ("SFAS 159"), "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities", which permits entities to voluntarily choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 provides entities an opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings that is caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and will be effective for the Company beginning on February 3, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect that the adoption of SFAS 159 could have on its financial position and results of operations.            In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), ("SFAS 141R"), "Business Combinations", which replaces FASB Statement 141. SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS 141(R) also modifies the recognition for preacquisition contingencies, such as environmental or legal issues, restructuring plans and acquired research and development value in purchase accounting. SFAS 141(R) amends SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", to require the acquirer to recognize changes in the amount of its deferred tax benefits that are recognizable because of a business combination either in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination or directly in contributed capital, depending on the circumstances. SFAS 141R also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective as of the beginning of an entity's fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS 141R on the Company's consolidated financial statements relating to potential future acquisitions.            In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 ("SFAS 160") "Accounting for Noncontrolling Interests", which clarifies the classification of noncontrolling interests in consolidated statements of financial position and the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such noncontrolling interests. SFAS 160 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS 160 on the Company's consolidated financial statements.            In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161 ("SFAS 161"), "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which amends SFAS 133 and expands disclosures to include information about the fair value of derivatives, related credit risks and a company's strategies and objectives for using derivatives. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is encouraged. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of SFAS 161 on its disclosures in the Company's consolidated financial statements.            ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.         Exchange Rate Risk             Approximately half of product sales and licensing revenue recorded for the year ended February 2, 2008 were denominated in United States dollars. The Company's primary exchange rate risk relates to operations in Canada and Europe. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts and currency swaps, to manage exchange risk on foreign currency transactions. The Company does not hedge all transactions denominated in foreign currency.            During the year ended February 2, 2008, the Company purchased U.S. dollar forward contracts in Canada totaling US$52.0 million to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases that were designated as cash-flow hedges. As of February 2, 2008, approximately US$27.0 million were outstanding and are expected to mature over the next eleven months. Our derivative financial instruments are recorded on the    46           consolidated balance sheet at fair value based on quoted market rates. These forward contracts are used to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases over specific months. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash-flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in cost of goods sold in the period which approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold.             An unrealized loss of approximately US$1.5 million, net of tax, primarily relating to contracts that have already matured, has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at February 2, 2008 and will be recognized as a charge to cost of goods sold on a pre-tax basis over the next five months. At February 2, 2008, the unrealized gain of the remaining open forward contracts recorded on the balance sheet was approximately US$0.1 million.            Also, the Company has foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expenses. For the year ended February 2, 2008, the Company recorded losses for the Canadian and Euro foreign currency contracts of US$1.9 million and US$5.5 million, respectively, which has been included in other income and expenses. At February 2, 2008, the Company had Canadian dollar foreign currency contracts to purchase US$26.0 million, expected to mature over the next eleven months and Euro foreign currency contracts to purchase US$87.6 million, expected to mature over the next nine months. At February 2, 2008, the unrealized losses of these Canadian and Euro forward contracts were approximately $3.3 million, primarily relating to the Euro forward contracts, and were recorded in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.            At February 2, 2008, a sensitivity analysis to changes in the foreign currencies when measured against the U.S. dollar indicates that, if the U.S. dollar had uniformly weakened by 10% against all of the foreign exchange derivatives, the fair value of the instruments would have decreased by US$16.0 million. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened by 10% against all of the foreign exchange derivatives, the fair value of these instruments would have increased by US$13.1 million. Any resulting changes in the fair value of the hedged instruments would have been partially offset by changes in the fair value of certain balance sheet positions impacted by the change in the foreign currency rate.            At December 31, 2006, the Company had Canadian dollar currency exchange contracts to purchase US$3.0 million and Euro currency exchange contracts to purchase US$50.0 million. The value of those contracts at December 31, 2006 were US$2.9 million and US$51.5 million, respectively, resulting in a net unrealized loss of US$1.4 million.    Interest Rate Risk             At February 2, 2008, approximately 38.8% of the Company's indebtedness related to a capital lease obligation which is covered by interest rate swap agreements resulting in a fixed interest rate of 3.55% over the life of the lease obligation. Changes in the related interest rate that result in an unrealized gain or loss on the fair value of the swap are reported in other income or expenses. The change in the unrealized fair value of the interest swap had an immaterial impact during the year ended February 2, 2008. Substantially all of the Company's remaining indebtedness, principally consisting of short-term borrowings under the short-term European borrowing agreements, is at variable rates of interest. Accordingly, changes in interest rates would impact the Company's results of operations in future periods. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense for the year ended February 2, 2008 by approximately $0.5 million.            The fair value of the Company's debt instruments are based on the amount of future cash flows associated with each instrument discounted using the Company's borrowing rate. At February 2, 2008, the carrying value of all financial instruments was not materially different from fair value, as the interest rate on the Company's debt approximates rates currently available to the Company.    47                   ITEM 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
