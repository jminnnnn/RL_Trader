ITEM 7.       MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND               RESULTS OF OPERATION  GENERAL           We derive our net revenue from the sale of GUESS men's, women's, boys' and girls' apparel and our licensees' products through our network of retail and factory outlet stores primarily in the United States, from the sale of GUESS men's, women's, boys' and girls' apparel worldwide to wholesale customers and distributors, from net royalties from worldwide licensing activities, from the sale of GUESS apparel through the retail and wholesale channels of our 60% owned Canadian subsidiary, GUESS? Canada Corporation ("Guess Canada"), and from the sale of GUESS men's, women's, boys' and girls' apparel and our licensee products through our on-line store at www.guess.com.           The business segments of the Company are wholesale, retail and licensing operations. Management evaluates segment performance based primarily on revenue and earnings from operations.                                         15   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table sets forth actual operating results for the 2000, 1999 and 1998 fiscal years as a percentage of net revenue:                                                                                   Year Ended December 31,                                                                      -------------------------------------                                                                        2000           1999          1998                                                                      --------       --------      --------        Product sales                                                            95.2%          93.4%         92.2% Net royalties                                                             4.8            6.6           7.8                                                                      --------       --------      --------     Total net revenue                                                   100.0          100.0         100.0 Cost of sales                                                            63.6           55.3          57.7                                                                      --------       --------      -------- Gross profit                                                             36.4           44.7          42.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses                             29.9           28.5          30.2 Severance (recovery) related to distribution facility relocation         (0.2)           0.5            -- Restructuring and impairment charges                                      1.1             --            --                                                                      --------       --------      --------     Earnings from operations                                              5.6           15.7          12.1 Gain on disposition of property and equipment                              --            0.6            -- Interest, net                                                             1.8            1.6           2.7 Other net                                                                  --            0.2           0.2                                                                      --------       --------      --------     Earnings before income taxes                                          3.8           14.5           9.2 Income taxes                                                              1.7            5.9           3.9                                                                      --------       --------      --------     Net earnings                                                          2.1%           8.6%          5.3%                                                                      ========       ========      =========    YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999.           NET REVENUE. Net revenue increased $179.5 million or 29.9% to $779.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $599.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.  Net revenue from retail operations increased $93.1 million or 31.1% to $392.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $299.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in net revenues was attributable to the volume generated by 56 new stores coupled with a 5.8% increase in comparable store sales. While comparable store sales were strong during the first six months of 2000, increasing 14.2%, our sales trends decelerated in the third quarter, and comparable store sales declined 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2000, partly due to a challenging retail environment. These lower than expected sales trends also impacted our new stores, including the new stores in Canada and the Guess? Kids' stores.  Net revenue from wholesale operations increased $88.3 million or 33.9% to $348.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, from $260.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Domestic and international wholesale operations net revenue increased, for the year ended December 31, 2000, by $61.0 million to $289.9 million and by $27.3 million to $59.0 million, respectively. Our domestic wholesale net revenue increased primarily as a result of the increased demand for fashion products in both our women's and men's lines. International wholesale operations net revenue increased primarily as a result of higher sales in Asia and the full-year inclusion of Guess Canada's operations which contributed $20.4 million in international wholesale net revenue for the 2000 year.  Net royalties decreased by $1.8 million or 4.6% to $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The decrease in net royalties was related to the discontinuation of certain licenses and the impact of currency devaluation in European and Asian markets. Net revenue from international operations comprised 1.7% and 6.7% of net product royalties during 2000 and 1999, respectively.                                          16            GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit increased 5.8% to $283.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $268.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in gross profit resulted from higher net revenue from product sales. Gross profit from product sales increased 7.6% to $245.8 million for the 2000 fiscal year from $228.4 million for the 1999 fiscal year.  Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total net revenue) decreased to 36.4% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 44.7% for the year ended December 31, 1999. Gross margin from product sales decreased to 33.2% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 40.8% for the year ended December 31, 1999.  The decrease in gross margin from product sales was experienced in both our retail and wholesale operations. Gross margin in our retail operation in fiscal year 2000 was negatively impacted by increased promotional markdowns to reduce excess inventory, inventory write-downs, higher shrinkage results and higher occupancy costs due to the lower sales productivity of new stores and rent expenses for stores not opened. Royalty revenues as a percentage of total net revenue decreased from 6.6% in 1999 to 4.8% in 2000. This reduced overall gross margins as royalty revenue has no associated cost of sales.  Gross margin in our wholesale domestic and international operations in fiscal year 2000 was negatively impacted by higher markdown and return allowances to department and specialty stores and sales to the off-price channels at prices below cost, or reduced margin in an effort to reduce excess inventory. In addition, the Company recorded special charges of approximately $10.3 million to reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market.           SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased to $233.2 million, or 29.9% of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000, from $171.0 million, or 28.5% of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999.  SG&A expenses increased 36.4% in 2000 compared to 1999 as a result of expenses necessary to operate new stores, higher costs at the new distribution facility, including start-up expenses and higher payroll due to lower productivity and higher unit volume, increased expenses incurred by Guess Canada, higher advertising expenses and consulting fees. During the first six months of 2000, we incurred start-up and other non-recurring pre-tax costs of $5.3 million relating to the relocation of our distribution operation to Kentucky. Additionally, at the beginning of the first quarter 2000, we revised our vacation pay policies to enhance employee benefits, which resulted in a one-time pre-tax charge of $1.3 million.           SEVERANCE RECOVERY RELATED TO DISTRIBUTION FACILITY RELOCATION. In accordance with the requirements of EITF 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)," the Company recorded a $3.2 million charge, in the second quarter ended June 26, 1999, for future severance costs of 460 employees related to the relocation of its distribution operations from Los Angeles to Louisville, Kentucky. As a result of employee transfers and attrition of 228 employees the severance costs actually incurred for Los Angeles-based employees was $1.7 million which has resulted in a recovery of $1.5 million of the severance charge in the second quarter of 2000. The Company successfully completed the transition of all product lines to the new distribution center during the second quarter of 2000. Because distribution operations were transferred to Kentucky, the Company does not expect to experience significant reduced employee expenses.           RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2000, the Company recorded restructuring charges including store closure costs primarily related to rent paid and esimated rent to be paid on idle lease facilities, lease exit costs and construction costs of stores abandoned during construction in the amount of $4.5 million. This is inclusive of charges of $0.8 million of asset impairments for under-performing stores that the Company plans to close. Cash payments of approximately $1.7 million consisting primarily of estimated rent to be paid on idle lease facilities and lease exit costs are anticipated to be paid during 2001. Annual rental savings from these closures should approximate $1.7 million per year. Annual depreciation expense savings from these closures is not expected to be significant.           The Company also recorded an additional $4.1 million of charges to write-down the value of certain impaired assets, including fixed assets related to unprofitable stores and an investment the Company has in an internet company. Related annual depreciation is expected to be reduced by approximatley $0.3 million.           EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS. Earnings from operations were $43.3 million in 2000 as compared to $93.8 million in 1999, a decrease of $50.5 million or 53.8%. The decrease in earnings from operations for the retail operating segment to $3.4 million in 2000, from $37.1 million in 1999 resulted principally from store restructuring and impairment charges of $6.2 million as discussed above, higher occupancy costs and higher new store expenses. The decrease in earnings from operations for the wholesale operating segment to $9.2 million in 2000 from $25.1 million in 1999 resulted principally from increased markdown and return allowances, start-up and other non-recurring costs related to the relocation of our distribution operation and increased SG&A expenses. Earnings from operations for the licensing operating segment decreased to $30.8 million in 2000, from $31.6 million in 1999 principally due to fewer licenses in 2000.           INTEREST EXPENSE, NET. Interest expense, net, increased to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase resulted from higher outstanding average debt, due to higher inventory levels throughout the year and significant capital expenditures during 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the average debt balance was $131.6 million, with an average effective interest rate of 9.0%. For the year ended December 31, 1999, the average debt balance was $93.1 million, with an average effective interest rate of 9.5%.           INCOME TAXES. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $13.1 million, or a 44.3% effective tax rate. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $35.2 million, or a                                          17   40.4% effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for 2000 was negatively impacted by a foreign subsidiary loss and potential income tax liabilities as a result of federal and certain state income tax audits.           NET EARNINGS. Net earnings decreased to $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $51.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998.           NET REVENUE. Net revenue increased $127.7 million or 27.1% to $599.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $471.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Net revenue from retail operations increased $76.7 million or 34.5% to $299.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, from a 26.8% increase in comparable store net revenue and from the volume generated by our new store openings. The strong increase in comparable store net revenue was primarily attributable to our improved merchandising and our fashioned-focused product mix. The retail segment is benefiting from our improved customer service levels resulting from our enhanced personnel training and incentive programs that have been offered to our associates.  Net revenue from wholesale operations increased $48.1 million or 22.6% to $260.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $212.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Domestic and international wholesale operations net revenue increased, for the year ended December 31, 1999, by $40.6 million to $228.7 million and by $7.4 million to $31.9 million, respectively. Our domestic wholesale net revenue increased primarily as a result of the increased demand for fashion products in both of our women's and men's lines. International wholesale operations net revenue increased due primarily to increased sales from the European market, partially offset by soft performance in the Asian and South American markets. GUESS Canada contributed $12.1 million in international net revenues during the second half for the year ended December 31, 1999. Net royalties increased $2.8 million or 7.7%, to $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase in net royalties was primarily due to settlements and adjustments related to us terminating licensees, partially offset by us discontinuing certain licenses that were brought back in-house and the continuing economic turmoil and currency devaluation in Asian markets. Net revenue from international operations comprised 6.7% and 5.6% of net product revenue during 1999 and 1998, respectively.           GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit increased 34.1% to $268.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $199.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase in gross profit resulted from higher net revenue from product sales. Gross profit from product sales increased 40.1% to $228.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $163.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total net revenue) increased to 44.7% for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to 42.3% for the year ended December 31, 1998. Gross margin from product sales increased to 40.8% for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to 37.5% for the year ended December 31, 1998.  The increase in our gross margin from product sales was primarily the result of fixed store occupancy costs being spread over a larger comparable store revenue base, a favorable mix in retail net revenue, which generally carries a higher gross margin rate, lower off-price sales and a decrease in wholesale markdowns and allowances as a percentage of wholesale net revenues.  Furthermore, during the fourth quarter of 1999, we enhanced our ability to estimate reserves through improved processes and more current and accurate data. As a result, we revised our estimate of certain reserves. This resulted in a reduction of cost of sales of $2.3 million and an increase in gross margin of $2.3 million or 2.4%.           SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses of $171.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 decreased to 28.5% of net revenue, from 30.3% of net revenue or $142.8 million, in the year ended December 31, 1998. The decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due to our ability to leverage certain expenses against a higher revenue base, as well as the success of our ongoing cost containment programs.           GAIN ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. We realized a non-recurring pre-tax gain of $3.8 million on the disposition of property and equipment.                                          18            SEVERANCE (RECOVERY) RELATED TO DISTRIBUTION FACILITY RELOCATION. In accordance with the requirements of EITF 94-3, "Liability for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)," we recorded a $3.2 million charge for future severance costs related to the relocation of our distribution operations from Los Angeles, California to Louisville, Kentucky.           EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS . Earnings from operations increased 64.4% to $93.8 million, or 15.6% of net revenue, for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $57.0 million, or 12.1% of net revenue, for the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase was primarily due to higher revenue.           INTEREST EXPENSE, NET. Net interest expense decreased 27.1% to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. This decrease resulted primarily from a lower outstanding average debt. For the year ended December 31, 1999, the average debt balance was $93.1 million, with an average effective interest rate of 9.5%. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the average debt balance was $135.5 million, with an average effective interest rate of 9.0%.           INCOME TAXES. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $35.2 million, or a 40.4% effective tax rate. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 1998 was $18.2 million, or a 42.0% effective tax rate. The effective tax for 1998 was adversely impacted by Federal and state income taxes related to a dividend declared to us by one of our foreign subsidiaries.           NET EARNINGS. Net earnings increased to $51.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, from $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1998.                                          19   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           During our fiscal year 2000, we relied primarily on borrowings under our $125.0 million Credit Agreement ("Credit Facility"), trade credit and internally generated funds to finance our operations and expansion. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $57.1 million to $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, from $87.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The decrease in the current year was primarily due to lower earnings. At December 31, 2000, we had working capital of $96.3 million compared to $97.9 million at December 31, 1999. The net decrease in working capital was primarily attributable to decreases in short-term investments and receivables, increases in inventories and other current assets, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and an increase in current installments of notes payable and long-term debt. The most significant changes were represented by short-term investments, which decreased by $26.2 million due to the sale of investments to fund the business expansion, inventories, which increased $37.6 million due to new stores and growth in the wholesale business and accounts payable, which increased $22.3 million as a result of increased inventories.           On December 3, 1999, we entered into a Credit Facility with Chase Manhattan Bank that replaced our $100.0 million revolving credit facility entered into in March 1997. The Credit Facility provides us with a $125.0 million revolving credit facility subject to a borrowing base calculation and is secured by inventory and accounts receivable including a $50.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The Credit Facility bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a range as defined or the greater of the Prime rate, the base CD rate plus 100 basis points or the Federal Funds Effective Rate (collectively "ABR") plus a range as defined depending on the duration and type of loan facility. The Credit Facility expires on October 31, 2002. Borrowing under the Credit Facility primarily funded capital projects and growth in inventories. At December 31, 2000, we had $22.4 million outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility, $17.6 million in outstanding documentary letters of credit and $4.0 million in standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2000, we had $81.0 million available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants requiring, among other things, the maintenance of certain financial ratios. As a result of lower than expected financial results in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2000, the Company was in non-compliance with the terms of the Credit Facility regarding the fixed charge coverage ratio required for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2000. On March 27, 2001 the Company's bank lenders agreed to amend the Credit Facility Agreement to cure all past non-compliance and revise certain terms, including modifications to the financial covenants, the addition of a liquidity ratio and an amendment to the range of interest rates based on the leverage ratio as follows: LIBOR plus 100 basis points to LIBOR plus 225 basis points, ABR to ABR plus 125 basis points and commitment fees of 25 basis points to 62.5 basis points. Accordingly, the Company is presently in full compliance with all the terms of the Credit Facility, as amended.           The Company has also agreed to provide long-term financing of up to $13.4 million to Guess Canada to expand its retail operations, of which $12.3 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2000. The remaining funding is being provided on an as-needed basis.           Capital expenditures, net of lease incentives granted, totaled $79.1 million for 2000 and $62.0 million for 1999. The increase in capital expenditures was due primarily to our increase in store openings and remodels, the retail expansion of Guess Canada, our expansion of shop-in shops in department stores and investments in our systems infrastructure. Capital expenditures by our retail operating segment increased to $57.3 million in 2000 from $26.5 million in 1999 primarily due to retail store expansion and store remodels. Capital expenditures by our wholesale operating segment decreased to $21.8 million in 2000 from $35.5 million in 1999 as the distribution facility construction costs were primarily incurred in 1999. Our capital expenditures planned for 2001 are approximately $40.0 million, primarily for retail store expansion, including our expansion in Canada, store remodelings, investments in systems and shop-in-shop expansion and enhancements.           We anticipate we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements through 2001, including retail expansion plans and interest payments on our senior subordinated notes due 2003 (such interest payments paid by us during 2000 amounted to $7.6 million), primarily with cash flow from operations, supplemented by borrowings under our Credit Facility.  IMPORTANT FACTORS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS           Various forward-looking statements have been made in this Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements may also be in our other reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in our press releases and in other documents. In addition, from time to time, we, through our management, may make oral forward-looking statements.           Forward-looking statements are only expectations, and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results in future periods and other future events to differ materially from what is currently anticipated. Certain statements in this Form 10-K, including those relating to our expected results, the accuracy of data relating to, and anticipated levels of, our future inventory and gross margins, our anticipated cash requirements and sources, our cost containment efforts, our plans regarding store openings and closings and our business seasonality, are forward-looking statements. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements. In addition to the factors discussed below, the economic and other factors identified elsewhere in this Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors discussed in our previously filed public documents, could affect the forward-looking statements contained herein and therein.                                          20             Forward-looking statements generally refer to future plans and performance, and are identified by the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "optimistic," "intend," "aim," "will" or the negative thereof and similar expressions. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of which they are made. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements.  Important factors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, as well as affect our ability to achieve our financial and other goals, include, but are not limited to, the following:  - -    The lack of continued availability of sufficient working capital.  - -    Our inability to integrate new stores into existing operations.  - -    The decline in continued desirability and customer acceptance of our      existing and future products.  - -    Possible cancellation of wholesale orders.  - -    The success of our competitive products.  - -    Our inability to strengthen our inventory cost accounting      controls and procedures.  - -    Our inability to identify and respond appropriately to changing consumer      demands and fashion trends.  - -    A decision by the controlling owner of a group of department stores or any      other significant customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to      cease carrying GUESS products.  - -    Our inability to control the quality, focus, image, financial stability or      distribution of our licensed products, which could impact consumer      receptivity to our products.  - -    Our failure to continue to enhance operating control systems.  - -    The outcomes of pending and future litigation.  - -    Factors beyond our control, such as which could have a material adverse      effect on our ability to expand our network of retail stores. Our general      failure to maintain and control our existing distribution and licensing      arrangements or to procure additional distribution and licensing      relationships.  - -    Changes in the economy.  - -    The extended loss of the services of one or more of our principal executive      officers.  - -    Political instability resulting in the disruption of trade with the      countries in which our contractors, suppliers or customers are located, the      imposition of additional regulations relating to imports, the imposition of      additional duties, taxes and other charges on imports, significant      fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies or      restrictions on the transfer of funds. Also, a substantial increase in      customs duties, which could have an adverse effect on our financial      condition or results of operations. These factors may be exacerbated by      our increasing use of packaged purchase sourcing from non-United States      vendors.                                          21   - -    The inability of a manufacturer to ship our products in a timely manner or      to meet our quality standards.  - -    No assurance can be given that others will not assert rights in, or      ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of GUESS?. In      addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect proprietary      rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.  SEASONALITY           Our business is impacted by general seasonal trends characteristic of the apparel and retail industries. Our retail operations are generally stronger in the third and fourth quarters, while our wholesale operations generally experience stronger performance in the first and third quarters. As the timing of the shipment of products may vary from year to year, the result for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year. We have not had significant overhead and other costs generally associated with large seasonal variations.  INFLATION           We do not believe the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in the United States over the last three years have had a significant effect on our net revenue or profitability. Although higher rates of inflation have been experienced in a number of foreign countries in which our products are manufactured, we do not believe they have had a material adverse effect on our net revenue or profitability.  IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS           In June 1998, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133") was issued and subsequently amended by SFAS 137. SFAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. It is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. We believe the adoption of SFAS 133 will not have a material impact on our financial reporting.  ITEM 7A.      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS           We receive United States dollars for substantially all of our product sales and our licensing revenues. Inventory purchases from offshore contract manufacturers are primarily denominated in United States dollars; however, purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers, which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods in the future. In addition, royalties received from our international licensees are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations as a result of the net sales of the licensee being denominated in local currency and royalties being paid to us in United States dollars. During the last three fiscal years, exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on our inventory costs.           We may enter into derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts, to manage foreign exchange risk on foreign currency transactions. These financial instruments can be used to protect us from the risk that the eventual net cash inflows from the foreign currency transactions will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Unrealized gains and losses on outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts, used to hedge future revenues and purchases, are not recorded in the financial statements but are included in the measurement of the related hedged transaction when realized. The Company will adopt SFAS 133 effective January 1, 2001. This could impact the Company's accounting of derivatives.          FORWARD EXCHANGE           U.S. DOLLAR                                               FAIR VALUE IN U.S. $          CONTRACTS               EQUIVALENT                 MATURITY DATE                  AT DECEMBER 31, 2000       ----------------           -----------                -------------                  --------------------              Canadian dollars          $  750,000     December 15, 2000 to January 16, 2001            $  764,161       Canadian dollars           1,000,000     January 3, 2001 to January 31, 2001               1,017,948       Canadian dollars           1,000,000     January 16, 2001 to February 16, 2001             1,016,547       Canadian dollars             750,000     February 1, 2001 to February 28,2001                763,911   Based upon the rates at December 31, 2000, the cost to buy the equivalent U.S. dollars discussed above was approximately $5.3 million Canadian currency.  At December 31, 2000, 76% of the Company's indebtedness contained a fixed interest rate of 9.5%. Substantially all of the Company's remaining indebtedness, including borrowings under its $125 million credit facility is at                                          22   variable rates of interest. Accordingly, changes in interest rates would impact the Company's results of operations in future periods. A 10% change in interest rate is not expected to significantly impact the Company's operating results.  ITEM 8.       FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
