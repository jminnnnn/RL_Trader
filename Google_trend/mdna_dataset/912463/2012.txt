ITEM 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.         General            Unless the context indicates otherwise, when we refer to "we," "us," "our" or the "Company" in this Form 10-K, weare referring to Guess?, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.    Business Segments            The Company's businesses are grouped into five reportable segments for management and internal financial reporting purposes: Europe,North American Retail, Asia, North American Wholesale and Licensing. Information relating to these segments is summarized in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Managementevaluates segment performance based primarily on revenues and earnings from operations. The Company believes this segment reporting reflects how its five business segments are managed and eachsegment's performance is evaluated. The Europe segment includes the Company's wholesale and retail operations in Europe and the Middle East. The North American Retail segment includes the Company'sretail operations in North America. The Asia segment includes the Company's wholesale and retail operations in Asia. The North American Wholesale segment includes the Company's wholesale operations inNorth America and export sales to Central and South America. The Licensing segment includes the worldwide licensing operations of the Company. The business segment operating results exclude corporateoverhead costs, which consist of shared costs of the organization. These costs are presented separately and generally include, among other things, the following unallocated corporate costs:information technology, human resources, global advertising and marketing, accounting and finance, executive compensation, facilities and legal.           Ourinternational jewelry license agreement, which expired in December 2009, was not renewed as the Company decided to directly operate this business going forward. Beginning in January2010, the operating results of our international jewelry business are included in our Europe segment. Prior to that date, we recorded the related royalty income in our licensing segment.    Products            We derive our net revenue from the sale of GUESS?, GUESS by MARCIANO, GUESS Kids and G by GUESS men's and women's apparel, and ourlicensees' products through our worldwide network of retail stores, wholesale customers and distributors, as well as our on-line sites. We also derive royalty revenues from worldwidelicensing activities.    Recent Global Economic Developments            Economic and market conditions have become increasingly volatile and uncertain in many markets around the world and consumer behaviorremains cautious. In North America, the relatively weaker levels of consumer confidence and the highly promotional conditions among retailers may persist for some time. In Europe, sovereign debt andbank credit issues continue to affect the capital markets of various European countries and have resulted in reduced consumer confidence and discretionary spending in those countries. These conditionsin Europe have begun to affect our business, particularly in the more penetrated countries in Southern Europe.           TheCompany anticipates that inflationary pressures on raw materials, labor, freight and other commodities including oil, experienced in fiscal 2012 may stabilize in the future butcontinue to negatively impact the cost of product purchases in fiscal 2013, particularly in the first half of the fiscal year. Although overall, the Company has been able to mitigate the impact ofproduct inflation through reduced promotional markdowns, price increases on select items and supply chain initiatives, there can be no assurances that these actions will continue to be successful. Inaddition, increased retail prices could lead to reduced customer demand.   29                Wealso continue to experience significant volatility in the global currency markets. Since the majority of our international operations are conducted in currencies other than the U.S.dollar (primarily the euro, Canadian dollar and Korean won), currency fluctuations can have a significant impact on the translation of our international revenues and earnings into U.S. dollar amounts.During fiscal 2012, the average U.S. dollar rate was weaker against these currencies versus the average rate in the comparable prior-year period. This had an overall positive impact on thetranslation of our international revenues and earnings for the year ended January 28, 2012 compared to the prior fiscal year.           Inaddition, some of our transactions that occur in Europe, Canada and South Korea are denominated in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and British pounds, exposing them to exchange ratefluctuations when converted to their functional currencies. These transactions include U.S. dollar denominated purchases of merchandise, U.S. dollar and British pound intercompany liabilities andcertain sales, operating expenses and tax liabilities denominated in Swiss francs. Fluctuations in exchange rates can impact the profitability of our foreign operations and reported earnings and arelargely dependent on the transaction timing and magnitude during the period that the currency fluctuates. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to offset some but not all of theexchange risk on certain foreign currency transactions. In addition, some of the derivative contracts in place will create volatility duringthe fiscal year as they are marked-to-market according to the accounting rules. Based on fluctuations in currency rates during fiscal 2012, the Company's results were favorablyimpacted by the net revaluation of our foreign currency contracts and balances and resulted in a net revaluation gain recorded in other income during fiscal 2012. Continued volatility in the globalcurrency markets could result in further revaluation gains or losses in future periods.    Long-Term Growth Strategy            Despite the difficult economic conditions described above, our key long-term strategies remain unchanged. Global expansioncontinues to be the cornerstone of our long-term growth strategy. Our combined revenues outside of the U.S. and Canada represented approximately half of the total Company's revenues infiscal 2012, compared to one-fifth in fiscal 2005. We expect to continue to expand in both our existing European and Asian markets. At the same time, we plan to develop markets in emergingcountries like China, Brazil, Russia and India and expand our G by GUESS concept both domestically and internationally. Our goal is also to drive growth by enhancing the productivity of our existingoperations.           Expandingour retail business across the globe is key to executing on our global growth strategy. We see opportunities to increase the number of GUESS? branded retail stores in Europeand Asia. In North America and South Korea, we also see store growth opportunities with our G by GUESS concept. We will continue to regularly assess and implement initiatives that we believe willbuild brand equity, grow our business and enhance long-term profitability in each region, including investing in advertising and marketing programs to build awareness and drive customertraffic to our stores and websites.           InEurope, over the long-term, we will continue to focus on developing new markets in Northern and Eastern Europe where our brand is well known but still under-penetrated andexpand on our success in Western and Southern Europe. In fiscal 2012, we have made significant progress on developing important European markets such as Germany, Russia, Portugal and the Netherlands.We have flagship stores in key cities such as Paris, Barcelona, Dusseldorf, London and Milan. Together with our licensee partners, we opened 120 stores during fiscal 2012 and we plan to continue ourinternational expansion in Europe by opening approximately 90 retail stores in fiscal 2013, about one third of which will be operated directly by us.           OurNorth American Retail growth strategy is to increase retail sales and profitability by expanding our network of retail stores and improving the productivity and performance ofexisting stores. We will continue to emphasize our newer G by GUESS store concept and our e-commerce channel. During fiscal 2012, we opened 37 retail stores and we currently plan to openapproximately 35 retail stores across all   30        conceptsin the U.S. and Canada during fiscal 2013, with roughly half under the G by GUESS brand. In addition, we plan to remodel key existing locations as part of the roll-out of our newstore designs. In February 2011, we opened our largest flagship store in the world in New York City with over 13,000 square feet.           Wesee significant market opportunities in Asia and we are dedicating capital and human resources to support the region's growth and development. We and our partners opened flagshipstores in key cities such as Seoul, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Macau, Taipei and Beijing and we have partnered with licensees to develop our business in the second tier cities in this region. During fiscal2012, we also launched our newer G by GUESS store concept in South Korea where we have 47 locations as of January 28, 2012. Our strategy in South Korea, with a combined 283 stores andconcessions at January 28, 2012, is to continue to improve productivity and expand distribution for both our GUESS? and G by GUESS branded locations. We and our partners opened 89 stores and107 concessions during fiscal 2012 across all of Asia and plan to open between 140 and 150 retail stores and concessions combined across all concepts in Asia during fiscal 2013.           TheCompany's investments in capital for the full fiscal year 2013 are planned between $130 million and $145 million (after deducting estimated lease incentives ofapproximately $10 million). The planned investments in capital are primarily for expansion of our retail businesses in North America and Europe and store remodeling programs in North America.    Other            The Company reports National Retail Federation ("NRF") calendar comparable store sales on a quarterly basis for our stores in the U.S.and Canada. A store is considered comparable after it has been open for 13 full months. If a store remodel results in a square footage change of more than 15%, or involves a relocation or a change instore concept, the store is removed from the comparable store base until it has been opened at its new size, in its new location or under its new concept for 13 full months.    Executive Summary     The Company            Net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. decreased 8.3% to $265.5 million, or diluted earnings of $2.86 per commonshare, for the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. of $289.5 million, or diluted earnings of $3.11 per common share, for the yearended January 29, 2011. In fiscal 2012, the Company recorded a pre-tax settlement charge of $19.5 million (or $17.6 million after considering a $1.9 millionreduction to income tax as a result of the charge), or $0.19 per share. The charge related to a settlement agreement with one of the Company's third party logistics service providers in Europe tofacilitate the transition to a new service provider. Adjusted diluted earnings, excluding the settlement charge, were $3.05 per common share for the year ended January 28, 2012. The fiscal 2011results included a benefit to revenues related to a revision in the estimated liability from the Company's loyalty program of $6.7 million before taxes, or $0.05 per diluted share. Referencesto financial results excluding the impact of the settlement charge are non-GAAP measures and are addressed below under "Non-GAAP Measures."           Highlightsof the Company's performance for the year ended January 28, 2012 compared to the prior year are presented below, followed by a more comprehensive discussion under"Results of Operations":     Total net revenue increased 8.1% to $2.69 billion for the year ended January 28, 2012, from$2.49 billion in the prior year. All of our segments contributed to the revenue growth. In constant U.S. dollars, revenues increased by 5.5%.    Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total net revenues) declined 50 basis points to 43.3% for the year endedJanuary 28, 2012, compared to 43.8% in the prior year, due to a higher occupancy rate partially offset by higher overall product margins.    31             Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased 9.8% to $746.3 million for the year endedJanuary 28, 2012, compared to $679.8 million in the prior year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues ("SG&A rate") increased by 50 basis points to 27.8% for the year endedJanuary 28, 2012, compared to 27.3% in the prior year.    In addition to SG&A expenses described above, the Company recorded the $19.5 million settlement charge and a$1.2 million pre-tax supplemental executive retirement plan ("SERP") curtailment expense during fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a $5.8 millionpre-tax SERP curtailment expense.    Earnings from operations decreased 1.8% to $397.2 million for the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to$404.6 million in the prior year. Operating margin declined 150 basis points to 14.8% for the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to 16.3% in the prior year. The settlement chargenegatively impacted the operating margin in fiscal 2012 by 70 basis points.    Other income, net, (including interest income and expense) totaled $2.1 million for the year endedJanuary 28, 2012, compared to other income, net, of $16.7 million in the prior year.    The effective income tax rate increased 210 basis points to 32.2% for the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to30.1% in the prior year.    The Company had $491.8 million in cash and cash equivalents as of January 28, 2012, up $64.8 million,compared to $427.0 million as of January 29, 2011. The Company invested $92.0 million to repurchase approximately 3.2 million shares of its common stock during the fourthquarter of fiscal 2012.    Accounts receivable, which relates primarily to the Company's wholesale business in Europe, and to a lesser extent, to itswholesale businesses in North America and Asia, decreased by $17.9 million, or 5.0%, to $340.6 million at January 28, 2012, compared to $358.5 million at January 29,2011. On a constant dollar basis, accounts receivable decreased $9.7 million, or 2.7%.   Inventory increased by $33.9 million, or 11.5%, to $328.6 million as of January 28, 2012, compared to$294.7 million as of January 29, 2011. When measured in terms of finished goods units, inventory volumes increased by 15.0% as of January 28, 2012, when compared toJanuary 29, 2011.     Europe            In Europe, revenue increased by $90.6 million, or 9.8%, to $1.01 billion for the year ended January 28, 2012,compared to $920.3 million in the prior year. In local currency, revenues increased by 4.7% over the same comparable period. The increase in reported revenues was driven by expansion of ourdirectly operated retail stores (where comparable store sales declined) and the favorable currency translation impact resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. This was partially offsetby lower net revenues from our European wholesale businesses where higher apparel sales were more than offset by a decline in handbag and jewelry sales. At January 28, 2012, we directlyoperated 179 stores in Europe compared to 141 stores at January 29, 2011, excluding concessions, which represents a 27.0% increase over the prior year.           Earningsfrom operations from our Europe segment decreased by $26.3 million, or 13.6%, to $167.0 million for the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to$193.3 million in the prior year. The decline includes the impact of the $19.5 million settlement charge. Operating margin declined 450 basis points to 16.5% for the year endedJanuary 28, 2012, compared to 21.0% for the prior year. In addition to the settlement charge, the decline was also driven by a higher occupancy rate, lower wholesale jewelry shipments andhigher selling and distribution costs, partially offset by higher product margins as we continue to grow our retail business.   32         North American Retail            Our North American Retail segment, comprising North American full-price retail stores, factory outlet stores ande-commerce, increased revenues by $47.7 million, or 4.5%, to $1.12 billion compared to $1.07 billion in the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by a largerstore base, partially offset by negative comparable store sales of 3.5% for our combined U.S. and Canadian stores (negative 4.1% in local currency, which excludes the favorable translation impact ofcurrency fluctuations relating to our Canadian retail stores). In fiscal 2012, we opened 37 new stores in the U.S. and Canada and closed 14 stores. At January 28, 2012, we directly operated 504stores in the U.S. and Canada compared to 481 stores as of January 29, 2011.           NorthAmerican Retail earnings from operations increased by $10.6 million, or 8.6%, to $133.2 million for the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to$122.6 million in the prior year. Operating margin improved by 40 basis points to 11.9% for the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to 11.5% for the year ended January 29, 2011,driven by higher product margins and a lower SG&A rate. The product margin improvement resulted from lower markdowns and selective price increases, partially offset by the negative impact of productcost inflation. The lower SG&A rate was driven mainly by the leveraging of store selling expenses. These increases were partially offset by occupancy deleverage, given the negative comparable storesales, and the prior year positive revenue impact of the revision in the estimated liability from the Company's loyalty program.    Asia            In Asia, revenue increased by $49.8 million, or 24.8%, to $250.7 million for the year ended January 28, 2012,compared to $200.9 million in the prior year. In constant dollars, net revenues increased by 21.2% over the prior year. All of our Asian businesses contributed to this growth, led by our SouthKorea and Greater China businesses. We continued to expand our operations in the region, where we and our partners opened 89 stores and 107 concessions during the year ended January 28, 2012.           Earningsfrom operations from our Asia segment decreased slightly to $28.5 million for the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to $28.6 million in the prior year.Operating margin declined 290 basispoints to 11.4% for the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to 14.3% for the prior year. The decrease was driven by a higher SG&A rate due to a larger store base and higher infrastructureinvestments to support our future growth in this region. In addition, gross margins were lower mainly due to higher promotional sales and channel mix in South Korea.    North American Wholesale            Our North American Wholesale segment revenue increased by $6.4 million, or 3.5%, to $187.4 million for the year endedJanuary 28, 2012, from $181.0 million in the prior year. In constant dollars, net revenues increased by 2.4%. During the year ended January 28, 2012, higher revenues from ourCanadian and Mexican wholesale businesses were partially offset by lower revenues in our U.S. wholesale business.           NorthAmerican Wholesale earnings from operations increased by $1.0 million, or 2.2%, to $47.2 million for the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to$46.2 million in the prior year. Operating margin decreased by 30 basis points to 25.2% for the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to 25.5% for the year ended January 29, 2011,due primarily to increased distribution costs.    Licensing            Our Licensing royalty revenues increased by $6.2 million, or 5.4%, to $121.4 million compared to $115.2 million inthe prior year, driven by royalties from higher sales in our footwear, eyewear and watches categories, partially offset by lower sales in handbags. Earnings from operations increased by$4.4 million   33        to$108.6 million for the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to $104.2 million for the year ended January 29, 2011.    Corporate Overhead            Corporate overhead expenses decreased by $3.0 million, or 3.3%, to $87.2 million for the year ended January 28,2012, from $90.2 million in the prior year. The decrease was due primarily to the net impact of higher curtailment expense recorded in the prior year.    Global Store Count            In fiscal 2012, together with our partners, we opened 261 new stores worldwide, consisting of 120 stores in Europe and the Middle East,89 stores in Asia, 37 stores in the U.S. and Canada and 15 stores in Central and South America. Together with our partners we closed 75 stores worldwide, including 33 stores in Europe and the MiddleEast, 23 stores in Asia, 14 stores in the U.S. and Canada and five stores in Central and South America.           Weended fiscal 2012 with 1,559 stores worldwide, comprised as follows:                      Region      Total Stores      Directly Operated Stores      Licensee Stores          United States and Canada        504        504                 Europe and the Middle East        561        179        382         Asia        423        47        376         Other        71        25        46                                   Total        1,559        755        804                                           Thisstore count does not include 349 concessions located primarily in South Korea and Greater China because of their smaller store size in relation to our standard international storesize. Of the total 1,559 stores, 1,067 were GUESS? stores, 302 were GUESS? Accessories stores, 100 were GUESS by MARCIANO stores and 90 were G by GUESS stores.    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates            The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., whichrequire management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financialstatements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors, theresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management evaluates its estimates andjudgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the valuation of inventories, accounts receivable allowances, sales return allowances, loyalty and gift card accruals, the useful life ofassets for depreciation, restructuring expense and accruals, evaluation of asset impairment, recoverability of deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, workers compensation and medicalself-insurance expense and accruals, litigation reserves, pension obligations and share-based compensation.           TheCompany believes that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. In addition to the accounting policies mentioned below, seeNote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for other significant accounting policies.   34                     Accounts Receivable Reserves             In the normal course of business, the Company grants credit directly to certain wholesale customers after a credit analysis isperformed based on financial and other criteria. Accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated lossesthat result from the inability of its wholesale customers to make their required payments. The Company bases its allowances on analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financialstatements, assessments of historical collection trends, an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions and whether the Company has obtained credit insurance or other guarantees.           Costsassociated with customer markdowns are recorded as a reduction to revenues, and any unapplied amounts are included in the allowance for accounts receivable. Historically, thesemarkdown allowances resulted from seasonal negotiations with the Company's wholesale customers, as well as historical trends and the evaluation of the impact of economic conditions.     Sales Returns Reserves             The Company accrues for estimated sales returns in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. To recognize the financialimpact of sales returns, the Company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned based on historical experience and reduces sales and cost of sales accordingly based on historical returnexperience. The Company's policy allows retail customers in certain regions a grace period to return merchandise following the date of sale. Substantially all of these returns are considered to beresalable at a price that exceeds the cost of the merchandise.     Inventory Reserves             Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (primarily weighted average method) or market. The Company continually evaluates itsinventories by assessing slow moving product as well as prior seasons' inventory. Market value of aged inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for each product line category, theimpact of market trends, an evaluation of economic conditions, available liquidation channels and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory. The Companyclosely monitors off-price sales to ensure the actual results closely match initial estimates. Estimates are regularly updated based upon this continuing review.     Valuation of Goodwill, Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets             The Company assesses the impairment of its long-lived assets (i.e., goodwill, intangible assets and property andequipment), which requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstancesindicate that the assets might be impaired. An asset is considered to be impaired if the Company determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon its assessment of the asset'sability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods or if significant changes in the Company's strategicbusiness objectives and utilization of the assets occurred. If the assets (other than goodwill) are assessed to be recoverable, they are depreciated or amortized over the periods benefited. If theassets are considered to be impaired, an impairment charge is recognized representing the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of those assets. Fair value isdetermined based upon the discounted cash flows derived from the underlying asset. We use various assumptions in determining current fair market value of these assets, including future expected cashflows and discount rates. Future expected cash flows for store assets are based on management's estimates of future cash flows over the remaining lease period or expected life, if shorter. If actualresults are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to ourresults of operations. See Notes 1 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.   35          Pension Benefit Plan Actuarial Assumptions             The Company's pension obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, within the authoritative guidanceframework. The discount rate and estimated future compensation are both important elements of expense and/or liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions annually which enables us tostate expected future payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Supplemental Executive Retirement Planrelated information.     Litigation Reserves             Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balancesheets. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the expected probable favorable or unfavorable outcome of each claim. Asadditional information becomes available, the Company assesses the potential liability related to new claims and existing claims and revises estimates as appropriate. As new claims arise or existingclaims evolve, such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position.     Share-Based Compensation             Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of authoritative guidance using themodified prospective transition method. Under this method, compensation cost recognized after January 1, 2006 includes: (a) compensation expense for all share-based payments grantedprior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value and (b) compensation expense for all share-based payments granted on or after January 1,2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with authoritative guidance. The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricingmodel with the following weighted-average assumptions used for new grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of theoption at the time of grant. The expected volatility is determined based on an average of both historical volatility and implied volatility. Implied volatility is derived from exchange traded optionson the Company's common stock. The expected life used prior to November 2007 was based on the "simplified" method described in authoritative guidance. For options granted beginning November 2007, theexpected term is determined based on historical trends. The dividend yield for 2006 and prior years was assumed to be zero since the Company had not historically declared and did not have a plan todeclare dividends on an ongoing basis until the Board of Directors authorized and approved the initiation of quarterly dividends in February 2007. The expected dividend yield starting from 2007 isbased on the Company's history and expectations of dividend payouts. The expected forfeiture rate is determined based on historical data. Compensation expense for nonvested stock options and stockawards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.           Inaddition, the Company has granted certain nonvested stock awards and stock options in the past that require the recipient to achieve certain minimum performance targets in order forthese awards to vest. If the minimum performance targets have not been achieved or are not expected to be achieved, no expense is recorded during the period.     Income Taxes             The Company adopted authoritative guidance in January 2007, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognizedin an enterprise's financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected tobe taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Guidance was also   36        providedon derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on theCompany's financial position and results of operations. The Company's continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As required underapplicable accounting rules, the Company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional income tax liability which the Company, more likely than not, could incur as a result of the ultimateresolution of tax audits ("uncertain tax positions"). The Company reviews and updates the estimates used in the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes availablefrom taxing authorities, upon completion of tax audits, upon expiration of statutes of limitation, or upon occurrence of other events. The results of operations and financial position for futureperiods could be impacted by changes in assumptions or resolutions of tax audits.           Deferredtax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted taxrates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances ifwe believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized. As all earnings from the Company's foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed,the Company's income tax provision does not include additional U.S. taxes on foreign operations.     Hedge Accounting             The Company operates in foreign countries, which exposes it to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.The Company has entered into certain forward contracts to hedge the risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations. The Company has elected to apply the hedge accounting rules in accordance withauthoritative guidance for certain of these hedges.           TheCompany's objective is to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flows due to the foreign currency risk. Various transactions that occur in Canada, Europe and South Korea aredenominated in U.S. dollars, British pounds or Swiss francs and thus are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to their functional currencies. These typesof transactions include U.S. dollar denominated purchases of merchandise and U.S. dollar and British pound intercompany liabilities. In addition, certain sales, operating expenses and tax liabilitiesare denominated in Swiss francs and are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to the functional currency. The Company enters into derivative financialinstruments, including forward exchange contracts to offset some but not all of the exchange risk on certain of these anticipated foreign currency transactions. Changes in the fair value of forwardcontracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in cost of product sales, SG&A or otherincome and expenses in the periodwhich approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold or the hedged operating expense and hedged intercompany liability is incurred.           TheCompany also has foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts not qualifying as cash flowhedges are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expense.     Gift Card Breakage             Gift card breakage is income recognized due to the non-redemption of a portion of gift cards sold by the Company for whicha liability was recorded in prior periods. Estimated breakage amounts are accounted for under the redemption recognition method and are classified as additional net revenues as the gift cards areredeemed. The Company determined a gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns, which represented the cumulative estimated amount of gift card breakage from the   37        inceptionof the electronic gift card program in late 2002. Any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage income recognized in future periods. SeeNote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the recognition of gift card breakage.     Loyalty Programs             The Company launched customer loyalty programs for its G by GUESS, GUESS? and GUESS by MARCIANO stores in July 2009, August 2008 andSeptember 2007, respectively. The GUESS? and GUESS by MARCIANO loyalty programs were merged in May 2009. Under the programs, customers accumulate points based on purchase activity. Once a loyaltyprogram member achieves a certain point level, the member earns awards that may only be redeemed for merchandise. In all of the programs, unredeemed points generally expire after six months andunredeemed awards generally expire after two months. Due to the relative newness of the programs, prior to fiscal 2011, all unexpired, unredeemed points and awards were accrued in current liabilitiesand recorded as a reduction of net sales as points and awards were accumulated by the member. In fiscal2011, based on the accumulation of multiple cycles of actual redemptions experienced since inception of the programs, the Company revised its approach to estimate the value of future award redemptionsunder the existing loyalty program by incorporating historical redemption rates. In connection with this revision, the Company recorded a cumulative adjustment of $6.7 million in fiscal 2011 toincrease net revenue and to adjust the current liability balance to an amount reflecting estimated future award redemptions. This adjustment had a favorable impact of $0.05 per share. The aggregatedollar value of the loyalty program accruals included in accrued liabilities was $2.3 million and $2.7 million at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively.Future revisions to the estimated liability may result in changes to net revenue.    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS            The following table sets forth actual operating results for the fiscal years ended January 28, 2012, January 29, 2011 andJanuary 30, 2010 as a percentage of net revenue:                            Year Ended              Jan. 28, 2012      Jan. 29, 2011      Jan. 30, 2010          Product sales        95.5  %     95.4  %     95.4  %      Net royalties        4.5        4.6        4.6                                   Net revenue        100.0        100.0        100.0         Cost of product sales        56.7        56.2        55.8                                   Gross profit        43.3        43.8        44.2         Selling, general and administrative expenses        27.8        27.3        27.3         Settlement charge        0.7                         Pension curtailment expense        0.0        0.2                                           Earnings from operations        14.8        16.3        16.9         Interest expense        (0.1  )     (0.1  )     (0.1  )      Interest income        0.2        0.1        0.1         Other income, net        0.0        0.6        0.1                                   Earnings before income taxes        14.9        16.9        17.0         Income taxes        4.8        5.1        5.4                                   Net earnings        10.1        11.8        11.6         Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests        0.2        0.2        0.2                                   Net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc.         9.9  %     11.6  %     11.4  %                                38         Year Ended January 28, 2012 Compared to Year Ended January 29, 2011     NET REVENUE.     Net revenue for the year ended January 28, 2012 increased by $200.7 million, or 8.1%, to $2.69 billion from$2.49 billion for the year ended January 29, 2011. All of our segments contributed to the revenue growth. In constant U.S. dollars, revenues increased by 5.5% as currency translationfluctuations relating to our foreign operations favorably impacted net revenue by $65.2 million compared to the same prior-year period.           Netrevenue from our Europe operations increased by $90.6 million, or 9.8%, to $1.01 billion for the year ended January 28, 2012, from $920.3 million for theyear ended January 29, 2011. In local currency, revenues increased by 4.7% over the same comparable period. The increase in reported revenues was driven by expansion of our directly operatedretail stores (where comparable store sales declined) and the favorable currency translation impact resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. This was partially offset by lower netrevenues from our European wholesale businesses, where higher apparel sales were more than offset by a decline in handbag and jewelry sales. At January 28, 2012, we directly operated 179 storesin Europe compared to 141 stores at January 29, 2011, excluding concessions, which represents a 27.0% increase over the prior year. Shipments in our existing wholesale business were unfavorablyimpacted in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 by the earlier spring product deliveries that benefitted the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our Europeanoperations favorably impacted net revenue by $48.9 million.           Netrevenue from our North American Retail operations increased by $47.7 million, or 4.5%, to $1.12 billion for the year ended January 28, 2012, from$1.07 billion for the year ended January 29, 2011.The increase was due primarily to a larger store base, partially offset by negative comparable store sales of 3.5% for our combined U.S. and Canadian stores (negative 4.1% in local currency, whichexcludes the favorable translation impact of currency fluctuations relating to our Canadian retail stores). The store base increased by an average of 38 net additional stores during the year endedJanuary 28, 2012 compared to the prior year, resulting in a net 8.5% increase in average square footage. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our non-U.S. retail storesfavorably impacted net revenue in our North American Retail segment by $7.1 million.           Netrevenue from our Asia operations increased by $49.8 million, or 24.8%, to $250.7 million for the year ended January 28, 2012, from $200.9 million for theyear ended January 29, 2011. In constant dollars, net revenue increased by 21.2%. We continued to grow our Asia business, where we and our partners opened 89 stores and 107 concessions duringthe year ended January 28, 2012. All of our Asian businesses contributed to this growth, driven by our South Korea and Greater China businesses, with stronger existing door performance and agreater number of doors compared to the prior year. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our Asia operations favorably impacted net revenue in our Asia segment by $7.2 million.           Netrevenue from our North American Wholesale operations increased by $6.4 million, or 3.5%, to $187.4 million for the year ended January 28, 2012, from$181.0 million for the year ended January 29, 2011. In constant dollars, net revenues increased by 2.4%. This increase was driven by higher revenues in our Canadian and Mexican wholesalebusinesses. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our non-U.S. wholesale businesses favorably impacted net revenue in our North American Wholesale segment by $2.0 million.           Netroyalty revenue from Licensing operations increased by $6.2 million, or 5.4%, to $121.4 million for the year ended January 28, 2012, from $115.2 millionfor the year ended January 29, 2011. This increase was driven by royalties on higher sales in our footwear, eyewear and watches categories, partially offset by lower sales in handbags.     GROSS PROFIT.     Gross profit increased by $74.1 million, or 6.8%, to $1.16 billion for the year ended January 28, 2012, from$1.09 billion for the year ended January 29, 2011 due to the growth in revenue   39        whichincluded the favorable impact of currency translation and improved product margins, partially offset by higher occupancy costs. All segments contributed to the growth in gross profit.           Grossmargin declined 50 basis points to 43.3% for the year ended January 28, 2012, from 43.8% for the year ended January 29, 2011. While the overall product marginsimproved in the year ended January 28, 2012 as a result of lower markdowns in North American Retail and the greater mix of retail in Europe, this was more than offset by the higher occupancyrate driven by negative comparable store sales in North America and Europe as well as retail expansion in Europe.           TheCompany's gross margin may not be comparable to other entities since some entities include all of the costs related to their distribution in cost of product sales and others, likethe Company, generally exclude the wholesale related distribution costs from gross margin, including them instead in SG&A expenses. Additionally, some entities include retail store occupancy costs inSG&A expenses and others, like the Company, include retail store occupancy costs in cost of product sales.    SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.     SG&A expenses increased by $66.5 million, or 9.8%, to $746.3 million for the year endedJanuary 28, 2012, from $679.8 million for the year ended January 29, 2011. The increase in SG&A expenses, which included the unfavorable impact of currency translation, was due tohigher selling and distribution expenses in Europe, higher store selling expenses in Europe and Asia and higher global advertising expenses. These increases were partially offset by lowerperformance-based compensation expenses.           TheCompany's SG&A rate increased by 50 basis points to 27.8% for the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to 27.3% in the prior year. The SG&A rate was negatively impacted bylower international jewelry shipments and higher selling and distribution costs in Europe, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expenses and improved store selling expensemanagement in our North American Retail segment.     SETTLEMENT CHARGE.     During fiscal 2012, we experienced a temporary disruption with one of our third party logistics service providers in Europe andsubsequently entered into a settlement agreement with this service provider to facilitate a transition to a new service provider. As a result, the Company recorded a $19.5 million settlementcharge related to amounts paid in connection with this agreement.    PENSION CURTAILMENT EXPENSE.     During the year ended January 28, 2012, the Company recorded a SERP curtailment expense of $1.2 millionbefore taxes related to the accelerated amortization of prior service cost resulting from the retirement of Maurice Marciano as an employee and executive officer, effective upon the expiration of hisemployment agreement on January 28, 2012. Mr. Maurice Marciano did not receive or earn any additional SERP-related benefits in connection with his retirement and, as of thedate of his retirement, ceased vesting or accruing any additional benefits under the terms of the SERP. During the year ended January 29, 2011, the Company recorded a SERPcurtailment expense of $5.8 million before taxes related to the accelerated amortization of prior service cost resulting from the departure of Carlos Alberini, the Company's former Presidentand Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Alberini did not receive any termination payments in connection with his departure and, as of the date of his departure, he ceased vesting or accruing anyadditional benefits under the terms of the SERP. Mr. Maurice Marciano's retirement and Mr. Alberini's departure each resulted in a significant reduction in the total expected remainingyears of future service of all SERP participants combined, resulting in the pension curtailment during each of the separate periods.    EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS.     Earnings from operations decreased by $7.4 million, or 1.8%, to $397.2 million for the year endedJanuary 28, 2012, from $404.6 million for the year ended January 29,   40        2011.Currency translation fluctuations relating to our foreign operations favorably impacted earnings from operations by $9.6 million. The change in earnings from operations by segment are asfollows:     Earnings from operations for the Europe segment decreased $26.3 million to $167.0 million for the year endedJanuary 28, 2012, compared to $193.3 million for the year ended January 29, 2011. The decline resulted from the $19.5 million settlement charge, lower wholesale jewelry andhandbag shipments and higher selling and distribution costs. These decreases were partially offset by the higher profits from the growth in retail stores, net of higher occupancy costs, andimprovement in product margins. Currency translation fluctuations favorably impacted earnings from operations by $7.5 million.    Earnings from operations for the North American Retail segment increased by $10.6 million to $133.2 millionfor the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to $122.6 million for the year ended January 29, 2011. The increase reflects the impact of improved product margins, better expensemanagement in the stores and profits from new stores, partially offset by the impact on profits from negative comparable store sales and the prior year positive revenue impact of the revision in theestimated liability from the Company's loyalty program.    Earnings from operations for the Asia segment decreased slightly to $28.5 million for the year endedJanuary 28, 2012, compared to $28.6 million for the year ended January 29, 2011. The favorable impact to earnings from higher sales was offset by higher occupancy and storeselling costs due to a larger retail store base, lower product margins and other infrastructure investments in SG&A to support our future growth in the region.    Earnings from operations for the North American Wholesale segment increased by $1.0 million to $47.2 millionfor the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to $46.2 million for the year ended January 29, 2011. The favorable impact to earnings from sales growth was partially offset byhigher SG&A expenses, mainly due to increased distribution costs.    Earnings from operations for the Licensing segment increased by $4.4 million to $108.6 million for the yearended January 28, 2012, compared to $104.2 million for the year ended January 29, 2011. The increase was driven by increased royalties due to higher sales partially offset byhigher advertising expenses.    Unallocated corporate overhead decreased by $3.0 million to $87.2 million for the year endedJanuary 28, 2012, compared to $90.2 million for the year ended January 29, 2011. The decrease was due primarily to the net impact of the higher curtailment expense recorded in theprior year.            Operatingmargin declined 150 basis points to 14.8% for the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to 16.3% for the year ended January 29, 2011. Operating margin wasnegatively impacted by a higher overall occupancy rate, the settlement charge and a higher SG&A rate, partially offset by an improvement in product margins.     INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME.     Interest expense increased to $2.0 million for the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to$1.2 million for the year ended January 29, 2011. Interest expense includes the impact of hedge ineffectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges. AtJanuary 28, 2012, total borrowings, related primarily to our capital lease in Europe, were $12.2 million, compared to $14.4 million at January 29, 2011. The average debtbalance for the year ended January 28, 2012, was $13.6 million, versus an average debt balance of $14.7 million for the year ended January 29, 2011. Interest incomeincreased to $3.1 million for the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to $1.6 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, due to higher interest rates on invested cash,partially offset by lower average invested cash balances as a result of the special dividend in the fourth quarter of the prior year.   41          OTHER INCOME, NET.     Other income, net, was $1.0 million for the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to other income, net, of$16.4 million for the year ended January 29, 2011. Other income, net, in the year ended January 28, 2012 consisted primarily of net unrealizedmark-to-market revaluation gains on foreign currency contracts and other foreign currency balances. Other income, net, in the year ended January 29, 2011 consistedprimarily of net unrealized mark-to-market revaluation gains on other foreign currency balances and foreign currency contracts and net unrealized gains onnon-operating assets.     INCOME TAXES.     Income tax expense for the year ended January 28, 2012 was $128.7 million, or a 32.2% effective tax rate, compared toincome tax expense of $126.9 million, or a 30.1% effective tax rate, for the year ended January 29, 2011. The increase in the effective tax rate in the year ended January 28, 2012was due in part to the settlement charge recorded in fiscal 2012, which unfavorably impacted the mix of taxable income among the Company's tax jurisdictions and increased the effective tax rate by 100basis points. The effective tax rate was also negatively impacted by a larger mix of taxable income in higher tax jurisdictions compared to the prior year.     NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS.     Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries for the year endedJanuary 28, 2012 was $5.2 million, net of taxes, compared to $5.0 million, net of taxes, for the year ended January 29, 2011. The increase was due to higher earnings in ourmajority-owned Mexican subsidiary, partially offset by lower earnings from our majority-owned European subsidiaries.    NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GUESS?, INC.     Net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. decreased by $24.0 million, or 8.3%, to$265.5 million for the year ended January 28, 2012, from $289.5 million for the year ended January 29, 2011. Diluted earnings per common share decreased to $2.86 per sharefor the year ended January 28, 2012, compared to $3.11 per share for the year ended January 29, 2011. The results for the year ended January 28, 2012 included the $0.19 per sharesettlement charge. Adjusted diluted earnings, excluding the settlement charge, was $3.05 per common share for the year ended January 28, 2012. References to financial results excluding theimpact of thesettlement charge are non-GAAP measures and are addressed below under "Non-GAAP Measures."    Year Ended January 29, 2011 Compared to Year Ended January 30, 2010      NET REVENUE.     Net revenue for the year ended January 29, 2011 increased by $358.8 million, or 16.9%, to $2.49 billion, from$2.13 billion for the year ended January 30, 2010. Revenues increased in all our segments and our international business drove the majority of our revenue growth. On a combined basis,our Europe and Asia segments represented 63.2% of the revenue increase. In constant U.S. dollars, revenues increased by 18.2% as currency translation fluctuations relating to our foreign operationsunfavorably impacted net revenue by $28.1 million compared to the prior year.           Netrevenue from our Europe operations increased by $173.1 million, or 23.2%, to $920.3 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from $747.2 million forthe year ended January 30, 2010. All of our European businesses contributed to this growth. We expanded our base of directly operated stores and our existing stores generated positivecomparable store sales. Our existing wholesale business also grew in the year, which included sales from our new international jewelry business and earlier deliveries of our spring product, primarilyin our accessories business, which resulted in a favorable shift of orders delivered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 which would have normally occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2012. AtJanuary 29, 2011, we directly operated 141 stores in Europe compared to 84 stores at the prior year end, excluding concessions. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our Europeanoperations unfavorably impacted net revenue by $62.0 million.           Netrevenue from our North American Retail operations increased by $86.0 million, or 8.7%, to $1.07 billion for the year ended January 29, 2011, from$983.9 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. This increase was due primarily to a larger store base, positive comparable store sales of 2.9% (1.1% in   42        localcurrency, which excludes the favorable translation impact of currency fluctuations relating to our Canadian retail stores) and a $6.7 million increase to revenues related to a revision inthe estimated liability from the Company's loyalty program. The store base increased by an average of 22 net additional stores during the year ended January 29, 2011 compared to the prior year,resulting in a net4.4% increase in average square footage. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our non-U.S. retail stores favorably impacted net revenue in our North American Retail segment by$19.3 million.           Netrevenue from our Asia operations increased by $53.6 million, or 36.4%, to $200.9 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from $147.3 million for theyear ended January 30, 2010. We continued to grow our Asia business, where we, along with our partners, opened 43 stores and 80 concessions during the year ended January 29, 2011. OurSouth Korea business continued to drive the growth in this region with a greater number of doors compared to the same prior-year period and stronger existing door performance. Our GreaterChina business also increased revenues as we continue to develop our business in this region in both first and second tier cities. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our South Koreabusiness favorably impacted net revenue in our Asia segment by $9.8 million.           Netrevenue from our North American Wholesale operations increased by $28.3 million, or 18.5%, to $181.0 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from$152.7 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase was driven by higher sales in all our businesses, led by the U.S. wholesale business. Currency translation fluctuationsrelating to our non-U.S. wholesale businesses favorably impacted net revenue in our North American Wholesale segment by $4.8 million.           Netroyalty revenue from Licensing operations increased by $17.8 million, or 18.4%, to $115.2 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from $97.4 millionfor the year ended January 30, 2010. This increase was driven by royalties on higher sales in our watches, handbags, footwear and eyewear categories, partially offset by the loss of royaltiesas a result of the direct operation of our international jewelry business since January 2010.     GROSS PROFIT.     Gross profit increased by $148.7 million, or 15.8%, to $1.09 billion for the year ended January 29, 2011, from$941.5 million for the year ended January 30, 2010 due to the growth in revenue, partially offset by higher occupancy costs. While all segments contributed to the growth, the largestincrease in gross profit came from our Europe segment.           Grossmargin declined 40 basis points to 43.8% for the year ended January 29, 2011, from 44.2% for the year ended January 30, 2010. The negative impact of the stronger U.S.dollar on product purchases, increased occupancy costs due to retail expansion in Europe, lower initial markups in Europe, and higher markdowns in our North American Retail segment were the mainfactors contributing to the lower gross margin.     SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.     SG&A expenses increased by$97.1 million, or 16.7%, to $679.8 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from $582.7 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase was driven byhigher expenses and infrastructure costs to support our global retail expansion, higher volume driven expenses and higher marketing investments to enhance our brand's awareness around the world. TheCompany's SG&A rate remained flat at 27.3% for the year ended January 29, 2011 compared to the prior year.     PENSION CURTAILMENT EXPENSE.     In fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a SERP curtailment expense of $5.8 million before taxes related to theaccelerated amortization of prior service cost resulting from the departure of Carlos Alberini, the Company's former President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Alberini did not receive anytermination payments in connection with his departure and, as of the date of his departure, he ceased vesting or accruing any additional benefits under the terms of the SERP. Mr. Alberini'sdeparture resulted in a significant reduction in the total expected remaining years of future service of all SERP participants combined, resulting in the pension curtailment.   43          EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS.     Earnings from operations increased by $45.8 million, or 12.8%, to $404.6 million for the year endedJanuary 29, 2011, from $358.8 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase in earnings from operations resulted primarily from the following:     Earnings from operations for the Europe segment increased $20.1 million to $193.3 million for the year endedJanuary 29, 2011, compared to $173.2 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase was driven by sales growth from all of our European businesses, led by the expansionof our directly operated retail store base, improved product margins in our directly operated stores and higher sales from our new jewelry business. This increase was partially offset by lower grossmargins due to the stronger U.S. dollar's impact on product purchases, higher occupancy costs, given our retail expansion in the region and lower initial markups. Currency translation fluctuationsunfavorably impacted earnings from operations by $13.6 million.    Earnings from operations for the North American Retail segment decreased by $9.7 million to $122.6 millionfor the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $132.3 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The decrease in earnings from operations was due primarily to higher expensesto support our retail store expansion, the impact of higher markdowns on product margins and higher marketing costs, partially offset by the favorable impact to earnings from the higher sales and the$6.7 million benefit to revenues related to a revision in the estimated liability from the Company's loyalty program. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our non-U.S.retail stores favorably impacted earnings from operations by $3.2 million.    Earnings from operations for the Asia segment increased by $12.8 million to $28.6 million for the year endedJanuary 29, 2011, compared to $15.8 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase was driven by growth in all of our businesses in the region, the leveraging ofoccupancy and SG&A expenses, and overall higher product margins. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our South Korea business favorably impacted earnings from operations by$1.6 million.    Earnings from operations for the North American Wholesale segment increased by $11.0 million to$46.2 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $35.2 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase in earnings from operations was mainly due tosales growth and the leveraging of SG&A expenses. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our non-U.S. wholesale businesses favorably impacted earnings from operations by$1.5 million.    Earnings from operations for the Licensing segment increased by $17.6 million to $104.2 million for the yearended January 29, 2011, compared to $86.6 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase was driven by increased royalties due to higher licensed product sales,partially offset by the loss of royalties as a result of the direct operation of our international jewelry business since January 2010.    Unallocated corporate overhead increased by $5.9 million to $90.2 million for the year endedJanuary 29, 2011, compared to $84.3 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase was driven primarily by the pension curtailment expense.            Operatingmargin decreased 60 basis points to 16.3% for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to 16.9% for the year ended January 30, 2010. The operating margindecrease was due primarily to the overall lower gross margins.     INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME.     Interest expense decreased to $1.2 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to$2.2 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. At January 29, 2011, total borrowings, related primarily to our capital lease in Europe, was $14.4 million, compared to$16.5 million at January 30, 2010. The decrease was due to lower average debt balances in Europe. The average debt balance for the year ended January 29, 2011, was$14.7 million, versus an average debt balance of $42.5 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, which included the use of certain lines of   44        creditduring the prior year. Interest income decreased slightly to $1.6 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $1.7 million for the year endedJanuary 30, 2010.     OTHER INCOME, NET.     Other income, net, was $16.4 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to other income, net, of$3.6 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. Other income, net, in the year ended January 29, 2011 consisted primarily of net unrealizedmark-to-market revaluation gains on other foreign currency balances and foreign currency contracts and net unrealized gains on non-operating assets. Other income,net, for the year ended January 30, 2010 resulted primarily from net unrealized gains on non-operating assets, partially offset by net unrealizedmark-to-market revaluation losses on other foreign currency balances and foreign currency contracts.     INCOME TAXES.     Income tax expense for the year ended January 29, 2011 was $126.9 million, or a 30.1% effective tax rate, compared toincome tax expense of $115.6 million, or a 31.9% effective tax rate, for the year ended January 30, 2010. The lower tax rate in the current year was due primarily to a larger mix oftaxable income in lower tax jurisdictions in fiscal 2011.     NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS.     Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries for the year endedJanuary 29, 2011 was $5.0 million, net of taxes, as compared to $3.6 million, net of taxes, for the year ended January 30, 2010. The increase was due to higher earningsfrom our Mexico operations.     NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GUESS?, INC.     Net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. increased by $46.7 million, or 19.3%, to$289.5 million for the year ended January 29, 2011, from $242.8 million for the year ended January 30, 2010. Diluted earnings per common share increased to $3.11 per sharefor the year ended January 29, 2011, compared to $2.61 per share for the year ended January 30, 2010.    NON-GAAP MEASURES            The Company's reported financial results are presented in accordance with GAAP. The reported net earnings attributable toGuess?, Inc. and diluted earnings per share for the year ended January 28, 2012 reflect the impact of a settlement charge which affects the comparability of those reported results. Thosefinancial results are also presented on a non-GAAP basis, as defined in Section 10(e) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, to exclude the effect of this item. TheCompany believes that these "non-GAAP" or "adjusted" financial measures are useful as an additional means for investors to evaluate the Company's operating results when reviewed inconjunction with the Company's GAAP financial statements. The non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as alternatives for, the Company's reported GAAP results.           Theadjusted measures exclude the impact of a settlement charge incurred during the year ended January 28, 2012. Near the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Companyexperienced a temporary disruption with one of its third party logistics service providers in Europe. Following this disruption in service, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with thisservice provider to facilitate a transition to a new service provider, resulting in a pre-tax settlement charge of $19.5 million (or $17.6 million after considering a$1.9 million reduction to income tax as a result of the charge), or $0.19 per share, in the year ended January 28, 2012 related to amounts paid in connection with this agreement. Theestimated income tax effect of the charge is based on the Company's assessment of deductibility using the statutory tax rate of the tax jurisdiction in which the charge was incurred. On a GAAP basis,net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. for the year ended January 28, 2012 was $265.5 million and diluted earnings per common share for the year ended January 28, 2012was $2.86. Excluding the impact of the settlement charge and the related tax impact, adjusted net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. for the year ended January 28, 2012 was$283.1 million and adjusted diluted earnings per common share for the year ended January 28, 2012 was $3.05.   45                           Ourdiscussion and analysis above also includes certain constant currency financial information. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amount reported from translatingthe Company's foreign revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars. These rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported operating results under GAAP. The Company provides constant currencyinformation to help investors assess how our businesses performed excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency translation rates. To calculate revenues and earnings from operations on aconstant currency basis, operating results for the current year period for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates ineffect during the comparable period of the prior year. The constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different tothe functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate. The constant currency information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES            We need liquidity primarily to fund our working capital, the expansion and remodeling of our retail stores,shop-in-shop programs, concessions, systems, infrastructure, other existing operations, international growth, potential acquisitions, potential share repurchases and payment ofdividends to our stockholders. During the fiscal year ended January 28, 2012, the Company relied on trade credit, available cash, real estate leases, and internally generated funds to financeour operations and expansion. The Company anticipates that we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements during the next twelve months for working capital, capital expenditures, interestand principal payments on our debt, potential acquisitions, potential sharerepurchases and dividend payments to stockholders, primarily with cash flow from operations and existing cash balances supplemented by borrowings, if necessary, under the Credit Facility and bankfacilities in Europe, as described below under "Credit Facilities." As of January 28, 2012, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $491.8 million andshort-term investments of $4.1 million. Approximately half of the Company's cash and cash equivalents were held outside of the U.S. Excess cash and cash equivalents, which representthe majority of our outstanding cash and cash equivalents balance, are held primarily in four diversified money market funds and in overnight deposit and short-term time deposit accounts.The money market funds are all AAA rated by national credit rating agencies and are generally comprised of high-quality, liquid investments. Please see "Part I, Item 1A. RiskFactors" for a discussion of risk factors which could reasonably be likely to result in a decrease of internally generated funds available to finance capital expenditures and working capitalrequirements.           TheCompany has presented below the cash flow performance comparison of the year ended January 28, 2012, versus the year ended January 29, 2011.    Operating Activities            Net cash provided by operating activities was $364.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2012, compared to$346.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011, or an increase of $18.1 million. The increase was driven by the receipt of a fixed cash rights payment of$35.0 million in January 2012 from one of our licensees and the favorable impact of changes in working capital, partially offset by lower net earnings of $23.9 million for the year endedJanuary 28, 2012 versus the prior year. The change in working capital was driven primarily by the lower accounts receivable balance at the end of fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 as the rateof sales growth in Europe slowed compared to the prior-year period, partially offset by the timing of payments for current liabilities and taxes compared to the same prior-yearperiod.           AtJanuary 28, 2012, the Company had working capital (including cash and cash equivalents) of $841.4 million compared to $732.6 million at January 29, 2011.The Company's primary working capital needs are for inventory and accounts receivable. Accounts receivable at January 28, 2012 amounted to $340.6 million, down $17.9 million,compared to $358.5 million at January 29, 2011. The accounts receivable balance relates primarily to the Company's wholesale business in Europe, and to a lesser extent,   46        toits wholesale businesses in North America and Asia. On a constant dollar basis, accounts receivable decreased by $9.7 million, or 2.7%. Approximately $192.5 million of ourreceivables, or 57% of the $340.6 million in accounts receivable at January 28, 2012, were insured for collection purposes or subject to certain bank guarantees or letters of credit.Inventory at January 28, 2012 increased to $328.6 million, or 11.5%, compared to $294.7 million at January 29, 2011. The increase in inventory supports primarily theexpansion of our retail business in Europe, and also reflects the recent impact of reduced customer demand in Europe, as well as growth in our Asian and North American operations. When measured interms of finished goods units, inventory volumes increased by 15.0% as of January 28, 2012, when compared to January 29, 2011.    Investing Activities            Net cash used in investing activities was $132.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2012, compared to$146.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011. Cash used in investing activities related primarily to the expansion of our North American Retail and Europe businesses andcapital expenditures incurred on existing store remodeling programs in North America.           Thedecrease in cash used in investing activities related primarily to a net decrease in investments in marketable securities during the current year compared to the prior year. This waspartially offset by net payments for settlement of forward contracts during the year ended January 28, 2012 compared to net cash receipts for settlement of forward contracts in the prior year.During the fiscal year ended January 28, 2012, the Company opened 107 directly-operated stores compared to 126 directly-operated stores that were opened in the prior year.    Financing Activities            Net cash used in financing activities was $163.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2012, compared to$277.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2012 compared to the fiscal 2011 was due primarily to thepayment of a special dividend in fiscal 2011 of $2.00 per share, partially offset by higher repurchases of shares of the Company's common stock during the fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2012, the Companyrepurchased 3,216,514 shares under the 2011 Share Repurchase Program at an aggregate cost of $92.0 million. During fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased 1,500,000 shares under the 2008 ShareRepurchase Program at an aggregate cost of $49.3 million.   47         Contractual Obligations and Commitments            The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations at January 28, 2012 and the effects such obligations areexpected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands):                                  Payments due by period              Total      Less than 1 year      1-3 years      3-5 years      More than 5 years          Contractual Obligations:                                                      Short-term borrowings     $  311     $  311     $       $       $           Capital lease obligations(1)        13,427        2,197        4,214        7,016                 Operating lease obligations(2)        1,098,937        180,558        325,845        255,358        337,176         Purchase obligations(3)        184,705        184,705                                 Benefit obligations(4)        103,971        405        2,585        4,162        96,819                                               Total     $  1,401,351     $  368,176     $  332,644     $  266,536     $  433,995                                               Other commercial commitments(5)     $  1,022     $  1,022     $       $       $                                                     (1) Includesinterest on capital lease obligations. (2) Doesnot include insurance, taxes and common area maintenance charges. In fiscal 2012, these variable charges totaled $64.3 million. (3) Purchaseobligations represent open purchase orders for merchandise at the end of the fiscal year. These purchase orders can be impacted by various factors,including the scheduling of market weeks, the timing of issuing orders, the timing of the shipment of orders and currency fluctuations. Accordingly, a comparison of purchase orders from period toperiod is not necessarily meaningful. (4) Includesexpected payments associated with the deferred compensation plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan through fiscal 2045. (5) Consistsof standby letters of credit for guarantee of foreign subsidiary's borrowings, workers' compensation and general liability insurance.            Excludedfrom the above contractual obligations table is the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including penalties and interest, of $16.7 million.This liability for unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded because the Company cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever.    Dividends            During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company announced the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share of theCompany's common stock. Since that time, the Company has continued to pay a quarterly cash dividend, which has subsequently increased to $0.20 per common share.           Duringthe fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company paid a special cash dividend of $2.00 per share of the Company's common stock, totaling approximately $184 million, and aregular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share. For the years ended January 28, 2012, January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, the Company paid dividends of$74.4 million, $247.1 million and $41.6 million, respectively.           OnMarch 14, 2012, the Company announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share of the Company's common stock. The dividend will be payable on April 13, 2012to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 28, 2012.   48                Thepayment of cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based on a number of business, legal and other considerations, including ourcash flow from operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes, earnings, share repurchases and liquidity.    Capital Expenditures            Gross capital expenditures totaled $123.5 million, before deducting lease incentives of $10.5 million, for the fiscalyear ended January 28, 2012. This compares to gross capital expenditures of $123.1 million, before deducting lease incentives of $14.2 million, for the fiscal year endedJanuary 29, 2011. The Company's investments in capital for the full fiscal year 2013 are planned between $130 million and $145 million (after deducting estimated lease incentivesof approximately $10 million). The planned investments in capital are primarily for expansion of our retail businesses in North America and Europe and store remodeling programs in NorthAmerica.           Inaddition, we periodically evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances and pursue those that we believe will support and contribute to our overall growth initiatives.    Credit Facilities            On July 6, 2011, the Company entered into a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility with JPMorgan ChaseBank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A. and the other lenders party thereto (the "Credit Facility"). The Credit Facility provides for a $200 million revolving multicurrency line of credit, and isavailable for direct borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit, subject to certain letters of credit sublimits. It may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. TheCredit Facility also allows for incremental revolving commitments or incremental term loans in an aggregate amount that does not exceed $100 million, subject to certain conditions. The CreditFacility replaced the Company's previous $85 million credit facility, which was scheduled to mature on September 30, 2011. No principal or interest was outstanding or accrued and unpaidunder the prior credit facility on its termination date.           Allobligations under the Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of the personal assets ofthe Company and such domestic subsidiaries, including a pledge of 65% of the equity interests of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.           Directborrowings under the Credit Facility will be made, at the Company's option, as (a) Eurodollar Rate Loans, which shall bear interest at the published LIBOR rate for therespective interest period plus an applicable margin (varying from 1.15% to 1.65%) based on the Company's leverage ratio at the time, or (b) Base Rate Loans, which shall bear interest at thehigher of (i) 0.50% in excess of the federal funds rate, (ii) the rate of interest as announced by JP Morgan as its "prime rate," or (iii) 1.0% in excess of the one month adjustedLIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin (varying from 0.15% to 0.65%) based on the Company's leverage ratio at the time. The Company is also obligated to pay certain commitment, letter of credit andother fees customary for a credit facility of this size and type. At January 28, 2012, the Company had $1.0 million in outstanding standby letters of credit, no outstanding documentaryletters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.           TheCredit Facility requires the Company to comply with a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the Credit Facility contains customary covenants, includingcovenants that limit or restrict the Company and its subsidiaries' ability to: incur liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets, make certain restricted payments, merge orconsolidate and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Credit Facilityand declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (some of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods),including, among other things, non-payment defaults,   49        covenantdefaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults and material judgment defaults. The Credit Facility allows for both secured and unsecuredborrowings outside of the Credit Facility up to specified amounts.           TheCompany, through its European subsidiaries, maintains short-term uncommitted borrowing agreements, primarily for working capital purposes, with various banks in Europe.The majority of the borrowings under these agreements are secured by specific accounts receivable balances. Based on the applicable accounts receivable balances at January 28, 2012, the Companycould have borrowed up to $176.4 million under these agreements. At January 28, 2012, the Company had no outstanding borrowings and $3.4 million in outstanding documentary lettersof credit under these agreements. The agreements are denominated primarily in euros and provide for annual interest rates ranging from 1.6% to 4.7%. The maturities of the short-termborrowings are generally linked to the credit terms of the underlying accounts receivable that secure the borrowings. With theexception of one facility for up to $46.3 million that has a minimum net equity requirement, there are no other financial ratio covenants.           TheCompany entered into a capital lease in December 2005 for a new building in Florence, Italy. At January 28, 2012, the capital lease obligation was $11.9 million. TheCompany entered into a separate interest rate swap agreement designated as a non-hedging instrument that resulted in a swap fixed rate of 3.55%. This interest rate swap agreement maturesin 2016 and converts the nature of the capital lease obligation from Euribor floating rate debt to fixed rate debt. The fair value of the interest rate swap liability at January 28, 2012 wasapproximately $0.9 million.           Fromtime to time the Company will obtain other short term financing in foreign countries for working capital to finance its local operations.    Share Repurchases            On March 14, 2011, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the previously authorized 2008 Share Repurchase Program (whichhad $84.9 million capacity remaining) and authorized a new program to repurchase, from time-to-time and as market and business conditions warrant, up to$250.0 million of the Company's common stock (the "2011 Share Repurchase Program"). Repurchases may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant toRule 10b5-1 trading plans or other available means. There is no minimum or maximum number of shares to be repurchased under the program and the program may be discontinued at anytime, without prior notice. During fiscal 2012, the Company repurchased 3,216,514 shares under the 2011 Share Repurchase Program at an aggregate cost of $92.0 million. There were no sharerepurchases under the 2008 Share Repurchase Programs during fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased 1,500,000 shares under the 2008 Share Repurchase Program at an aggregate cost of$49.3 million. During fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased 407,600 shares under the 2008 Share Repurchase Program at an aggregate cost of $5.3 million. At January 28, 2012, theCompany had remaining authority under the 2011 Share Repurchase Program to purchase $158.0 million of its common stock.    Other            On August 23, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan which becameeffective January 1, 2006. The SERP provides select employees who satisfy certain eligibility requirements with certain benefits upon retirement, termination of employment, death, disability ora change in control of the Company, in certain prescribed circumstances. Paul Marciano, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman of the Board, isthe only active participant in the SERP. Maurice Marciano, non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, was an active participant in the SERP until his retirement effective onJanuary 28, 2012. Carlos Alberini, the Company's former President and Chief Operating Officer, was an active participant in the SERP until his departure from the Company on June 1, 2010.Mr. Maurice Marciano and Mr. Alberini will be eligible to receive vested SERP benefits in the future   50        inaccordance with the terms of the SERP. During the year ended January 28, 2012, the Company recorded a SERP curtailment expense of $1.2 million before taxes related to the acceleratedamortization of prior service cost resulting from the retirement of Mr. Maurice Marciano as an employee and executive officer, effective upon the expiration of his employment agreement onJanuary 28, 2012. Mr. Maurice Marciano did not receive or earn any additional SERP-related benefits in connection with his retirement and, as of the date of his retirement,ceased vesting or accruing any additional benefits under the terms of the SERP. During the year ended January 29, 2011, the Company recorded a SERP curtailment expense of $5.8 millionbefore taxes related to the accelerated amortization of prior service cost resulting from the departure of Mr. Alberini from the Company. Mr. Alberini did not receive any terminationpayments in connection with his departure and, as of the date of his departure, he ceased vesting or accruing any additional benefits under the terms of the SERP. Mr. Maurice Marciano'sretirement and Mr. Alberini's departure each resulted in a significant reduction in the total expected remaining years of future service of all SERP participants combined, resulting in thepension curtailment during each of the separate periods. As a non-qualified pension plan, no dedicated funding of the SERP is required; however, the Company has and expects to continue tomake periodic payments into insurance policies held in a rabbi trust to fund the expected obligations arising under the non-qualified SERP. The amount of future payments may vary,depending on the future years of service, future annual compensation of the active participant and investment performance of the trust. The cash surrender values of the insurance policies were$38.4 million and $32.9 million as of January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively and were included in other assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Asa result of a change in value of the insurance policy investments, the Company recorded (losses) gains of ($0.2) million, $2.7 million and $3.1 million in other income during fiscal2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively.           InJanuary 2002, the Company established a qualified employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP"), the terms of which allow for qualified employees (as defined) to participate in the purchaseof designated shares of the Company's common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing price at the beginning or end of each quarterly stock purchase period. On January 23,2002, the Company filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-8 registering 4,000,000 shares of common stock for the ESPP. During the year ended January 28, 2012,47,456 shares of the Company's common stock were issued pursuant to the ESPP at an average price of $29.00 per share for a total of $1.4 million. On March 12, 2012, the Board ofDirectors approved a restatement of the ESPP which extended the term for an additional ten years, subject to shareholder approval at the Company's 2012 annual meeting.    INFLATION            The Company does not believe that inflation trends in the U.S. and internationally over the last three years have had a significanteffect on net revenue or profitability. The Company anticipates that inflationary pressures on raw materials, labor, freight and other commodities including oil, experienced in fiscal 2012 maystabilize in the future but continue to negatively impact the cost of product purchases in fiscal 2013, particularly in the first half of the fiscal year. Although overall, the Company has been ableto mitigate the impact of product inflation through reduced promotional markdowns, price increases on select items and supply chain initiatives, there can be no assurances that these actions willcontinue to be successful. In addition, increased retail prices could lead to reduced customer demand. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations andfinancial condition. Also see "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsGeneralRecent Global Economic Developments" forfurther information regarding the impact of currencies on the cost of goods purchased.    SEASONALITY            The Company's business is impacted by the general seasonal trends characteristic of the apparel and retail industries. The U.S.,European and Canadian retail operations are generally stronger during the   51        secondhalf of the fiscal year, and the U.S. and Canadian wholesale operations generally experience stronger performance from July through November. The European wholesale businesses operate with twoprimary selling seasons: the Spring/Summer season, which ships primarily from November to April and the Fall/Winter season, which ships primarily from May to October. The Company's goal is to takeadvantage of early-season demand and potential reorders by offering a pre-collection assortment which ships at the beginning of each season. Customers retain the ability to request earlyshipment of backlog orders or delay shipment of orders depending on their needs.    RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE            In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an update to its authoritative guidance regarding fair valuemeasurement to clarify disclosure requirements and improve comparability. Additional disclosure requirements in the update include: (a) for Level 3 fair value measurements, quantitativeinformation about the significant unobservable inputs used, qualitative information about the sensitivity of the measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs disclosed including theinterrelationship between inputs, and a description of the Company's valuation processes; (b) all, not just significant, transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy;(c) the reason why, if applicable, the current use of a nonfinancial asset measured at fair value differs from its highest and best use; and (d) the categorization in the fair valuehierarchy for financial instruments not measured at fair value but for which disclosure of fair value is required. The Company will adopt this guidance commencing in fiscal 2013, effectiveJanuary 29, 2012, and apply it retrospectively.           InJune 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that revised its requirements related to the presentation of comprehensive income, which becomes effective for fiscal periodsbeginning after January 1, 2012, with early adoption allowed. This guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income ("OCI") as part of the consolidatedstatement of equity. It requires presentation of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement ofcomprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The Company has elected to early adopt this guidance in fiscal 2012 and accordingly has presented the required comprehensive incomedisclosures as separate consolidated statements of comprehensive income in its in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.           InSeptember 2011, the FASB issued an update to its authoritative guidance regarding the methods used to test goodwill for impairment, which becomes effective for fiscal years beginningafter December 15, 2011, with early adoption allowed. The amendment provides the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform thetwo-step quantitative goodwill impairment test currently required. Under that option, an entity would no longer be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit if the entitydetermines, based on that qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its carrying amounts are less than their fair values. If an entity concludes otherwise, then it must perform thetwo-step impairment test currently required. The Company elected to early adopt this guidance in fiscal 2012. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company'sconsolidated financial statements.             ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.         Exchange Rate Risk            More than half of product sales and licensing revenue recorded for the year ended January 28, 2012 were denominated incurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company's primary exchange rate risk relates to operations in Europe, Canada and South Korea. Changes in currencies affect our earnings in various ways. Forfurther discussion on currency related risk, please refer to our risk factors under "Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors."   52                Varioustransactions that occur in Canada, Europe and South Korea are denominated in U.S. dollars, British pounds or Swiss francs and thus are exposed to earnings risk as a result ofexchange rate fluctuations when converted to their functional currencies. These types of transactions include U.S. dollar denominated purchases of merchandise, U.S. dollar and British pounddenominated intercompany liabilities and certain sales, operating expenses and tax liabilities denominated in Swiss francs that are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuationswhen converted to the functional currency. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to offset some but not all of the exchange risk on certain anticipated foreign currencytransactions. In addition, some of the derivative contracts in place will create volatility during the fiscal year as they are marked-to-market according to the accountingrules.    Forward Contracts Designated as Cash Flow Hedges            During the year ended January 28, 2012, the Company purchased U.S. dollar forward contracts in Europe and Canada totalingUS$148.9 million and US$41.5 million, respectively, to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases and intercompany royalties that weredesignated as cash flow hedges. As of January 28, 2012, the Company had forward contracts outstanding for its European and Canadian operations of US$90.0 million andUS$41.5 million, respectively, which are expected to mature over the next 11 months. The Company's derivative financial instruments are recorded in its consolidated balance sheet at fairvalue based on quoted market rates. Changes in the fair value of the U.S. dollar forward contracts, designated as cash flow hedges for forecasted merchandise purchases, are recorded as a component ofaccumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in cost of product sales in the period which approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold.Changes in the fair value of the U.S. dollar forward contracts, designated as cash flow hedges for forecasted intercompany royalties, are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensiveincome within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in other income and expense in the period in which the royalty expense is incurred.           Fromtime to time, Swiss franc forward contracts have been used in the past to hedge certain anticipated Swiss operating expenses over specific months. Changes in the fair value of theSwiss franc forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in SG&A in the periodwhich approximates the time the expenses are incurred.           Asof January 28, 2012, accumulated other comprehensive income included a net unrealized gain of approximately US$4.3 million, net of tax, of which US$4.1 millionwill be recognized in other income or cost of product sales over the following 12 months at the then current values on a pre-tax basis, which can be different than the currentyear-end values. At January 28, 2012, the net unrealized gain of the remaining open forward contracts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet was approximatelyUS$2.5 million.           AtJanuary 29, 2011, the Company had forward contracts outstanding for its European and Canadian operations of US$71.6 million and US$52.3 million, respectively. AtJanuary 29, 2011, the net unrealized loss of these open forward contracts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet was approximately US$0.5 million.   53                Thefollowing table summarizes net after-tax derivative activity recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (in thousands):                         Year Ended Jan. 28, 2012      Year Ended Jan. 29, 2011          Beginning balance (loss) gain     $  (1,789  )  $  1,845         Net gains from changes in cash flow hedges        662        295         Net losses (gains) reclassified to income        5,386        (3,929  )                          Ending balance gain (loss)     $  4,259     $  (1,789  )                           Forward Contracts Not Designated as Cash Flow Hedges            The Company also has foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Changes in fair value offoreign currency contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expense. For the year ended January 28, 2012, the Company recorded a netgain of US$4.3 million for the euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar foreign currency contracts, which has been included in other income and expense. At January 28, 2012,the Company had euro foreign currency contracts to purchaseUS$88.0 million expected to mature over the next 11 months, Canadian dollar foreign currency contracts to purchase US$50.5 million expected to mature over the next eight months,Swiss franc foreign currency contracts to purchase US$14.0 million expected to mature over the next nine months and GBP5.0 million of foreign currency contracts to purchase eurosexpected to mature over the next seven months. At January 28, 2012, the net unrealized gain of these open forward contracts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet was approximatelyUS$4.7 million.           AtJanuary 29, 2011, the Company had euro foreign currency contracts to purchase US$70.0 million, Canadian dollar foreign currency contracts to purchaseUS$67.7 million, Swiss franc foreign currency contracts to purchase US$30.1 million and GBP11.3 million of foreign currency contracts to purchase euros. At January 29,2011, the net unrealized loss of these open forward contracts recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheet was approximately US$4.1 million.    Sensitivity Analysis            At January 28, 2012, a sensitivity analysis of changes in the foreign currencies when measured against the U.S. dollar indicatesthat, if the U.S. dollar had uniformly weakened by 10% against all of the U.S. dollar denominated foreign exchange derivatives totaling US$284.0 million, the fair value of the instruments wouldhave decreased by US$31.6 million. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened by 10% against all of the U.S. dollar denominated foreign exchange derivatives, the fair value of theseinstruments would have increased by US$25.8 million. Any resulting changes in the fair value of the hedged instruments may be partially offset by changes in the fair value of certain balancesheet positions (primarily U.S. dollar denominated liabilities in our foreign operations) impacted by the change in the foreign currency rate. The ability to reduce the exposure of currencies onearnings depends on the magnitude of the derivatives compared to the balance sheet positions during each reporting cycle.    Interest Rate Risk            At January 28, 2012, approximately 97% of the Company's total indebtedness related to a capital lease obligation, which iscovered by a separate interest rate swap agreement with a swap fixed interest rate of 3.55% that matures in 2016. Changes in the related interest rate that result in an unrealized gain or loss on thefair value of the swap are reported in other income or expense. The change in the unrealized fair value of the interest swap decreased other income, net by $0.2 million during fiscal year 2012.Substantially all of the Company's remaining indebtedness is at variable rates of interest. Accordingly, changes in interest   54        rateswould impact the Company's results of operations in future periods. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have had an insignificant effect on interest expense for the year endedJanuary 28, 2012.           Thefair value of the Company's debt instruments are based on the amount of future cash flows associated with each instrument discounted using the Company's incremental borrowing rate.At January 28, 2012, the carrying value of all financial instruments was not materially different from fair value, as the interest rate on the Company's debt approximates rates currentlyavailable to the Company.
