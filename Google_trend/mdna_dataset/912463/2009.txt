ITEM 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.          General             Unless the context indicates otherwise, when we refer to "we," "us" or the "Company" in this Form 10-K, we are referring to Guess?, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.     Business Segments             The business segments of the Company are retail, wholesale, European and licensing operations. Information relating to these segments is summarized in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes this segment reporting reflects how its four business segments are managed and each segment's performance is evaluated. The retail segment includes the Company's retail operations in North America. The wholesale segment includes the wholesale operations in North America and our Asian operations. The European segment includes both wholesale and retail operations in Europe and the Middle East. The licensing segment includes the worldwide licensing operations of the Company. The business segments operating results exclude corporate overhead costs, which consist of shared costs of the organization. These costs are presented separately and generally include, among other things, the following unallocated corporate costs: information technology, human resources, accounting and finance, global advertising and marketing, executive compensation, facilities and legal.             We acquired Focus Europe S.r.l. ("Focus"), our former licensee for GUESS by MARCIANO products in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, in December 2006, and its Spanish subsidiary ("Focus Spain") in October 2007. We also acquired BARN S.r.l. ("Barn"), our former kids licensee in Europe, in January 2008. Each of these entities is reported in our European segment. G by GUESS is a relatively new retail brand concept that was launched in early fiscal 2008 and is included in our retail segment. Our South Korea business, which we have operated directly since January 2007, and our Greater China business, launched in April 2007, are also relatively new businesses for us and are reported in our wholesale segment.      Products             We derive our net revenue from the sale of GUESS? men's and women's apparel, G by GUESS men's and women's apparel, GUESS by MARCIANO men's and women's apparel, and our licensees' products through our worldwide network of retail stores, wholesale customers and distributors, as well as our on-line stores. We also derive royalty revenues from worldwide licensing activities.     Recent Global Economic Developments             The global economic environment has deteriorated over the past several months. The declining values in real estate, reduced credit lending by banks, solvency concerns of major financial institutions, increases in unemployment levels and recent significant declines and volatility in the global financial markets have negatively impacted the level of consumer spending for discretionary items. This has affected our business as it is dependent on consumer demand for our products. In North America we have experienced a significant slowdown in customer traffic and a highly promotional environment. These same conditions are now spreading to many international markets. If the global macroeconomic environment continues to be weak or deteriorates further, there will likely be a negative effect on the Company's revenues and earnings across all of our segments for fiscal 2010.            In addition, the recent deterioration in the global economic environment has resulted in significant volatility in the global currency markets. The majority of our international operations are conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the Korean won. The recent volatility has resulted in a substantial strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these three currencies. A relatively stronger U.S. dollar will result in our international operating results translating into lower U.S.    30             dollar amounts. These conditions could negatively impact our results of operations and the Company's ability to generate both revenue and earnings growth. In addition, certain transactions that occur in Canada, Europe and South Korea are denominated in U.S. dollars and thus are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to their local functional currencies. These types of transactions include U.S. denominated purchases of merchandise and intercompany liabilities. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts and currency swaps, to manage exchange risk on certain foreign currency transactions. The Company does not hedge all transactions denominated in foreign currency.     Other             On January 18, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a change in the Company's fiscal year end from December 31 to the Saturday nearest January 31 of each year. The change, which became effective for the Company's 2008 fiscal year, aligned the Company's reporting cycle with the National Retail Federation ("NRF") fiscal calendar to provide for more consistent year-to-year comparisons. The Company's 2008 fiscal year began on February 4, 2007 and ended on February 2, 2008, resulting in a one-month transition period that began January 1, 2007 and ended February 3, 2007. The audited results for the one month ended February 3, 2007 are included in "ITEM 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules."            Unless specifically indicated otherwise, "fiscal 2009" relates to the twelve-months ended January 31, 2009, "fiscal 2008" relates to the twelve-months ended February 2, 2008 and "fiscal 2007" relates to the unaudited twelve months ended February 3, 2007. For purposes of this MD&A, the Company has presented the financial performance comparison of the 2009 fiscal year versus the 2008 fiscal year and the fiscal 2008 year versus the 2007 fiscal year. Fiscal years 2009 and 2008 include 52 weeks while fiscal 2007 includes 53 weeks.            The Company reports NRF calendar comparable store sales on a quarterly basis for its full-price retail and factory outlet stores in the U.S. and Canada. A store is considered comparable after it has been open for 13 full months. If a store remodel results in a square footage change of more than 15%, or involves a relocation or a change in store concept, the store is removed from the comparable store base until it has been opened at its new size, in its new location or under its new concept for 13 full months.     Executive Summary      The Company             The Company's operations generated net earnings of $213.6 million, or diluted earnings of $2.28 per share, for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to net earnings of $186.5 million, or diluted earnings of $1.99 per share, for the year ended February 2, 2008. The fiscal 2009 results included the benefit over the prior year of a lower effective tax rate which favorably impacted tax expense by $23.2 million (or $0.25 per diluted share) and a favorable impact of currency translation to earnings from operations of $5.2 million (or $0.03 per diluted share). This was partially offset by an unfavorable impact in fiscal 2009 of long-lived asset impairment charges of $24.4 million (or $0.17 per diluted share). The asset impairment charge reflected the write-down of the asset base for a number of our retail stores in North America and Asia as a result of adverse retail conditions arising from the recent deterioration in the global economic environment.            Total net revenues increased 19.6% to $2,093.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $1,749.9 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. All our business segments contributed to this growth. The European segment was the largest contributor to the growth in revenues, representing over half of the consolidated revenue growth. Retail store expansion in North America and the expansion of our operations in Asia also contributed to the growth in revenues, while our licensing business increased revenues across all key accessories categories and footwear.    31                    Gross margin decreased 120 basis points to 44.1% for the year ended January 31, 2009 compared to the prior year. The decline in the overall gross margin was attributable to lower product margins in our retail and wholesale segments partially offset by higher product margins in Europe and a higher mix of European net revenues, which generated a relatively higher gross margin than the other segments.            Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased 22.8% to $593.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2009 compared to $483.6 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. The increase in SG&A expenses was driven by higher variable costs to support the higher sales in our existing businesses, asset impairment charges in North America and Asia, investments in our newer businesses and investments in infrastructure in Europe. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expense increased 80 basis points to 28.4% for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to the prior-year. The asset impairment charge negatively impacted SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues by 120 basis points.            Earnings from operations increased 6.4% to $328.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2009 compared to $309.1 million for the same period a year ago. Operating margin declined 200 basis points to 15.7% for the year ended January 31, 2009 compared to the prior year due to the lower gross margin and the increase in SG&A spending as a percentage of net revenues. The asset impairment charge negatively impacted operating margin by 120 basis points.            Net interest income decreased $2.7 million for the year ended January 31, 2009 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances and higher average debt balances in Europe.            Other expense, net increased by $9.5 million for the year ended January 31, 2009 primarily due to the decline in the value of insurance policy investments and other non-operating assets.            Our effective income tax rate decreased 720 basis points to 32.6% for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to 39.8% in the prior year, primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.            The Company had $294.1 million in cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2009, compared to $275.6 million as of February 2, 2008. Total debt, including capital lease obligations, as of January 31, 2009, was $38.6 million, a decrease of $15.4 million from $54.0 million as of February 2, 2008. The decrease in debt was the combined result of a lower Euro denominated balance at January 31, 2009 compared to the prior year end and the favorable translation effect of the relatively stronger U.S. dollar. Accounts receivable increased by $9.9 million, or 3.9%, to $264.3 million at January 31, 2009, compared to $254.4 million at February 2, 2008. The increase in accounts receivable primarily resulted from the revenue growth in Europe. Changes in currency translation rates reduced the current year's accounts receivable balance by approximately $34.5 million compared to the prior year. Approximately $159.0 million of our European, U.S. and Canadian receivables, or 60% of the $264.3 million in accounts receivable at January 31, 2009, were insured for collection purposes or subject to certain bank guarantees. Inventory increased by $7.5 million, or 3.2%, to $239.7 million as of January 31, 2009, compared to $232.2 million as of February 2, 2008. Most of the inventory increase was related to anticipated sales growth in our existing European operations. The current year's inventory balance includes a negative translation impact of approximately $26.6 million due to currency fluctuations compared to the prior year.     Retail             Our retail segment, comprising North American full-priced retail and factory outlet stores and e-commerce, generated net sales of $978.0 million during the year ended January 31, 2009, an increase of 13.4% from $862.4 million in the prior year period. This growth was driven by a larger store base, which represented a net 12.8% increase in average square footage compared to the year ended February 2, 2008, and an increase in comparable store sales of 1.0% for the year ended January 31, 2009. Retail earnings from operations decreased by $35.3 million, or 27.5%, to $93.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $128.5 million for the prior year period. In addition, the operating margin decreased by 540 basis    32             points to 9.5% for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to 14.9% for the year ended February 2, 2008. The declines in both earnings from operations and operating margin were driven by asset impairment charges in the retail segment of $23.3 million and lower product margins. The decrease in earnings from operations was partially offset by the increased earnings due to the increased sales volume from the larger store base and lower advertising and marketing costs. The asset impairment charges negatively impacted operating margin by 230 basis points.            We opened 57 new stores, closed five underperforming stores and converted one full-price retail store to a GUESS? Accessories store in the U.S. and Canada during fiscal 2009. At January 31, 2009, we operated 425 stores in the U.S. and Canada, comprised of 192 GUESS? full-priced retail stores, 104 GUESS? factory outlet stores, 52 GUESS by MARCIANO stores, 43 G by GUESS stores and 34 GUESS? Accessories stores. This compares to 373 stores as of February 2, 2008.     Wholesale             Wholesale segment revenues increased by $37.8 million, or 14.6%, to $296.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $258.4 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to international expansion in our Asian business. Earnings from operations for the wholesale segment decreased by $4.4 million, or 8.8%, to $45.5 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $49.9 million for the prior year period. The decrease was driven by lower product margins in our North American wholesale business as well as higher product related costs and additional occupancy and SG&A expenses, largely to support our expanding Asian operations. Operating margin decreased by 390 basis points to 15.4% in the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to 19.3% for the prior year period. The lower North American wholesale product margins, additional operating expenses in Asia and the overall mix of our Asia business, where operating margins are lower than in our North American wholesale business, drove the operating margin decrease.     Europe             In Europe, revenues increased by $180.6 million, or 33.5%, to $719.0 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to $538.4 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. The majority of the revenue growth was generated by the European wholesale business, driven by growth in both our existing accessories and apparel businesses and our acquisition of BARN in January 2008. In addition, at January 31, 2009, we directly operated 61 stores in Europe, compared to 40 stores at the prior year end. As a result, European retail revenues, including new stores, increased by 47.0% for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to the prior year. Earnings from operations from our European segment increased by $47.8 million, or 39.6%, to $168.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $120.8 million for the prior year period. The increase in earnings from operations also included a currency benefit of $9.7 million. Operating margin increased 110 basis points to 23.5% in the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to 22.4% for the prior year due to higher product margins partially offset by increased occupancy and SG&A expenses.     Licensing             Our licensing business revenues increased by $9.6 million, or 10.5%, to $100.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $90.7 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. This increase was driven by growth in sales of several product categories, especially watches, jewelry, footwear, eyewear and handbags. Licensing segment earnings from operations increased $8.5 million, or 10.9%, to $86.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $77.9 million for the prior year period. Operating margin increased 30 basis points to 86.2% for the year ended January 31, 2009 compared to 85.9% for the prior year period.    33                   Outside of the U.S. and Canada, in the year ended January 31, 2009, together with our partners we opened 168 new stores, including 99 in Europe, 55 in Asia and 14 in the combined area of Mexico, Central and South America. We ended the year with 690 stores outside of the U.S. and Canada, of which 488 were GUESS? stores, 156 were GUESS? Accessories stores, and 46 were GUESS by MARCIANO stores. Of the 690 stores, 96 were operated by the Company and 594 were operated by licensees or distributors. This store count does not include 177 jean and accessory concessions located in Asia and Europe because of their smaller store size in relation to our standard international store size.     Corporate Overhead             Corporate overhead, included in SG&A, decreased by $3.1 million, or 4.6%, to $64.9 million in the year ended January 31, 2009, from $68.0 million for the prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to lower compensation related expenses.      Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates             The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the valuation of inventories, accounts receivable allowances, sales return allowances, loyalty accrual, the useful life of assets for depreciation, restructuring expense and accruals, evaluation of impairment, recoverability of deferred taxes, workers compensation accruals, litigation accruals, pension obligations and stock-based compensation.            The Company believes that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. In addition to the accounting policies mentioned below, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for other significant accounting policies.       Accounts receivable reserves               In the normal course of business, the Company grants credit directly to certain wholesale customers after a credit analysis based on financial and other criteria is performed. Accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the inability of its wholesale customers to make their required payments. The Company bases its allowances through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements, assessments of historical collection trends, an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions and whether the Company has obtained credit insurance or other guarantees.             Costs associated with customer markdowns are recorded as a reduction to net revenues, and are included in the allowance for accounts receivable. Historically, these markdown allowances resulted from seasonal negotiations with the Company's wholesale customers, as well as historical trends and the evaluation of the impact of the economic conditions. During fiscal 2008, the Company renegotiated its arrangements with its major customers in the U.S. to fix the percentage of sales that will be expensed as markdown allowances. The negotiation of a fixed rate allows the Company to process credit memos against the outstanding balance immediately which has resulted in a reduction of our outstanding markdown allowance accrual.    34              Sales returns reserves               The Company accrues for estimated sales returns in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. To recognize the financial impact of sales returns, the Company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned based on historical experience and reduces sales and cost of sales accordingly based on historical return experience. The Company's policy allows retail customers a 30 day period to return merchandise following the date of sale. Substantially all of these returns are considered to be resalable at a price that exceeds the cost of the merchandise.       Inventory reserves               Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (primarily weighted average method) or market. The Company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving product as well as prior seasons' inventory. Market value of aged inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for each product line category, the impact of market trends, an evaluation of economic conditions and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory. The Company closely monitors its off-price sales to ensure the actual results closely match initial estimates. Estimates are regularly updated based upon this continuing review.       Valuation of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets               The Company assesses the impairment of its long-lived assets (i.e. goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment), which requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. An asset is considered to be impaired if the Company determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon its assessment of the asset's ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods or if significant changes in the Company's strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets occurred. If the assets (other than goodwill) are assessed to be recoverable, they are depreciated or amortized over the periods benefited. If the assets are considered to be impaired, an impairment charge is recognized representing the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of those assets. Fair value is determined based upon the discounted cash flows derived from the underlying asset. We use various assumptions in determining current fair market value of these assets, including future expected cash flows and discount rates. Future expected cash flows for store assets are based on management's estimates of future cash flows over the remaining lease period or expected life, if shorter. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations. See Notes 1 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.       Pension benefit plan actuarial assumptions               The Company's pension obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, within the framework of the amendment of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 87, "Employer's Accounting for Pensions." The discount rate is an important element of expense and/or liability measurement. We evaluate this critical assumption annually which enables us to state expected future payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan related information.       Litigation reserves               Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the expected favorable or unfavorable    35           outcome of each claim. As additional information becomes available, the Company will assess the potential liability related to new claims and existing claims and will revise estimates as appropriate. As new claims arise, such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position.       Stock-based compensation               Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R ("SFAS 123R"), "Share-Based Payments," using the modified prospective transition method. Under this method, compensation cost recognized after January 1, 2006 included: (a) compensation expense for all stock-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, December 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and (b) compensation expense for all stock-based payments granted on or after January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for new grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time of grant. The expected volatility is determined based on an average of both historical volatility and implied volatility. Implied volatility is derived from exchange traded options on the Company's common stock. The expected life used prior to November 2007 was based on the "simplified" method described in the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. For options granted beginning November 2007, the expected term is determined based on historical trends. The dividend yield for the one month period ended February 3, 2007 and prior years was zero. In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Board of Directors authorized and approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend. The expected forfeiture rate is determined based on historical data. Compensation expense for new stock options and nonvested stock awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.            In addition, the Company grants certain nonvested stock awards and stock options that require the recipient to achieve certain minimum performance targets in order for these awards to vest. If the minimum performance targets have not been achieved or are not expected to be achieved, no expense is recorded during the period.       Taxes               The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes," in January 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109 and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations. The Company's continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the adoption of FIN 48.            In accordance with SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized. As all earnings from the    36             Company's foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed, the Company's income tax provision does not include additional U.S. taxes on foreign operations.       Hedge accounting               The Company operates in foreign countries, which exposes it to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company has entered into certain forward contracts and swaps to hedge the risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations. The Company has elected to apply the hedge accounting rules as required by SFAS No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," for certain of these hedges. The Company's objective is to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flows due to the foreign currency risk associated with certain anticipated inventory purchases and other expenses on a first dollar basis for specific months. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in cost of product sales or SG&A in the period which approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold or the hedged operating expense is incurred.            The Company has foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expenses.       Gift card breakage               Gift card breakage is income recognized due to the non-redemption of a portion of gift cards sold by the Company for which a liability was recorded in prior periods. Beginning with the quarter ended August 4, 2007, these estimated breakage amounts are accounted for under the redemption recognition method and are classified as additional net revenues as the gift cards are redeemed. The Company determined a gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns, which represented the cumulative estimated amount of gift card breakage from the inception of the electronic gift card program in late 2002. Any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage income recognized in future periods. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the recognition of gift card breakage.    37        NAME="page_do45001_1_38">                                               RESULTS OF OPERATIONS              The following table sets forth actual operating results for the 2009, 2008 and 2007 fiscal years and one-month periods ended February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006 as a percentage of net revenue:                                  Year Ended      One Month  Ended              Jan. 31,  2009      Feb. 2,  2008      Feb. 3,  2007      Feb. 3,  2007      Jan. 28,  2006          Product sales        95.2  %     94.8  %     94.6  %     95.0  %     92.9  %      Net royalties        4.8        5.2        5.4        5.0        7.1                                                  Total net revenue        100.0        100.0        100.0        100.0        100.0         Cost of product sales        55.9        54.7        55.9        59.0        67.0                                               Gross profit        44.1        45.3        44.1        41.0        33.0         Selling, general and administrative expenses        27.2        27.6        27.5        31.8        33.0         Asset impairment charges        1.2                0.2                                                                  Earnings from operations        15.7        17.7        16.4        9.2                 Interest expense        0.2        0.2        0.6        0.5        0.6         Interest income        (0.3  )     (0.4  )     (0.5  )     (0.5  )     (0.6  )      Other, net        0.6        0.1        (0.4  )     (0.2  )                                                       Earnings before income taxes        15.2        17.8        16.7        9.4                 Income taxes        5.0        7.1        6.2        3.6                 Minority interest                                (0.1  )                                                       Net earnings        10.2  %     10.7  %     10.5  %     5.9  %       %                                              Year Ended January 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended February 2, 2008.       NET REVENUE.     Net revenue for the year ended January 31, 2009 increased by $343.5 million, or 19.6%, to $2,093.4 million, from $1,749.9 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. All segments contributed to this revenue growth with double-digit percentage increases. The largest contribution to this revenue growth was generated by our European segment.            Net revenue from retail operations increased by $115.6 million, or 13.4%, to $978.0 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $862.4 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. The increase was driven by an average of 55 net additional stores during the year ended January 31, 2009, resulting in a 12.8% increase in average square footage compared to the prior year, and an increase in comparable store sales of 1.0% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our Canadian retail stores unfavorably impacted revenues by $9.0 million.            Net revenue from wholesale operations increased by $37.8 million, or 14.6%, to $296.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $258.4 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. The revenue growth was generated from our expanding Asia operations, primarily in South Korea and Greater China. During fiscal year 2009, the Company, along with its partners, opened 20 stores and 31 concessions in Greater China and 10 stores and 29 concessions in South Korea. Our U.S. wholesale products, which are mostly sold through better department stores, were sold in approximately 1,057 major doors as of January 31, 2009, compared to 1,006 major doors at the end of the prior year period. Currency translation fluctuations, relating to both our Canadian and South Korean operations, unfavorably impacted net revenue in our wholesale segment by $16.3 million.            Net revenue from European operations increased by $180.6 million, or 33.5%, to $719.0 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $538.4 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. All of our wholesale businesses in Europe contributed to this growth, including BARN, which we acquired in January    38             2008. The growth is also attributable to same store sales growth in our existing retail stores and the addition of new retail stores, increasing our directly operated store count to 61 stores at January 31, 2009 from 40 stores at February 2, 2008. Currency translation fluctuations accounted for $34.7 million of the increase in net revenue relating to our European operations.            Net royalty revenue from licensing operations increased by $9.6 million, or 10.5%, to $100.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $90.7 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. The increase was the result of the strength of the accessories business, particularly watches, jewelry, footwear, eyewear and handbags. Licensing revenues in fiscal year 2009 did not include any royalty revenue from our BARN business which we now operate directly as part of our European operations.      GROSS PROFIT.     Gross profit increased by $129.8 million, or 16.4%, to $922.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $792.8 million for the prior period. The increase in gross profit primarily resulted from the following:       Gross profit for the retail segment increased by $14.7 million, or 4.5%, to $344.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $330.1 million for the prior period, primarily due to higher unit sales volume driven by the expansion in our store count during the year and an increase in comparable store sales of 1.0% compared to the prior year. The increase in gross profit also includes the unfavorable impact of higher occupancy costs due to the store expansion and lower product margins.       Gross profit for the wholesale segment decreased by $1.5 million, or 1.5%, to $97.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $99.4 million for the prior year period, primarily due to lower product margins in our North American wholesale operations and increased occupancy costs in Asia, partially offset by higher sales volume in our Asian operations.       Gross profit for the European operations increased by $107.0 million, or 39.3%, to $379.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $272.6 million for the prior year period. The increase in our European gross profit was primarily attributable to higher sales volume in the existing European wholesale and retail operations, higher wholesale product margins and the impact of the acquisitions of BARN in January 2008 and Focus Spain in October 2007.       Gross profit for the licensing segment increased by $9.6 million, or 10.5%, to $100.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $90.7 million for the prior year period. The licensing gross profit improvement resulted from higher sales by our licensees of accessory and footwear products.             Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total net revenues) decreased 120 basis points to 44.1% for the year ended January 31, 2009, from 45.3% for the year ended February 2, 2008. The decline in the overall gross margin was attributable to lower product margins in our retail and wholesale segments, partially offset by higher product margins in Europe and a higher mix of European net revenues, which generated a relatively higher gross margin than the other segments.            The Company's gross margin may not be comparable to other entities since some entities include all of the costs related to their distribution in cost of product sales and others, like the Company, exclude the wholesale related distribution costs from gross margin, including them instead in selling, general and administrative expenses.      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.     SG&A expenses increased by $110.2 million, or 22.8%, to $593.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $483.6 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. About $46.1 million of the increase was attributable to higher store selling, merchandising and distribution costs due to the higher sales volumes. Approximately $36.1 million of the increase was attributable to spending to support newer businesses, including BARN, Focus Spain, our G by GUESS brand, and Greater China, as well as spending to support the continued build-out of our European    39             headquarters in Lugano, Switzerland. In addition, approximately $24.4 million of asset impairment charges were recorded during fiscal year 2009 compared to $0.6 million in the prior year.            As a percentage of net revenues, SG&A expense increased to 28.4% for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to 27.6% for prior year period, driven by additional spending for infrastructure and new businesses in Europe and the asset impairment charges, partially offset by expense leverage in our wholesale segment and in our corporate overhead.      EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS.     Earnings from operations increased by $19.7 million, or 6.4%, to $328.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to earnings from operations of $309.1 million for the year ended February 2, 2008.        Earnings from operations for the retail segment were $93.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to earnings from operations of $128.5 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. The decrease was driven by the store impairment charges of $23.3 million and the impact of lower product margins. This was partially offset by higher sales and the resulting gross profit due to the larger store base, and lower advertising and marketing costs. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our Canadian retail stores unfavorably impacted earnings from operations by $1.7 million.       Earnings from operations for the wholesale segment were $45.5 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to earnings from operations of $49.9 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. While segment revenues increased, the decrease in earnings from operations was driven by lower segment product margins and higher occupancy and SG&A expenses to support our expanding Asian operations. Currency translation fluctuations, relating to both our Canadian and South Korean operations, unfavorably impacted earnings from operations in our wholesale segment by $2.5 million.       Earnings from operations for the European segment were $168.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to $120.8 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. The increase was primarily due to the higher sales and gross profit resulting from growth in our existing European wholesale businesses, and our acquisition of BARN. This increase was partially offset by higher volume related operating costs and infrastructure spending, along with higher advertising and marketing costs. Currency translation fluctuations favorably impacted earnings from operations in our European segment by $9.7 million.       Earnings from operations for the licensing segment were $86.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to $77.9 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. The increase was the result of higher revenues generated by our product licensees. This increase was partially offset by the loss of royalty revenue from BARN, our kids product licensee, which we acquired and now report as part of our European operations.       Unallocated corporate overhead, included in SG&A, was $64.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to $68.0 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, mainly due to lower compensation related costs.             The lower gross margin and higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues resulted in a decrease in operating margin of 200 basis points to 15.7% for the year ended January 31, 2009 from 17.7% for the prior year period.      INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME.     Interest expense increased to $4.7 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to $3.4 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, primarily due to higher average debt balances in Europe to support working capital growth. On a comparable basis, the average debt balance for the year ended January 31, 2009 was $59.2 million versus an average debt balance of $48.6 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. Interest income decreased to $6.1 million for the year    40             ended January 31, 2009 compared to $7.5 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, due to lower interest rates on invested cash, partially offset by higher average invested cash balances.      OTHER EXPENSE, NET.     Other expense was $11.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, versus other expense of $1.8 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. Other expense for the year ended January 31, 2009 primarily resulted from the decline in value of insurance policy investments and other non-operating assets. For the year ended January 31, 2009, other expense included a net charge of $0.3 million relating to changes in foreign exchange rates on foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency transactions. The forward contracts are used to hedge currency exposure primarily relating to U.S. dollar transactions in our foreign operations in the event of a strengthening U.S. dollar. The impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on the forward contracts during the year ended January 31, 2009 resulted in a mark-to-market gain of $18.8 million. This gain was primarily offset by the unfavorable revaluation of U.S. dollar denominated liabilities in our foreign operations of $18.5 million during the same period.      INCOME TAXES.     Income tax expense for the year ended January 31, 2009 was $103.8 million, resulting in a 32.6% effective tax rate, compared to income tax expense for the prior year of $124.1 million, or a 39.8% effective tax rate. The lower tax rate in fiscal year 2009 was due to a higher mix of profits in lower tax jurisdictions and a decline in the Italian statutory tax rate at the end of fiscal 2008 that resulted in a devaluation of our Italian deferred tax assets at the end of fiscal year 2008.      MINORITY INTEREST.     The minority interest expense for the year ended January 31, 2009 was $1.5 million, net of taxes, as compared to minority interest expense of $0.9 million, net of taxes, for the year ended February 2, 2008. The increase in minority interest expense was primarily due to the stronger performance of Focus and our Mexican joint venture.     NET EARNINGS.     Net earnings increased by $27.1 million, or 14.5%, to $213.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $186.5 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. Diluted earnings per share increased to $2.28 per share for the year ended January 31, 2009 compared to $1.99 per share for the year ended February 2, 2008.     Year Ended February 2, 2008 Compared to Year Ended February 3, 2007.       NET REVENUE.     Net revenue for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008 increased by $497.2 million, or 39.7%, to $1,749.9 million, from $1,252.7 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. All segments contributed to this revenue growth with double-digit percentage increases. The largest contribution to this revenue growth was generated by our European segment.            Net revenue from retail operations increased by $121.3 million, or 16.4%, to $862.4 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, from $741.1 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. The increase was driven by a comparable store sales growth of 14.6% and an average of 26 net additional stores during the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008 resulting in a 5.3% increase in average square footage compared to the prior year period. Currency translation fluctuations accounted for $14.3 million of the increase in net revenue relating to our Canadian retail stores.            Net revenue from wholesale operations increased by $105.8 million, or 69.3%, to $258.4 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, from $152.6 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. Approximately 80.0% of this revenue growth was generated outside of the U.S., primarily in Asia. Our North American wholesale net revenue growth was primarily attributable to strong product performance. Our products were sold in the U.S. in approximately 1,006 major doors as of February 2, 2008, compared to 961 major doors at the end of the prior year period. Currency translation fluctuations accounted for $2.8 million of the increase in net revenue relating to our Canadian wholesale business.    41                   Net revenue from European operations increased by $246.6 million, or 84.5%, to $538.4 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, from $291.8 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. The majority of the revenue growth was generated by the European wholesale business, driven by our continued growth in both our existing accessories and apparel businesses and our acquisition of a 75% equity interest in Focus on December 31, 2006. The growth is also attributable to same store sales growth in our existing retail stores and the addition of new retail stores. Currency translation fluctuations accounted for $48.1 million of the increase in net revenue relating to our European operations.            Net royalty revenue from licensing operations increased by $23.6 million, or 35.1%, to $90.7 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, from $67.1 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. The increase was the result of the strength of the accessories business, particularly handbags, footwear and watches, and the increased recognition of licensing revenues as a result of the amortization of fixed cash rights payments received from licensees in connection with previously renegotiated contracts based on the periods these contracts represent. Licensing revenues in fiscal 2008 did not include any royalty revenue from our GUESS by MARCIANO and South Korean licensees, both of which we now operate directly, as the associated sales are now reported as revenue in the European and wholesale segments, respectively.      GROSS PROFIT.     Gross profit increased by $240.3 million, or 43.5%, to $792.8 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, from $552.5 million in the prior period. The increase in gross profit primarily resulted from sales growth in all segments.        Gross profit for the retail segment increased by $50.2 million, or 17.9%, to $330.1 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, from $279.9 million in the prior period, primarily due to higher sales volume and higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher occupancy costs.      Gross profit for the wholesale segment increased by $44.1 million, or 79.6%, to $99.4 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, from $55.3 million in the prior year period, primarily due to the increase in sales volume in Asia, and increased sales and higher mark-ups in North America driven by stronger product performance.       Gross profit for the European operations increased by $122.4 million, or 81.5%, to $272.6 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, from $150.2 million in the prior year period. The European gross profit increase resulted from higher sales volumes in the existing European operations and the acquisition of a 75% equity interest in Focus at the end of 2006.       Gross profit for the licensing segment increased by $23.6 million, or 35.1%, to $90.7 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, from $67.1 million in the prior year period. The licensing gross profit improvement was primarily the result of the strong sales performance of accessories, especially handbags, footwear and watches.             Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total net revenues) increased 120 basis points to 45.3% for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, from 44.1% for the year ended February 3, 2007. The improvement in the overall gross margin was attributable to a higher mix of European net revenues, which generated a relatively higher gross margin than the other businesses, higher mark-ups in our wholesale segment, and higher product margins in our retail segment due to higher mark-ups and gift card breakage income. This improvement was partially offset by the lower product margin in Europe compared to the prior year.             The Company's gross margin may not be comparable to other entities since some entities include all of the costs related to their distribution in cost of product sales and others, like the Company, exclude the wholesale related distribution costs from gross margin, including them instead in selling, general and administrative expenses.      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.     SG&A expenses increased by $136.6 million, or 39.4%, to $483.6 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, from $347.0 million    42             for the year ended February 3, 2007. Approximately $68.0 million of the increase was attributable to incremental spending required to support new businesses including Focus, our new European headquarters in Lugano, Switzerland, the new G by GUESS brand initiative, the South Korea operation, expansion in Greater China and Mexico, and BARN in Europe. In addition, the increase was also attributable to growth in store selling, merchandising and distribution costs of $41.8 million, incremental compensation expenses (primarily performance-based) of $12.5 million, and additional advertising and marketing spending in our existing businesses of $8.3 million. As a percentage of net revenue, SG&A expenses improved to 27.6% for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, compared to 27.7% for the prior year period.      EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS.     Earnings from operations increased by $103.6 million, or 50.4%, to $309.1 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, compared with earnings from operations of $205.5 million for the year ended February 3, 2007.        Earnings from operations for the retail segment were $128.5 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, compared to earnings from operations of $105.5 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. The increase in earnings from operations for the retail segment was driven by the higher sales volume, higher product margin and occupancy leverage, partially offset by increased investments in infrastructure to support our new G by GUESS brand concept and higher advertising expense. Currency translation fluctuations accounted for $3.5 million of the increase in earnings from operations for our Canadian retail stores.       Earnings from operations for the wholesale segment were $49.9 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, compared to earnings from operations of $25.2 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. This increase was principally due to incremental sales and gross profit from our new South Korea operation and higher sales and improved gross profit in North America, partially offset by additional SG&A expenses in Asia, including South Korea, to build infrastructure in this region and support the increased sales. Currency translation fluctuations accounted for $0.8 million of the increase in earnings from operations for our Canadian wholesale business.      Earnings from operations for the European segment were $120.8 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, compared to $73.2 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. The increase was primarily due to higher sales and gross profit in the existing accessories and apparel wholesale businesses combined with the sales and gross profit resulting from our acquisition of a 75% equity interest in Focus in late 2006. In addition, our existing Company-owned retail business in Europe continued to improve, generating strong sales growth and increasing profits. The growth in sales and gross profit was partially offset by higher volume related and infrastructure expansion expenses. Currency translation fluctuations accounted for $10.4 million of the increase in earnings from operations for our European operations.       Earnings from operations for the licensing segment were $77.9 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, compared to $58.7 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. The improvement was the result of higher revenues generated by our accessories product licensees and the recognition of additional licensing revenues relating to the amortization of fixed cash rights payments received from licensees in connection with previously renegotiated contracts. These increases were partially offset by the loss of royalty revenue from the GUESS by MARCIANO and South Korean licensees in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007.       Unallocated corporate overhead was $68.0 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, compared to $57.0 million for the year ended February 3, 2007, mainly due to higher performance-based compensation costs, including share based payment expense.    43                        The higher gross margin and lower SG&A spending as a percentage of net revenues resulted in an increase in operating margin of 130 basis points to 17.7% for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008 from 16.4% for the prior year period.      INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME.     Interest expense decreased to $3.4 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, compared to $7.7 million for the year ended February 3, 2007, primarily due to the early redemption of the Company's 6.75% Secured Notes of $32.8 million at the end of 2006. The Secured Notes were redeemed in December 2006 resulting in a $1.4 million write-off of debt issuance costs and a $0.5 million redemption premium, which are included in interest expense for the year ended February 3, 2007. On a comparable basis, the average debt balance for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008 was $48.6 million versus an average debt balance of $79.4 million, for the year ended February 3, 2007. Interest income increased to $7.5 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, compared to $6.2 million for the year ended February 3, 2007, due to higher average invested cash balances.      OTHER INCOME, NET.     Other expense, net was $1.8 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, versus other income, net of $4.7 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. Other expense, net in the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008 was primarily due to net losses related to changes in foreign exchange rates on forward contracts and other foreign currency transactions. Other income, net in the year ended February 3, 2007 comprised gains on sale of land and other long-term investments.      INCOME TAXES.     Income tax expense for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008 was $124.1 million, or a 39.8% effective tax rate, compared to income tax expense of $77.6 million, or a 37.2% effective tax rate, for the year ended February 3, 2007. Fiscal 2008's higher tax rate was due to a higher mix of profits in higher tax jurisdictions, the utilization of capital loss carryforwards in the prior year, favorable tax audit settlements last year and a recent decline in the Italian statutory tax rate, effective in fiscal 2009, that resulted in a devaluation of deferred tax assets in the fiscal 2008.      MINORITY INTEREST.     The minority interest expense of $0.9 million, net of taxes, primarily represents the portion of earnings of Focus for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008 allocated to the minority interest stockholders. The Company acquired a 75% interest in Focus on December 31, 2006.      NET EARNINGS.     Net earnings increased by $55.3 million, or 42.2%, to $186.5 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008, from $131.2 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. Diluted earnings per share increased to $1.99 per share for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008 compared to $1.42 per share for the year ended February 3, 2007.     One-Month Audited Transition Period Ended February 3, 2007 ("January 2007") Compared to the One-Month Unaudited Period Ended January 28, 2006 ("January 2006").             The Company reported net earnings of $8.0 million, or diluted earnings of $0.09 per share, for January 2007 (which included 34 days), compared to $0.00 per share for January 2006 (which included 28 days). Net revenue for January 2007 increased by $67.5 million, or 98.6%, to $136.0 million, from $68.5 million for January 2006. Gross profit increased by $33.1 million, or 146.6%, to $55.7 million for January 2007, from $22.6 million for January 2006. SG&A expenses increased by $20.6 million, or 91.2%, to $43.3 million for January 2007, from $22.6 million for January 2006. Earnings from operations increased by $12.5 million to $12.5 million for January 2007, compared to the approximately break-even results from operations for January 2006. These results reflect the impact of the significant growth in our existing European operations, the comparable store sales growth of 12.7% in our retail store operations in North America for January 2007 compared to the prior-year period, the greater number of days in the one month ended January 2007 compared to the prior-year period and the acquisition of a 75% majority interest in Focus, our European GUESS by MARCIANO licensee, in late 2006.    44             LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES             We need liquidity primarily to fund our working capital in Europe, the expansion and remodeling of our retail stores, shop-in-shop programs, systems, infrastructure, other existing operations, international growth, potential acquisitions, potential share repurchases and payment of dividends to our stockholders. During the year ended January 31, 2009, the Company relied on trade credit, available cash, short-term borrowings from its European bank facilities, real estate leases and internally generated funds to finance its operations and expansion. The Company anticipates that it will be able to satisfy its ongoing cash requirements during the next twelve months for working capital, capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on its debt, potential acquisitions, potential share repurchases and dividend payments to stockholders, primarily with cash flow from operations supplemented by borrowings, if necessary, under the Credit Facility and bank facilities in Europe, as described below under "Credit Facilities." As of January 31, 2009, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $294.1 million. Excess cash and cash equivalents, which represent the majority of our outstanding cash and cash equivalents balance, are held primarily in three diversified money market funds. The funds, each of which is rated AAA by national credit rating agencies, are generally comprised of high-quality, liquid instruments. As of January 31, 2009, the Company does not have any exposure to auction-rate security investments in these funds. Please see "Important Factors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Part I, ITEM 1A. Risk Factors" for a discussion of risk factors which could reasonably be likely to result in a decrease of internally generated funds available to finance capital expenditures and working capital requirements.            The Company has presented below the cash flow performance comparison of the 2009 fiscal year versus the 2008 fiscal year.     Operating Activities             Net cash provided by operating activities was $228.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to $180.8 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, or an increase of $47.8 million. The majority of the increase was driven by a $27.1 million growth in net income for the year ended January 31, 2009 versus the prior year. The remaining increase was due to working capital changes which reflected the lower growth in accounts receivable and inventory, mostly offset by a decline in accounts payable and accrued expenses when comparing the year ended January 31, 2009 to the year ended February 2, 2008.            At January 31, 2009, the Company had working capital (including cash and cash equivalents) of $558.3 million compared to $432.6 million at February 2, 2008. The Company's primary working capital needs are for inventory and accounts receivable. Accounts receivable at January 31, 2009 amounted to $264.3 million, an increase of $9.9 million, from $254.4 million at February 2, 2008. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to growth in accounts receivable related to our European wholesale business (including our new GUESS Kids business acquired in January 2008), which totaled $193.4 million at January 31, 2009, versus $183.6 million at February 2, 2008. Fluctuations in currency rates resulted in a $34.5 million decrease to the accounts receivable balance as of January 31, 2009 compared to the prior year end. Approximately $159.0 million of our European, U.S. and Canadian receivables, or 60% of the $264.3 million in accounts receivable at January 31, 2009, were insured for collection purposes or subject to certain bank guarantees. Inventory at January 31, 2009 amounted to $239.7 million, up $7.5 million compared to $232.2 million at February 2, 2008. Most of this inventory increase was related to anticipated sales growth in our existing European operations. The current year's inventory balance includes a negative translation impact of approximately $26.6 million due to currency fluctuations compared to the prior year.     Investing Activities             Net cash used in investing activities decreased to $102.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to $117.2 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, or a decrease of $15.0 million. Cash used in investing activities relates primarily to capital expenditures incurred on new store openings and existing    45             store remodeling programs in the U.S. and Canada, expansion in Europe and Asia, investments in information systems and other enhancements. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2009 was driven by lower capital expenditures relating to the opening of 57 new stores in North America during the 2009 fiscal year compared to the combination of opening 49 new stores and converting 20 existing stores to the new G by GUESS concept in the prior year. The decrease in capital expenditures was partially offset by the net proceeds received related to the assignment of an aircraft purchase agreement in fiscal 2008. The Company ultimately did not acquire the corporate aircraft and as a result assigned its aircraft purchase right in exchange for a payment to the Company during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.     Financing Activities             Net cash used in financing activities increased to $99.1 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to $0.1 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the repurchase under the Company's 2008 Share Repurchase Program of 2.9 million shares of the Company's common stock at a total cost of $60.5 million, the repayment of borrowings during the current year and the higher dividend payments compared to the prior year.     Contractual Obligations and Commitments             The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations at January 31, 2009 and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands):                                  Payments due by period              Total      Less than  1 year      1-3  years      3-5  years      More than  5 years          Contractual Obligations:                                                      Short-term borrowings     $  22,304     $  22,304     $       $       $           Capital lease obligations(1)        21,964        2,860        5,043        4,762        9,299         Operating lease obligations(2)        828,331        126,019        215,688        186,481        300,143         Purchase obligations        111,502        111,502                                 Benefit obligations(3)        95,520        3,220        2,174        232        89,894         Other long-term liabilities(4)        5,557        1,546        4,011                                                                  Total     $  1,085,178     $  267,451     $  226,916     $  191,475     $  399,336                                               Other commercial commitments(5)     $  24,915     $  24,915     $       $       $                                                       (1) Includes interest on long-term debt and capital lease obligations. (2) Does not include insurance, taxes and common area maintenance charges. In fiscal 2009, these variable charges totaled $42.5 million. (3) Includes expected payments associated with the deferred compensation plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan through fiscal 2037. (4) Includes FIN 48 tax liabilities. The Company is unable to determine when these open items will be resolved. For purposes of this table, the full FIN 48 liability has been included in payments due in 1-3 years. (5) Consists of standby letters of credit for guarantee of foreign subsidiary's borrowings, workers' compensation and general liability insurance.   46            Capital Expenditures             Gross capital expenditures totaled $90.0 million, before deducting lease incentives of $7.5 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. This compares to gross capital expenditures of $100.2 million, before deducting lease incentives of $11.0 million, for the year ended February 2, 2008. The Company's capital expenditures for the full fiscal year 2010 are planned at approximately $75.4 million (before deducting estimated lease incentives of approximately $5.4 million) primarily for retail store expansion in the U.S. and Canada, store remodeling programs, expansion in Europe and Asia, investments in information systems and enhancements in other infrastructure.            The Company evaluates strategic acquisitions and alliances and pursues those that we believe will support and contribute to our overall growth initiatives. The combined purchase price for Focus and Focus Spain was finalized in October 2007 in the amount of €19.4 million ($25.6 million) which included an initial payment of €10.0 million in cash, €2.0 in GUESS? common stock and €7.4 in final payments after resolving certain purchase price adjustments and other contingencies with the seller.            Effective January 16, 2008, the Company, through a subsidiary, acquired 100% of the capital stock of BARN for a purchase price of approximately €5.0 million ($7.4 million). The acquisition included inventory, trade receivables, payables, debt and certain long term assets used to operate the business including leasehold interests related to four GUESS Kids stores.     Credit Facilities             On September 19, 2006, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit facility led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders (the "Credit Facility"). The Credit Facility provides for an $85 million revolving multicurrency line of credit and is available for direct borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit, subject to certain letters of credit sub-limits. The Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on September 30, 2011. At January 31, 2009, the Company had $25.0 million in outstanding standby letters of credit, $12.4 million in outstanding documentary letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the terms of the Credit Facility.            The Company, through its European subsidiaries, maintains short-term borrowing agreements, primarily for working capital purposes, with various banks in Europe. Under these agreements, which are generally secured by specific accounts receivable balances, the Company can borrow up to $215.6 million, limited primarily by accounts receivable balances at the time of borrowing, except for one borrowing agreement which is partially secured by a $10.0 million standby letter of credit issued under the Company's Credit Facility. Based on the applicable accounts receivable balances at January 31, 2009 and the standby letter of credit, the Company could have borrowed up to approximately $201.4 million under these agreements. However, the Company's ability to borrow outside the Credit Facility through foreign subsidiaries is generally limited to $185.0 million under the terms of the Credit Facility. At January 31, 2009, the Company had $22.3 million of outstanding borrowings and $5.6 million in outstanding documentary letters of credit under these agreements. The agreements are primarily denominated in Euros, have no financial ratio covenants and provide for annual interest rates ranging from 1.9% to 6.1%. The maturities of the short-term borrowings are generally linked to the credit terms of the underlying accounts receivable that secure the borrowings.            The Company entered into a capital lease in December 2005 for a new building in Florence, Italy. This transaction resulted in a capital lease obligation of $16.3 million as of January 31, 2009. The Company entered into a separate interest rate swap agreement designated as a non-hedging instrument resulting in a swap fixed rate of 3.55%. This interest rate swap agreement matures in 2016 and converts the nature of the capital lease obligation from Euribor floating rate debt to fixed rate debt. The fair value of the interest rate swap liability as of January 31, 2009 was approximately $0.3 million.    47                   From time to time the Company will obtain other short term financing in foreign countries for working capital to finance its local operations.      Dividend Policy             During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share on the Company's common stock. Since that time, the Company has continued to pay a quarterly cash dividend which has subsequently increased to $0.10 per share.            In continuation of this practice, on March 17, 2009, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share on the Company's common stock. The dividend will be payable on April 17, 2009 to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 1, 2009.             The payment of cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based upon a number of business, legal and other considerations, including our cash flow from operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes, earnings, share repurchases and liquidity.     Share Repurchases             In March 2008, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the previously authorized 2001 share repurchase program and authorized the new 2008 Share Repurchase Program to repurchase, from time-to-time and as market and business conditions warrant, up to $200 million of the Company's common stock. Repurchases may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or other available means. There is no minimum or maximum number of shares to be repurchased under the program and the program may be discontinued at any time, without prior notice. During the year ended January 31, 2009, the Company purchased 2.9 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions at a cost of $60.5 million (at an average price of $21.23). At January 31, 2009, the Company had remaining authority under the 2008 Share Repurchase Program to purchase an additional $139.5 million of its common stock.     Other             On August 23, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") which became effective January 1, 2006. The SERP provides select employees who satisfy certain eligibility requirements with certain benefits upon retirement, termination of employment, death, disability or a change in control of the Company, in certain prescribed circumstances. The initial participants in the SERP are Maurice Marciano, Chairman of the Board, Paul Marciano, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman of the Board, and Carlos Alberini, President and Chief Operating Officer. As a non-qualified pension plan, no funding of the SERP is required; however, the Company expects to make annual payments into an insurance policy held in a rabbi trust to fund the expected obligations arising under the SERP. The cash surrender value of the insurance policy was $12.1 million and $13.3 million as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively, and is included in other assets. The amount of future payments may vary, depending on the future years of service, future annual compensation of the participants and investment performance of the trust.            In January 2002, the Company established a qualified employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP"), the terms of which allow for qualified employees (as defined) to participate in the purchase of designated shares of the Company's common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing price at the beginning or end of each quarterly stock purchase period. On January 23, 2002, the Company filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-8 registering 4,000,000 shares of common stock for the ESPP. During the year ended January 31, 2009, 67,917 shares of the Company's common stock were issued out of its treasury pursuant to the ESPP at an average price of $26.03 per share for a total of $1.8 million.    48            SEASONALITY             The Company's business is impacted by the general seasonal trends characteristic of the apparel and retail industries. U.S. retail operations are generally stronger from July through December, and U.S. wholesale operations generally experience stronger performance in July, August and September. The European operations are largely wholesale driven and operate with two primary selling seasons. Spring/Summer primarily ships in January, February and March and Fall/Winter primarily ships in July, August and September. The remaining months of the year are relatively small shipping months in Europe, primarily for reorders. The Company's goal is to reduce these seasonal effects in Europe by shipping product to customers more evenly throughout the year and benefit from reorders later in each season. Due to the seasonality of the business, the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year.      INFLATION             The Company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in the U.S. and Europe over the last three years have had a significant effect on net revenue or profitability. Although higher rates of inflation have been experienced in Asia where some of the Company's products are manufactured and sold, management does not believe that foreign rates of inflation have had a material adverse effect on the Company's net revenue or profitability.     IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS             In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 ("SFAS 157"), "Fair Value Measurement," which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS 157 are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 157-1 and FSP SFAS 157-2. FSP SFAS 157-1 amends SFAS 157 to exclude SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions. FSP SFAS 157-2 will delay the effective date of SFAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). FSP SFAS 157-2 partially defers the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of FSP SFAS 157-2. The Company adopted SFAS 157 effective February 3, 2008 for all financial assets and liabilities as required. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Measurements, of the Company's consolidated financial statements for additional information. The adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption FSP SFAS 157-2 on the Company's consolidated financial statements.            In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 ("SFAS 159"), "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," which permits entities to voluntarily choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 provides entities an opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings that is caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and was effective for the Company beginning on February 3, 2008. SFAS 159 allows the Company to elect the fair value option on an instrument by instrument basis. SFAS 159 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial condition as the Company did not elect to adopt the fair value option for any of its financial assets or liabilities.             In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007) ("SFAS 141R"), "Business Combinations," which replaces FASB Statement 141. SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS 141R also    49             modifies the recognition for preacquisition contingencies, such as environmental or legal issues, restructuring plans and acquired research and development value in purchase accounting. SFAS 141R amends SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," to require the acquirer to recognize changes in the amount of its deferred tax benefits that are recognizable because of a business combination either in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination or directly in contributed capital, depending on the circumstances. SFAS 141R also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective as of the beginning of the Company's 2010 fiscal year. The Company will apply SFAS 141R to any future business combinations completed after the effective date. The impact of the adoption of SFAS 141R will depend on the nature, terms and size of business combinations completed after the effective date.            In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 ("SFAS 160"), "Accounting for Noncontrolling Interests," which clarifies the classification of noncontrolling interests in consolidated statements of financial position and the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such noncontrolling interests. SFAS 160 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of SFAS 160 on the Company's consolidated financial statements.            In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161 ("SFAS 161"), "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which amends SFAS 133 and expands disclosures to include information about the fair value of derivatives, related credit risks and a company's strategies and objectives for using derivatives. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of SFAS 161 on its disclosures in the Company's consolidated financial statements.            In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3 ("FSP FAS 142-3"), "Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets," which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The intent of FSP FAS 142-3 is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement No. 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS 141R. FSP FAS 142-3 will be applied prospectively and is effective as of the beginning of the Company's 2010 fiscal year. Where applicable, the Company will apply FSP FAS 142-3 to future intangible assets acquired beginning in fiscal 2010.             In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. EITF 03-6-1 ("FSP EITF 03-6-1"), "Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities," which requires unvested share-payment awards that contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents to be included in the two-class method of computing earnings per share. FSP EITF 03-6-1 also requires retrospective application to all periods presented. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective as of the beginning of the Company's 2010 fiscal year. Prior periods will be restated to reflect this impact in future reporting periods. The Company expects that the adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1 will result in a reduction in diluted earnings per share of $0.03 for each of the years ended January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008.     NAME="do45001_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02650">         ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.          Exchange Rate Risk             Approximately half of product sales and licensing revenue recorded for the year ended January 31, 2009 were denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's primary exchange rate risk relates to operations in Canada, Europe and South Korea. Changes in currencies affect our earnings in various ways. For further discussion on currency related risk, please refer to our risk factors under "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors."    50        NAME="page_dq45001_1_51">                                                      Various transactions that occur in Canada, Europe and South Korea are denominated in U.S. dollars and thus are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to their local functional currencies. These types of transactions include U.S. denominated purchases of merchandise and intercompany liabilities. In addition, certain operating expenses are denominated in Swiss Francs and are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to the functional currency. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts and currency swaps, to manage exchange risk on certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. The Company does not hedge all transactions denominated in foreign currency.     Forward Contracts Designated as Cash Flow Hedges             During the year ended January 31, 2009, the Company purchased U.S. dollar forward contracts in Europe and Canada totaling US$36.0 million and US$52.9 million, respectively, to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases that were designated as cash flow hedges at January 31, 2009. During fiscal year 2009, the Company also purchased Swiss Franc/Euro forward contracts in Europe totaling CHF18.0 million to hedge forecasted operating expenses that were designated as cash flow hedges at January 31, 2009. As of January 31, 2009, the Company had forward contracts outstanding for its European and Canadian operations of US$21.0 million and US$38.5 million, respectively, that are expected to mature over the next nine months and Swiss Franc-Euro forward contracts outstanding for its European operations of CHF18.0 million that are expected to mature over the next 12 months. The Company's derivative financial instruments are recorded in its consolidated balance sheet at fair value based on quoted market rates. The U.S. dollar forward contracts are used to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases over specific months. Changes in the fair value of the U.S. dollar forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in cost of product sales in the period which approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold. The Swiss Franc forward contracts are used to hedge certain anticipated Swiss operating expenses over specific months. Changes in the fair value of the Swiss Franc forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in SG&A in the period which approximates the time the expenses are incurred.             As of January 31, 2009, accumulated other comprehensive income included an unrealized gain of approximately US$8.8 million, net of tax, that will be recognized as a reduction to cost of goods sold or SG&A over the following 13 months at the then current values on a pre-tax basis, which can be different than the current year-end values. At January 31, 2009, the unrealized net gain of the remaining open forward contracts recorded in current assets in the consolidated balance sheet was approximately US$8.1 million. The ineffective portion was immaterial during the year ended January 31, 2009 and was recorded in net earnings.             At February 2, 2008, the Company had Canadian dollar forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to purchase US$27.0 million with an unrealized gain recorded in the consolidated balance sheet of approximately US$0.1 million.            The following table summarizes net after-tax derivative activity recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (in thousands):                        Year Ended  Jan. 31, 2009      Year Ended  Feb. 2, 2008          Beginning balance (loss)     $  (1,475  )  $           Net gains (losses) from changes in cash flow hedges        9,093        (2,439  )      Net losses reclassified to income        1,145        964                             Ending balance gain (loss)     $  8,763     $  (1,475  )                          51            Foreign Currency Contracts Not Designated as Cash Flow Hedges             The Company also has foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expense. For the year ended January 31, 2009, the Company recorded a net gain of US$18.8 million for the Canadian dollar, Euro and Swiss Franc foreign currency contracts, which has been included in other income and expense. At January 31, 2009, the Company had Canadian dollar foreign currency contracts to purchase US$36.5 million expected to mature over the next nine months, Euro foreign currency contracts to purchase US$104.0 million expected to mature over the next 11 months and Swiss Franc foreign currency contracts to purchase CHF5.3 million expected to mature over the next 12 months. At January 31, 2009, the net unrealized gains of these Canadian dollar, Euro and Swiss Franc forward contracts recorded in current assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheet were approximately US$13.7 million.            At February 2, 2008, the Company had Canadian dollar and Euro currency exchange contracts not designated as cash flow hedges to purchase US$26.0 million and US$87.6 million, respectively. At February 2, 2008, the unrealized losses of these Canadian dollar and Euro forward contracts recorded in the balance sheet were approximately US$3.3 million, primarily relating to the Euro forward contracts.     Sensitivity Analysis             At January 31, 2009, a sensitivity analysis of changes in the foreign currencies when measured against the U.S. dollar indicates that, if the U.S. dollar had uniformly weakened by 10% against all of the U.S. dollar denominated foreign exchange derivatives totaling US$200.0 million, the fair value of the instruments would have decreased by US$22.2 million. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened by 10% against all of the U.S. dollar denominated foreign exchange derivatives, the fair value of these instruments would have increased by US$18.2 million. Any resulting changes in the fair value of the hedged instruments may be more than or partially offset by changes in the fair value of certain balance sheet positions (primarily U.S. dollar denominated liabilities in our foreign operations) impacted by the change in the foreign currency rate. The ability to reduce the exposure of currencies on earnings depends on the magnitude of the derivatives compared to the balance sheet positions during each reporting cycle.     Interest Rate Risk             At January 31, 2009, approximately 42% of the Company's indebtedness related to a capital lease obligation which is covered by a separate interest rate swap agreement with a swap fixed interest rate of 3.55% that matures in 2016. Changes in the related interest rate that result in an unrealized gain or loss on the fair value of the swap are reported in other income or expenses. The change in the unrealized fair value of the interest swap increased other expense, net by $0.8 million during fiscal year 2009. Substantially all of the Company's remaining indebtedness, principally consisting of short-term borrowings under the short-term European borrowing agreements, is at variable rates of interest. Accordingly, changes in interest rates would impact the Company's results of operations in future periods. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense for the year ended January 31, 2009 by approximately $0.6 million.            The fair value of the Company's debt instruments are based on the amount of future cash flows associated with each instrument discounted using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. At January 31, 2009, the carrying value of all financial instruments was not materially different from fair value, as the interest rate on the Company's debt approximates rates currently available to the Company.
