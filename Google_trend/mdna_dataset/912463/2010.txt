ITEM 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.          General             Unless the context indicates otherwise, when we refer to "we," "us" or the "Company" in this Form 10-K, we are referring to Guess?, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.     Business Segments             The Company's businesses are grouped into four reportable segments for management and internal financial reporting purposes: retail, wholesale, European and licensing. Information relating to these segments is summarized in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management evaluates segment performance based primarily on revenue and earnings from operations. The Company believes this segment reporting reflects how its business segments are managed and each segment's performance is evaluated. The retail segment includes the Company's retail operations in North America. The wholesale segment includes the wholesale operations in North America and our Asian operations. The European segment includes both wholesale and retail operations in Europe and the Middle East. The licensing segment includes the worldwide licensing operations of the Company. The segment operating results exclude corporate overhead costs, which consist of shared costs of the organization. These costs are presented separately and generally include, among other things, the following unallocated corporate costs: information technology, human resources, accounting and finance, global advertising and marketing, executive compensation, facilities and legal.            We acquired Focus Europe S.r.l. ("Focus"), our former licensee for GUESS by MARCIANO products in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, in December 2006, and its Spanish subsidiary ("Focus Spain") in October 2007. We also acquired BARN S.r.l. ("Barn"), our former kids licensee in Europe, in January 2008. Each of these entities is reported in our European segment. G by GUESS is a relatively new retail brand concept that was launched in early fiscal 2008 and is included in our retail segment. Our South Korea and China businesses, which we have operated directly since January 2007 and April 2007, respectively, are also relatively new businesses for us and are reported in our wholesale segment. Our international jewelry license agreement, which expired in December 2009, was not renewed as the Company decided to directly operate this business going forward. Beginning in January 2010, the operating results of our international jewelry business are included in our European segment. Prior to that date, we recorded the related royalty income in our licensing segment.     Products             We derive our net revenue from the sale of GUESS?, GUESS by MARCIANO and G by GUESS men's and women's apparel, and our licensees' products through our worldwide network of retail stores, wholesale customers and distributors, as well as our on-line sites. We also derive royalty revenues from worldwide licensing activities.     Recent Global Economic Developments             The state of the global economy negatively impacted our results in fiscal 2010. When economic conditions deteriorated in the latter part of 2008, we reacted quickly by adjusting our short-term goals to focus on protecting our liquidity, strong balance sheet position, and the integrity of our brands. As a result, we limited our store expansion in North America and managed both inventories and costs carefully. While we believe conditions have become more stable and predictable, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions may continue to have a negative effect on our business.            The deterioration in the global economic environment has also resulted in significant volatility in the global currency markets. Since the majority of our international operations are conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Korean won), currency    28              fluctuations can have a significant impact on the translation of our international revenues and earnings into U.S. dollar amounts. During the first half of fiscal 2010, the U.S. dollar strengthened against these three currencies versus the comparable prior year period, unfavorably impacting the translation of our international revenues and earnings during that period. However, in the second half of fiscal 2010, the U.S. dollar weakened against these currencies versus the comparable prior year period, positively impacting the translation of our international revenues and earnings during that period.            In addition, some of our transactions that occur in Europe, Canada and South Korea are denominated in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and British pounds exposing them to exchange rate fluctuations when converted to their local currencies. These transactions include U.S. dollar denominated purchases of merchandise, U.S. dollar and British pound intercompany liabilities and certain operating expenses denominated in Swiss francs. Fluctuations in exchange rates can impact the profitability of our foreign operations and reported earnings and are largely dependent on the transaction timing and magnitude during the period that the currency fluctuates. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exchange risk on certain foreign currency transactions. However, the Company does not hedge all transactions denominated in foreign currency.      Long-Term Growth Strategy             Despite the recent economic conditions, our key long-term strategies remain unchanged. Global expansion continues to be the cornerstone of our growth strategy. Our combined revenues outside of the U.S. and Canada currently represent approximately 45% of the total Company's revenues, compared to 21% in 2005. We expect this trend to continue as we expand both in Europe and Asia. Expanding our retail business across the globe is another important part of our growth strategy. We see opportunities to increase the number of GUESS? branded retail stores in Europe, as we expand outside of Italy, and also in North America, where we see opportunities particularly with our newer store concepts. We will continue to regularly evaluate and implement initiatives that we believe will build brand equity, grow our business and enhance profitability.            Our North American retail growth strategy is to increase retail sales and profitability by expanding our network of retail stores and improving the productivity and performance of existing stores. We will continue to emphasize our new G by GUESS store concept and our accessories business. This includes greater focus on our accessories line in our existing stores and the expansion of our GUESS? Accessories store concept. We plan to open 52 retail stores across all concepts in the U.S. and Canada during fiscal 2011.            In Europe, we will continue to focus on growing our business in the countries where our brand is well known but under penetrated. The Company is also planning to expand the number of directly operated GUESS? retail stores in Europe. We and our partners plan to continue our international expansion in Europe by opening 85 retail stores in fiscal 2011.            The Company's capital expenditures for the full fiscal year 2011 are planned at approximately $180 million (before deducting estimated lease incentives of approximately $10 million), which includes key money investments for new European stores. The planned capital expenditures are primarily for retail store expansion in the U.S. and Canada, store remodeling programs, expansion of our European retail business and infrastructure, investments in information systems, expansion of our Asian business, and other infrastructure improvements.      Other             The Company operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year calendar, which ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31 of each year. Fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 all included 52 weeks.    29                   The Company reports National Retail Federation ("NRF") calendar comparable store sales on a quarterly basis for our full-price retail and factory outlet stores in the U.S. and Canada. A store is considered comparable after it has been open for 13 full months. If a store remodel results in a square footage change of more than 15%, or involves a relocation or a change in store concept, the store is removed from the comparable store base until it has been opened at its new size, in its new location or under its new concept for 13 full months.     Executive Summary      The Company             Net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. was $242.8 million, or diluted earnings of $2.61 per common share, for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. of $213.6 million, or diluted earnings of $2.25 per common share, for the year ended January 31, 2009. The fiscal 2010 and 2009 results included the unfavorable impact of long-lived asset impairment charges of $4.7 million before taxes (or $0.03 per diluted share) and $24.4 million before taxes (or $0.16 per diluted share), respectively. The asset impairment charges reflected the write-down of the asset base for a number of our retail stores primarily as a result of adverse retail conditions arising from the deterioration in the global economic environment.            During the first quarter ended May 2, 2009, the Company adopted authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") which requires unvested share-payment awards that contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents to be included in the two-class method of computing earnings per share. The adoption negatively impacted diluted earnings per common share by approximately $0.03 per share for each of the years ended January 30, 2010, January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008. Refer to Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.            Total net revenue increased 1.7% to $2,128.5 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $2,093.4 million in the prior year. Despite the difficult economic environment, our European, retail and wholesale segments all increased revenues in the current year, while royalty revenues were lower in our licensing business. Currency translation fluctuations relating to all our foreign operations unfavorably impacted net revenue in fiscal 2010 by $47.0 million, driven mostly by the impact of fluctuations in the euro when translating revenues from our European segment.            Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total net revenues) increased slightly to 44.2% for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to 44.1% in the prior year. Overall, the higher product margins in our retail and wholesale segments were offset by occupancy deleverage in our European and retail segments as a result of a larger mix of European retail stores and negative comparable store sales.            Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses decreased 1.9% to $582.7 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $593.8 million in the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower asset impairment charges on our retail stores and lower marketing expenses as compared to the prior year. The Company also benefited from the favorable impact of the stronger dollar versus the prior year when translating SG&A expenses for our foreign operations into U.S. dollars. The decrease was partially offset by higher store selling expenses in Europe to support our retail expansion in Europe, as well as higher performance-based and other compensation related expenses. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues ("SG&A rate") improved by 100 basis points to 27.4% for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to the prior year. The net impact of the asset impairment charges in the current and prior fiscal year accounted for all of this improvement.            Earnings from operations increased 9.1% to $358.8 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $328.8 million in the prior year. Operating margin increased 120 basis points to 16.9% for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to 15.7% in the prior year due primarily to the lower SG&A rate.    30             Currency translation fluctuations relating to all our foreign operations unfavorably impacted earnings from operations by $7.8 million.             Other income, net, (including interest income and expense) totaled $3.1 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to other expense, net, of $10.0 million in the prior year. The net gain for the year ended January 30, 2010 included mark-to-market gains related to our insurance policy investments, partially offset by mark-to-market losses related to the revaluation of foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency transactions. Other expense, net, for the year ended January 31, 2009 primarily resulted from the decline in value of insurance policy investments and other non-operating assets.             Our effective income tax rate decreased 70 basis points to 31.9% for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to 32.6% in the prior year, primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.            The Company had $502.1 million in cash and cash equivalents as of January 30, 2010, up $208.0 million, compared to $294.1 million as of January 31, 2009. Total debt, including capital lease obligations, as of January 30, 2010 was $16.5 million, down $22.1 million from $38.6 million as of January 31, 2009. Accounts receivable increased by $27.3 million, or 10.4%, to $289.6 million at January 30, 2010, compared to $262.3 million at January 31, 2009. The accounts receivable balance at January 30, 2010 included a positive translation impact of approximately $18.9 million due to currency fluctuations compared to the prior year end. Inventory increased by $6.5 million, or 2.7%, to $246.2 million as of January 30, 2010, compared to $239.7 million as of January 31, 2009.     Retail             Our retail segment, comprising North American full-priced retail stores, factory outlet stores and e-commerce, generated net sales of $983.9 million during the year ended January 30, 2010, an increase of $5.9 million, or 0.6%, from $978.0 million in the prior year. The slight increase was driven by a larger store base, which represented a net 5.6% increase in average square footage compared to the year ended January 31, 2009, partially offset by a decline in comparable store sales of 4.5%, which included an unfavorable translation impact of currency fluctuations for our Canadian retail stores compared to the prior year. Retail earnings from operations increased by $39.1 million, or 42.0%, to $132.3 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $93.2 million in the prior year. In addition, the operating margin increased by 390 basis points to 13.4% for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to 9.5% for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase in both earnings from operations and operating margin was driven by lower asset impairment charges, improved product margins, and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher occupancy costs. The lower asset impairment charges in the retail segment of $3.7 million during the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $23.3 million during the year ended January 31, 2009, favorably impacted operating margin by 200 basis points.            In the year, we opened 18 new stores in the U.S. and Canada and closed 11 stores. At January 30, 2010, we operated 432 stores in the U.S. and Canada, comprised of 191 full-priced GUESS? retail stores, 107 GUESS? factory outlet stores, 52 GUESS by MARCIANO stores, 44 G by GUESS stores and 38 GUESS? Accessories stores. This compares to 425 stores as of January 31, 2009.      Wholesale             Wholesale segment revenue increased by $3.8 million, or 1.3%, to $300.0 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $296.2 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by higher sales in our Asian business, partially offset by lower sales in our North American wholesale business. Wholesale earnings from operations increased by $5.5 million, or 12.1%, to $51.0 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $45.5 million in the prior year. Operating margin increased by 160 basis points to 17.0% for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to 15.4% for the year ended January 31,    31             2009. The operating margin expansion was primarily driven by product margin improvements and SG&A expense leverage in Asia compared to the prior year.     Europe             In Europe, revenues increased by $28.2 million, or 3.9%, to $747.2 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $719.0 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales in the retail business and sales from our new international jewelry business, partially offset by the unfavorable translation impact to revenues due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At January 30, 2010, we directly operated 84 stores in Europe compared to 61 stores at January 31, 2009. Earnings from operations from our European segment increased by $4.6 million, or 2.7%, to $173.2 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $168.6 million in the prior year. Operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 23.2% for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to 23.5% for the prior year. The decline resulted from higher occupancy costs, given our retail expansion in the region, mostly offset by a lower SG&A rate.      Licensing             Our licensing royalty revenues decreased by $2.9 million, or 2.9%, to $97.4 million, compared to $100.3 million in the prior year. Earnings from operations for the year ended January 30, 2010, were essentially flat at $86.6 million, compared to $86.4 million in the prior year.     Corporate Overhead             Corporate overhead expenses increased by $19.4 million, or 29.9%, to $84.3 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $64.9 million in the same prior year period. The increase was driven by higher performance-based and other compensation related expenses, and higher professional fees, partially offset by lower brand marketing expenses.     Global Store Count             In the year, together with our partners, we opened 161 new stores worldwide, including 90 stores in Europe and the Middle East, 45 stores in Asia, 18 stores in the U.S. and Canada and 8 stores in Central and South America. Together with our partners we closed 63 stores worldwide, including 22 stores in Europe and the Middle East, 29 stores in Asia, 11 stores in the U.S. and Canada and 1 store in Central and South America.            We ended fiscal 2010 with 1,210 stores worldwide, comprised as follows:                                 Region          Total Stores      Directly  Operated Stores      Licensee Stores          United States and Canada        432        432                 Europe and the Middle East        388        84        304         Asia        335        28        307         Other        55        13        42                                   Total        1,210        557        653                                               These stores exclude 229 concessions operated by us and our partners located primarily in South Korea and Greater China because of their smaller store size in relation to our standard international store size. Of the 778 stores located outside of the U.S. and Canada, 557 were GUESS? stores, 176 were GUESS? Accessories stores and 45 were GUESS by MARCIANO stores.    32            Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates             The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the valuation of inventories, accounts receivable allowances, sales return allowances, loyalty accrual, the useful life of assets for depreciation, restructuring expense and accruals, evaluation of impairment, recoverability of deferred taxes, workers compensation accruals, litigation accruals, pension obligations and stock-based compensation.            The Company believes that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. In addition to the accounting policies mentioned below, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for other significant accounting policies.       Accounts receivable reserves               In the normal course of business, the Company grants credit directly to certain wholesale customers after a credit analysis is performed based on financial and other criteria. Accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the inability of its wholesale customers to make their required payments. The Company bases its allowances on analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements, assessments of historical collection trends, an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions and whether the Company has obtained credit insurance or other guarantees.            Costs associated with customer markdowns are recorded as a reduction to revenues, and are included in the allowance for accounts receivable. Historically, these markdown allowances resulted from seasonal negotiations with the Company's wholesale customers, as well as historical trends and the evaluation of the impact of economic conditions. During fiscal 2008, the Company renegotiated its arrangements with its major customers in the U.S. to fix the percentage of sales that will be expensed as markdown allowances. The negotiation of a fixed rate allows the Company to process credit memos against the outstanding balance immediately which has resulted in a reduction of our outstanding markdown allowance accrual.       Sales returns reserves               The Company accrues for estimated sales returns in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. To recognize the financial impact of sales returns, the Company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned based on historical experience and reduces sales and cost of sales accordingly based on historical return experience. The Company's policy allows retail customers a 30 day period to return merchandise following the date of sale. Substantially all of these returns are considered to be resalable at a price that exceeds the cost of the merchandise.       Inventory reserves               Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (weighted average method) or market. The Company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving product as well as prior seasons' inventory. Market value of aged inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for each product line category, the impact of market trends, an evaluation of economic conditions and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory. The Company closely monitors its off-price sales to ensure the actual results closely match initial estimates. Estimates are regularly updated based upon this continuing review.    33              Valuation of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets               The Company assesses the impairment of its long-lived assets (i.e., goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment), which requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. An asset is considered to be impaired if the Company determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon its assessment of the asset's ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods or if significant changes in the Company's strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets occurred. If the assets (other than goodwill) are assessed to be recoverable, they are depreciated or amortized over the periods benefited. If the assets are considered to be impaired, an impairment charge is recognized representing the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of those assets. Fair value is determined based upon the discounted cash flows derived from the underlying asset. We use various assumptions in determining current fair market value of these assets, including future expected cash flows and discount rates. Future expected cash flows for store assets are based on management's estimates of future cash flows over the remaining lease period or expected life, if shorter. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations. See Notes 1 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.       Pension benefit plan actuarial assumptions               The Company's pension obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, within the authoritative guidance framework. The discount rate is an important element of expense and/or liability measurement. We evaluate this critical assumption annually which enables us to state expected future payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan related information.       Litigation reserves               Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the expected favorable or unfavorable outcome of each claim. As additional information becomes available, the Company assesses the potential liability related to new claims and existing claims and revises estimates as appropriate. As new claims arise, such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position.       Share-based compensation               Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of authoritative guidance using the modified prospective transition method. Under this method, compensation cost recognized after January 1, 2006 includes: (a) compensation expense for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value and (b) compensation expense for all share-based payments granted on or after January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with authoritative guidance. The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for new grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time of grant. The expected volatility is determined based on an average of both historical volatility and implied volatility. Implied volatility is derived from exchange traded options on the Company's common stock. The expected life used prior to November 2007 was based on the "simplified" method described in authoritative guidance. For options granted beginning November 2007, the expected term is determined based on historical trends. The    34           dividend yield for 2006 and prior years was assumed to be zero since the Company had not historically declared and did not have a plan to declare dividends on an ongoing basis until the Board of Directors authorized and approved the initiation of quarterly dividends in February 2007. The expected dividend yield starting from 2007 is based on the Company's history and expectations of dividend payouts. The expected forfeiture rate is determined based on historical data. Compensation expense for new stock options and nonvested stock awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.            In addition, the Company grants certain nonvested stock awards and stock options that require the recipient to achieve certain minimum performance targets in order for these awards to vest. If the minimum performance targets have not been achieved or are not expected to be achieved, no expense is recorded during the period.       Income taxes               The Company adopted authoritative guidance in January 2007, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Guidance was also provided on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations. The Company's continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.            Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized. As all earnings from the Company's foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed, the Company's income tax provision does not include additional U.S. taxes on foreign operations.       Hedge accounting               The Company operates in foreign countries, which exposes it to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company has entered into certain forward contracts to hedge the risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations. The Company has elected to apply the hedge accounting rules in accordance with authoritative guidance for certain of these hedges. The Company's objective is to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flows due to the foreign currency risk associated with certain anticipated inventory purchases, intercompany royalties and other expenses on a first dollar basis for specific months. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in cost of product sales, SG&A or other income and expenses in the period which approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold or the hedged operating expense and hedged intercompany royalty is incurred.             The Company also has foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expenses.    35        NAME="page_do10101_1_36">                                               Gift card breakage               Gift card breakage is income recognized due to the non-redemption of a portion of gift cards sold by the Company for which a liability was recorded in prior periods. Beginning with the quarter ended August 4, 2007, these estimated breakage amounts are accounted for under the redemption recognition method and are classified as additional net revenues as the gift cards are redeemed. The Company determined a gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns, which represented the cumulative estimated amount of gift card breakage from the inception of the electronic gift card program in late 2002.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS              The following table sets forth actual operating results for the fiscal years ended January 30, 2010, January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008 as a percentage of net revenue:                                        Year Ended              Jan. 30,  2010      Jan. 31,  2009      Feb. 2,  2008          Product sales        95.4  %     95.2  %     94.8  %      Net royalties        4.6        4.8        5.2                                      Total net revenue        100.0        100.0        100.0         Cost of product sales        55.8        55.9        54.7                                   Gross profit        44.2        44.1        45.3         Selling, general and administrative expenses        27.2        27.2        27.6         Asset impairment charges        0.2        1.2                                              Earnings from operations        16.9        15.7        17.7         Interest expense        (0.1  )     (0.2  )     (0.2  )      Interest income        0.1        0.3        0.4         Other income (expense), net        0.1        (0.6  )     (0.1  )                                   Earnings before income taxes        17.0        15.2        17.8         Income taxes        5.4        5.0        7.1                                      Net earnings        11.6        10.2        10.7         Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests        0.2                0.0                                      Net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc.         11.4  %     10.2  %     10.7  %                                     Year Ended January 30, 2010 Compared to Year Ended January 31, 2009       NET REVENUE.     Net revenue for the year ended January 30, 2010 increased by $35.1 million, or 1.7%, to $2,128.5 million, from $2,093.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. Our European, retail and wholesale segments all increased revenues in the current year, while royalty revenues in our licensing business declined. Currency translation fluctuations relating to all our foreign operations unfavorably impacted net revenue by $47.0 million compared to the prior year.            Net revenue from retail operations increased by $5.9 million, or 0.6%, to $983.9 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $978.0 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The slight increase was driven by an average of 26 net additional stores during the year ended January 30, 2010, resulting in a net 5.6% increase in average square footage compared to the prior year. This growth was partially offset by a decline in comparable stores sales of 4.5%. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our Canadian retail stores unfavorably impacted net revenue in our retail segment by $4.2 million.    36                   Net revenue from wholesale operations increased by $3.8 million, or 1.3%, to $300.0 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $296.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase was driven by growth in our Asian business, with revenue increases in both South Korea and Greater China. The increase in Asia was partially offset by lower North American wholesale sales. Our U.S. wholesale business continued to be impacted by the economic downturn as department stores continued to manage their inventories tightly. Our products were sold in the U.S. in approximately 947 doors at the end of the year compared to approximately 1,057 doors at the end of the prior year. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our South Korean and Canadian operations unfavorably impacted net revenue in our wholesale segment by $9.7 million.             Net revenue from European operations increased by $28.2 million, or 3.9%, to $747.2 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $719.0 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase was driven primarily by our retail business in Europe. Wholesale revenues in Europe increased slightly, resulting from the addition of our new international jewelry business, which before January 2010, was operated as a licensed business. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our European operations unfavorably impacted net revenue by $29.5 million. At January 30, 2010, we directly operated 84 stores in Europe compared to 61 stores at the prior year end.             Net royalty revenue from licensing operations decreased by $2.9 million, or 2.9%, to $97.4 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $100.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. This decrease was driven primarily by lower royalties resulting from lower watch product sales.      GROSS PROFIT.     Gross profit increased by $18.9 million, or 2.0%, to $941.5 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $922.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. This increase was primarily driven by our retail, wholesale and European segments as follows:       Gross profit for the retail segment increased due to higher product margins resulting primarily from fewer markdowns and less promotional activity. These improvements were partially offset by higher occupancy costs and the unfavorable translation impact of currency fluctuations.       Gross profit for the wholesale segment increased due to higher sales in Asia and improved product margins in both our Asian and North American wholesale businesses. These were partially offset by a decline in sales in our North American wholesale business and an unfavorable currency translation impact.      Gross profit for the European segment increased as a result of higher sales in our European retail business and from our international jewelry business. These improvements were partially offset by higher occupancy costs due to our retail expansion in Europe and the unfavorable translation impact of currency fluctuations.             Gross margin increased slightly by 10 basis points to 44.2% for the year ended January 30, 2010, from 44.1% for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase was attributable to higher product margins in our retail and wholesale segments, offset by occupancy deleverage in our European and retail segments as a result of a larger mix of European retail stores and negative comparable store sales.            The Company's gross margin may not be comparable to other entities since some entities include all of the costs related to their distribution in cost of product sales and others, like the Company, exclude the wholesale related distribution costs from gross margin, including them instead in selling, general and administrative expenses.      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.     SG&A expenses decreased by $11.1 million, or 1.9%, to $582.7 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $593.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The decrease was driven by lower asset impairment charges related to our retail stores of $4.7 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $24.4 million of impairment charges for the year ended January 31, 2009. The decrease was also driven by lower marketing expenses as    37             compared to the prior year and the favorable impact of the stronger dollar versus the prior year when translating SG&A expenses for our foreign operations into U.S. dollars. The decrease was partially offset by higher store selling expenses, due to our retail expansion in Europe, as well as higher performance-based and other compensation related costs.             The SG&A rate improved by 100 basis points to 27.4% for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to 28.4% in the prior year. The net impact of the asset impairment charges in the current and prior fiscal year accounted for all this improvement.      EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS.     Earnings from operations increased by $30.0 million, or 9.1%, to $358.8 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $328.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase in earnings from operations primarily resulted from the following:       Earnings from operations for the retail segment increased by $39.1 million to $132.3 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $93.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase in earnings from operations was driven by higher gross profit, lower asset impairment charges, and lower operating and marketing expenses.       Earnings from operations for the wholesale segment increased by $5.5 million to $51.0 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $45.5 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase in earnings from operations was mainly driven by sales growth in Asia and lower operating and marketing expenses in North America. This was partially offset by lower sales volume in the North American wholesale business and the unfavorable translation impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on the South Korean business. The currency translation fluctuations, related to both our South Korean and Canadian operations, unfavorably impacted earnings from operations in our wholesale segment by $1.2 million.       Earnings from operations for the European segment increased $4.6 million to $173.2 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $168.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase was due primarily to sales growth in our retail business and lower marketing expenses, partially offset by higher store selling expenses to support the expansion of our retail business in the region. The currency translation fluctuations unfavorably impacted earnings from operations by $5.9 million.       Earnings from operations for the licensing segment increased by $0.2 million to $86.6 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $86.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase was the result of lower marketing expenses, partially offset by lower royalty revenues.       Unallocated corporate overhead increased by $19.4 million to $84.3 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $64.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher performance-based and other compensation related costs, and higher professional fees, partially offset by lower brand marketing expenses.             Operating margin improved 120 basis points to 16.9% for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to 15.7% for the year ended January 31, 2009, primarily as a result of the lower SG&A rate.      INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME.     Interest expense decreased to $2.2 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $4.7 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. The decrease was due to a combination of lower average debt balances in Europe and lower average interest rates on the debt. Total debt at January 30, 2010 was $16.5 million, and was primarily related to our capital lease in Europe. The average debt balance for the year ended January 30, 2010, was $42.5 million, versus an average debt balance of $59.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. Interest income decreased to $1.7 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $6.1 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, due to lower interest rates on invested cash, partially offset by higher average invested cash balances.    38             OTHER INCOME OR EXPENSE, NET.     Other income, net, was $3.6 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to other expense, net, of $11.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. Other income, net, in the year ended January 30, 2010, primarily consisted of mark-to-market gains on insurance policy investments, partially offset by net mark-to-market losses on the revaluation of foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency transactions. Other expense, net, for the year ended January 31, 2009 primarily resulted from the decline in value of insurance policy investments and other non-operating assets.      INCOME TAXES.     Income tax expense for the year ended January 30, 2010 was $115.6 million, or a 31.9% effective tax rate, compared to income tax expense of $103.8 million, or a 32.6% effective tax rate, for the year ended January 31, 2009. The lower tax rate in the current year was due to a higher proportion of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.      NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS.     Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended January 30, 2010 was $3.6 million, net of taxes, as compared to $1.5 million, net of taxes, for the year ended January 31, 2009. The increase was due to higher earnings from our Focus and Mexico operations.      NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GUESS?, INC.     Net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. increased by $29.2 million, or 13.7%, to $242.8 million for the year ended January 30, 2010, from $213.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2009. Diluted earnings per common share increased to $2.61 per share for the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $2.25 per share for the year ended January 31, 2009.     Year Ended January 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended February 2, 2008       NET REVENUE.     Net revenue for the year ended January 31, 2009 increased by $343.5 million, or 19.6%, to $2,093.4 million, from $1,749.9 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. All segments contributed to this revenue growth with double-digit percentage increases. The largest contribution to this revenue growth was generated by our European segment.            Net revenue from retail operations increased by $115.6 million, or 13.4%, to $978.0 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $862.4 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. The increase was driven by an average of 55 net additional stores during the year ended January 31, 2009, resulting in a 12.8% increase in average square footage compared to the prior year, and an increase in comparable store sales of 1.0% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our Canadian retail stores unfavorably impacted revenues by $9.0 million.            Net revenue from wholesale operations increased by $37.8 million, or 14.6%, to $296.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $258.4 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. The revenue growth was generated from our expanding Asian operations, primarily in South Korea and Greater China. During fiscal year 2009, the Company, along with its partners, opened 20 stores and 31 concessions in Greater China and 10 stores and 29 concessions in South Korea. Our U.S. wholesale products were sold in approximately 1,057 major doors as of January 31, 2009, compared to 1,006 major doors at the end of the prior year period. Currency translation fluctuations, relating to both our Canadian and South Korean operations, unfavorably impacted net revenue in our wholesale segment by $16.3 million.            Net revenue from European operations increased by $180.6 million, or 33.5%, to $719.0 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $538.4 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. All of our wholesale businesses in Europe contributed to this growth, including BARN, which we acquired in January 2008. The growth was also attributable to same store sales growth in our existing retail stores and the addition of new retail stores, increasing our directly operated store count to 61 stores at January 31, 2009 from 40 stores at February 2, 2008. Currency translation fluctuations accounted for $34.7 million of the increase in net revenue relating to our European operations.    39                    Net royalty revenue from licensing operations increased by $9.6 million, or 10.5%, to $100.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $90.7 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. The increase was the result of the strength of the accessories business, particularly watches, jewelry, footwear, eyewear and handbags. Licensing revenues in fiscal 2009 did not include any royalty revenue from our BARN business which we began operating directly as part of our European operations in January 2008.      GROSS PROFIT.     Gross profit increased by $129.8 million, or 16.4%, to $922.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $792.8 million for the prior period. Most of the increase was driven by the European, retail and licensing segments as follows:       Gross profit for the European operations increased due to higher sales volume in the existing European wholesale and retail operations, higher wholesale product margins and the impact of the acquisitions of BARN in January 2008 and Focus Spain in October 2007.       Gross profit for the retail segment increased due to higher unit sales volume driven by the expansion in our store count during the year and an increase in comparable store sales of 1.0% compared to the prior year. The increase in retail gross profit also includes the unfavorable impact of higher occupancy costs due to the store expansion and lower product margins.       Gross profit for the licensing segment increased as a result of higher sales by our licensees of accessory and footwear products.             Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of total net revenues) decreased 120 basis points to 44.1% for the year ended January 31, 2009, from 45.3% for the year ended February 2, 2008. The decline in the overall gross margin was attributable to lower product margins in our retail and wholesale segments, partially offset by higher product margins in Europe and a higher mix of European net revenues, which generated a relatively higher gross margin than the other segments.            The Company's gross margin may not be comparable to other entities since some entities include all of the costs related to their distribution in cost of product sales and others, like the Company, exclude the wholesale related distribution costs from gross margin, including them instead in selling, general and administrative expenses.      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.     SG&A expenses increased by $110.2 million, or 22.8%, to $593.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $483.6 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. About $46.1 million of the increase was attributable to higher store selling, merchandising and distribution costs due to the higher sales volumes. Approximately $36.1 million of the increase was attributable to spending to support newer businesses, including BARN, Focus Spain, our G by GUESS brand, and Greater China, as well as spending to support the continued build-out of our European headquarters in Lugano, Switzerland. In addition, approximately $24.4 million of asset impairment charges were recorded during fiscal year 2009 compared to $0.6 million in the prior year.            As a percentage of net revenues, SG&A expense increased to 28.4% for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to 27.6% for prior year period, driven by additional spending for infrastructure and new businesses in Europe and the asset impairment charges, partially offset by expense leverage in our wholesale segment and in our corporate overhead.      EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS.     Earnings from operations increased by $19.7 million, or 6.4%, to $328.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to earnings from operations of $309.1 million for the year ended February 2, 2008.        Earnings from operations for the retail segment were $93.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to earnings from operations of $128.5 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. The decrease was driven by the store impairment charges of $23.3 million and the impact of lower product margins. This was partially offset by higher sales and the resulting gross profit due to the    40              larger store base, and lower advertising and marketing costs. Currency translation fluctuations relating to our Canadian retail stores unfavorably impacted earnings from operations by $1.7 million.        Earnings from operations for the wholesale segment were $45.5 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to earnings from operations of $49.9 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. While segment revenues increased, the decrease in earnings from operations was driven by lower segment product margins and higher occupancy and SG&A expenses to support our expanding Asian operations. Currency translation fluctuations, relating to both our Canadian and South Korean operations, unfavorably impacted earnings from operations in our wholesale segment by $2.5 million.       Earnings from operations for the European segment were $168.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to $120.8 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. The increase was primarily due to the higher sales and gross profit resulting from growth in our existing European wholesale businesses, and our acquisition of BARN. This increase was partially offset by higher volume related operating costs and infrastructure spending, along with higher advertising and marketing costs. Currency translation fluctuations favorably impacted earnings from operations in our European segment by $9.7 million.       Earnings from operations for the licensing segment were $86.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to $77.9 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. The increase was the result of higher revenues generated by our product licensees. This increase was partially offset by the loss of royalty revenue from BARN, our kids product licensee, which we acquired and now report as part of our European operations.       Unallocated corporate overhead, included in SG&A, was $64.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to $68.0 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, mainly due to lower compensation related costs.             The lower gross margin and higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues resulted in a decrease in operating margin of 200 basis points to 15.7% for the year ended January 31, 2009 from 17.7% for the prior year period.      INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME.     Interest expense increased to $4.7 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, compared to $3.4 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, primarily due to higher average debt balances in Europe to support working capital growth. On a comparable basis, the average debt balance for the year ended January 31, 2009 was $59.2 million versus an average debt balance of $48.6 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. Interest income decreased to $6.1 million for the year ended January 31, 2009 compared to $7.5 million for the year ended February 2, 2008, due to lower interest rates on invested cash, partially offset by higher average invested cash balances.      OTHER EXPENSE, NET.     Other expense was $11.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, versus other expense of $1.8 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. Other expense for the year ended January 31, 2009 primarily resulted from the decline in value of insurance policy investments and other non-operating assets. For the year ended January 31, 2009, other expense included a net charge of $0.3 million relating to changes in foreign exchange rates on foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency transactions. The forward contracts are used to hedge currency exposure primarily relating to U.S. dollar transactions in our foreign operations in the event of a strengthening U.S. dollar. The impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on the forward contracts during the year ended January 31, 2009 resulted in a mark-to-market gain of $18.8 million. This gain was primarily offset by the unfavorable revaluation of U.S. dollar denominated liabilities in our foreign operations of $18.5 million during the same period.    41             INCOME TAXES.     Income tax expense for the year ended January 31, 2009 was $103.8 million, resulting in a 32.6% effective tax rate, compared to income tax expense for the prior year of $124.1 million, or a 39.8% effective tax rate. The lower tax rate in fiscal year 2009 was due to a higher mix of profits in lower tax jurisdictions and a decline in the Italian statutory tax rate at the end of fiscal 2008 that resulted in a devaluation of our Italian deferred tax assets at the end of fiscal year 2008.      NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS.     Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended January 31, 2009 was $1.5 million, net of taxes, as compared to $0.9 million, net of taxes, for the year ended February 2, 2008. The increase was primarily due to the stronger performance of Focus and our Mexican operations.      NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GUESS?, INC.     Net earnings attributable to Guess?, Inc. increased by $27.1 million, or 14.5%, to $213.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2009, from $186.5 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. Diluted earnings per common share increased to $2.25 per share for the year ended January 31, 2009 compared to $1.96 per share for the year ended February 2, 2008.     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES             We need liquidity primarily to fund our working capital, the expansion and remodeling of our retail stores, shop-in-shop programs, concessions, systems, infrastructure, other existing operations, international growth, potential acquisitions, potential share repurchases and payment of dividends to our stockholders. During the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010, the Company relied on trade credit, available cash, short-term borrowings from our European bank facilities, real estate leases, and internally generated funds to finance our operations and expansion. The Company anticipates that we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements during the next twelve months for working capital, capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on our debt, potential acquisitions, potential share repurchases and dividend payments to stockholders, primarily with cash flow from operations supplemented by borrowings, if necessary, under the Credit Facility and bank facilities in Europe, as described below under "Credit Facilities." As of January 30, 2010, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $502.1 million. Excess cash and cash equivalents, which represent the majority of our outstanding cash and cash equivalents balance, are held primarily in four diversified money market funds. The funds are all AAA rated by national credit rating agencies and are generally comprised of high-quality, liquid investments. As of January 30, 2010, we do not have any exposure to auction-rate security investments in these funds. Please see "ITEM 1A Risk Factors" for a discussion of risk factors which could reasonably be likely to result in a decrease of internally generated funds available to finance capital expenditures and working capital requirements.            The Company has presented below the cash flow performance comparison of the year ended January 30, 2010, versus the year ended January 31, 2009.     Operating Activities             Net cash provided by operating activities was $358.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $228.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009, or an improvement of $129.6 million. The increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of working capital changes on operating cash flows as a result of the lower growth in accounts receivable and inventory during the year ended January 30, 2010, compared to the growth in the comparable prior year period. This was primarily driven by our European operations where we experienced a slower rate of growth relative to the prior year as a result of the global economic conditions. The increase is also attributable to higher growth in accrued liabilities during the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010, compared to the decline of accrued liabilities in the comparable prior year period. In addition, net earnings increased from $215.0 million for fiscal 2009 to $246.3 million for fiscal 2010.    42                   At January 30, 2010, the Company had working capital (including cash and cash equivalents) of $781.4 million compared to $558.3 million at January 31, 2009. The Company's primary working capital needs are for inventory and accounts receivable. Accounts receivable at January 30, 2010 amounted to $289.6 million, up $27.3 million, compared to $262.3 million at January 31, 2009. The accounts receivable balance at January 30, 2010 included a positive translation impact of approximately $18.9 million due to currency fluctuations compared to January 31, 2009. Approximately $133.9 million of our receivables, or 46.2% of the $289.6 million in accounts receivable at January 30, 2010, were insured for collection purposes or subject to certain bank guarantees or letters of credit. Inventory at January 30, 2010 amounted to $246.2 million compared to $239.7 million at January 31, 2009.     Investing Activities             Net cash used in investing activities was $90.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $102.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009. Cash used in investing activities related primarily to capital expenditures incurred on new store openings and existing store remodeling programs in the U.S. and Canada, expansion of our European retail business and infrastructure, expansion of our Asian business, improvements to headquarter buildings, investments in information systems and other enhancements.            The lower level of spending on new stores and remodeling of existing stores in the U.S. and Canada during the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010 was the main driver of the lower cash used in investing activities compared to the prior year, partially offset by improvements to our infrastructure in the current year. During the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010, the Company opened 18 new owned stores in the U.S. and Canada, 17 owned stores in Europe, 6 owned stores in Asia and 2 owned stores in Mexico, compared to 57 new owned stores in the U.S. and Canada, 20 owned stores in Europe, 10 owned stores in Asia and 4 owned stores in Mexico that were opened in the prior year.     Financing Activities             Net cash used in financing activities was $61.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010, compared to $99.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher repurchases of shares of the Company's common stock under the 2008 Share Repurchase Program during fiscal 2009, partially offset by repayments of borrowings and higher dividends during fiscal 2010.    43        NAME="page_dq10101_1_44">                                                Contractual Obligations and Commitments             The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations at January 30, 2010 and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands):                                              Payments due by period              Total      Less than  1 year      1-3  years      3-5  years      More than  5 years          Contractual Obligations:                                                      Short-term borrowings     $  738     $  738     $       $       $           Capital lease obligations(1)        18,612        2,280        4,538        4,440        7,354         Operating lease obligations(2)        995,676        147,280        269,838        237,701        340,857         Purchase obligations(3)        147,476        147,476                                 Benefit obligations(4)        98,548        1,191        1,766        2,146        93,445                                                  Total     $  1,261,050     $  298,965     $  276,142     $  244,287     $  441,656                                               Other commercial commitments(5)     $  12,450     $  12,450     $       $       $                                                          (1) Includes interest on capital lease obligations. (2) Does not include insurance, taxes and common area maintenance charges. In fiscal 2010, these variable charges totaled $44.5 million. (3) Purchase obligations represent open purchase orders for merchandise at the end of the fiscal year. These purchase orders can be impacted by various factors, including the scheduling of market weeks, the timing of issuing orders, the timing of the shipment of orders and currency fluctuations. Accordingly, a comparison of purchase orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful. (4) Includes expected payments associated with the deferred compensation plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan through fiscal 2037. (5) Consists of standby letters of credit for guarantee of foreign subsidiary's borrowings, workers' compensation and general liability insurance.            Excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $14.5 million. This liability for unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded because the Company cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever.     Dividend Policy             During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share of the Company's common stock. Since that time, the Company has continued to pay a quarterly cash dividend, which has subsequently increased to $0.16 per common share.             In continuation of this practice, on March 17, 2010, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share of the Company's common stock. The dividend will be payable on April 16, 2010 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 31, 2010.            The payment of cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based on a number of business, legal and other considerations, including our cash flow from operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes, earnings, share repurchases and liquidity.    44            Capital Expenditures             Gross capital expenditures totaled $82.3 million, before deducting lease incentives of $5.4 million, for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010. This compares to gross capital expenditures of $90.0 million, before deducting lease incentives of $7.5 million, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009. The Company's capital expenditures for the full fiscal year 2011 are planned at approximately $180 million (before deducting estimated lease incentives of approximately $10 million), which includes key money investments for new European stores. The planned capital expenditures are primarily for retail store expansion in the U.S. and Canada, store remodeling programs, expansion of our European retail business and infrastructure, investments in information systems, expansion of our Asian business, and other infrastructure improvements.            In addition, we periodically evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances and pursue those that we believe will support and contribute to our overall growth initiatives.     Credit Facilities             On September 19, 2006, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit facility led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders (the "Credit Facility"). The Credit Facility provides for an $85 million revolving multicurrency line of credit and is available for direct borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit, subject to certain letters of credit sublimits. The Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on September 30, 2011. At January 30, 2010, the Company had $12.5 million in outstanding standby letters of credit, no outstanding documentary letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the terms of the Credit Facility.            The Company, through its European subsidiaries, maintains short-term borrowing agreements, primarily for working capital purposes, with various banks in Europe. Under these agreements, which are generally secured by specific accounts receivable balances, the Company can borrow up to $228.0 million, limited primarily by accounts receivable balances at the time of borrowing. Based on the applicable accounts receivable balances at January 30, 2010, the Company could have borrowed up to approximately $211.7 million under these agreements. However, the Company's ability to borrow through foreign subsidiaries is generally limited to $185.0 million under the terms of the Credit Facility. Under these credit agreements the Company had no outstanding borrowings and $4.1 million in outstanding documentary letters of credit as of January 30, 2010. The agreements are primarily denominated in euros and provide for annual interest rates ranging from 0.7% to 3.5%. The maturities of the short-term borrowings are generally linked to the credit terms of the underlying accounts receivable that secure the borrowings. With the exception of one facility for $20.8 million that has a minimum net equity requirement, there are no other financial ratio covenants.            The Company entered into a capital lease in December 2005 for a new building in Florence, Italy. At January 30, 2010, the capital lease obligation was $15.8 million. The Company entered into a separate interest rate swap agreement designated as a non-hedging instrument that resulted in a swap fixed rate of 3.55%. This interest rate swap agreement matures in 2016 and converts the nature of the capital lease obligation from Euribor floating rate debt to fixed rate debt. The fair value of the interest rate swap liability at January 30, 2010 was approximately $0.8 million.            From time-to-time the Company will obtain other short term financing in foreign countries for working capital to finance its local operations.     Share Repurchases             In March 2008, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the previously authorized 2001 share repurchase program and authorized a new program to repurchase, from time-to-time and as market and    45             business conditions warrant, up to $200 million of the Company's common stock (the "2008 Share Repurchase Program"). Repurchases may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or other available means. There is no minimum or maximum number of shares to be repurchased under the program and the program may be discontinued at any time, without prior notice. During the year ended January 30, 2010, the Company repurchased 407,600 shares under the 2008 Share Repurchase Program at an aggregate cost of approximately $5.3 million, all of which occurred in the first quarter ended May 2, 2009.     Other             On August 23, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") which became effective January 1, 2006. The SERP provides select employees who satisfy certain eligibility requirements with certain benefits upon retirement, termination of employment, death, disability or a change in control of the Company, in certain prescribed circumstances. The participants in the SERP are Maurice Marciano, Chairman of the Board, Paul Marciano, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman of the Board, and Carlos Alberini, President and Chief Operating Officer. As a non-qualified pension plan, no funding of the SERP is required; however, the Company expects to make periodic payments into insurance policies held in a rabbi trust to fund the expected obligations arising under the non-qualified SERP. The amount of future payments may vary, depending on the future years of service, future annual compensation of the participants and investment performance of the trust. The cash surrender value of the insurance policies was $22.1 million and $12.1 million as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively and is included in other assets. As a result of an increase in value of the insurance policy investments, the Company recorded a gain of $3.1 million in other income during fiscal 2010.            In January 2002, the Company established a qualified employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP"), the terms of which allow for qualified employees (as defined) to participate in the purchase of designated shares of the Company's common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing price at the beginning or end of each quarterly stock purchase period. On January 23, 2002, the Company filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-8 registering 4,000,000 shares of common stock for the ESPP. During the year ended January 30, 2010, 73,810 shares of the Company's common stock were issued pursuant to the ESPP at an average price of $16.92 per share for a total of $1.2 million.      INFLATION             The Company does not believe that inflation trends in the U.S. and internationally over the last three years have had a significant effect on net revenue or profitability.     SEASONALITY             The Company's business is impacted by the general seasonal trends characteristic of the apparel and retail industries. U.S. retail operations are generally stronger from July through December, and U.S. wholesale operations generally experience stronger performance from July through November. The European operations are largely wholesale driven and operate with two primary selling seasons. The Spring/Summer season primarily ships from December to March and the Fall/Winter season primarily ships from June to September. The remaining months of the year are relatively smaller shipping months in Europe. The Company's goal is to take advantage of early-season demand and potential reorders by offering a pre-collection assortment for apparel.     RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE             In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise's variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial    46              interest in a variable interest entity. This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics, among others: (a) the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entity's economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity, that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. Under this guidance, ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity are required. This guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after November 15, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of the guidance on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.            In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that expands the required disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance provides for new disclosures requiring the Company to (i) disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers and (ii) present separately information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance also provides clarification of existing disclosures requiring the Company to (i) determine each class of assets and liabilities based on the nature and risks of the investments rather than by major security type and (ii) for each class of assets and liabilities, disclose the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the presentation of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the guidance on its disclosures in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.      NAME="dq10101_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02650">         ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.          Exchange Rate Risk             Approximately 46% of product sales and licensing revenue recorded for the year ended January 30, 2010 were denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's primary exchange rate risk relates to operations in Canada, Europe and South Korea. Changes in currencies affect our earnings in various ways. For further discussion on currency related risk, please refer to our risk factors under "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors."            Various transactions that occur in Canada, Europe and South Korea are denominated in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and British pounds and thus are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to their local functional currencies. These types of transactions include U.S. dollar denominated purchases of merchandise, U.S. dollar and British pound denominated intercompany liabilities and certain operating expenses denominated in Swiss francs that are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to the functional currency. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exchange risk on certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. The Company does not hedge all transactions denominated in foreign currency.     Forward Contracts Designated as Cash Flow Hedges             During the year ended January 30, 2010, the Company purchased U.S. dollar forward contracts in Europe and Canada totaling US$87.0 million and US$40.0 million, respectively, to hedge forecasted intercompany royalties and merchandise purchases that were designated as cash flow hedges. As of January 30, 2010, the Company had forward contracts outstanding for its European and Canadian operations of US$62.4 million and US$27.7 million, respectively, that are expected to mature over the next 12 months. The Company's derivative financial instruments are recorded in its consolidated balance sheet at fair value based on quoted market rates. U.S. dollar forward contracts are used to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases over specific months. Changes in the fair value of these U.S. dollar forward contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in cost of product sales in the    47              period which approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold. The Company also hedges forecasted intercompany royalties over specific months. Changes in the fair value of these U.S. dollar forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in other income and expense in the period in which the royalty expense is incurred.            From time to time, Swiss franc forward contracts are used to hedge certain anticipated Swiss operating expenses over specific months. Changes in the fair value of the Swiss franc forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in SG&A in the period which approximates the time the expenses are incurred.            As of January 30, 2010, accumulated other comprehensive income included an unrealized gain of approximately US$1.8 million, net of tax, that will be recognized as a net decrease to cost of product sales or other income and expense over the following 12 months at the then current values on a pre-tax basis, which can be different than the current year-end values. At January 30, 2010, the net unrealized gain of the remaining open forward contracts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet was approximately US$3.2 million.            At January 31, 2009, the Company had forward contracts outstanding for its European and Canadian operations of US$21.0 million and US$38.5 million, respectively, and Swiss franc/euro forward contracts outstanding for its European operations of CHF18.0 million. At January 31, 2009, the unrealized net gain of these open forward contracts recorded in current assets in the consolidated balance sheet was approximately US$8.1 million.            The following table summarizes net after-tax derivative activity recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (in thousands):                                    Year  Ended  Jan. 30, 2010      Year  Ended  Jan. 31, 2009          Beginning balance gain (loss)     $  8,763     $  (1,475  )      Net (losses) gains from changes in cash flow hedges        (1,641  )     9,093         Net (gains) losses reclassified to income        (5,277  )     1,145                             Ending balance gain     $  1,845     $  8,763                                  Forward Contracts Not Designated as Cash Flow Hedges             The Company also has foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expense. For the year ended January 30, 2010, the Company recorded a net loss of US$10.6 million for the Canadian dollar, euro, British pound and Swiss franc foreign currency contracts, which has been included in other income and expense. At January 30, 2010, the Company had Canadian dollar foreign currency contracts to purchase US$22.3 million expected to mature over the next eight months, euro foreign currency contracts to purchase US$117.6 million expected to mature over the next 12 months and euro foreign currency contracts to purchase GBP14.0 million expected to mature over the next 11 months. At January 30, 2010, the net unrealized gain of these Canadian dollar, euro and British pound forward contracts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet were approximately US$3.9 million.            At January 31, 2009, the Company had Canadian dollar foreign currency contracts to purchase US$36.5 million, euro foreign currency contracts to purchase US$104.0 million and Swiss franc foreign currency contracts to purchase CHF5.3 million. At January 31, 2009, the net unrealized gains of these    48             Canadian dollar, euro and Swiss franc forward contracts recorded in current assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheet were approximately US$13.7 million.     Sensitivity Analysis             At January 30, 2010, a sensitivity analysis of changes in the foreign currencies when measured against the U.S. dollar indicates that, if the U.S. dollar had uniformly weakened by 10% against all of the U.S. dollar denominated foreign exchange derivatives totaling US$229.9 million, the fair value of the instruments would have decreased by US$25.5 million. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened by 10% against all of the U.S. dollar denominated foreign exchange derivatives, the fair value of these instruments would have increased by US$20.9 million. Any resulting changes in the fair value of the hedged instruments may be more than or partially offset by changes in the fair value of certain balance sheet positions (primarily U.S. dollar denominated liabilities in our foreign operations) impacted by the change in the foreign currency rate. The ability to reduce the exposure of currencies on earnings depends on the magnitude of the derivatives compared to the balance sheet positions during each reporting cycle.     Interest Rate Risk             At January 30, 2010, approximately 96% of the Company's indebtedness related to a capital lease obligation which is covered by a separate interest rate swap agreement with a swap fixed interest rate of 3.55% that matures in 2016. Changes in the related interest rate that result in an unrealized gain or loss on the fair value of the swap are reported in other income or expenses. The change in the unrealized fair value of the interest swap increased other expense, net by $0.5 million during fiscal year 2010. Substantially all of the Company's remaining indebtedness is at variable rates of interest. Accordingly, changes in interest rates would impact the Company's results of operations in future periods. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense for the year ended January 30, 2010 by approximately $0.4 million. This increase would be partially offset by a favorable gain on the interest rate swap.            The fair value of the Company's debt instruments are based on the amount of future cash flows associated with each instrument discounted using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. At January 30, 2010, the carrying value of all financial instruments was not materially different from fair value, as the interest rate on the Company's debt approximates rates currently available to the Company.
