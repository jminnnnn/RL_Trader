ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS       This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This Act provides a "safe harbor" for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about themselves so long as they identify these statements as forward looking and provide meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ from the projected results. All statements other than statements of historical fact made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward looking. In particular, the statements herein regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. The Company's actual results may differ significantly from management's expectations. The following discussion and the section entitled "Business -- Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results" describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause these differences.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    Net Sales                                      1998      % CHANGE      1997      % CHANGE     1996                                 --------    --------    --------    --------    -------                                                     (IN THOUSANDS)            Net sales.....................  $609,996      313%      $147,787      839%      $15,746        Net sales are composed of the selling price of books, music and other products and services sold by the Company, net of returns, as well as outbound shipping and handling charges. Growth in net sales in 1998 and 1997 reflects a significant increase in units sold due to the growth of the Company's customer base and repeat purchases from the Company's existing customers. The Company had approximately 6.2 million and 1.5 million cumulative customer accounts as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Repeat customer orders accounted for over 60% of orders placed on the Amazon.com Web site during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998. Additionally, the increase in net sales in 1998 was partially due to the opening of the music store in June 1998, the United Kingdom and German stores in October 1998 and the video store in November 1998.       International sales, including export sales from the United States, represented approximately 20%, 25% and 33% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Although there can be no assurances, the Company does not expect the introduction of the Euro resulting from the European Monetary Union to significantly impact our competitive position or operations.    Gross Profit                                        1998      % CHANGE     1997      % CHANGE     1996                                   --------    --------    -------    --------    ------                                                      (IN THOUSANDS)            Gross profit....................  $133,841      364%      $28,818      733%      $3,459 Gross margin....................      21.9%                  19.5%                 22.0%        Gross profit consists of sales less the cost of sales, which consists of the cost of merchandise sold to customers, as well as outbound and inbound shipping costs. Gross profit increased in 1998 and 1997 in absolute dollars, reflecting the Company's increased sales volume. Gross margin increased in 1998 as a result of improvements in product costs through improved supply chain management, including increased direct purchasing from publishers, which together more than offset the impact of aggressive product pricing and lower music and video margins. Gross margin decreased in 1997 due to a combination of lower prices and lower overall shipping margins, partially offset by improvements in product cost.       The Company believes that offering its customers attractive prices is an essential component of its business strategy. Accordingly, the Company offers everyday discounts of up to 40% on hundreds of                                         18    19  thousands of titles and certain "special value" editions discounted up to 85%. The Company may in the future expand or increase the discounts it offers to its customers and may otherwise alter its pricing structure and policies.       The Company over time intends to expand its operations by promoting new or complementary products or sales formats and by expanding the breadth and depth of its product and service offerings. Gross margins attributable to new business areas may be lower than those associated with the Company's existing business activities. In particular, in June 1998 the Company launched its new music store and in November 1998 launched a video store. Music and video gross margins are lower than book gross margins. To the extent music and video become a larger portion of the Company's product mix, it is expected to have a proportionate impact on overall product gross margin.    Marketing and Sales                                        1998      % CHANGE     1997      % CHANGE     1996                                   --------    --------    -------    --------    ------                                                      (IN THOUSANDS)            Marketing and sales.............  $133,023      229%      $40,486      565%      $6,090 Percentage of net sales.........      21.8%                  27.4%                 38.7%        Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of advertising, promotional and public relations expenditures, as well as payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing, selling and fulfillment activities. All fulfillment costs not included in cost of sales, including the cost of operating and staffing distribution centers and customer service, are included in marketing and sales. The Company expects its costs of fulfillment to increase based primarily on anticipated sales growth and its planned distribution network expansion. Marketing and sales expenses increased in 1998 and 1997 primarily due to increases in the Company's advertising and promotional expenditures, increased payroll and related costs associated with fulfilling customer demand and increased credit card fees resulting from higher sales. The increase in 1998 was also attributable to the entry into music and video sales and the launch of new stores in Germany and the United Kingdom. Marketing and sales expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales due to the significant increase in net sales. The Company intends to continue to pursue its aggressive branding and marketing campaign, which includes radio, television and print advertising and significant expenditures for online promotion and advertising relationships. In addition, the Company intends to increase investments in marketing, promotion and fulfillment activities related to its product, service and international expansion. As a result of the foregoing, the Company expects marketing and sales expenses to increase significantly in absolute dollars.    Product Development                                        1998      % CHANGE     1997      % CHANGE     1996                                    -------    --------    -------    --------    ------                                                       (IN THOUSANDS)            Product development..............  $46,807      236%      $13,916      480%      $2,401 Percentage of net sales..........      7.7%                   9.4%                 15.2%        Product development expenses consist principally of payroll and related expenses for development, editorial, systems and telecommunications operations personnel and consultants; systems and telecommunications infrastructure; and costs of acquired content, including freelance reviews. The increases in product development expenses in 1998 and 1997 were primarily attributable to increased staffing and costs related to continual feature, content and functionality enhancements to the Company's Web sites and transaction-processing systems, as well as increased investment in systems and telecommunications infrastructure. Such increases in 1998 included investments associated with the entry into music and video sales, the launch of an enhanced holiday gift store, new stores in Germany and the United Kingdom and operating expenses associated with the acquired entities. Product development expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales due to the significant increase in net sales. To date, product development costs have been expensed as incurred. The Company believes that continued investment in product development is critical to attaining its strategic objectives. In addition to ongoing investments in its Web stores and infrastructure,                                         19    20  the Company intends to increase investments in products, services and international expansion. As a result, the Company expects product development expenses to increase significantly in absolute dollars.    General and Administrative                                         1998      % CHANGE     1997     % CHANGE     1996                                     -------    --------    ------    --------    ------                                                       (IN THOUSANDS)            General and administrative........  $15,799      125%      $7,011      397%      $1,411 Percentage of net sales...........      2.6%                  4.7%                  9.0%        General and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive, finance and administrative personnel, recruiting, professional fees and other general corporate expenses. The 1998 and 1997 increases in general and administrative expenses were primarily a result of increased salaries and related expenses associated with the hiring of additional personnel and legal and other professional fees related to the Company's growth. In 1998, additional expenses were incurred associated with the acquired entities and the related international expansion and expanded activities. Beginning in 1997, general and administrative costs have included costs attributable to being a public company. General and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales due to the significant increase in net sales. The Company expects general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as the Company expands its staff and incurs additional costs related to the growth of its business, including investments associated with products, services and international expansion.    Merger and Acquisition Related Costs, Including Amortization of Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangibles       Merger and acquisition related costs, including amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles, were approximately $50.2 million or 8.2% of net sales in 1998. These costs were recorded in connection with the Company's April 1998 acquisitions of three Internet companies and its August 1998 acquisition of Junglee. These acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Additionally, certain transaction costs were incurred in connection with the August 1998 merger with PlanetAll, which was accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting. Merger and acquisition related costs consist of amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles of approximately $42.6 million, as well as approximately $7.6 million, composed primarily of equity in loss of investee and other merger and acquisition related costs. The Company anticipates that future amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles associated with its 1998 acquisitions will continue to be amortized on a straight-line basis over lives of up to approximately three years, and will amount to approximately $22 million per quarter until March 2000 and approximately $15 million per quarter thereafter until the related goodwill and other purchased intangibles are fully amortized. It is likely that the Company will continue to expand its business through acquisitions and internal development. Any additional acquisitions or impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangibles, as well as equity in losses of equity investees, could result in additional merger and acquisition related costs.    Interest Income and Expense                                           1998      % CHANGE     1997     % CHANGE    1996                                       -------    --------    ------    --------    ----                                                        (IN THOUSANDS)            Interest income.....................  $14,053      639%      $1,901      841%      $202 Interest expense....................  (26,639)     N/M         (326)     N/M         (5)        Interest income on cash and marketable securities increased in 1998 due to higher investment balances resulting from the proceeds from the Senior Discount Notes issued in May 1998, and in 1997 due to higher investment balances resulting from the proceeds of the Company's initial public offering in May 1997. Interest expense in 1998 includes interest and amortization of deferred charges related to the Senior Discount Notes.       Interest expense in 1998 and 1997 consists of interest and amortization of deferred charges related to the Company's $75 million three-year senior secured term loan (the "Senior Loan") entered into in                                         20    21  December 1997, as well as asset acquisitions financed through loans and capital leases. In 1998, interest expense also includes the write-off of $2.0 million of unamortized loan fees following prepayment of the Senior Loan in May 1998.       The Company expects interest expense to increase in the future as a result of the Senior Discount Notes, the Convertible Notes and potentially increased financing of asset acquisitions through loans and capital leases. The Company also expects interest income to increase because of higher cash balances resulting from the net proceeds of the Convertible Notes.    Income Taxes       The Company did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal, state or foreign income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because it has experienced operating losses since inception. Utilization of the Company's net operating loss carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2011, may be subject to certain limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset, consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards, because of uncertainty regarding its realizability.  PRO FORMA INFORMATION       In April 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of three Internet companies. Each of the acquisitions was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The aggregate purchase price of the three acquisitions, plus related charges, was approximately $55 million. The consideration for the acquisitions was comprised of common stock and cash. The Company issued an aggregate of approximately 3.2 million shares of common stock to affect the transactions. The Company is amortizing the goodwill resulting from the acquisitions on a straight-line basis over approximately two years.       In August 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Junglee. The Company issued approximately 4.7 million shares of common stock and assumed all outstanding options and warrants in connection with the acquisition of Junglee. The Junglee acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, with substantially all of the approximately $180 million purchase price allocated to goodwill and other purchased intangibles. The goodwill and substantially all other purchased intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over lives averaging approximately three years.       In August 1998, the Company exchanged common stock and options for all of the outstanding capital stock of PlanetAll. The Company issued approximately 2.4 million shares of common stock and assumed all outstanding options in connection with the merger. The PlanetAll merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and, as a result, the Company's consolidated financial statements have been restated for all periods presented.       As of December 31, 1998, the Company has an investment of approximately 46% in drugstore.com, inc., an online drugstore, that is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company's share of the investee's earnings or loss is included in consolidated operating results. The Company's basis in its equity investment is classified within other purchased intangibles in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the Company's share of the investee's loss is classified in merger and acquisition related costs, including amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles. To date, this investment has not materially impacted the Company's results of operations or its financial position.       Pro forma information regarding the Company's results, excluding approximately $50.2 million of merger and acquisition related costs, which include amortization of goodwill and other purchased                                         21    22  intangibles, for the business combinations discussed above, as well as the Company's share of losses from its investee, is as follows:                                                                    YEAR ENDED                                                                DECEMBER 31,                                                                    1998                                                               --------------                                                               (IN THOUSANDS)    Pro forma loss from operations..............................     $(61,788) Pro forma net loss..........................................     $(74,374) Pro forma basic and diluted loss per share..................     $  (0.50) Shares used in computation of basic and diluted loss per   share.....................................................      148,172        The pro forma results for the year ended December 31, 1998 are presented for informational purposes only and are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       At December 31, 1998, the Company's cash was $25.6 million, compared to $1.9 million at December 31, 1997. Marketable securities balances, which include highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, were $347.9 million and $123.5 million at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.       Net cash provided by operating activities of $31.0 million and $687,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively, was primarily attributable to increases in accounts payable, other liabilities and accrued expenses, accrued advertising and non-cash expenses, largely offset by the net loss and increases in inventories and prepaid expenses and other.       Net cash used in investing activities was $261.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 and consisted of net purchases of marketable securities, purchases of fixed assets, and acquisitions, dispositions and investments in businesses. For the year ended December 31, 1997, net cash used in investing activities was $125.7 million and consisted of net purchases of marketable securities and purchases of fixed assets.       Net cash provided by financing activities of $254.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 resulted from net proceeds of approximately $318.2 million from the Senior Discount Notes offering, net proceeds of approximately $8.4 million from PlanetAll's issuance of capital stock, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $6.0 million, partially offset by the repayment of the Senior Loan. Net cash provided by financing activities of $126.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 resulted primarily from net proceeds from the Senior Loan, the Company's initial public offering and PlanetAll's issuance of capital stock.       As of December 31, 1998, the Company's principal sources of liquidity consisted of $373.4 million of cash and marketable securities. As of that date, the Company's principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under its Senior Discount Notes, obligations in connection with the acquisition of fixed assets, operating leases and commitments for advertising and promotional arrangements. The Company anticipates a substantial increase in its capital expenditures and lease commitments consistent with anticipated growth in operations, infrastructure and personnel, including growth associated with product and service offerings, geographic expansion and integration of business combinations. For example, in August 1998, the Company entered into a long-term office lease, which will result in increased lease obligations commencing in 1999, and, in December 1998, the Company leased a highly mechanized distribution facility in Fernley, Nevada, which is expected to begin operations in 1999. Bringing these facilities to operational readiness will require significant leasehold improvement and capital expenditures, and require the Company to stock inventories, purchase fixed assets and hire and train employees.       The Company intends to establish one or more additional distribution centers within the next 12 months, which would require it to commit to lease obligations, stock inventories, purchase fixed assets, hire and train employees and install leasehold improvements. In addition, the Company has announced plans to continue developing distribution infrastructure to increase efficiency and support greater customer                                         22    23  demand and to increase its inventory to provide better availability to customers and achieve purchasing efficiencies.    Senior Discount Notes       In May 1998, the Company completed the offering of approximately $326 million gross proceeds of the Senior Discount Notes. Pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4, in September 1998, the Company completed an exchange offer of 10% Senior Discount Notes due 2008 (the "Exchange Notes"), which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), for all outstanding Senior Discount Notes. The Exchange Notes have identical terms in all material respects to the terms of the original Senior Discount Notes, except that the Exchange Notes generally are freely transferable (the Exchange Notes are referred to throughout this Annual Report interchangeably with the Senior Discount Notes). The Exchange Notes were issued under the indenture governing the original Senior Discount Notes (the "Senior Notes Indenture"). The Senior Discount Notes were sold at a substantial discount from their principal amount at maturity of $530 million. Prior to November 1, 2003, no cash interest payments are required; instead, interest will accrete during this period to the $530 million aggregate principal amount at maturity. From and after May 1, 2003, the Senior Discount Notes will bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum payable in cash on each May 1 and November 1. The Senior Discount Notes are redeemable, at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time on or after May 1, 2003, at the redemption prices set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture, plus accrued interest, if any, to the date of redemption.       Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Senior Notes Indenture), the Company would be required to make an offer to purchase the Senior Discount Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their Accreted Value on the date of purchase, plus accrued interest, if any. There can be no assurance that the Company would have sufficient funds available at the time of any Change of Control to make any required debt repayment (including repurchases of the Senior Discount Notes).       The Senior Notes Indenture contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Senior Notes Indenture) to incur indebtedness, pay dividends, prepay subordinated indebtedness, repurchase capital stock, make investments, create liens, engage in transactions with stockholders and affiliates, sell assets and engage in mergers and consolidations. However, these limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants at December 31, 1998.    Convertible Subordinated Notes       In February 1999, the Company completed an offering of approximately $1.25 billion of the Convertible Notes. Interest payments on the Convertible Notes of 4 3/4% per annum are due and payable semiannually in arrears in cash on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing August 1, 1999. The Convertible Notes are unsecured and are subordinated to all existing and future Senior Indebtedness as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes (the "Convertible Notes Indenture"). The Convertible Notes are generally convertible into common stock of the Company, unless redeemed or repaid prior to maturity, at a conversion price of $156.055 per share. The Convertible Notes may be redeemed by the Company (the "Provisional Redemption"), in whole or in part, at any time prior to February 6, 2002, at a redemption price equal to $1,000 per Convertible Note to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption (the "Provisional Redemption Date") if (1) the closing price of the common stock shall have exceeded 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days in any consecutive 30-trading day period and (2) the shelf registration statement covering resales of the Convertible Notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes is effective and available for use and is expected to remain effective and available for use for the 30 days following the Provisional Redemption Date. Upon any Provisional Redemption, the Company will make an additional payment in cash with respect to the Convertible Notes called for redemption in an amount equal to $212.60 per $1,000 Convertible Note, less the amount of any interest actually paid on such Convertible Note prior to the call for redemption. The Company must make these                                        23    24  payments on all of the Convertible Notes called for redemption, including Convertible Notes called after the date of the call for redemption. After February 6, 2002, the Convertible Notes will be redeemable on at least 30 days' notice at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time, at the redemption prices set forth in the Convertible Notes Indenture.       Upon occurrence of any Fundamental Change (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes, each holder of the Convertible Notes has the right to require the Company to redeem all or any part of the holder's Convertible Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued interest, of the Convertible Notes being redeemed.       The Company will, for the benefit of the holders, file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as soon as practicable, but in any event within 90 days after the first date of original issuance of the Convertible Notes, a shelf registration statement covering resales of the Convertible Notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.       The Company has or may use the net proceeds from the offering of the Convertible Notes for general corporate purposes, including working capital to fund anticipated operating losses, the expansion of the Company's core business, investments in new business segments and markets, capital expenditures, acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses, products and technologies and repurchases and retirement of debt.       The Company believes that current cash and marketable securities balances, together with net proceeds from the Convertible Notes, will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. If current cash, marketable securities and cash that may be generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy the Company's liquidity requirements, the Company may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a line of credit. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to the Company's stockholders. In addition, the Company will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies, and the repurchase and retirement of debt, which might impact the Company's liquidity requirements or cause the Company to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.  YEAR 2000 IMPLICATIONS       Many current installed computer systems and software may be coded to accept only two-digit entries in the date code field and cannot distinguish 21st century dates from 20th century dates. As a result, many software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced. The Company is in the process of assessing the Year 2000 issue and expects to complete the program in the second quarter of 1999. The Company has not incurred material costs to date in the process, and does not believe that the cost of additional actions will have a material effect on its operating results or financial condition. However, the Company has established a budget totaling approximately $1 million for the acquisition of contract software services that will assist in the Year 2000 assessment and remediation activities to be completed no later than the third quarter of 1999. Amazon.com's current systems and products may contain undetected errors or defects with Year 2000 date functions that may result in material costs. In addition, the Company utilizes third-party equipment, software and content, including non-information technology systems, such as security systems, building equipment and embedded micro-controllers that may not be Year 2000 compliant. The Company is in the process of developing a plan to assess whether its internally developed software, third-party systems and non-information technology systems are adequately addressing the Year 2000 issue. Failure of third-party equipment, software or content to operate properly with regard to the Year 2000 issue could require the Company to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy problems, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.       Amazon.com is assessing whether third parties in its supply and distribution chain are adequately addressing their Year 2000 compliance issues. The Company has initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers and service providers to determine the extent to which its systems may be vulnerable                                        24    25  if such suppliers and providers fail to address and correct their own Year 2000 issues. The Company cannot guarantee that the systems of suppliers or other companies on which the Company relies will be Year 2000 compliant. The Company is in the process of developing a contingency plan that will address situations that may result should Year 2000 compliance for critical operations not be fully achieved in 1999.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK       The Company does not have any derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 1998. However, the Company is exposed to interest rate risk. The Company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in the market risk of its marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale as of December 31, 1998. The Company's Senior Discount Notes, Convertible Notes and other long-term debt have fixed interest rates and the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. The Company believes that the market risk arising from holdings of its financial instruments is not material.       Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."       The table below provides information about the Company's marketable securities, including principal cash flows for 1999 through 2003 and the related weighted average interest rates.
