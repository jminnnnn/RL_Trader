Item 7 of Part II, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources.    Interest Rate Risk    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market mutual funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.         41          The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2006 (in millions, except percentages):    STYLE="font-size:12px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">

our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2009 and 2010. The fair value of our long-term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.    Based upon quoted market prices, the fair value of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes (outstanding principal of $900 million) was $883 million and $868 million at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005.          42           The fair value of the 6.875% PEACS was $320 million at December 31, 2006 (outstanding principal of 240 million), and $586 million at December 31, 2005 (outstanding principal of 490 million).   Foreign Exchange Risk    STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> During 2006, net sales from our International segment (consisting of  www.amazon.co.uk ,  www.amazon.de ,  www.amazon.fr , www.amazon.co.jp , and  www.joyo.com ) accounted for 45% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from these websites, as well as those relating to  www.amazon.ca  (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2006, International segment revenues increased $18 million in comparison with the prior year.    We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (foreign funds). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2006 of $623 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $30 million, $60 million, and $125 million. All investments are classified as available for sale, as defined by SFAS No. 115,  Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities . Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders equity.    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in foreign currency. Based on the net intercompany balances at December 31, 2006 of $386 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to these foreign currencies would result in losses of $20 million, $40 million, and $80 million, recorded to Remeasurements and other.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> We have foreign exchange risk related to our 6.875% PEACS, which have an outstanding principal balance at December 31, 2006 of 240 million ($317 million, based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2006). Due to fluctuations in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, which we cannot predict, our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $80 million as of December 31, 2006. Based on the outstanding 6.875% PEACS principal balance, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% weakening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Euro would result in additional losses of approximately $15 million, $30 million, and $65 million, recorded to Remeasurements and other. Additionally, we have not hedged our interest payments under our 6.875% PEACS to protect against exchange rate fluctuations. Assuming the U.S. Dollar weakens against the Euro by 5%, 10%, and 20% in 2006, we would incur $1 million, $2 million, and $4 million additional annual interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange.    STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> See Effect of Exchange Rates for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates.    STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"> Investment Risk    As of December 31, 2006, our recorded basis in equity securities (including both publicly-traded and private companies) was $27 million, including $7 million classified as Marketable securities, and $19 million classified as Other assets. We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other-than-temporary. The fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market in general, company-specific circumstances, and changes in general economic conditions. Based on the fair value of the publicly-traded equity securities we held at December 31, 2006 of $59 million (recorded basis of $11 million), an assumed 15%, 30%, and 50% adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately $10 million, $20 million, and $30 million.         43           Item 8.     Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
