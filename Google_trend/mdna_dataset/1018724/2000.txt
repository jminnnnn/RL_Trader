ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS       This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This Act provides a "safe harbor" for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about themselves so long as they identify these statements as forward looking and provide meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ from the projected results. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward looking. We use words such as "anticipates," "believes," "expects," "future" and "intends" and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. The Company's actual results may differ significantly from management's expectations. This following discussion includes forward-looking statements regarding expectations of future profitability of the US books business, gross margin, improvement in operating loss and sales, all of which are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ significantly for a variety of reasons, including the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that the Company invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, customer spending patterns, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of revenues derived from product sales as compared to services, risks of inventory management, and risks of distribution and fulfillment throughput and productivity. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company's actual results to differ significantly from management's expectations, are described in greater detail in the section entitled "Business -- Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results," which, along with the following discussion, describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management's expectations.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    Net Sales                                     1999       % CHANGE      1998      % CHANGE      1997                               ----------    --------    --------    --------    --------                                                     (IN THOUSANDS)            Net sales...................  $1,639,839      169%      $609,819      313%      $147,787        Net sales include the selling price of products sold by us, net of returns and gift certificate discounts, and also include outbound shipping charges. Shipping revenue was $239 million, $94.1 million and $24.8 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Net sales also include commissions from auctions and zShops transactions, which include sales commissions, placement fees and fees from payment service transactions.       Growth in net sales in 1999 and 1998 reflects a significant increase in units sold due to the growth of our customer base, repeat purchases from existing customers, increased international sales, and the introduction of new product offerings. These new product offerings include music and DVD/video in June and November of 1998, respectively, toys and electronics in July 1999 and home improvement, software and video games in November 1999. We increased our issuance of promotional gift certificates to customers in 1999 to promote new product lines, however, which partially offset such growth in net sales. The Company had approximately 16.9 million, 6.2 million and 1.5 million cumulative customer accounts as of December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The percentage of orders by repeat customers increased from 64% in the fourth quarter of 1998 to 73% in the fourth quarter of 1999. The increase in net sales in 1998 was also partially due to the launch of the UK and German focused Web sites in October 1998.                                         23    26       Sales to customers outside of the US represented approximately 22%, 20% and 25% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.    Gross Profit                                      1999      % CHANGE      1998      % CHANGE     1997                                 --------    --------    --------    --------    -------                                                     (IN THOUSANDS)            Gross profit..................  $290,645      117%      $133,664      364%      $28,818 Gross margin..................      17.7%                   21.9%                  19.5%        Gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of sales, which consists of the cost of merchandise sold to customers, as well as inbound and outbound shipping costs and the cost of tangible supplies used to package product for shipment to customers. Gross profit increased in 1999 and 1998 in absolute dollars, reflecting the Company's increased sales volume. Gross margin decreased in 1999 due to the introduction of new product lines, particularly toys and electronics, and inventory-related charges of approximately $39 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 1999. We also increased our issuance of promotional gift certificates to customers in 1999 to promote these new product lines, which decreased net sales and, therefore, gross margin. Additionally, we realized lower shipping margins in 1999 due to an increase in partial shipments to satisfy holiday demand and because of split shipments from one or more locations, which was caused by our failure to optimize inventory at our distribution centers. Gross margin increased in 1998 as compared to 1997 as a result of improvements in product costs through improved supply chain management, including increased direct purchasing from publishers, as well as higher overall shipping margins. These two factors more than offset the impact of aggressive product pricing and lower music and video margins.       As noted above, outbound shipping costs are included in cost of sales. Gross profit from shipping, which represents shipping revenues less outbound shipping costs, was $11.7 million, $18.2 million and $4.4 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.       We expect our overall gross margin to approach 20% for the first quarter of 2000 and for the year.       We believe that offering our customers attractive prices is an essential component of our business strategy. For example, we offer everyday discounts of 50% on every book on the New York Times bestseller list, up to 40% on hundreds of thousands of titles and up to 85% on certain "special value" editions. We may in the future expand or increase the discounts we offer to our customers and may otherwise alter our pricing structure and policies in a manner that may adversely impact gross profit and gross margin.       We intend to continue to expand our operations by promoting new or complementary products or sales formats and by expanding the breadth and depth of our product and service offerings. Gross margins attributable to new business areas may be different from those associated with our existing business activities. To the extent such product lines become larger components of our sales, we would expect a corresponding impact on overall product gross margin.       We believe that the Amazon.com Commerce Network will tend to increase gross margins in the future because the revenue associated with the activities conducted by Amazon.com Commerce Network generates substantially higher gross profit than the Company's sale of products. See "Business -- Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results -- Our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making and integrating business combinations and strategic alliances."       Organizations responsible for promulgating accounting standards are currently reviewing the financial statement classification of, and accounting for, fulfillment and order processing costs and other items by a number of e-commerce companies, including Amazon.com. The review by these accounting organizations may lead to new accounting standards that could require that some or all of our fulfillment and order processing costs be classified as costs of sales. We currently include these costs in Marketing and Sales. These new standards could also require us to capitalize certain of our fulfillment and order processing costs in inventory. We currently expense these costs as incurred. We will adjust our accounting and classification of fulfillment and order processing costs if required by accounting organizations or by the SEC.                                         24    27    Marketing and Sales                                      1999      % CHANGE      1998      % CHANGE     1997                                 --------    --------    --------    --------    -------                                                     (IN THOUSANDS)            Marketing and sales...........  $413,150      211%      $132,654      231%      $40,077 Percentage of net sales.......      25.2%                   21.8%                  27.1%        Marketing and sales expenses consist of advertising, promotional and public relations expenditures, credit card fees and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing, selling and fulfillment activities. Fulfillment costs included in marketing and sales expenses represent those costs incurred in operating and staffing distribution and customer service centers, including costs attributable to receiving, inspecting and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging and preparing customers' orders for shipment; and responding to inquiries from customers. Fulfillment costs amounted to $188.4 million, $50.3 million and $12.1 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Marketing and sales expenses increased in 1999 and 1998 primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with fulfilling customer demand, increases in our advertising and promotional expenditures in the US, Germany and the UK, and increased credit card fees resulting from higher sales. The increase in 1999 was further attributable to increased advertising during the holiday season and the promotion of the new toys, electronics, software, video games and home improvement stores. The increase in 1998 was also attributable to the entry into music and video sales and the launch of new Web sites targeting Germany and the UK. Marketing and sales expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in 1999 as compared to 1998 primarily due to increases in fulfillment expenses associated with our expansion of our distribution center network and customer service staff during 1999. Marketing and sales expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales in 1998 due to the significant increase in net sales. We intend to continue our advertising and marketing activities in the future and expect that such expenditures will continue to increase in absolute dollars, but, as a percentage of sales, will likely decline in the future. We also expect that fulfillment costs will decline as a percentage of sales in the future as additional capacity of our existing distribution center network is more fully utilized. However, due to risks related to market share, seasonality, distribution centers, inventory management and other factors, advertising and marketing expenditures and fulfillment costs may not decline as a percentage of sales.       Organizations responsible for promulgating accounting standards are currently reviewing the financial statement classification of, and accounting for, fulfillment and order processing costs and other items by a number of e-commerce companies, including Amazon.com. The review by these accounting organizations may lead to new accounting standards that could require that some or all of our fulfillment and order processing costs be classified as costs of sales. These new standards could also require us to capitalize certain of our fulfillment and order processing costs in inventory. We currently expense these costs as incurred. We will adjust our accounting and classification of fulfillment and order processing costs if required by accounting organizations or by the SEC.    Technology and Content                                       1999      % CHANGE     1998      % CHANGE     1997                                  --------    --------    -------    --------    -------                                                      (IN THOUSANDS)            Technology and content.........  $159,722      244%      $46,424      247%      $13,384 Percentage of net sales........       9.7%                   7.6%                   9.1%        Technology and content expenses consist principally of payroll and related expenses for development, editorial, systems and telecommunications operations personnel and consultants; systems and telecommunications infrastructure; and costs of acquired content, including freelance reviews. The increases in technology and content expenses in 1999 and 1998 were primarily attributable to increased staffing and associated costs related to continual enhancements to the features, content and functionality of our Web sites and transaction-processing systems, as well as increased investment in systems and telecommunications infrastructure. These increases also were the result of the costs of developing, introducing and operating new product lines, operating expenses associated with acquired entities and, in 1998, the costs of developing, introducing and operating new Web sites targeting Germany and the UK. Technology and content expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in 1999 due to the significant number of new product lines and services launched by us                                         25    28  during the year. Technology and content expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales in 1998 due to the significant increase in net sales. Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred, except for certain costs relating to the development of internal-use software that are capitalized and depreciated over estimated useful lives. We believe that continued investment in technology and content is critical to attaining our strategic objectives. In addition to ongoing investments in our Web stores and infrastructure, we intend to increase investments in products, services and international expansion. As a result, we expect technology and content expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars.    General and Administrative                                        1999      % CHANGE     1998      % CHANGE     1997                                    -------    --------    -------    --------    ------                                                       (IN THOUSANDS)            General and administrative.......  $70,144      349%      $15,618      132%      $6,741 Percentage of net sales..........      4.3%                   2.6%                  4.6%        General and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive, finance and administrative personnel, recruiting, professional fees and other general corporate expenses. The 1999 and 1998 increases in general and administrative expenses were primarily a result of increased salaries and related expenses associated with the hiring of additional personnel and legal and other professional fees related to our growth. In both 1999 and 1998, additional expenses were incurred associated with acquired entities and the related international expansion and expanded activities. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we incur additional costs to support the growth of our business.    Stock-based Compensation                                         1999      % CHANGE     1998     % CHANGE     1997                                     -------    --------    ------    --------    ------                                                       (IN THOUSANDS)            Stock-based compensation..........  $30,618     1,521%     $1,889       56%      $1,211 Percentage of net sales...........      1.9%                  0.3%                  0.8%        Stock-based compensation is comprised of the portion of acquisition-related consideration conditioned on the continued tenure of key employees of the acquired businesses, which must be classified as compensation expense rather than as a component of purchase price under generally accepted accounting principles. Stock-based compensation also includes stock-based charges such as option-related deferred compensation recorded at our initial public offering, as well as certain other compensation and severance arrangements. The increase in stock-based compensation in 1999 resulted primarily from acquisitions closed in 1999. Stock-based compensation for 1998 and 1997 relates primarily to option-related deferred compensation recorded at the time of our initial public offering.    Amortization of Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangibles                                           1999      % CHANGE     1998      % CHANGE    1997                                      --------    --------    -------    --------    ----                                                        (IN THOUSANDS)            Amortization of goodwill and other   purchased intangibles............  $214,694      404%      $42,599      N/M        $0        Increases in amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles in 1999 primarily resulted from the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles recorded at the time of our acquisitions of Exchange.com, Alexa Internet, Accept.com, LiveBid.com, the catalog and online commerce assets of Acme Electric Motor Co. (Tool Crib of the North), Back to Basics Toys and other acquisitions. In 1998, amortization charges resulted from the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles recorded in the acquisitions of Junglee and three smaller Internet companies. We expect that amortization charges from the acquisitions consummated in 1999 will increase in 2000 based on a full year of amortization for all of the acquisitions. It is likely that we will continue to expand our business through acquisitions, which would cause amortization of goodwill and other intangibles to increase.                                         26    29    Loss from Operations                                      1999      % CHANGE      1998      % CHANGE     1997                                 --------    --------    --------    --------    -------                                                     (IN THOUSANDS)            Loss from operations..........  $605,755      455%      $109,055      235%      $32,595 Percentage of net sales.......      36.9%                   17.9%                  22.1%        Our loss from operations increased from 1997 to 1998, and from 1998 to 1999, due to continued expansion of our business. Our operating expenses have historically increased more quickly than our revenues as we have expanded our operations. We expect that our overall loss from operations incurred in 2000 will decrease significantly as a percentage of net sales, compared to that percentage in 1999.    Interest Income and Expense                                        1999      % CHANGE     1998      % CHANGE     1997                                    -------    --------    -------    --------    ------                                                       (IN THOUSANDS)            Interest income..................  $45,451      223%      $14,053       639%     $1,901 Interest expense.................   84,566      217%       26,639     8,071%        326        Interest income on cash and marketable securities increased in 1999 due to higher investment balances resulting from the proceeds from the issuance of $1.25 billion of 4 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 (the "Convertible Subordinated Notes") in February 1999 and increased in 1998 due to the issuance of approximately $326 million gross proceeds of 10% Senior Discount Notes due May 1, 2008 (the "Senior Discount Notes") in May 1998. Interest expense increased in 1999 and 1998 due to the interest expense associated with this debt, as well as amortization of deferred charges associated with issuance of the notes.       On February 16, 2000, we completed an offering of E690,000,000 ($680,685,000 as of February 11, 2000) of 6.875% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2010, also known as Premium Adjustable Convertible Securities, or "PEACS." Therefore, we expect interest expense to increase in the future for interest associated with these notes.

This is generally defined as an ownership interest of the voting stock of the investee of between 20% and 50%. We made several equity-method investments in 1999 and increased our investment in the equity-method investment we made in 1998. We expect to make additional equity-method investments in the future. Many of the companies in which we have invested to date are in the early stage of their operations and are incurring net losses. Therefore, we expect to continue to record losses on our equity-method investments.       In July 1999, one of our equity-method investees, drugstore.com, inc., completed the initial public offering of its common stock. drugstore.com operates an online retail store and information site for health, beauty, wellness, personal care and pharmacy products. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a contribution to additional paid-in capital of $13.8 million, representing the difference between the carrying value of our investment and the underlying net book value of drugstore.com after the IPO. Two of our other equity-method investees, Pets.com and Homegrocer.com, completed their IPOs in February 2000 and March 2000, respectively. We therefore will record a contribution to additional paid-in capital in connection with these transactions, and it is reasonably possible that other equity-method investees may complete IPOs in the future.                                         27    30    Income Taxes       We did not provide any current or deferred US federal, state or foreign income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since inception. Utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2010, may be subject to certain limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and other limitations under state and foreign tax laws. We have provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset, consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards, because of uncertainty regarding its realizability.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       At December 31, 1999, our cash balance was $117 million, compared to $25.6 million at December 31, 1998. Our marketable securities balance, which includes highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, was $589.2 million and $347.9 million at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.       Net cash used by operating activities amounted to $90.9 million for 1999. This was primarily attributable to the net loss for the year of $720 million, partially offset by non-cash charges related to depreciation, stock-based compensation, amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles, and equity in losses of equity-method investees totaling $358.9 million, as well as $230.1 million of cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities is primarily a function of an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, offset by an increase in inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets. For 1998, net cash provided by operating activities was $31 million and was primarily attributable to non-cash expenses and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, largely offset by the net loss and increases in inventories and prepaid expenses and other.       Net cash used in investing activities was $922.3 million in 1999 and consisted of net purchases of marketable securities of $265.6 million, purchases of fixed assets of $287.1 million and cash paid for acquisitions and investments in businesses of $369.6 million. Net cash used in investing activities during 1998 was $261.8 million and consisted of net purchases of marketable securities of $214.5 million, purchases of fixed assets of $28.3 million and cash paid for acquisitions and investments in businesses of $19 million.       Net cash provided by financing activities of $1.104 billion for 1999 was primarily due to $1.25 billion of proceeds from the sale of our Convertible Subordinated Notes in February 1999, partially offset by repayment of long-term debt, including $178.4 million of cash paid to repurchase a portion of our outstanding Senior Discount Notes. Net cash provided by financing activities of $254.5 million for 1998 primarily resulted from                                         28    31  net proceeds of approximately $318.2 million from the Senior Discount Notes offering offset by the repayment of $78.1 million of long-term debt.       As of December 31, 1999, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $706.2 million of cash and marketable securities. As of that date, our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under our Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 and Senior Discount Notes, as well as obligations in connection with operating leases and commitments for advertising and promotional arrangements. During 1999, we undertook a substantial expansion of our distribution center network in the US, adding six distribution centers in the US. We also opened new distribution centers in the UK and Germany. We anticipate that our current distribution center capacity in the US will be adequate for our needs for at least the next 12 months, but we may require additional capacity in international markets.       In May 1998, we completed the offering of approximately $326 million gross proceeds of the Senior Discount Notes, in February 1999, we completed the offering of approximately $1.25 billion Convertible Subordinated Notes, and in February 2000, we completed the offering of E690 million of 6.875% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2010, also knows as PEACS. See Notes 7 and 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference to Item 8 of Part II.       We believe that current cash and marketable securities balances, together with net proceeds from the PEACS, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. If current cash, marketable securities and cash that may be generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain credit facilities from lenders. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to the Company's stockholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies, and the repurchase and retirement of debt, which might impact our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.  YEAR 2000 IMPLICATIONS       Many currently installed computer systems, software programs and embedded data chips are programmed using a two-digit date field and are therefore unable to distinguish dates beyond the 20th century. A failure to identify and correct any mission-critical internal or third-party year 2000 processing problem could have a material adverse operational or financial consequence to us.       We established a Year 2000 Project Team that, together with external consultants, developed a process for addressing the year 2000 issue, including performing an inventory, an assessment, remediation procedures (to the extent necessary) and testing procedures of all mission-critical information systems and equipment and machinery that contain embedded technology, as well as obtaining assurances from all mission-critical third parties as to their own year 2000 preparedness. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all of our mission-critical systems have been successfully tested for year 2000 compliance, and we have not experienced any significant year 2000 problems with our own mission-critical systems or any mission-critical third parties. Although we have not experienced any significant year 2000 problems to date, we plan to continue to monitor the situation closely.       We cannot be sure that we will be completely successful in our efforts to address the year 2000 issue or that problems arising from the year 2000 issue will not cause a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. We believe, however, that our most reasonably likely worst-case scenario would relate to problems with the systems of third parties rather than with our internal systems. We are limited in our efforts to address the year 2000 issue as it relates to third parties and rely solely on the assurances of these third parties as to their year 2000 preparedness.       As part of our broader contingency planning, we also developed business continuity plans to address each critical process and activity that we believe would cause a significant disruption to operations if not functional for 24 hours. Despite these efforts, we cannot guarantee that the contingency plan will adequately address all                                         29    32  circumstances that may disrupt operations or that such planning will prevent circumstances that may cause a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK       We do not have any derivative financial instruments in our marketable securities portfolio as of December 31, 1999. However, we are exposed to interest rate risk on debt instruments we hold. We employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the market risk of our marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale as of December 31, 1999 and 1998. Our Senior Discount Notes, Convertible Subordinated Notes, PEACS and other long-term debt have fixed interest rates and the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. We believe that the market risk arising from holdings of our financial instruments is not material.       Our exposure to currency exchange risk through December 31, 1999 has not been material. However, with the completion of the offering of PEACS notes on February 16, 2000, we will be exposed to currency exchange risk because the debt is denominated in euros while our functional currency is the US dollar. We plan to employ established policies and procedures to mitigate the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, the conversion price for the PEACS is denominated in euros.       Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."       The table below provides information about our marketable securities, including principal cash flows for 2000 through 2004 and the related weighted average interest rates.
