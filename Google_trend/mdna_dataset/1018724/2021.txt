Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers . The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.” Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $26.6 billion as of December 31, 2020. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions. We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $203 million and $2.4 billion during 2019 and 2020. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity warrant valuations, equity securities valuations and adjustments, and foreign currency. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, audit-related developments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business make estimates of future income more challenging.  We recorded a provision for income taxes of $2.4 billion and $2.9 billion in 2019 and 2020. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.   We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2020 (in millions, except percentages):   2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Total Estimated Fair Value as of December 31, 2020 Money market funds $ 27,430  $ —  $ —  $ —  $ —  $ —  $ 27,430  $ 27,430  Weighted average interest rate (0.16) % —  % —  % —  % —  % —  % (0.16) % Corporate debt securities 16,505  4,459  5,531  1,990  886  —  29,371  29,988  Weighted average interest rate 0.42  % 1.65  % 1.32  % 1.86  % 1.84  %   0.92  % U.S. government and agency securities 5,439  587  899  298  67  71  7,361  7,439  Weighted average interest rate 0.30  % 1.38  % 1.12  % 1.74  % 1.13  % 2.97  % 0.58  % Asset-backed securities 870  773  472  763  243  46  3,167  3,235  Weighted average interest rate 2.08  % 2.00  % 1.53  % 2.13  % 1.57  % 1.25  % 1.94  % Foreign government and agency securities 4,932  147  45  3  —  —  5,127  5,131  Weighted average interest rate 0.25  % 0.74  % 1.28  % 1.76  % —  % —  % 0.28  % Other fixed income securities 109  156  230  160  43  —  698  710  Weighted average interest rate 2.10  % 1.85  % 1.10  % 0.84  % 1.31  % —  % 1.38  % $ 55,285  $ 6,122  $ 7,177  $ 3,214  $ 1,239  $ 117  $ 73,154  Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 73,933  As of December 31, 2020, we had long-term debt with a face value of $33.2 billion, including the current portion, primarily consisting of fixed rate unsecured senior notes.
