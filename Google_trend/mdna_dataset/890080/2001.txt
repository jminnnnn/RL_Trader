ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  Overview       Foamex L.P. operates in the flexible polyurethane and advanced polymer foam products  industry.  As of December  31,  2000,  Foamex  L.P.'s  operations  are conducted directly and through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Foamex Canada Inc. ("Foamex Canada"), Foamex Latin America, Inc. ("Foamex Mexico") and Foamex Asia, Inc.  ("Foamex Asia").  Business  segments are listed below.  Segment  financial information is included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.       An  executive  vice  president  heads  each  operating  segment.  Each vice president is responsible  for developing  budgets and plans as well as directing the operations of the segment.  The  performance  of each  operating  segment is measured based upon income from  operations,  excluding  restructuring  charges. Foamex L.P.  does not  allocate  restructuring  and other  charges to  operating segments because many of Foamex L.P.'s facilities  produce products for multiple segments.       Foam Products - manufactures and markets foam used by the bedding industry,      the furniture  industry and the retail industry.      Carpet  Cushion  Products - manufactures  and  distributes  prime,  rebond,      sponge  rubber and felt  carpet  cushion  to Foamex  Carpet  Cushion,  Inc.      ("Foamex  Carpet"),  a sister company wholly owned by Foamex  International      Inc. ("Foamex International").      Automotive  Products - supplies  foam  primarily  for  automotive  interior      applications to automotive manufacturers and tier one suppliers.      Technical  Products - manufactures and markets  reticulated foams and other      custom polyester and polyether foams for industrial, specialty and consumer      and safety applications.      Other - primarily consists of certain  manufacturing  operations in Mexico,      corporate  expenses  not  allocated  to the  other  business  segments  and      restructuring  and other charges  (credits).  The  restructuring  and other      charges  (credits)  amounted to $6.0 million in 2000, $10.8 million in 1999      and $(10.1) million in 1998.       Foamex  L.P.'s sales are primarily to markets in the United  States.  These sales are  impacted  by  economic  conditions  in several  sectors of the United States economy,  including consumer  spending,  sales of new and existing homes, the overall level of passenger car and light truck  production and  seasonality. Foamex L.P. typically  experiences two seasonally slow periods during each year, in  early  July and in late  December,  due to  scheduled  plant  shutdowns  and holidays.       The  following   discussion   should  be  read  in  conjunction   with  the consolidated  financial  statements  and related  notes  included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The reclassification required shipping costs originally recorded      in cost of sales to be  recognized  in net sales,  with no impact on income      from operations. Carpet Cushion Products was the only segment impacted.  (b)  Not meaningful.    Dispositions       GFI Transaction       On February  27,  1998,  Foamex  International,  Foamex L.P. and certain of their affiliates  completed a series of transactions which changed Foamex L.P.'s structure  (collectively,  the "GFI Transaction").  Prior to the consummation of the GFI Transaction, Foamex L.P. defeased the $4.5 million outstanding principal amount of its 9 1/2% senior  secured  notes due 2000.  Foamex  L.P.  settled its intercompany  payables to General Felt  Industries,  Inc.  ("General Felt") with $4.8 million in cash and a promissory note in the aggregate  principal amount of $34.0  million  supported by a $34.5  million  letter of credit under the Foamex L.P. credit facility (the "Foamex/GFI Note"). The initial  transaction  resulted in the transfer  from Foamex L.P. to Foam Funding LLC, an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary  of  Trace  International  Holdings,  Inc.  ("Trace"),  of all of the outstanding  common stock of General Felt, in exchange for (i) the assumption by Foam Funding LLC of $129.0  million of Foamex L.P.'s  indebtedness  and (ii) the transfer  by Foam  Funding  LLC to  Foamex  L.P.  of a 1%  non-managing  general partnership  interest in Foamex L.P. As a result,  General  Felt ceased  being a subsidiary  of Foamex L.P. and was relieved  from all  obligations  under Foamex L.P.'s 9 7/8% senior subordinated notes due 2007 and 13 1/2% senior subordinated notes due 2005. Upon consummation of the initial  transaction,  Foamex Carpet, a newly  formed   wholly  owned   subsidiary  of  Foamex   International,   Foamex International, Foam Funding LLC, and General Felt entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement dated February 27, 1998, in which General Felt sold  substantially all of its assets (other than cash, the Foamex/GFI  Note and its operating  facility in Pico Rivera,  California)  to Foamex Carpet in exchange for (i) $20.0 million in cash and (ii) a promissory  note issued by Foamex  Carpet to Foam Funding LLC in the  aggregate  principal  amount of $70.2  million.  The $20.0  million cash payment was funded with a distribution by Foamex L.P.       No gain was  recognized on the GFI  Transaction.  The net impact of the GFI Transaction  was an increase in Foamex  L.P.'s  partners'  capital  (deficit) of approximately   $10.1  million,  a  distribution  of  $20.0  million  to  Foamex International  and approximately  $1.5 million of fees charged to earnings.  The $129.0  million of debt assumed by Foam Funding LLC in the GFI  Transaction  was used to repay  approximately  $125.1  million of term loan  borrowings  that was accounted for as an  extinguishment  of debt which resulted in an  extraordinary loss of  approximately  $3.2 million.  The 1% non-managing  general  partnership interest  acquired in connection with the GFI Transaction was accounted for as a redemption of equity.  2000 Compared to 1999       Net sales for 2000 decreased 2.5% to $1,161.0 million from $1,190.7 million in 1999.  The decline in sales  primarily  reflected a  deterioration  in market conditions during the second half of 2000. Lower sales were recorded in the Foam Products, Carpet Cushion Products and Automotive Products business segments. The Technical  Products segment  continued to report strong sales growth and certain Foamex L.P.'s foreign  operations  reported in the "Other" segment also reported higher sales,  which  partially  offset sales declines in the business  segments discussed above.                                          17        Income  from  operations  in 2000 was $84.1  million,  0.5% higher than the $83.7 million  recorded during 1999. These results  included  restructuring  and other charges  (discussed under "Other" below) of $6.0 million in 2000 and $10.8 million in 1999.  Excluding the  restructuring  and other charges for comparison purposes, income from operations was $90.1 million in 2000, down 4.7% from $94.6 million in 1999. On this basis,  income from operations was 7.8% of net sales in 2000 compared to 7.9% of net sales in 1999.       The decline in income from operations,  excluding  restructuring  and other charges,  was largely  attributable  to the impact of lower sales and higher raw material  costs offset by improved  operating  efficiencies  and lower  selling, general  and  administrative  expenses,   discussed  below.  Higher  oil  prices translated into raw material costs increases in 2000 and these higher costs were not fully recovered through selling price increases. The gross profit margin was 12.4% for 2000 compared to 13.0% in 1999.       Selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  were  down  9.7%  in 2000 compared to 1999. The decrease  primarily  reflected  cost savings  initiatives, lower incentive compensation expenses and lower selling expenses.       Foam Products       Foam  Products  net sales for 2000  decreased  1.7% to $512.5  million from $521.4 million in 1999. Lower sales primarily  reflected a volume decline in the consumer  products  market and the loss of sales from  Foamex  L.P.'s  packaging business  that was sold in 1999.  Income from  operations in 2000 was up 0.9% to $54.9  million  compared  to $54.4  million in 1999.  As  discussed  above,  raw material  costs  continued  to  increase  during  the year,  and  selling  price increases  and  improved  operating  efficiencies  did  not  fully  recover  the increased costs.  However,  reduced selling,  general and  administrative  costs contributed  to the overall  improvement.  As a percentage of net sales,  income from operations was 10.7% of net sales in 2000, up from 10.4% in 1999.       Carpet Cushion Products       Carpet  Cushion  Products  net  sales  for 2000  decreased  11.7% to $165.8 million  from $187.7  million in 1999.  The sales  decline  primarily  reflected competitive  pressures experienced by Foamex Carpet that resulted in lower sales volumes across all product lines.  As a result,  a loss from operations of $11.7 million was recorded in 2000 compared to income from  operations of $0.9 million in 1999.       Automotive Products       Automotive Products net sales for 2000 were $342.4 million,  down 5.4% from $361.8  million in 1999.  The decrease  reflected a slow down in the  automotive industry,  particularly  during  the  second  half  of  the  year.  Lower  sales translated to a 0.9% decrease in income from  operations,  from $22.9 million in 1999 to $22.7  million in 2000.  Results in 2000  benefited  from the  favorable impact of a selling price adjustment. Income from operations represented 6.6% of net sales in 2000 and 6.3% of net sales in 1999.       Technical Products       Technical  Products net sales for 2000  increased  15.7% to $106.7  million from $92.2  million in 1999.  Income from  operations  increased  27.1% to $29.3 million  in  2000,  up from  $23.0  million  in  1999.  Income  from  operations represented  27.4%  of net  sales  in  2000  compared  to  25.0%  in  1999.  The improvement  reflected favorable market conditions that resulted in sales volume growth and improved operating efficiencies.       Other       Other  primarily  consists of certain  manufacturing  operations in Mexico, corporate  expenses not  allocated to business  segments and  restructuring  and other charges.  The increase in net sales associated with this segment primarily resulted from an increase in net sales from Foamex L.P.'s Mexico City operation. The loss from  operations  of $11.1 million in 2000 included a provision of $6.0 million for  restructuring  and other charges,  discussed  below.  The loss from operations of $17.5 million in 1999 included $10.8 million of restructuring  and other charges.                                          18        During  2000,   Foamex  L.P.   approved  and   implemented   four  separate restructuring  plans to  further  rationalize  plant  operations  and to  reduce selling, general and administrative expenses.       Foamex L.P.  recorded  restructuring  charges of $1.7 million for severance costs in connection with the first  restructuring plan. This plan reduced Foamex L.P.'s  salaried work force by 15  employees,  including  certain  executives of Foamex L.P.       The second  restructuring plan was implemented to rationalize certain plant operations  relating to the increase in the VPF(SM)  capacity in North Carolina. Foamex L.P. recorded a restructuring charge of $0.7 million associated with this plan. The restructuring  charge was comprised of $0.1 million of severance costs in connection with a work force reduction of 12 employees, $0.4 million of lease and plant closure costs and $0.2 million of asset write-downs.       The third  restructuring  plan, as amended,  was implemented to exit Foamex L.P.'s fiber operations in Indiana.  Foamex L.P. recorded a restructuring charge of $1.1 million in  connection  with this plan which was  comprised of less than $0.1 million of severance costs for the work force reduction of seven employees, $0.1  million  of lease  and  plant  closure  costs  and $1.0  million  of asset write-downs.       The fourth  restructuring  plan was  implemented for the  consolidation  of pourline operations and certain product line rationalizations resulting from the closure  of  facilities  in  Indiana  and  Arkansas.   Foamex  L.P.  recorded  a restructuring  charge of $2.3 million in connection  with this plan.  The charge was  comprised  of $0.2  million  of  severance  costs  relating  to work  force reductions of 65  employees,  $0.8 million for lease and plant closure costs and $1.3 million for asset write-downs.       In  addition,  Foamex  L.P.  recorded  a net  restructuring  charge of $0.2 million  associated  with changes in  estimates  to prior  years'  restructuring plans. The net charge was comprised of $0.3 million for asset write-downs offset by a credit of $0.1 million relating to severance costs.       The accrued  restructuring  balance at  December  31, 2000 will be used for payments  relating to severance  and lease and plant  closure  costs,  including runout costs at the facilities.  As of December 31, 2000, all employees  subject to the plans have been terminated.  Foamex L.P.  expects to spend  approximately $3.8 million during 2001 with the balance to be spent through 2006,  principally for lease runout costs.       During 1999, Foamex L.P. approved and implemented four restructuring  plans to reduce selling,  general and  administrative  costs and to rationalize  plant operations.       Foamex L.P. recorded  restructuring  charges of approximately  $2.3 million relating to severance  costs in connection  with the first  restructuring  plan. This plan reduced Foamex L.P.'s salaried work force by 78 employees.       Foamex L.P. recorded  restructuring  charges of approximately  $2.9 million relating to severance costs in connection with the second restructuring plan for replacing three of Foamex L.P.'s former  executives,  including its former Chief Executive Officer.       In  connection  with the third  restructuring  plan,  Foamex L.P.  recorded restructuring  charges of approximately  $1.7 million relating to the closure of one facility and certain product line rationalizations.  The $1.7 million charge was  comprised of  approximately  $0.1 million of severance  costs in connection with the work force reductions of 115 employees, $0.1 million of lease and plant closure costs and $1.5 million of asset write-downs.       In connection with the fourth  restructuring  plan,  Foamex L.P. closed its New York office (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial  statements).  Foamex L.P. recorded  approximately $2.5 million of restructuring  charges comprised of $1.6 million of severance  costs for eight  employees  and $0.9 million of costs primarily relating to future lease obligations, net of sublease proceeds.       In addition,  Foamex L.P. recorded  restructuring  charges of approximately $1.1 million  relating to changes in estimates to prior years' plans,  primarily for the sale of the  packaging  business  in 1999.  The $1.1  million  charge is comprised of $0.2 million of severance,  $1.7 million of lease and plant closure costs, offset by $0.8 million                                          19   of adjustments for asset write-downs.  Foamex L.P. also recorded $0.3 million of other  charges  relating to rent due from Trace for the New York office prior to its closure.       Interest and Debt Issuance Expense       Interest and debt issuance  expenses  totaled $69.3 million in 2000,  which represented a 4.2% increase  from 1999 expense of $66.5  million.  The impact of higher  effective  interest  rates was partially  offset by the benefit of lower average debt levels. Higher effective interest rates reflected market conditions and the impact of a certain  provision of the Foamex L.P.  credit  facility that required an  incremental  interest  rate margin,  as discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated  financial  statements.  The additional interest rate margin was 25 basis points in the first  quarter of 2000.  During the second  quarter of 2000, the  interest  rate  margin  was  increased  25  basis  points  to a  cumulative adjustment of 50 basis  points.  During the third quarter of 2000, an additional 25 basis  point  adjustment  became  effective  that  resulted  in a  cumulative adjustment of 75 basis points.  Based on the debt leverage  ratio of Foamex L.P. at the end of the third quarter,  the  cumulative  adjustment of 75 basis points was reset to zero during the fourth quarter of 2000.  Interest  capitalized as a component of the construction  costs of plant and equipment totaled $0.8 million in 2000.       Income from Equity Interest in Joint Venture       Income  from an equity  interest  in an Asian joint  venture  totaled  $1.7 million in 2000 compared to $0.5 million in 1999. The improved results reflected the growth of the joint venture as it moves beyond the start up phase.       Other Expense, Net       Other expense, net in 2000 totaled $1.3 million and primarily consisted of: $1.3 million  loss on the  disposal of fixed  assets and $0.7 million  letter of credit  fees offset by $0.6  million of interest  income.  During,  1999,  other expense,  net totaled $0.9 million.  Partially  offsetting  income items in 1999 were losses on the disposal of fixed assets and letter of credit fees related to the  GFI  Transaction,  discussed  in  Note  12 to  the  consolidated  financial statements.       Income Tax Expense       Foamex L.P.,  as a limited  partnership,  is not subject to Federal  income taxes. Consequently, no current or deferred provision has been provided for such taxes. However,  Foamex L.P. has provided for the income taxes of certain states in  which it is  subject  to  taxes  and for  subsidiaries  located  in  foreign jurisdictions  that file separate tax returns.  Compared to 1999,  the effective tax rate was higher in 2000 primarily due to a greater percentage of income from foreign sources and a higher effective tax rate on foreign source income.       Net Income       Net  income  for 2000 was down  14.8% to $13.3  million  compared  to $15.6 million in 1999.  1999 Compared to 1998       Net sales for 1999 increased 2.8% to $1,190.7 million from $1,157.8 million in 1998. The increase was primarily the result of stronger  volume growth in the Automotive  Products and Technical  Products segments  partially offset by sales declines in the Foam Products and Carpet Cushion Products segments.       Income from operations  increased 27.8% to $83.7 million in 1999 from $65.5 million in 1998.  Results in 1999 included  $10.8 million of  restructuring  and other charges.  In 1998, a net  restructuring  credit of previously  established restructuring  accruals  increased  operating  income  by $10.1  million.  These restructuring  and other charges  (credits) are discussed  further under "Other" below.  Excluding the  restructuring  and other charges (credits) for comparison purposes,  income from operations  increased 70.8% to $94.6 million in 1999 from $55.4 million in 1998. On this basis, income from operations represented 7.9% of net  sales in 1999,  up from  4.8% of net  sales in 1998.  The  improvement  was primarily  due to (i) the  increase in net sales,  (ii)  improved  gross  profit margins and (iii)                                          20   lower selling, general and administrative expenses at both the business unit and corporate  levels.   Improved  gross  profit  margins  resulted  primarily  from operating  efficiencies,  the benefits of the first phase of  implementation  of improved  operating  practices  across a number  of  Foamex  L.P.'s  facilities, enhanced  raw  material   utilization  and  the  full  year  benefits  from  the consolidation of facilities acquired in connection with the acquisition of Crain Industries,  Inc. (the "Crain  Acquisition")  in December  1997.  Lower selling, general and administrative  expenses primarily  reflected the integration of the Crain Acquisition, staffing reductions in January 1999, elimination of the Trace management fee and the closure of the New York office.       Foam Products       Foam  Products  net sales for 1999  decreased  6.8% to $521.4  million from $559.7  million in 1998.  The decrease  was  primarily  due to  decreased  sales volumes resulting from Foamex L.P.'s decision to exit certain business lines and the closure of facilities related to the Crain Acquisition.  Despite the decline in sales,  income from operations  increased 50.2% to $54.4 million in 1999 from $36.3 million in 1998. Income from operations  represented 10.4% of net sales in 1999, up from 6.5% in 1998. The improvement was primarily driven by (i) enhanced raw material utilization, (ii) the benefits of the first phase of implementation of improved  operating  practices  across a number of Foamex L.P.'s  facilities, (iii) the benefits of consolidation of facilities in the Southeast region of the U.S.  and  in  Southern   California  and  (iv)  the  elimination  of  operating inefficiencies  incurred in 1998.  Income from operations for 1998 was adversely impacted by a number of  factors,  the most  significant  of which were (i) $4.0 million of costs  associated  with the Crain  Acquisition  transition  including inventory   adjustments  for  facilities   affected  by  the   consolidation  of manufacturing  facilities,  (ii) operating inefficiencies and logistics costs of $2.5 million  associated with the sales of juvenile and other consumer  products sold through mass  merchandisers  and discount stores and (iii) operating losses and  inefficiencies  of $1.0  million  resulting  from  fires at  Foamex  L.P.'s facilities in Orlando, Florida and Cornelius, North Carolina.       Carpet Cushion Products       Carpet  Cushion  Products  net  sales  for 1999  decreased  11.5% to $187.7 million  from  $212.1  million in 1998  primarily  due to lower  sales  volumes. Competitive  pressures in the carpet  cushion  marketplace  contributed to lower sales volumes.  Sales volumes were also reduced due to limited  production  from Foamex L.P.'s  Orlando,  Florida  facility as a result of the 1998 fire.  Income from  operations  for 1999 increased to $0.9 million from a loss of $0.1 million in 1998. Income from operations  continued to be impacted by lower sales volumes and the  Orlando  fire,  which  increased  product  transportation  costs as the fulfillment process was shifted to less geographically  optimal facilities.  The Orlando,  Florida carpet cushion line was brought back on stream and operational in the fourth  quarter of 1999.  These  effects were  partially  offset by lower expenses  associated  with  the   rationalization   associated  with  the  Crain Acquisition.  Results in 1998 were impacted by a $1.0 million charge  associated with the  Orlando,  Florida  fire and costs  related  to the  Crain  Acquisition transition of $0.9 million.       Automotive Products       Automotive  Products net sales for 1999  increased  26.9% to $361.8 million from $285.2  million in 1998,  primarily  as a result of higher  sales volume of lamination products.  Income from operations increased 32.0% to $22.9 million in 1999 from $17.3 million in 1998. Income from operations  represented 6.3% of net sales in 1999, up from 6.1% in 1998.  The  improvement  was primarily due to (i) operating  efficiencies  at Foamex L.P.'s Mexican border  facilities that became fully  operational  in the  fourth  quarter  of 1998  and (ii)  increased  sales volumes.  Income from  operations  for 1998 was  reduced by (i) $3.0  million of costs  incurred  during  the start up phase of new  lamination  business  at the Mexican border, (ii) contract price reductions of approximately $1.1 million and (iii) losses of $1.0 million  associated  with the production of  thermoformable headliners.       Technical Products       Technical Products net sales for 1999 increased 16.5% to $92.2 million from $79.1 million in 1998.  Income from operations  increased 54.5% to $23.0 million in 1999 from $14.9 million in 1998. Income from operations  represented 25.0% of net sales in 1999, up from 18.9% in 1998. The improvement  was primarily  driven by favorable market conditions,  strong growth in sales volumes, a higher-margin product mix and improved                                         21   manufacturing efficiencies. Plans to expand capacity for Technical Products were initiated during the second half of 1999.       Other       Other  primarily  consists of certain  manufacturing  operations in Mexico, corporate  expenses not  allocated to business  segments and  restructuring  and other charges (credits).  The increase in net sales associated with this segment primarily  resulted from an increase in net sales from Foamex L.P.'s Mexico City operation.  The loss from  operations in 1999 was primarily  associated with the $10.8 million of restructuring  and other charges discussed below. The loss from operations in 1998 included $10.1 million of net restructuring credits discussed below. The loss from operations for 1998 was impacted by accounts receivable and inventory write downs of approximately  $8.5 million at the Mexico City facility and start up costs of $2.5 million for Foamex L.P.'s Asian joint venture.       Restructuring  and other charges for 1999  amounted to $10.8,  as discussed previously.       In 1998, net restructuring credits were approximately $10.1 million,  which reflect a $14.8 million reversal of prior year's  restructuring plans, offset by other charges of $4.7 million.  The $4.7 million was comprised of a $2.4 million reserve for net  receivables  due from Trace and a $2.3 million of impaired cost in excess of assets acquired associated with a foreign facility.  However, these charges were offset by a $14.8  million  restructuring  credit  associated  with modifications to the 1997 restructuring plan. The $14.8 million credit reflected the reversal of $10.2 million of fixed asset write-downs,  $3.5 million of plant closure and lease obligations and $1.1 million of personnel reductions.       Interest and Debt Issuance Expense       Interest and debt issuance expense totaled $66.5 million in 1999,  slightly higher than the 1998 expense of $66.1 million. The benefit of lower average debt levels was offset by higher effective interest rates and increased  amortization expense related to additional debt issuance costs paid during 1999.       Other Expense, Net       Other expense,  net totaled $0.9 million and was primarily due to losses on the  disposal  of fixed  assets  and  letter of credit  fees  related to the GFI Transaction. Interest income totaled $2.2 million in 1999.       Other expense,  net for 1998 primarily consists of: $3.0 million of foreign currency  losses in Mexico;  $2.5  million of fees and costs  related to the GFI Transaction; and other expenses offset by approximately $3.4 million of interest income.       Income Tax Expense       Foamex L.P.,  as a limited  partnership,  is not subject to Federal  income taxes. Consequently, no current or deferred provision has been provided for such taxes. However,  Foamex L.P. has provided for the income taxes of certain states in  which it is  subject  to  taxes  and for  subsidiaries  located  in  foreign jurisdictions that file separate tax returns.       Income (Loss) Before Extraordinary Loss       Income (loss) before extraordinary loss increased to $15.6 million for 1999 as compared to a loss of $5.9 million in 1998.  The increase is primarily due to improved operating results during 1999 as compared to 1998, as discussed above.       Extraordinary Loss       The extraordinary loss on the early extinguishment of debt in 1998 was $3.2 million.  The charge primarily reflected the write-off of debt issuance costs in connection with the GFI Transaction.                                          22   Business Outlook       The coming year  presents a number of challenges  for Foamex L.P.  Although the domestic  economy is clearly not as strong as in recent  years,  Foamex L.P. believes  improved  results are  attainable.  In Foam  Products,  reduced profit margins are  anticipated  to  continue,  given the current cost  structure.  Any improvement  in profit  margins for Foam  Products  will  largely  depend on the ability to implement  selling  price  increases  to recover  higher raw material costs and  higher  transportation  costs,  combined  with a  continued  focus on operating  efficiencies.  In Carpet Cushion Products, the introduction by Foamex Carpet  of  new  products  and  marketing  strategies,  including  expansion  of commercial applications,  will be a key to improving results in the coming year. In Automotive Products,  the slow down in the automotive industry is anticipated to  continue  in the short term and will  continue  to limit  results.  Improved results for the Mexico City operation, reported in Other, is primarily dependent on a continued  focus on a  higher-value  product mix and  increased  shipments. Technical  Products are  anticipated  to continue their growth trend and results for the  business  segment  should help to offset the impact of the  unfavorable business conditions discussed above.       The effective start up of two new VPF(SM)  facilities and the conversion to other production  technologies to comply with new emission standards,  effective in the fourth quarter of 2001, will be also a key success factor.       Results in 2001 should also benefit from continued  growth and results from Foamex L.P.'s joint venture in Asia and from lower  interest  expense  resulting from anticipated debt reduction and anticipated lower effective  interest rates, discussed below.  Liquidity and Capital Resources       Foamex L.P.'s operating cash  requirements  consist  principally of working capital   requirements,   scheduled   payments  of  principal  and  interest  on outstanding indebtedness and capital expenditures. Based on the business outlook discussed  above,  Foamex  L.P.  believes  that  cash  flow  from its  operating activities,  cash on hand and  periodic  borrowings  under its credit  facility, discussed  below,  will be  adequate  to meet its  liquidity  requirements.  The ability  of  Foamex  L.P.  to make  distributions  to  Foamex  International  is restricted  by  the  terms  of  its  financing  agreements;   therefore,  Foamex International  is not  expected  to have  access to the cash flow  generated  by Foamex L.P. for the foreseeable future.       Cash and cash equivalents  totaled $2.9 million at the end of 2000 compared to $1.6  million  at the end of  1999.  Working  capital  at the end of 2000 was $109.5 million compared to working capital at the end of 1999 of $110.5 million. The  current  ratio was 1.7 to 1 at  year-end  2000 and 1999.  The  increase  in accrued employee compensation and benefits primarily reflects an increase in the amount of  contributions  required for the Foamex L.P.  defined  benefit pension plan in the United States.       Total debt at the end of 2000 was $664.5  million,  down $25.5 million from year-end 1999.  During the first quarter of 2000, the Foamex/GFI Note was repaid with  borrowings  under the Foamex L.P.  revolving  credit  facility.  The $34.5 million letter of credit that was outstanding at year-end 1999 to  collateralize principal and interest payable under the Foamex/GFI Note was also terminated.       Cash Flow from Operating Activities       Cash provided by operating activities in 2000 was $46.7 million compared to $58.1 million in 1999. The cash flow decrease primarily  reflected lower results and an  increase  in  retirement  benefit  funding.  Working  capital  and other requirements were relatively comparable for the two years.       Cash Flow from Investing Activities       Cash used for investing  activities  totaled  $22.5  million in 2000.  Cash requirements for capital  expenditures  were $22.8 million,  partially offset by $4.0 million of proceeds  from the sale of assets.  In 1999,  cash flow used for investing  activities  totaled  $15.8  million  primarily  for $19.4  million of capital  expenditures  partially  offset by a $2.5                                          23   million  repayment  of a note  receivable  from  Foamex  International  and $1.5 million of proceeds from Foamex L.P.'s packaging  business.  Foamex L.P. expects capital expenditures for 2001 to be approximately $17.0 million,  which includes the  completion  of a fourth  VPF(SM)  facility.  In  addition,  Foamex  L.P. is continuing to explore the possible  implementation of a new ERP software system, but no significant expenditures are anticipated for the balance of 2001.       Cash Flow from Financing Activities       Cash used for  financing  activities  was $22.9 million in 2000 compared to cash used of $43.8 million in 1999. As discussed  previously,  the $34.0 million Foamex/GFI  Note was  repaid  during the first  quarter of 2000 with  borrowings under the Foamex L.P. revolving credit facility. The remaining cash requirements for financing  activities  primarily reflected other debt repayments.  Cash used for financing  activities in 1999 was primarily due to net debt repayments,  net distributions  paid to partners and costs  incurred to amend  certain  financing agreements.       Financial Condition       Based on the business  outlook  discussed  above,  coupled with  forecasted capital  expenditures  in 2001 of  approximately  $17.0  million,  Foamex L.P.'s targeted debt reduction is approximately $35.0 million in the coming year.       The Foamex  L.P.  Credit  Facility  contains  certain  quarterly  financial covenants which become more  restrictive  during 2001.  Foamex L.P.  anticipates that it will continue to comply in 2001 with the quarterly  financial  covenants in the Foamex L.P.  Credit  Facility.  Management's  current  business  plan for Foamex L.P.  anticipate  customer  selling price increases in response to higher raw material  costs,  improved  working  capital  management,  a reduced capital expenditure  program,  declining  interest rates,  successful  implementation of on-going  cost savings  initiatives  and improved  operating  efficiencies.  The achievement  of the business plan is necessary for  compliance  with the various financial covenants in 2001.       The possibility exists that certain financial  covenants will not be met if business  conditions are other than as anticipated  or other  unforeseen  events impact  results.  In the absence of a waiver of or amendment  to such  financial covenants,  such  noncompliance  would constitute a default under the applicable debt agreements, and the lenders would be entitled to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness  outstanding  thereunder.  In the event that such noncompliance appears  likely,  or occurs,  Foamex L.P.  will seek the  lenders'  approvals of amendments to, or waivers of, such  financial  covenants.  Historically,  Foamex L.P. has been able to renegotiate  financial covenants and/or obtain waivers, as required,  and  management  believes  such waivers  and/or  amendments  could be obtained if required. However, there can be no assurance of future amendments or waivers will be obtained.       Foamex L.P. Credit Facility       At December 31, 2000,  Foamex L.P. had a credit  facility (the "Foamex L.P. Credit  Facility")  with a group of banks which provided for a revolving  credit facility  commitment of $177.5  million and three term loans with an outstanding balance  totaling $248.8  million.  Included in the group of banks that provides the  Foamex  L.P.  Credit  Facility  is The  Bank of  Nova  Scotia,  which  is a shareholder  of Foamex  International,  as discussed  below.  Amendments in 1998 provided for a $2.5 million  quarterly  reduction of the availability  under the revolving credit facility,  which extends through June 2003. On January 2, 2001, the revolving  credit  facility  commitment  was $175.0  million with the fourth quarter 2000 reduction applied on January 2nd because the last day of 2000 was a Sunday.       Borrowings  under the Foamex L.P.  Credit  Facility are  collateralized  by substantially  all of the assets of Foamex  L.P.  on a pari passu basis with the IRBs (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements); however, the rights of the holders of the applicable  issue of the IRBs to receive  payment upon the disposition  of the  collateral  securing  such  issue  of  the  IRBs  has  been preserved.       In response to financial  conditions at year-end  1998,  amendments to debt agreements  were executed  during the first half of 1999. As a result the Foamex L.P.  Credit  Facility,  which was amended and  restated in February  1998,  was further amended and restated in June 1999 to modify financial  covenants for net worth,  interest  coverage,                                          24   fixed charge coverage and leverage  ratios through  December 2006. The agreement was also amended to no longer permit Foamex L.P. to make certain cash  payments, including  the  payment  of an  annual  management  fee  of  $3.0  million  to a subsidiary  of Trace and  distributions  to Foamex  International,  and to limit future  investments in foreign  subsidiaries and joint ventures.  The "change of control"  definition  under the  agreement  was also  modified to conform to the definition  discussed  in  "change  of  control"  in Note 1 to the  consolidated financial statements. Changes in the interest rate structure, effective in 2000, were also made and are discussed below.  Foamex L.P. was in compliance with this agreement at year-end 2000 and 1999.       At year-end 2000,  interest was based on the combination of a variable rate consisting of the higher of (i) the base rate of The Bank of Nova Scotia or (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5% plus a margin. The margins for revolving,  Term B, Term C and Term D loans were 2.25%, 2.50%, 2.75% and 2.875%, respectively. At the option of Foamex L.P.,  portions of the  outstanding  loans are  convertible into LIBOR  based  loans plus 1.0% added to the margins  identified  above.  The effective  interest rates for the Foamex L.P. Credit Facility at the end of 2000 ranged between 10.31% and 10.69%.       Effective  January 1, 2000,  the interest  rate on  outstanding  borrowings under the Foamex L.P.  Credit  Facility  will  increase by 25 basis  points each quarter that Foamex L.P.'s  leverage  ratio,  as defined,  exceeds 5.00 to 1.00. Once the leverage ratio is reduced below this level,  the  cumulative  amount of any 25 basis point  adjustments  to the interest  rate on borrowings is reset to zero.  During 2000,  basis point  adjustments  were  incurred in the first three quarters,  beginning with 25 basis points in the first quarter and ending with a cumulative impact of 75 basis points by the end of the third quarter. There were no basis point adjustments for the fourth quarter of 2000. At December 31, 2000, the calculated  leverage ratio was 5.3 to 1.00.  Consequently,  a 25 basis point adjustment will be applicable for the calculation of interest in 2001, effective upon delivery of the financial statements to the lenders.       Available  borrowings  under the revolving  credit  facility  totaled $10.5 million at year-end  2000.  Letters of credit  outstanding  at December 31, 2000 totaled $21.1 million.       As part of the Foamex L.P.  Credit  Facility,  excess  cash flow  generated annually,  as defined,  is required to prepay portions of Term B, C and D loans. There was no  required  prepayment  at  year-end  2000.  The  prepayment  amount determined 1999 was $13.3 million and was financed through revolving loans under the facility.  The 1999 required  payment was made during the second  quarter of 2000.  Buyout Proposals - History       On  February  9,  2000,  Foamex  International  announced  that  it  was in discussions  with  respect to a proposal  involving  the  acquisition  of all of Foamex  International's  outstanding common stock for cash. Foamex International stated that the proposal was subject to a number of  conditions,  including  the buyer's  due  diligence  and the  execution  of  definitive  agreements.  Foamex International  agreed to an exclusive  negotiating  period  ending five business days after  delivery  of its  audited  financial  statements  included in Foamex International's Annual Report on Form 10-K to the prospective buyer. On April 5, 2000, Foamex  International  announced that discussions with the potential buyer were  terminated  with no agreement  having been reached.  Foamex  International subsequently  terminated  the  engagement  of J.P.  Morgan & Company,  Inc. ("JP Morgan"),  which acted as financial advisor in connection with such transaction. During the second quarter of 2000, Foamex  International  ended discussions with JP Morgan concerning an additional engagement.       On  August  5,  1999,  Foamex  International  announced  that its  Board of Directors signed a letter of intent with Sorgenti Chemical  Industries,  LLC and Liberty  Partners  Holdings  20,  LLC  (collectively,  the  "Purchasers")  for a business  combination   providing  for  $11.50  per  share  for  all  of  Foamex International's outstanding common stock (the "Sorgenti Transaction"). Under the terms of the letter of intent, if Foamex  International  entered into a business combination  with another party,  the Purchasers would be entitled to a break-up fee of $6.0 million plus  reimbursement of certain expenses,  subject to certain conditions,  including  the  willingness  of  the  Purchasers  to  enter  into a definitive  merger agreement  providing for a price of at least $11.50 per share prior to the expiration of the letter of intent.  The proposed  transaction  was subject to a number of  conditions,  including  the  negotiation  of  definitive documents  regarding certain  conditions  relating to the bank credit facilities and the public debt of Foamex  International's  subsidiaries.  Additional issues considered included minimum shareholder acceptance,  change of                                          25   board membership,  and other provisions  providing for a higher break-up fee and expense   reimbursement  if  Foamex   International   entered  into  a  business combination providing a more favorable transaction. On December 15, 1999, Foamex International announced that the letter of intent with the Purchasers, which had been extended,  expired by its terms. The Purchasers had submitted a revised bid at a price and on terms that were less  favorable  than those  contained  in the letter of intent and the Negotiating  Committee of Foamex  International's Board of Directors rejected the revised bid.       In 1998, Foamex International  received an unsolicited buyout proposal from Trace,  Foamex  International's  principal  stockholder.   Foamex  International entered into two merger agreements, which were subsequently terminated by Trace.  Foamex International Shareholder and Change in Control Developments       Trace is a privately held company,  which owned approximately 29% of Foamex International's outstanding voting common stock at September 30, 2000, and whose former  Chairman  also  serves  as  Foamex  International's   Chairman.   Foamex International's  common stock owned by Trace was pledged as  collateral  against certain of Trace's  obligations.  The Foamex Credit  Facility  pursuant to which approximately  $351.1  million of principal was  outstanding as of September 30, 2000, provided that a "change of control" would be an event of default and could result in the acceleration of such indebtedness.  "Change of control" means, for this purpose, that (i) a person or related group, other than Trace, beneficially owns more than 25% of Foamex  International's  outstanding voting stock and (ii) such voting stock constitutes a greater percentage of such voting stock than the amount beneficially owned by Trace.  Additionally,  certain indentures of Foamex L.P. and Foamex  Capital  Corporation  ("FCC")  relating to senior  subordinated notes of $248.0 million contain similar  "change of control"  provisions,  which require Foamex L.P. and FCC to tender for such notes at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if there is such a "change of control".       On July 21, 1999, Foamex  International was informed by Trace that it filed a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the  Bankruptcy  Code in Federal Court in New York  City.  Subsequently,  on  January  24,  2000,  an order was  signed converting the Trace  bankruptcy  from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. A trustee was  appointed  to oversee the  liquidation  of Trace's  assets. Neither Trace's  bankruptcy filing nor the conversion to Chapter 7 constituted a "change of control" under the provisions of the debt agreements described above.       On July 31, 2000, Foamex  International  announced that it had entered into an agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with The Bank of Nova Scotia relating to a portion of the 7,197,426 shares of Foamex International's common stock pledged by Trace to The Bank of Nova  Scotia.  The Exchange  Agreement  provided for the transfer of the pledged  stock to The Bank of Nova Scotia in a manner that would not constitute a "change of control" as described above. These transactions were conditioned upon bankruptcy court approval of a settlement agreement between The Bank of Nova Scotia and the trustee for the Trace bankruptcy,  which was entered on October 18, 2000. On November 2, 2000, the  transactions  contemplated by the Exchange  Agreement and the settlement  agreement were consummated,  and did not constitute a "change of control".  As a result,  Trace no longer owns any shares of Foamex International's common stock.       Under the Exchange  Agreement,  The Bank of Nova Scotia initially  received 1,500,000  shares  of  Foamex   International's  common  stock  from  the  Trace bankruptcy estate and exchanged these common stock shares for 15,000 shares of a new  class  of  Foamex  International's  non-voting  non-redeemable  convertible preferred  stock (the  "Series B Preferred  Stock").  Each share of the Series B Preferred  Stock can be  converted  into 100  shares  of Foamex  International's common stock but only if such conversion would not trigger a "change of control" event,  as  discussed  above.  The Series B  Preferred  Stock (a) is entitled to dividends only if a dividend is declared on Foamex International's common stock, (b) ranks senior to any future  preferred  stock issued by Foamex  International and (c) is entitled to a  liquidation  preference  of $100 per share.  Following this  exchange,  The Bank of Nova  Scotia  became  the  owner of  24.41%  of the outstanding  shares of Foamex  International's  common stock when the  remaining 5,697,426 shares of Foamex  International's common stock were transferred to The Bank of Nova Scotia from the Trace bankruptcy estate.                                          26   Environmental and Health and Safety Matters       Foamex L.P. is subject to  extensive  and changing  environmental  laws and regulations.  Expenditures to date in connection  with Foamex L.P.'s  compliance with  such  laws and  regulations  did not have a  material  adverse  effect  on operations,  financial position,  capital expenditures or competitive  position. Liabilities recorded by Foamex L.P. in connection with environmental  matters as of December  31, 2000  totaled $3.1  million.  Although it is possible  that new information  or future  developments  could require  Foamex L.P. to reassess its potential  exposure  to  all  pending  environmental  matters,  including  those described in the consolidated  financial statements,  Foamex L.P. believes that, based upon all  currently  available  information,  the  resolution  of all such pending  environmental  matters will not have a  significant  adverse  effect on Foamex  L.P.'s  operations,   financial   position,   capital   expenditures  or competitive position.       On November  14, 2000,  the United  States  Occupational  Safety and Health Administration  ("OSHA")  released the final  ergonomics  standard  ("Ergonomics Standard"),  which applies to Foamex L.P., as well as all other employers in the United  States,  with  certain  industry  specific  exclusions.  The  Ergonomics Standard   addresses   musculoskeletal   disorders,   including  those  commonly referenced as repetitive motion disorders.       The  Ergonomics  Standard  is  comprehensive,   covering   essentially  all employees of Foamex L.P. in the United States. Although the implementation costs could be significant,  in the present form, Foamex L.P. does not believe it will have a negative impact on the its competitive position within the industry.       Subsequent to year-end 2000, a joint  resolution by the United States House of  Representatives  and  Senate  was  approved  that  repealed  the  Ergonomics Standard.  The repeal has been  submitted to the  President of the United States for his review and signature.  Inflation and Other Matters       On  average,  inflation  rates  for the  domestic  economy  continue  to be relatively  low.  Although  long-term  inflation rates are difficult to predict, Foamex L.P.  believes it has the flexibility in operations and capital structure to maintain a competitive  position. In recent years, results of operations were adversely  affected  by raw  material  cost  increases.  The  price  of the  two principal chemicals used, TDI and polyol, is influenced by demand, manufacturing capacity  and oil prices.  Results for 2000 were  negatively  impacted by higher transportation  costs  related to oil price  increases  and higher costs for raw materials.  Foamex L.P.  attempts to offset raw material cost increases  through selling price  increases;  however,  there can be no assurance  that Foamex L.P. will be successful in implementing  selling price increases or that  competitive pricing pressure will not require Foamex L.P. to adjust selling prices.  Results of  operations  have  been  and  could  be  adversely   affected  by  delays  in implementing,  or the  inability  of Foamex L.P.  to  implement,  selling  price increases to offset raw material cost increases.  Accounting Changes  - Revenue Recognition and Presentation       The Securities and Exchange  Commission (the "SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB No. 101"). SAB No. 101, as amended,  was effective as of January 1, 2000 and was adopted in the fourth quarter of 2000. SAB No. 101 outlines the SEC's position that revenue should not be recognized until it is realized or realizable. Based on the review of the  SAB  No.  101  requirements,  no  significant  impact  was  incurred  or anticipated on the revenue recognition practices of Foamex L.P.       During  July 2000,  the  Emerging  Issues  Task  Force (the  "EITF") of the Financial  Accounting Standards Board reached a consensus on an issue concerning the components of revenue.  EITF No. 00-10 "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Revenues and Costs"  essentially  requires that shipping and handling costs that are billed to a customer be included in revenue. Foamex L.P. has determined that a portion of shipping  costs billed to certain  customers  prior to February 28, 1998 required a  reclassification  from costs of sales to revenue.  Accordingly, net sales for 1998 in the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  reflect the reclassification  required.  On a segment basis, the Carpet Cushion Products was the  only  business  segment  impacted  and  net  sales  for  1998  reflect  the reclassification required. All other shipping and handling costs associated with product shipments are reported in cost of goods sold.                                          27   Future Accounting Changes  - Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities       Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 133,  "Accounting  for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133") will require the fair value of  derivatives  be recognized in the  consolidated  balance  sheets. Changes in the fair value of  derivatives  will be  recognized in earnings or in other comprehensive loss, essentially depending on the structure and the purpose of  the  derivatives.  During  2000,  SFAS  No.  138,  "Accounting  for  Certain Derivative  Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities",  which amended SFAS No. 133 on a limited number of issues,  was issued. The statements will be effective for Foamex L.P. in the first quarter of 2001.       These  statements  create a  foundation  that will address  accounting  and reporting  issues  for  a  wide  range  of  financial   instruments  defined  as derivatives and related hedging activities. As of December 31, 2000, Foamex L.P. did not have any  derivatives,  as defined in the statements.  Accordingly,  the initial  adoption of the  statements  will not have a significant  impact on the results of operations  or financial  position of Foamex L.P. The adoption of the statements will require a reclassification  in the consolidated  balance sheets, effective in 2001.  Specifically,  $6.1 million  recognized  at year-end 2000 as liabilities will be reclassified to accumulated other  comprehensive  loss under partners'  deficit.  The amount  reclassified is the result of certain  interest rate swaps that were  terminated in prior years,  as discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated  financial statements.  The amount reclassified will continue to be amortized, with $0.9 million of amortization anticipated in 2001.  ITEM 7a.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Foamex L.P.'s debt securities  with variable  interest rates are subject to market risk for changes in interest  rates.  On December 31, 2000,  indebtedness with variable interest rates totaled $405.6 million.  On an annualized basis, if the interest rates on these debt  instruments  increased by 1%, interest expense would increase by  approximately  $4.1 million;  concomitantly  in fact interest rates have  decreased by 150 basis  points for a potential  savings in excess of $6.0 million for the year 2001.
