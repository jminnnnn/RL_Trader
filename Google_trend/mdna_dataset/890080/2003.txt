ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  Forward Looking Statements       The  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995  provides a "safe harbor"  for  forward-looking   statements  so  long  as  those  statements  are identified as  forward-looking  and are  accompanied  by  meaningful  cautionary statements  identifying  important  factors that could cause  actual  results to differ  materially from those projected in such  statements.  In connection with certain forward-looking  statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and  those  that may be made in the  future  by or on  behalf  of us  which  are identified as forward-looking, we note that there are various factors that could cause  actual  results  to differ  materially  from  those set forth in any such forward-looking  statements,  such as the ability to implement  customer selling price  increases in response to higher raw material  costs,  raw material  price increases, general economic conditions, the interest rate environment, the level of automotive production,  carpet production,  furniture and bedding production, and housing starts, the completion of various restructuring/consolidation plans, the achievement of management's  business plans,  our capital and debt structure (including various financial covenants), litigation and changes in environmental legislation  and  environmental  conditions.   The  forward-looking   statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were prepared by management and are qualified  by, and  subject to,  significant  business,  economic,  competitive, regulatory and other uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict and many of which are beyond our control.       Accordingly,  there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained  in this  Annual  Report on Form 10-K will be  realized or that actual results  will  not  be  significantly   higher  or  lower.  The  forward-looking statements  have not been audited by,  examined by,  compiled by or subjected to agreed-upon  procedures  by  independent  accountants,  and no third  party  has independently  verified  or  reviewed  such  statements.  Readers of this Annual Report on Form 10-K should  consider these facts in evaluating  the  information contained  herein.  In  addition,  our business  and  operations  are subject to substantial risks which increase the uncertainty inherent in the forward-looking statements  contained in this Annual  Report on Form 10-K.  The inclusion of the forward-looking  statements  contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as a  representation  by us or any other  person that any of the forward-looking  statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will be achieved. In light of the foregoing,  readers of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are  cautioned  not to place undue  reliance on the  forward-looking  statements contained herein.  Overview       We operate in the flexible  polyurethane and advanced polymer foam products industry.  Operations  were  conducted  directly  and through  our  wholly-owned subsidiaries,  Foamex Canada,  Foamex Mexico and Foamex Asia.  Business segments are listed below and business segment financial  information is included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.       An executive vice president heads each of our principal operating segments. Each executive vice president is responsible for developing budgets and plans as well as  directing  the  operations  of the  segment.  The  performance  of each operating  segment is  measured  based upon income  from  operations,  excluding restructuring,  impairment and other charges. We do not allocate  restructuring, impairment  and  other  charges  to  operating  segments  because  many  of  our facilities produce products for multiple segments.       Foam  Products -  manufactures  and markets  cushioning  foams for bedding,      furniture,  packaging and health care applications, and foam-based consumer      products, such as mattress pads and children's furniture.       Carpet Cushion Products - manufactures and distributes rebond,  prime, felt      and rubber carpet padding.       Automotive Products - distributes automotive foam products and laminates to      major Tier 1 suppliers and original equipment manufacturers, or "OEMs".                                           15         Technical  Products  -  manufactures  and  markets  reticulated  and  other      specialty foams used for  reservoiring,  filtration,  gasketing and sealing      applications.       Other - primarily  consists of certain  manufacturing  operations in Mexico      City,  corporate  expenses not allocated to the other business segments and      restructuring, impairment and other charges (credits).       Our sales are  primarily to markets in the United  States.  These sales are impacted by economic conditions in several sectors of the United States economy, including consumer spending,  sales of new and existing homes, the overall level of  passenger  car and light truck  production  and  seasonality.  We  typically experience  two  seasonally  slow periods during each year, in early July and in late December, due to scheduled plant shutdowns and holidays.       A small  number of major  customers  produce a  significant  portion of our sales.  In 2002,  our largest  customer  provided 17.3% of our net sales and our five largest customers  provided 33.8% of our net sales. Two of the five largest customers  are  customers  of the  Automotive  Products  segment  and  three are customers of the Foam Products segment.       There  are a limited  number  of  suppliers  of TDI and  polyol,  the major chemicals  used in the  production  of foam.  Our  principal  supplier  of these chemicals  has  historically  been The Dow Chemical  Company.  While we have not experienced  shortages of raw  materials,  a disruption in our ability to obtain these chemicals would have a material adverse effect on our business.       TDI and polyol are oil-based  chemicals  and, as such,  the prices of these chemicals are significantly influenced by crude oil production and prices and by world  political  instability,  particularly in the Middle East. The conflict in that  part of the  world  could  significantly  impact  the  price of these  raw materials.       The  following   discussion   should  be  read  in  conjunction   with  the consolidated  financial  statements  and related  notes  included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Overview of 2002       Operations       We had income from operations of $45.5 million in the six months ended June 30,  2002 and a loss from  operations  of $3.2  million in the six months  ended December 29, 2002.  Contributing factors to this significant negative turnaround in operating results included the following:       o    Significant  increases  in raw  material  prices  from major  chemical           manufacturers  reduced our gross profit margin from 12.7% in the first           half of 2002 to 8.7% in the second half of 2002. We experienced  20.0%           to 25.0% increases in raw material  prices  beginning in June 2002 and           further  10%  increases  beginning  in  November  2002.  The two price           increases  raised raw  material  costs by 32.0% to 37.0% by the end of           2002. We achieved only limited  success in raising  selling  prices to           offset these cost increases during 2002.       o    Selling, general and administrative expenses were $39.7 million in the           first half of 2002 and $54.6 million in the second half of 2002.  This           increase was partially  attributable  to  organizational  and proposed           public  offering  costs of $3.6  million  related to the  formation of           Symphonex  Inc., a proposed new  subsidiary  which would have included           our Technical Products segment and other related activities,  and $1.3           million  of costs  associated  with the  proposed  sale of our  Carpet           Cushion  Products  segment.  The public offering of Symphonex Inc. has           been deferred indefinitely and the proposed sale of the Carpet Cushion           Products segment has been terminated.  In addition, in the second half           of 2002 we experienced an increase in professional fees, primarily due           to  information  technology  consulting  and  accounting  fees, and an           increase in bad debt expense,  primarily due to one large write off of           the balance due from a customer that ceased operations.                                           16         o    Restructuring,  impairment and other charges increased $6.3 million in           the second half of the year compared to the first six months.       Our  results  for 2003 will be  principally  dependent  on our  success  in maintaining  and increasing  margins  through  selling price  increases and cost efficiencies  to  offset  past  and  future  raw  material  cost  increases.  We implemented  significant price increases in late 2002, but further selling price increases are needed to increase gross profit margins to acceptable  levels.  We are developing  alternative  sources of supply for raw materials in an effort to stabilize and reduce raw material  costs. We also expect the  reorganization  of our facilities,  operations and management to result in savings of approximately $8.0 to $10.0 million on an  annualized  basis,  in addition to the  anticipated annualized  savings of  approximately  $25.0 to $27.0  million from the business reorganization that began in the fourth quarter of 2001.       There were a number of unusual items that impacted 2002. Accounting changes as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 142,   "Goodwill  and  Other  Intangible  Assets"  and  Statement  of  Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business  Combinations"  produced a net charge to income of $72.0  million.  We had net  extraordinary  charges as a result of the early extinguishment of debt in the amount of $2.8 million.       Financing       On March 25, 2002,  we completed a  refinancing  of a major  portion of our debt structure.  The  refinancing  included the issuance of $300.0 million of 10 3/4% Senior  Secured  Notes due April 1, 2009 and  amendment  of the Foamex L.P. credit  facility  ("Amended  Credit  Facility")  to provide  for term loans with maturity dates of June 30, 2005 through  December 29, 2006, and a $100.0 million revolving  credit facility that matures on June 30, 2005. Net proceeds were used to pay a portion of debt outstanding  under the credit facility and the proceeds from a new term loan under the Amended  Credit  Facility  was used to repay debt due to a related party. Additionally,  the financial debt covenants contained in the Amended  Credit  Facility  were  adjusted to reflect  changes in the capital structure and business environment. Subsequently, we purchased and retired $49.0 million of the 13 1/2% senior  subordinated  notes,  including  unamortized debt premium of $2.5  million,  and $1.5  million of the 9 7/8%  senior  subordinated notes.       On November 15, 2002, we and our bank lenders  executed an amendment to the Amended  Credit  Facility.  We would  have been  unable to comply  with  certain financial  covenants as of September 29, 2002.  Under the amendment,  compliance with certain existing  covenants was suspended  through  September 28, 2003 with the covenants revised and reinstated thereafter. Instead, Foamex L.P. is subject to other  financial  covenants  through  December 28, 2003 and was in compliance with such covenants at December 29, 2002. A minimum EBDAIT, as defined, covenant is tested  monthly,  on a cumulative  basis  beginning  with  December  2002, in addition  to  revised  minimum  net  worth,  as  defined,  and  maximum  capital expenditures,  as defined, covenants,  measured quarterly. Our ability to comply with the EBDAIT covenant will be  substantially  dependent on the achievement of an improved gross profit margin and reduction of  administrative  costs compared to the last six months of 2002. Additionally, we are subject to a borrowing base calculation that may limit our ability to borrow funds in the future.       Critical Accounting Policies       We prepared  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States of America.  As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates, judgments  and  assumptions  affect  the  reported  amounts  of the  assets  and liabilities and revenues and expenses.  Our significant  accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The accounting policies  which we believe are the most  critical to aid in fully  understanding and evaluating our reported  financial  results and which require  management to exercise judgment include the following:                                           17         Revenue Recognition       We  record  net sales  when  product  title and risk of loss  passes to the customer,  which is primarily at the time of shipment.  Net sales are reduced by allowances for estimated discounts,  returns and customer rebates.  Balances for allowances  and rebates  are  reviewed at least  quarterly  and are  adjusted if warranted.       Account Receivable and Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts       We actively monitor  customer  payments in conjunction with customer credit evaluations.  Accordingly,  an estimate of uncollectible  accounts is maintained and  is  based  on  historical   collection  experience  and  specific  customer collection  issues.  A significant  change in the financial  condition of one or more of our larger  customers  could have a  material  adverse  impact on future financial results.       Long-Lived Assets       We have a significant  investment in long-lived assets consisting primarily of property,  plant and equipment.  Impairment losses are recognized when events indicate  that certain  long-lived  assets may be impaired  and a projection  of future  undiscounted  cash  flows  generated  from the  assets are less than the current  carrying value of the assets.  These cash flow projections are based on the  combination  of historical  results  adjusted for  estimated  future market conditions  and  operating  plans.  To the extent that these  estimates  change, impairment  losses  could have a  material  adverse  impact on future  financial results.       Self Insurance       We are partially  self-insured  for a number of risks up to certain  limits including  workers  compensation,  medical,  automobile  and general  liability. Commercial  insurance  policies  are  carried  for  amounts  in  excess  of  the self-insured  amounts.  Management exercises  significant judgment in estimating the ultimate liability for claims.       Retiree Benefit Plans       We provide  defined benefit pension plans that cover most of our employees. Projected  benefit  obligations,  pension expense and amounts  included in other comprehensive income are impacted by a number of assumptions.  These assumptions include the discount  rate on projected  benefit  obligations,  and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.  The discount rate on projected benefit obligations enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the  measurement  date. We have little latitude in selecting this rate, as it is required to represent the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments. A lower  discount rate  increases the present value of benefit  obligations  and increases  pension  expense.  The  decrease in the  discount  rate on  projected benefit obligations from 7.0% to 6.5% is expected to increase pension expense by $0.5 million. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets,  we consider  the current and  expected  asset  allocations,  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets. We assumed that long-term returns on our pension plans were 9.0% in 2002 and 2001 and 10.0% in 2000.  Amortization  of losses  has been and  continues  to be a  significant component of pension  expense and this  amortization  is expected to increase by approximately $1.0 million in 2003. The losses have resulted from actual returns that are significantly  less than the expected return  assumption,  particularly over the last three years,  and funding levels that have not been  sufficient to offset the growth in benefit obligations.  We expect pension expense to increase by a total of approximately $2.0 million in 2003.       Claims and Litigation       We receive claims for damages that are outside of our insurance  coverages. Management  evaluates these claims and records its estimate of liabilities  when such  liabilities are considered  probable and an amount or reasonable range can be estimated.                                          18          Environmental Remediation       We have a number of  manufacturing  facilities and certain idle  facilities that require remediation of soil and/or groundwater  contamination.  As required by applicable State and/or Federal compliance programs,  many of these sites are in the monitoring stage that requires periodic sampling of contamination  levels in conjunction with ongoing assessments of remediation actions. Accordingly, the recognition  of  environmental  liabilities  requires  estimates  concerning the duration of monitoring and  associated  costs,  often  projected to extend for a number  of  years.  To  the  extent  that  these  estimates  change,  additional environmental  costs could have a material  adverse  impact on future  financial results.  See the section below entitled  "Environmental  Health and Safety" for additional information.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Our operating cash requirements consist principally of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable  requirements,  scheduled payments of interest on outstanding indebtedness,  capital expenditures,  and employee benefit plans. We believe that cash flow from our operating activities,  cash on hand and periodic borrowings  under  our  credit  facility  will be  adequate  to  meet  liquidity requirements. Scheduled principal payments on our debt are not significant until the second  half of 2004.  If our cash flow is not  adequate  to meet  liquidity requirements, there would be a material adverse effect on our financial position as well as our ability to continue as a going concern.       Cash and cash  equivalents  were $4.4 million at December 29, 2002 compared to $15.1 million at December 31, 2001.  Working capital at December 29, 2002 was $118.0 million and the current ratio was 1.6 to 1 compared to working capital at December 31, 2001 of $63.6 million and a current ratio of 1.3 to 1. The increase in working  capital is primarily  due to increases  in accounts  receivable  and inventories  and  decreases in current  portion of  long-term  debt and accounts payable,  partially offset by decreases in other current assets and increases in accrued interest and cash overdrafts.       Total  debt at  December  29,  2002 was  $738.6  million,  a $72.3  million increase  from December 31, 2001,  including a deferred  credit of $14.2 million related to  interest  rate swap  transactions.  (See Note 8 to the  consolidated financial  statements.)  As of December 29, 2002,  there were  revolving  credit borrowings  of $51.8 million  under the Foamex L.P.  credit  facility with $27.6 million  available  for  borrowings  and  $20.6  million  of  letters  of credit outstanding.  Foamex  Canada  did not  have  any  outstanding  borrowings  as of December 29, 2002 under Foamex Canada's  short-term  revolving credit agreement, with unused  availability  of  approximately  $5.1 million.  The increased  debt balance  reflects the issuance of $300.0 million of 10 3/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2009 on March 25, 2002,  offset by $280.0  million of debt  repayments  from proceeds of the  offering.  Revolving  credit  borrowings  at December  29, 2002 reflect working capital requirements.       In 2002,  we  purchased  and  retired  $49.0  million of the 13 1/2% senior subordinated notes, including unamortized debt premium of $2.5 million, and $1.5 million of the 9 7/8% senior  subordinated  notes for a total  purchase price of $48.5 million.       On  October  16,  2002,  we  announced  that we had  obtained  a waiver  of financial  covenants  under the Amended  Credit  Facility  for the period  ended September  29,  2002  since  we  would  not  have  been in  compliance  with the covenants.  The waiver was  effective  until  November  30, 2002 and reduced the commitment  under the revolving  credit  facility  from $100.0  million to $70.0 million for the period the waiver was in effect.  On November 15,  2002,  we and our bank lenders executed an amendment to the Amended Credit Facility. Under the amendment,  we are subject to minimum net worth, minimum EBDAIT, as defined, and maximum capital expenditure  covenants through periods ending December 28, 2003. The minimum EBDAIT  covenant is tested monthly on a cumulative  basis  beginning with December 2002. We were in compliance with the revised covenants at December 29, 2002. In addition, we were subject to a minimum EBDAIT, as defined, covenant for the quarter ended September 29, 2002 and were in compliance. Compliance with existing  covenants on leverage,  fixed  charge  coverage and interest  coverage ratios is suspended through periods ending September 28, 2003, but the covenants are revised and will be reinstated thereafter.  All the financial covenants were established  based on a business  plan  provided to the  lenders.  In  addition, borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility will be subject to a borrowing base calculation, which could limit borrowings under the revolving credit facility to less than the maximum  commitment.  As of February 23,                                          19     2003, the borrowing base calculation does not limit borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility.  The cost of obtaining the amendment  aggregated  approximately $4.0 million, including bank and legal fees.       On February 26, 2003, Standard and Poor's Rating Services ("S&P") announced that it had lowered its corporate credit rating on Foamex L.P. from "B+" to "B". In their announcement, S&P cited their view that our weak operating performance, higher  raw  material  costs,  and a  sluggish  domestic  economy,  which if not reversed will likely elevate near-term liquidity concerns.  The S&P action could have a negative  impact on the cost of our future  borrowings,  if any,  and the extension of trade credit.       Our minimum EBDAIT  covenants have higher  thresholds in the second half of 2003.  Management's  current plans to achieve EBDAIT covenants require continued customer  selling  price  management  in response to raw material  cost changes, successful implementation of on-going cost savings initiatives,  plant closures, improved operating efficiencies, improved working capital management and reduced capital  expenditures.  Management  is also  continuing  to  evaluate  strategic alternatives in an effort to reduce our debt.  There can be no assurance that we will be  successful  in  achieving  our  plans or  complying  with  the  amended covenants,  as there are a number of factors  beyond our control,  including raw material cost changes and customer  acceptances of selling price  increases that are  necessary  for  us to be  successful.  Additionally,  compliance  with  the financial covenants may not be met if business conditions are not as anticipated or other unforeseen  events impact results  unfavorably.  In the event that such noncompliance  appears  likely,  or occurs,  we will seek the  lenders'  further approval  of   amendments   to,  or  waivers  of,  such   financial   covenants. Historically, we have been able to renegotiate financial covenants and/or obtain waivers.  Management currently believes that obtaining waivers and/or amendments in the future may be difficult,  or not possible,  if required. If amendments or waivers  are not  obtained,  we would be in default  and  lenders  could  demand immediate payment of our outstanding debt under the Amended Credit Facility.  In addition, it is possible that the holders of our Senior Secured Notes and Senior Subordinated  Notes could also demand immediate  payment.  We may not be able to secure  additional  financing  at a  reasonable  cost,  or at all.  The  lack of financing  would have a material  adverse  effect on our financial  position and could impair our ability to continue as a going concern.       During 2002, we purchased,  pursuant to the terms of an existing agreement, the 5% stock  interest held by the director of Foamex de Mexico S.A. de C.V. for a cash  payment of $1.0  million.  In  addition,  during 2002 we entered into an employment  agreement with one director and a consulting  agreement with another director.  Payments  under  these  agreements  were to  aggregate  at least $0.7 million and $0.2  million,  respectively,  on an annual  basis.  The  employment agreement with the director was terminated effective January 31, 2003.       We were required to cause a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 for our 10 3/4% Senior Secured Notes to be effective  within 180 days of March 25, 2002. We filed the  registration  statement,  but it was not effective until January 30, 2003 and therefore we are liable for  liquidated  damages from September 23, 2002 until January 30, 2003.  The  liquidated  damages were at the rate of $15,000 per week for the first 90 days,  escalating  by $15,000 per week for each additional 90 days until a maximum of $150,000 per week is reached.  At December 29, 2002, we had an accrual for liquidated damages of $0.2 million.       Effective  May 1,  2002,  we  completed  a series  of  interest  rate  swap transactions with notional amounts  aggregating  $300.0 million.  We designated, documented  and accounted for these  interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of our 10 3/4% Senior  Secured  Notes due April 1, 2009.  The risk being  hedged in these  transactions  was the change in fair value of the 10 3/4% Senior  Secured Notes based on changes in the  benchmark  interest  rate,  LIBOR.  The effect of these interest rate swap  transactions was to convert the fixed interest rate on the 10 3/4%  Senior  Secured  Notes to  floating  rates  reset twice per year to correspond with the interest payment dates for the 10 3/4% Senior Secured Notes. On  September  18,  2002,  we unwound the  interest  rate swap  transactions  in exchange  for a net cash  proceeds  of $18.4  million,  including  $3.6  million realized through lower effective interest rates while the swap transactions were in effect. The unwinding  resulted in a deferred credit of $14.8 million,  which will be amortized over the term of the 10 3/4% Senior  Secured Notes,  using the effective interest rate method.                                          20          Cash Flow from Operating Activities       Cash used in operating  activities  in 2002 was $49.6  million  compared to cash  provided of $108.7  million in the 2001  reflecting  significantly  higher working capital  requirements  principally  relating to inventories and accounts payable.       Cash Flow from Investing Activities       Cash used in investing  activities  totaled  $21.1  million for 2002.  Cash requirements  included  capital  expenditures of $15.6 million.  Other investing activities include software  development costs of $5.9 million in 2002. In 2001, cash used in  investing  activities  was $38.1  million,  which  included  $22.5 million of capital expenditures and $17.6 million for an acquisition.  Estimated capital   expenditures  for  2003  are  approximately  $19.0  million  including approximately $1.5 million for safety and environmental activities. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $6.8 million for internally  developed software in 2003, a portion of which may be capitalized.       Cash Flow from Financing Activities       Cash provided by financing activities was $60.0 million in 2002 compared to cash used of $60.4 million in 2001. We completed the offering of $300.0  million of 10 3/4% Senior Secured Notes on March 25, 2002. We used $280.0 million of net proceeds from these notes and $56.6 million of new term loans to repay revolving loans of $125.0  million,  term loans of $140.0  million and long-term debt to a related party of $31.6  million.  We also purchased and retired $49.0 million of the 13 1/2% senior  subordinated  notes,  including  unamortized debt premium of $2.5 million and $1.5 million of the 9 7/8% senior subordinated notes. Cash used during 2001 primarily reflected debt repayments.       Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments       At December 29, 2002, we had obligations to repay a total of $722.0 million of principal of long-term  debt  borrowed  under a number of  arrangements.  The amortization  schedule for our long-term  debt payments is included in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.  At December 29, 2002, we had outstanding letters of credit aggregating $20.6 million.       We also have  commitments  for operating  leases as discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated  financial  statements that require minimum  payments  totaling $52.2 million,  with $44.5 million due through December 31, 2007 and the balance in later years.  We have  entered  into  contracts  for  information  technology services  and certain  raw  materials  that have  minimum  purchase  commitments estimated at $84.8  million in 2003,  $98.0  million in 2004,  $39.9  million in 2005, $39.4 million in 2006, $36.1 million in 2007 and $32.2 million for each of the years 2008 to 2010.

The  increase  was  primarily  attributable  to improved  sales in the Automotive  Products and  Technical  Products  segments,  partially  offset by a decrease  in the Foam  Products  segment.  The  improvement  in sales  partially reflected the impact of sales related to the acquisition  discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.       The gross profit margin was $141.4  million,  or 10.6%, in 2002 compared to $180.1  million,  or 14.4%,  in 2001 primarily as a result of the 32.0% to 37.0% increases in the cost of our major chemical raw materials during the second half of 2002.  The gross profit  margin was further  reduced by higher  manufacturing costs  principally  in the Foam Products  segment,  unfavorable  yields,  higher manufacturing overhead expense and unfavorable production mix. We are seeking to improve gross profit margins through customer selling price increases, selective elimination of unprofitable  customer  accounts and products,  and reductions in manufacturing overhead expenses.       Income from  operations  for 2002 was $42.3  million,  which  represented a 34.6% decrease from the $64.7 million reported for 2001.  Income from operations was  3.2% of net  sales in 2002  compared  to 5.2% of net  sales  in  2001.  The decrease  attributable to the reduced gross profit margin is discussed above. In addition,  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  increased  by $15.0 million,  or 19.0%,  which included $3.6 million of organizational  and proposed public  offering  costs related to the formation of Symphonex  Inc. The proposed public  offering of Symphonex  Inc.  has been  deferred  indefinitely.  Selling, general and  administrative  expenses  also include $1.3 million of  transaction costs  associated with the proposed sale of our Carpet Cushion  Products segment which was subsequently  terminated.  The remainder of the increase was primarily due  to  higher  professional  service  fees  for  information   technology  and accounting  services and employee related expenses,  partially offset by reduced goodwill amortization and lower bad debt expense.       Foam Products       Foam  Products  net sales for 2002  decreased  5.7% to $471.0  million from $499.7 million in 2001. The decrease primarily  reflected  reduction in business from a major bedding  manufacturer  and the slow recovery of sales after an odor issue caused by defective  chemicals  from a major  supplier in late 2001.  Foam Products gross profit margin was 10.8% in 2002, down from 17.9% in 2001.  Income from operations  decreased 64.0%, to $24.0 million in 2002 from $66.6 million in 2001,  primarily due to increased raw material costs, lower net sales and higher manufacturing  costs. Income from operations was 5.1% of net sales in 2002, down from 13.3% in 2001.                                           22         Carpet Cushion Products       Carpet Cushion Products net sales for 2002 increased 1.3% to $234.0 million from $231.0  million in 2001. We were able to increase our market share in spite of market  weakness and overcome the loss of sales to one large retail  customer that  exited  the  carpet  business.  Loss from  operations,  which  principally reflected higher raw material and other operating costs during 2002 and included expenses  of $1.3  million  in 2002  associated  with the  proposed  sale of the business which was  subsequently  terminated,  represented  5.3% of net sales in 2002 and 2.8% of net sales in 2001.       Automotive Products       Automotive  Products net sales for 2002  increased  23.6% to $466.7 million from $377.8 million in 2001.  The  improvement  primarily  reflected a continued high build rate for new cars and new  product  programs.  We have been  informed that our largest  customer  intends to reduce its purchases of certain  products from us in 2003 to diversify  its supply base.  This may result in reduced sales to this customer of up to $70.0  million in 2003,  some of which may be replaced by sales to other customers. Automotive Products gross profit margin was 8.2% in 2002  compared to 8.4% in 2001 and  reflects  the impact of higher raw  material costs  offsetting  the  contribution  from  increased  net  sales.  Income  from operations represented 5.4% of net sales in 2002 and 5.7% of net sales in 2001.       Technical Products       Net sales for Technical  Products in 2002 increased 11.8% to $124.1 million from $111.0 million in 2001.  Higher sales  partially  reflected  sales from the acquisition  of  General  Foam  Corporation  in  July  2001  (see  Note 3 to the consolidated  financial  statements).  Income from operations decreased 11.6% to $20.4 million in 2002 compared to $23.1 million in 2001.  The decrease  reflects the  contribution  from higher net sales offset by higher material costs and the costs  related to Symphonex  Inc. as  described  above.  Income from  operations represented 16.4% of net sales in 2002 compared to 20.8% in 2001.       Other       Other  primarily  consists of certain  manufacturing  operations  in Mexico City,  corporate  expenses not allocated to business segments and restructuring, impairment and other  charges.  The 3.7% decrease in net sales  associated  with this segment  primarily  resulted from the Mexico City operation.  The loss from operations was $15.1 million in 2002 and included restructuring,  impairment and other  charges,  discussed  below.  The loss from  operations  in 2001 was $39.9 million, including restructuring, impairment and other charges.       Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges       In 2002,  we recorded net  restructuring,  impairment  and other charges of $4.8 million.  Fourth quarter  charges of $10.0 million  included  severance and other  termination  benefits for  approximately 200 employees and exit costs and remaining  lease  payments  related  to  the  reorganization  of  executive  and corporate management and the closure of six operations.  Approximately 60 of the planned  terminations  occurred  during  2002.  The charges also  included  $2.5 million of asset impairments, primarily for leasehold improvements and machinery and  equipment  in the Carpet  Cushion  Products  segment.  Earlier in 2002,  we recorded restructuring, impairment and other credits of $5.2 million including a reversal  of  approximately  $3.7  million  from  the  reevaluation  of the 2001 Operational Reorganization Plan.       In 2001, we recorded  restructuring,  impairment and other charges of $36.1 million, primarily related to our 2001 Operational Reorganization Plan including plant facility  closures,  reductions in management and support  personnel,  and cost  reductions in purchasing and logistics.  The charge included an impairment charge of $13.8 million (net of anticipated  proceeds of $4.6 million) to reduce certain assets,  primarily leasehold improvement and equipment,  included within the Foam Products and Carpet Cushion  Products  segments to their estimated fair values.  Approximately  700 employee  terminations  including  plant  personnel, support staff and executives and management were originally  planned pursuant to the  2001  Operational  Reorganization  Plan.  The  subsequent  reevaluation  of                                           23     facilities closures reduced the number of planned  terminations to approximately 500. Approximately 340 employees were terminated in 2002.       We will have substantially  completed the remaining actions contemplated by the 2001  Operational  Reorganization  Plan in early 2003 and expect to complete the facility closures and personnel reductions related to the 2002 restructuring plan  during  2003,   primarily  in  the  first  six  months.   Terminations  of approximately 300 employees are planned to take place in 2003.       Interest and Debt Issuance Expense       Interest  and debt  issuance  expense  was  $66.6  million  in 2002,  which represented a 5.3% increase from 2001 expense of $63.2 million. The increase was attributable  to higher  amortization  of debt  issuance  cost.  We  capitalized interest of $0.3  million in 2002  compared to $1.4  million in 2001.  We expect 2003 interest and debt issuance expense to be at or higher than the 2002 level.       Income from Equity Interest in Joint Ventures       The income  from an equity  interest  in an Asian  joint  venture  was $1.6 million in both 2002 and 2001. We have a 70.0%  ownership  interest in the joint venture since December 2001. Previously our ownership interest was 49.0%.       Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes       Foamex L.P.,  as a limited  partnership,  is not subject to Federal  income taxes;  therefore no current or deferred  provision  has been  provided for such taxes. However, we have provided for the income taxes of certain states in which we are  subject  to taxes and for  certain  subsidiaries,  which are  subject to Federal  and  state  income  taxes  and  for  subsidiaries  located  in  foreign jurisdictions  that file  separate  tax returns.  The partners  will provide for their  respective  shares of income or loss in their Federal or applicable state income tax returns.  Foamex L.P. has a tax sharing  agreement  that provides for the payment of  distributions to our partners for amounts that would be required to be paid if we were a corporation filing separate tax returns.  Our ability to make such  distributions  is limited by the terms of our  credit  agreement  and indentures.       Extraordinary Items, Net of Income Taxes       In connection with the refinancing transaction completed on March 25, 2002, we wrote off debt issuance costs  associated with the early  extinguishments  of long-term  debt  due to a  related  party  and the  revolving  credit  facility, resulting in an extraordinary loss of $4.2 million, net of income tax benefit of $0.1  million.  We  purchased  and retired  $49.0  million of the 13 1/2% senior subordinated notes, including unamortized debt premium of $2.5 million, and $1.5 million of the 9 7/8% senior  subordinated  notes resulting in an  extraordinary gain of $1.4 million.  These  extraordinary  items will be reclassified upon the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145 in 2003.       Cumulative Effect of Accounting Changes       The  cumulative  effect of  accounting  change in 2002  includes a goodwill impairment  charge of $72.0  million as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142").  2001 Compared to 2000       Net sales for 2001 decreased 0.4% to $1,252.9 million from $1,257.8 million in 2000. The decline was primarily  attributable to lower sales in Foam Products and Carpet Cushion  Products,  partially offset by a significant  improvement in Automotive Products sales. Technical Products also recorded improved sales.                                           24          The  gross  profit  margin  was  14.4% in 2001  compared  to 13.7% in 2000. Certain raw  material  cost  reductions  had the effect of  improving  the gross profit margin percentage in 2001 by approximately 1.4 percentage  points.  These 2001 cost reductions are not anticipated to continue in 2002.  Selling,  general and administrative expenses were 16.0% higher in 2001. The increase included the impact of higher professional fees,  including those associated with a change in independent accountants,  higher bad debt expense related to economic conditions and increased compensation and benefit costs.       Income from operations in 2001 was $64.7 million, which represented a 33.5% decrease  from  the  $97.4  million  recorded  during  2000.   Results  included restructuring,  impairment  and other  charges of $36.1 million in 2001 and $6.3 million in 2000.  Restructuring,  impairment and other charges  recorded  during 2001 are discussed under "Other" below. Excluding the restructuring,  impairment and other charges for comparison  purposes,  income from  operations  would have been $100.8  million in 2001 compared to $103.7  million in 2000. On this basis, income  from  operations  was 8.0% of net  sales  in 2001  and 8.2% in 2000.  In addition to the raw material cost  reductions  discussed  above,  cost reduction programs and increases in certain selling prices were also positive factors.       Foam Products       Foam  Products  net sales for 2001  decreased  3.8% to $499.7  million from $519.2 million in 2000. The decrease  primarily  reflected the domestic economic slowdown that impacted the markets for  furniture  manufacturers  and other foam fabricators.  Despite the sales decline, income from operations increased 20.7%, from $55.2 million in 2000 to $66.6 million in 2001.  The increase was primarily the impact of raw material cost  reductions,  discussed  above,  which primarily benefited the Foam Products  segment.  Income from  operations  was 13.3% of net sales in 2001, up from 10.6% in 2000.       Carpet Cushion Products       Carpet Cushion Products net sales for 2001 decreased 9.9% to $231.0 million from $256.4 million in 2000. The sales decline continued to reflect  competitive pressures that resulted in lower sales volumes  across all product lines.  Lower selling  prices in certain  product  lines and a lower value  shipment  mix also contributed to the sales decline.  The factors contributing to the sales decline translated to a loss from  operations of $6.6 million in 2001 compared to income from  operations of $2.2 million in 2000. The loss from  operations  represented 2.8% of net sales in 2001 and income  from  operations  represented  0.9% of net sales in 2000.       Automotive Products       Automotive  Products net sales for 2001  increased  10.3% to $377.8 million from $342.4 million in 2000.  The  improvement  primarily  reflected new product programs and renewed activity  following  inventory  corrections in the domestic automotive  industry earlier in the year. Income from operations  declined 4.3%, from $22.4  million in 2000 to $21.4  million in 2001.  Income  from  operations represented  5.7% of net sales in 2001 and 6.5% in 2000.  The lower  results  in 2001 were primarily  attributed to intense  pricing  competition  and higher raw material costs.       Technical Products       Net sales for  Technical  Products  in 2001 were up 4.1% to $111.0  million from $106.7 million in 2000.  Higher sales  primarily  reflected  sales from the acquisition of certain assets from General Foam Corporation, discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Income from operations decreased 20.5% to $23.1  million  in 2001  compared  to $29.0  million  in  2000.  The  decline reflected a lower value  shipment mix and the impact of an economic  downturn in the technology  industry,  especially during the first half of 2001. Income from operations represented 20.8% of net sales in 2001 compared to 27.2% in 2000.       Other       Other  primarily  consists of certain  manufacturing  operations  in Mexico City,  corporate  expenses not allocated to business  segments and restructuring and other charges.  Net sales were slightly higher in 2001 compared to 2000. The loss from  operations  was $39.9  million  in 2001 and  included  restructuring, impairment  and other  charges  of                                           25     $36.1 million,  discussed  below. The $11.5 million loss from operations in 2000 included restructuring,  impairment and other charges totaling $6.3 million. The 2000 loss also included  professional  fees  associated  with the  resolution of certain  change  in  control  issues  following  the  Trace  bankruptcy  and the settlement of certain shareholder litigation.  Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges       In December 2001, we announced our 2001 Operational  Reorganization Plan to reduce operating costs and accelerate  revenue growth.  The major initiatives of the 2001  Operational  Reorganization  Plan included  plant  facility  closures, headcount  reductions,  purchasing and logistics  cost  reductions and sales and marketing management consolidation.       We identified a total of 17 plant operations to be closed. Costs associated with this aspect of the 2001  Operational  Reorganization  Plan  included  lease termination  costs and  severance and  termination  benefits  aggregating  $14.1 million. Additionally, we identified salaried positions to be eliminated, mainly in support  function areas.  Severance,  termination and other costs  associated with these positions were estimated to be $4.4 million.       Further,  we  evaluated  the  recoverability  of certain  other  long-lived assets,  both associated and not associated with the Operational  Reorganization Plan,  in  accordance  with SFAS No.  121,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  of Long-Lived  Assets and for Long-Lived  Assets to be Disposed".  As a result,  we recorded an impairment  provision of $13.8 million (net of anticipated  proceeds of $4.6 million) to reduce these assets to their estimated fair values.       Severance  and  termination  benefits  as a result of the 2001  Operational Reorganization   Plan  were  expected  to  be  incurred  for  approximately  700 employees. We expected to spend approximately $12.4 million during 2002 with the balance to be spent through  2012,  primarily  for lease costs.  Other  one-time period  expenses  during the fourth  quarter  consisted  primarily  of executive severance  of $1.9  million  and  consulting  fees  related  to the  Operational Reorganization Plan in the amount of $1.2 million.       In addition,  we recorded $0.4 million for restructuring plans prior to the fourth quarter of 2001 that included severance for 41 employees and $1.4 million related to executive severance recorded in other charges. We also recorded a net restructuring  credit of $1.2  million  related to changes in estimates to prior restructuring plans.       During 2000, we recorded $6.2 million for restructuring plans that included severance  for 102  employees.  We also recorded a net  restructuring  charge of approximately  $0.1  million  related to changes in  estimates  to prior  years' restructuring  plans. Also during 2000, we received $3.6 million of net proceeds from the sale of assets related to restructuring plans.       Interest and Debt Issuance Expense       Interest and debt issuance  expense  totaled  $63.2 million in 2001,  which represented a 15.9%  decrease from $75.2 million  recorded in 2000. The decrease was  attributable  to lower  average  debt levels and lower  effective  interest rates.  We  capitalized  interest of $1.4  million and $0.8  million in 2001 and 2000,  respectively,  as a  component  of the  construction  cost of  plant  and equipment.       Income from Equity Interest in Joint Ventures       Income  from an equity  interest  in an Asian joint  venture  totaled  $1.6 million and $1.7 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively.         Other Expense, Net       Other  expense,  net for 2001 was $1.9 million.  Expense items totaled $2.8 million and included letter of credit fees. Interest income recorded in 2001 was $0.9 million.                                          26          Other expense, net in 2000 totaled $1.6 million and primarily included $1.2 million of costs  associated  with a buyout  proposal and $0.7 million letter of credit fees offset by $0.6 million of interest income.         Income Tax Expense       Foamex L.P.,  as a limited  partnership,  is not subject to Federal  income taxes;  therefore no current or deferred  provision  has been  provided for such taxes. However, we have provided for the income taxes of certain states in which we are  subject  to taxes and for  certain  subsidiaries,  which are  subject to Federal  and  state  income  taxes  and  for  subsidiaries  located  in  foreign jurisdictions  that file  separate  tax returns.  The partners  will provide for their  respective  shares of income or loss in their Federal or applicable state income tax  returns.  We have a tax  sharing  agreement  that  provides  for the payment of  distributions  to our partners for amounts that would be required to be paid if we were a  corporation  filing  separate tax returns.  Our ability to make such  distributions  is limited by the terms of our  credit  agreement  and indentures.

("Trace") is a privately held company, which  owned  approximately  29% of Foamex  International's  outstanding  voting common stock at September 30, 2000, and whose former Chairman also serves as our Chairman.  Foamex  International's  common  stock  owned by Trace was pledged as collateral against certain of Trace's obligations. Certain credit agreements and promissory  notes,  pursuant to which  approximately  $401.1 million of debt was outstanding as of September 30, 2000,  provided that a "change of control" would be  an  event  of  default  and  could  result  in  the   acceleration  of  such indebtedness.  "Change of control" means, for this purpose, that (i) a person or related  group,  other  than  Trace,  beneficially  owns more than 25% of Foamex International's  outstanding voting stock and (ii) such voting stock constitutes a greater percentage of such voting stock than the amount  beneficially owned by Trace.  Additionally,  certain  of our  indentures  and those of Foamex  Capital Corporation ("FCC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary,  relating to senior subordinated notes contain similar "change of control"  provisions,  which require us and FCC to  tender  for such  notes at a price  in cash  equal to 101% of the  aggregate principal amount thereof,  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if there is such a "change of control".       On July 21, 1999, Foamex  International was informed by Trace that it filed a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the  Bankruptcy  Code in Federal Court in New York  City.  Subsequently,  on  January  24,  2000,  an order was  signed converting the Trace  bankruptcy  from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. A trustee was  appointed  to oversee the  liquidation  of Trace's  assets. Neither Trace's  bankruptcy filing nor the conversion to Chapter 7 constituted a "change of control" under the provisions of the debt agreements described above.       On July 31, 2000, Foamex  International  announced that it had entered into an agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with The Bank of Nova Scotia relating to a portion of the 7,197,426 shares of Foamex  International  common stock pledged by Trace to The Bank of Nova  Scotia.  The Exchange  Agreement  provided for the transfer of the pledged  stock to The Bank of Nova Scotia in a manner that would not constitute a "change of control" as described above. These transactions were conditioned upon bankruptcy court approval of a settlement agreement between The Bank of Nova Scotia and the trustee for the Trace bankruptcy,  which was entered on October 18, 2000. On November 2, 2000, the  transactions  contemplated by the Exchange  Agreement and the settlement  agreement were consummated,  and did not constitute a "change of control".  As a result,  Trace no longer owns any shares of Foamex International common stock.       Under the Exchange  Agreement,  The Bank of Nova Scotia initially  received 1,500,000 shares of Foamex  International common stock from the Trace bankruptcy estate and exchanged  these common stock shares for 15,000 shares of a new class of  non-voting  non-redeemable   convertible  preferred  stock  (the  "Series  B Preferred  Stock").  Each share of the Series B Preferred Stock can be converted into 100 shares of Foamex International common stock but only if such conversion would not trigger a "change of control" event, as discussed  above. The Series B Preferred  Stock (a) is entitled to dividends  only if a dividend is declared on Foamex  International's  common stock,  (b) ranks senior to any future preferred stock  issued by  Foamex  International  and (c) is  entitled  to a  liquidation                                          27     preference of $100 per share.  Following this exchange,  The Bank of Nova Scotia became the owner of 24.41% of the outstanding  shares of Foamex  International's common stock when the remaining 5,697,426 shares of Foamex  International common stock were  transferred  to The Bank of Nova  Scotia  from the Trace  bankruptcy estate.  Certain equity  transactions,  primarily the exercise of stock options, have reduced the Bank of Nova  Scotia's  common stock  ownership  percentage  to 23.6% at February 15, 2003.  Environmental Health and Safety       We are subject to extensive and changing federal,  state, local and foreign environmental  laws  and  regulations,  including  those  relating  to the  use, handling, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances, the discharge or  emission  of  materials  into  the  environment,   and  the  remediation  of environmental contamination,  and as a result, are from time to time involved in administrative and judicial  proceedings and inquiries relating to environmental matters.  As of December 29, 2002, we had accruals of approximately $2.7 million for  environmental  matters  including  approximately  $2.3  million  related to remediating and monitoring soil and groundwater  contamination and approximately $0.4 million relating to PRP sites and other matters. Additional losses, if any, in excess of amounts currently accrued,  cannot be reasonably  estimated at this time. If there are additional matters or if any current estimates are incorrect, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial  position,  results of operations and cash flows.       On August 8,  2001,  the EPA  proposed  a National  Emission  Standard  for Hazardous Air Pollutants or "NESHAP" for Flexible  Polyurethane Foam Fabrication Operations.  The proposed NESHAP regulates  emissions of methylene  chloride and other Hazardous Air Pollutants and restricts air emissions from flame lamination sources.  We do not believe that this standard,  if adopted,  will require us to make material expenditures.       On  August  31,  2002,   Environment  Canada,  the  Canadian  environmental regulatory  agency,  proposed a rule which would require  flexible  polyurethane foam manufacturing operations to reduce methylene chloride (dichloromethane) air emissions. The proposed rule establishes a 50.0% reduction in methylene chloride emissions by December 1, 2003 and 100.0%  reductions  by January 1, 2007.  We do not believe that this  standard,  if adopted,  will require us to make  material expenditures for our Canadian plants.       We have reported to the appropriate  state  authorities  that we have found soil and/or  groundwater  contamination  in excess of state standards at certain locations.  Seven sites are  currently  in various  stages of  investigation  or remediation. Accordingly, the extent of contamination and the ultimate liability is not  known  with  certainty  for  all  sites.  During  2000,  we  reached  an indemnification  agreement  with the former owner of the  Morristown,  Tennessee facility.  The  agreement  allocates the incurred and future  remediation  costs between the former owner and us. The  estimated  allocation  of future costs for the  remediation  of this  facility is not  significant,  based on current known information.  The former owner was Recticel  Foam  Corporation,  a subsidiary of Recticel.       We have either  upgraded  or closed all  underground  storage  tanks at our facilities in accordance with applicable regulations.       The CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability without fault for the costs of  cleaning  up  contaminated  sites on certain  classes of persons  that contributed to the release of hazardous substances into the environment at those sites, for example, by generating wastes containing  hazardous  substances which were disposed at such sites. We are currently  designated as a PRP by the EPA or by state  environmental  agencies or other PRPs, pursuant to CERCLA or analogous state  statutes,  with respect to eight sites.  Estimates of total cleanup costs and fractional allocations of liability are often provided by the EPA, the state environmental  agency or the  committee  of PRPs with  respect to the  specified site.  Based  on  these  estimates  (to  the  extent  available)  and  on  known information,  in each case and in the  aggregate,  we do not  expect  additional costs,  if any, to be material to liquidity,  results of operations or financial position.       In 2003,  capital  expenditures  for  safety and  environmental  compliance projects  are  anticipated  to be  approximately  $1.5  million.  Although it is possible  that new  information  or  future  developments  could  require  us to reassess the potential exposure relating to all pending  environmental  matters, including  those  described  above,  management  believes  that,  based upon all currently available  information,  the resolution of these environmental                                          28    matters will not have a material  adverse  effect on our  operations,  financial position,  capital expenditures or competitive position. The possibility exists, however, that new environmental legislation and/or environmental regulations may be  adopted,  or other  environmental  conditions,  including  the  presence  of previously  unknown  environmental  contamination,  may be  found  to exist or a reassessment of the potential exposure to pending  environmental  matters may be necessary  due to new  information  or  future  developments,  that may  require expenditures not currently anticipated and that may be material.  Claims and Litigation       We and our  subsidiaries are party to various  lawsuits,  both as defendant and  plaintiff,  arising in the normal course of business.  It is the opinion of management that the  disposition of these lawsuits will not,  individually or in the  aggregate,  have a material  adverse  effect on our  financial  position or results of operations.  If  management's  assessment is incorrect,  such actions could have a material  adverse effect on our  consolidated  financial  position, results of  operations  and cash flows.  As of December 29, 2002, we had accrued approximately $0.7 million for litigation and other legal matters in addition to the environmental matters discussed above.  Inflation, Raw Material Costs and Other Matters       On  average,  inflation  rates  for the  domestic  economy  continue  to be relatively low. Although long-term  inflation rates are difficult to predict, we believe we have the flexibility in operations and capital  structure to maintain a competitive position.  The prices of the two principal chemicals used, TDI and polyol, are influenced by demand and manufacturing  capacity.  In addition,  the prices of TDI and polyol are  significantly  influenced by crude oil  production and prices and by world political instability,  particularly in the Middle East. The conflict in that part of the world could  significantly  impact the price of these raw materials.  Results for 2002 were negatively  impacted by higher costs for raw materials.  In 2001, the beginning of the economic  slowdown resulted in excess  manufacturing  capacity for the major chemical suppliers.  This, coupled with declining oil prices, resulted in lower costs for raw materials in 2001. We experienced  32.0% to 37.0%  increases in the prices of raw material  from major chemical  manufacturers  during 2002. We sought to recover these cost  increases through  manufacturing  process  efficiencies  and  management  of selling price increases, but were only partially able to do so during 2002. Our major chemical suppliers have announced  their  intention to increase  prices by  approximately 10.0% to 12.0%  effective  April 1,  2003.  In an  attempt  to offset  these raw material cost  increases,  we have announced price increases to our customers to be effective  during April 2003. We may not be successful in implementing  these and further selling price increases to fully recover raw material cost increases and competitive pricing pressure may require us to adjust selling prices or lose volume.  Results of  operations  have been and could be  adversely  affected  by delays in  implementing,  or inability to  implement,  additional  selling price increases to offset raw material cost  increases.  Additionally,  we must reduce and  control  our  other  operating  expenses  including  selling,  general  and administrative  expenses to offset raw  material  cost  increases.  A failure to recover cost increases could result in debt covenant  violations  which may lead to lenders  demanding  immediate  payment of our outstanding debt and impair our ability to continue as a going concern.  Related Party Transactions       We  have a  number  of  related  party  transactions.  Such  related  party transactions  and current  balances are discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.  Accounting Changes       Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 142,  "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142") addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired  goodwill and other intangible  assets. A key change as a result of implementing  SFAS No. 142 is that goodwill and certain other intangibles are no longer  amortized but will be  periodically  assessed for  impairment,  and as a result  there may be more  volatility  in the  reported  results  than under the previous standard because  impairment losses are likely to occur irregularly and in varying amounts.  An impairment of goodwill due to the initial application of SFAS No. 142 is discussed  below.  Any goodwill and intangible  assets  acquired after  June 30,  2001,  including  the  acquisition  discussed  in note 3 to the consolidated                                           29    financial  statements,  are  subject  to the  nonamortization  and  amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142. The other provisions of SFAS No. 142 were adopted by us on January 1, 2002.       SFAS No. 142 provides a six-month  transitional  period from the  effective date to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired.  We completed this  assessment in the second quarter of 2002. Step one of the transitional impairment test uses a fair value methodology, which differs from the  undiscounted  cash  flow  methodology  that  continues  to be used for intangible  assets with an identifiable  life. We identified six reporting units during the second quarter and performed step one of the transitional  impairment test on each of the  reporting  units.  Based on the  results of step one of the transitional  impairment  test,  we identified  one  reporting  unit in the Foam Products  segment,  the Carpet  Cushion  Products  reporting  unit and the Other reporting  unit,  for which the carrying  values  exceeded the fair values as at January  1,  2002,  indicating  a  potential  impairment  of  goodwill  in those reporting units. Step two of the transitional  impairment test, to determine the magnitude of any goodwill impairment, was completed in the third quarter of 2002 and the  resulting  impairment  loss of $72.0  million  has been  recorded  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle,  retroactive to the first quarter  2002  results  of  operations  in  accordance  with  the   transitional implementation  guidance  of SFAS No.  142.  We  performed  our annual  goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2002 which did not result in the recognition of any additional impairment.       On April 30, 2002,  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 145, "Rescission of FASB  Statements  No. 4, 44, and 64,  Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical  Corrections"  ("SFAS No. 145") was issued. The provisions of this  Statement  related to the rescission of Statement 4 shall be applied in fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. Any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was  classified as an  extraordinary  item in prior periods  presented that  does  not  meet  the  criteria  in  Opinion  30 for  classification  as an extraordinary item shall be reclassified. Early application of the provisions of this  Statement  related to the  rescission  of Statement 4 is  encouraged.  The adoption  of this  Statement  in 2003 will result in a  reclassification  of the extraordinary items recorded during 2002.       Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal  Activities ("SFAS No. 146") was issued in June 2002.  SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for costs  associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the  date of an  entity's  commitment  to an exit  plan.  SFAS No.  146  further establishes  that fair value is the  objective  for initial  measurement  of the liability.  The statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002.       In  November  2002,  the FASB issued  FASB  Interpretation  ("FIN") No. 45, "Guarantor's  Accounting and Disclosure  Requirements for Guarantees,  Including Indirect  Guarantees  of  Indebtedness  of  Others."  FIN No. 45  clarifies  the requirements  of SFAS No. 5,  "Accounting  for  Contingencies,"  relating to the guarantor's  accounting for and disclosures of certain  guarantees.  The initial recognition and measurements  provisions of the interpretation are applicable on a prospective  basis to guarantees  issued or modified  after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantor's fiscal year-end. The disclosure  requirements of the interpretation  are effective for financial  statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The adoption of this  interpretation  is not  expected  to have any impact on our  results  of  operations  or  financial position. We do not have any disclosure obligations under this interpretation at December 29, 2002.  ITEM 7a.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Our debt securities with variable interest rates are subject to market risk for changes in interest rates. On December 29, 2002,  indebtedness with variable interest rates totaled $221.0 million.  On an annualized  basis, if the interest rates on these  debt  instruments  increased  by 1.0%,  interest  expense  would increase by approximately $2.2 million.  ITEM 8.
