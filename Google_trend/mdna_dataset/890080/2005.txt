EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Overview         We operate in the flexible polyurethane and advanced polymer foam products industry. Our operations are conducted directly and through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Foamex Canada, Foamex Mexico and Foamex Asia. Business segments are listed below and business segment financial information is included in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Please see Part I, Item 1 "Business" for a more complete description of the activities of our business segments.                                          13         An executive vice president heads each of our principal operating segments. Each executive vice president is responsible for developing budgets and plans as well as  directing  the  operations  of the  segment.  The  performance  of each operating  segment is  measured  based upon income  from  operations,  excluding restructuring,  impairment and other charges and corporate  overhead.  We do not allocate  restructuring,  impairment  and other  charges to  operating  segments because many of our facilities produce products for multiple segments.       Foam  Products -  manufactures  and markets  cushioning  foams for bedding,      furniture,  packaging and health care applications, and foam-based consumer      products, such as mattress pads and children's furniture.       Carpet Cushion Products - manufactures and distributes prime,  rebond, felt      and rubber carpet padding.       Automotive Products - distributes automotive foam products and laminates to      major Tier 1 suppliers and OEMs.       Technical  Products  -  manufactures  and  markets  reticulated  and  other      specialty foams used for  reservoiring,  filtration,  gasketing and sealing      applications.       Other  -  primarily  consists  of  certain  manufacturing  and  fabrication      operations  in Mexico City,  corporate  expenses not allocated to the other      business   segments  and   restructuring,   impairment  and  other  charges      (credits).       Our sales are  primarily to markets in the United  States.  These sales are impacted by economic conditions in several sectors of the United States economy, including consumer spending,  sales of new and existing homes, the overall level of  passenger  car and light truck  production  and  seasonality.  We  typically experience  two  seasonally  slow periods during each year, in early July and in late December, due to scheduled plant shutdowns and holidays.       A small number of major customers produce a significant  portion of our net sales.  In 2004,  our largest  customer  provided 12.5% of our net sales and our five largest customers  provided 29.6% of our net sales. Two of the five largest customers  are  customers  of the  Automotive  Products  segment  and  three are customers of the Foam Products segment.       The  following   discussion   should  be  read  in  conjunction   with  the consolidated  financial  statements  and related  notes  included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.       Operations       The  following  table  includes  key elements of our  financial  statements expressed as a percentage of net sales for the years 1999 through  2004,  except for net cash provided by (used for) operating  activities  which is expressed in millions of dollars.                                        2004        2003         2002         2001         2000            1999                                   -------      -------      -------      -------      -------         ------              Net Sales                          100.0%       100.0%       100.0%       100.0%       100.0%         100.0%  Cost of Goods Sold                  88.8%        89.0%        89.2%        85.8%        86.3%          86.1%  Gross Profit Margin                 11.2%        11.0%        10.8%        14.2%        13.7%          13.9%  Selling, General and    Administrative Expenses           6.9%         6.2%         7.1%         6.3%         5.4%           5.8%  Operating Income Margin              4.1%         4.9%         3.4%         5.0%         7.7%           7.3%                                            14                                          2004        2003         2002         2001         2000            1999                                   -------      -------      -------      -------      -------         ------ Interest and Debt                 Issuance Expense                  6.1%         6.8%         5.2%         5.0%         6.0%           5.6%  Net Cash Provided by (Used    for) Operating Activities        $0.2        $18.1       $(49.6)      $108.7        $52.9          $68.6        As demonstrated by the table above, our results significantly  deteriorated in 2002 and improved only  marginally in 2003 and 2004.  Our gross profit margin has been reduced by approximately three percentage points while selling, general and  administrative  expenses and interest and debt  issuance  expense have both increased as a percentage of net sales, as well as in absolute dollar terms. Net sales  dollars  have been  relatively  flat over the six year  period  with 2004 representing a decrease of 2.2% compared to 1999.       Our management is focusing on restoring  former levels of  profitability by concentrating on the following key areas:       o    Developing  new  value-added  products  that  leverage  our  technical           capability and entering new markets with increased profit potential.       o    Managing raw material costs.       o    Maintaining  selling  price  increases  to  customers  to recover  raw           material and manufacturing cost increases.       o    Controlling   and   reducing   labor  and   overhead   costs  both  in           manufacturing and administration.       The cost of major chemical raw materials  increased several times effective during  the  second  half  2004,  so that  the  weighted  average  cost of major chemicals  was more than 20%  higher in the  fourth  quarter of 2004 than in the first  quarter  of 2004.  Primarily  as a  result  of these  raw  material  cost increases,  our gross profit  margin  declined to 8.7% in the fourth  quarter of 2004.  Our major  chemical  suppliers  further  increased the price of polyol by approximately  15% effective in January 2005 and  increased  prices for both TDI and  polyol  by  approximately  10%  effective  in March  2005.  There can be no assurance that chemical prices will not further increase in 2005. In addition to rising  prices,  some of the key  chemicals we use have been in short supply and availability  may  continue  to be tight in the future.  We manage raw  material costs by  negotiating  discounts  and rebates for volume  purchases  and seeking alternative sources of supply.       We have been only partially successful in raising selling prices to recover raw material and other cost increases.  Further selling price increases, reduced costs and increased mix of higher profit products are major factors in restoring gross profit margin percentages to the levels experienced in 1999-2001. At those levels we should be able to reduce  borrowings  and also cash interest  expense, although  there is no assurance we will be  successful in our efforts to achieve those levels of gross profit margins.       We are  focused on reducing  both  manufacturing  costs and  administrative expenses.  We  believe  that  manufacturing  costs  can be  further  reduced  by emphasizing  efficiency and better supply chain management.  Our focus areas for further  reductions in  administrative  expenses are employee  related costs and professional  service  fees,  although we have  experienced  large  increases in professional   fees  in  conjunction   with  our  efforts  to  comply  with  the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002. In addition,  we will explore the potential sales of non-strategic assets during 2005.       Financing       Our Senior  Secured  Credit  Facility  initially  consisted  of a revolving credit  facility with a maximum  availability  of $190.0  million and an initial term loan of $50.0  million.  The  revolving  credit  facility  includes a $50.0 million  sublimit for letters of credit and  availability is limited to eligible amounts, as defined,  of accounts receivable                                          15    and  inventory.  At January 2, 2005,  Foamex L.P. had  available  borrowings  of approximately  $25.0 million and letters of credit outstanding of $22.1 million. Borrowings under the term loan are limited to eligible amounts,  as defined,  of equipment and real estate.  Substantially  all the assets of Foamex L.P. and its domestic  subsidiaries  and Foamex  Canada are  pledged  as  collateral  for the related borrowings.  Borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan bear  interest  at floating  rates  based upon and  including a margin over either  LIBOR or a Base Rate,  as  defined.  At January  2, 2005,  the  weighted average  interest  rates  were 6.00% for both the  revolving  loans and the term loan. The term loan requires  quarterly  installment  payments of  approximately $1.8 million. Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility will mature on April 30, 2007.       The Secured  Term Loan had an  original  maturity  date of April 30,  2007. Borrowings  under this  facility  bear interest at a rate that is 9.25% plus the greater of the Reference Rate, as defined, or 4.25%. The minimum rate, which was in effect as of December 28, 2003,  is 13.50%.  The rate in effect at January 2, 2005 was 14.50%. In addition,  Foamex L.P. is subject to a 1.00% facility fee on the initial $80.0 million term loan which is payable annually on the anniversary date.  Borrowings  under the Secured  Term Loan are  collateralized  by the same collateral as the Senior Secured Credit  Facility.  An  intercreditor  agreement governs  the  distribution  of  collateral  among the  lenders  under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the Secured Term Loan.       Under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the Secured Term Loan,  Foamex L.P. is subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage  ratio,  as defined,  of 1.00 measured quarterly.  For the two quarters ended December 28, 2003, Foamex L.P.'s fixed charge  coverage  ratio was 1.09.  Amendments to the Senior Secured Credit Facility and Secured Term Loan executed on November 3, 2004 allowed  Foamex L.P. to  exclude  certain  charges   aggregating   approximately   $3.7  million  and approximately   $1.0  million  in  the  first  and  second   quarters  of  2004, respectively,  from the computation of the fixed charge coverage ratio.  For the four quarters ended January 2, 2005,  Foamex L.P.'s fixed charge  coverage ratio was 0.98.  The lenders  have agreed to waive  compliance  with the fixed  charge coverage  ratio for that  period.  On March 31, 2005,  Foamex L.P.  entered into amendments  with the existing  lenders under the Senior Secured Credit  Facility and the Secured Term Loan that set lower  minimum fixed charge  coverage  ratios through  April 2,  2006 and  permit  borrowing  of up to  $25.0  million  of the additional $39.0 million  commitment,  discussed  below,  under the Secured Term Loan, the proceeds of which would be used to repay revolving loans.  Foamex L.P. incurred  fees  and  expenses  for  the  waivers  and   amendments   aggregating approximately  $1.0  million.  Foamex L.P. is also  subject to a maximum  annual capital expenditure amount which was $36.0 million for the year ended January 2, 2005 and will be $46.8 million for the year ending January 1, 2006.       There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving our plans or complying  with the fixed  charge  coverage  ratio,  as there are a number of factors  beyond our control,  including  raw material  cost changes and customer acceptance of selling price increases that are necessary for us to be successful and  we  have  limited  borrowing   capacity  and  access  to  capital  markets. Additionally, compliance with the amended fixed charge coverage ratio may not be met if business  conditions are not as anticipated  or other  unforeseen  events impact results unfavorably. In the event that such noncompliance appears likely, or occurs,  we will seek the  lenders'  further  approval of  amendments  to, or waivers  of,  such  covenants.  Historically,  we have been able to  renegotiate financial  covenants and/or obtain waivers.  Management  currently believes that obtaining  waivers  and/or  amendments  in  the  future  may  be  difficult.  If amendments  or waivers are not  obtained,  Foamex  L.P.  would be in default and lenders could demand immediate  payment of Foamex L.P.'s  outstanding debt under the Senior  Secured  Credit  Facility and Secured Term Loan. In addition,  it is possible  that the  holders of Foamex  L.P.'s  Senior  Secured  Notes and Senior Subordinated  Notes could also demand immediate  payment.  We may not be able to secure  additional  financing  at a  reasonable  cost,  or at all.  The  lack of financing  would have a material  adverse  effect on our financial  position and could impair our ability to continue as a going concern.       Our 13 1/2% Senior  Subordinated  Notes with a face value of $51.6  million are due on August 15, 2005.  We may,  from time to time,  directly or indirectly make  purchases of these notes or our other public debt in the open market or in private  transactions.  On November 3, 2004,  Foamex L.P. entered into financing agreements  with the existing  lenders under the Senior Secured Credit  Facility and the Secured Term Loan to provide up to $54.0 million of new  financing,  the proceeds of which could be used only to repurchase prior to or repay the 13 1/2% Senior  Subordinated  Notes at  maturity  and  certain  fees  related to the new financing.  The lenders under the Senior Secured Credit  Facility have agreed to lend up to $15.0 million  under a new junior term loan with a floating  interest rate based upon LIBOR, as defined, reset monthly plus 6.00% with a maturity date of April 30, 2007.  The lenders  under                                          16     the Secured Term Loan would lend up to an additional $39.0 million with interest rates  identical to the rates underthe  existing  Secured Term Loan. The Secured Term Loan  maturity  date was also  extended  to April 1,  2009.  The  financing commitment  under  the  Secured  Term Loan  requires  the  payment  of an unused commitment  fee at the rate of 1.5% per annum and a funding fee equal to 2.5% of the amount  borrowed with a minimum funding fee of  approximately  $0.6 million. The  amendments  permit Foamex L.P. to reduce the financing  commitments  by any cash proceeds, as defined in the amendments,  generated from certain sources. If Foamex  L.P. is unable to meet its  minimum  fixed  charge  coverage  ratio,  as amended, the financing  commitments under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the  Secured  Term  Loan  may not be  available  to  repay  the 13  1/2%  Senior Subordinated  Notes  when due.  Withdrawal  of these  commitments  would  have a material  adverse effect on our financial  position and could impair our ability to continue as a going concern.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES       We prepared  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States of America.  As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates, judgments  and  assumptions  affect  the  reported  amounts  of the  assets  and liabilities and revenues and expenses.  Our significant  accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The accounting policies  which we believe are the most  critical to aid in fully  understanding and evaluating our reported  financial  results and which require  management to exercise judgment include the following:       Revenue Recognition       Revenue from sales, net of discounts and estimated returns,  allowances and customer rebates,  is recognized when product title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer,  the sales price is fixed and  determinable  and collection is reasonably  assured.  Products are shipped FOB shipping point. Net sales are reduced by allowances  for estimated  discounts,  returns and customer rebates. Balances for allowances and rebates are reviewed at least quarterly and are adjusted if warranted.  Shipping and handling costs are included in costs of goods sold.       Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts       We actively monitor  customer  payments in conjunction with customer credit evaluations.  Accordingly,  a reserve for  estimated  uncollectible  accounts is maintained  and is  based  on  historical  collection  experience  and  specific customer  collection issues. A significant change in the financial  condition of one or more of our larger  customers  could have a  material  adverse  impact on future financial results.       Long-Lived Assets       Net property,  plant and  equipment  totaled  $141.5  million at January 2, 2005.  Property and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment  testing at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in  circumstances  indicate that the  carrying  amount of the assets  may not be  recoverable.  Foamex  L.P. assesses  recoverability  by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the  estimated  undiscounted  future cash flows  expected to be generated by the assets.  If an asset group is considered  impaired,  the  impairment  loss to be recognized  would be measured as the amount by which the asset group's  carrying amount  exceeds  its fair  value.  Estimated  future  cash  flows  are  based on historical results adjusted for estimated future market conditions and operating plans. To the extent that these estimates change, impairment losses could have a material adverse impact on future financial results.       Goodwill       We evaluate the  recoverability  of goodwill on an annual basis as required by Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 142,  "Goodwill  and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"). We perform this annual evaluation as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter,  or more frequently if events or changes in  circumstances,  such as declining sales,  earnings or cash flows or material adverse  changes in the business  climate,  indicate that the                                          17    carrying  value of goodwill  might be  impaired.  Goodwill is  considered  to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting  unit exceeds its estimated fair value.  Fair  values are  primarily  established  using a  discounted  cash flow methodology.  The determination of discounted cash flows is based on businesses' strategic plans and long range planning forecasts.       Self Insurance       We are partially  self-insured  up to certain  limits for a number of risks including  workers  compensation,  medical,  automobile  and general  liability. Commercial  insurance  policies  are  carried  for  amounts  in  excess  of  the self-insured  amounts.  Management exercises  significant judgment in estimating the ultimate  liability for claims.  The services of an outside actuary are used to  assist  management  in  their  evaluation  of  the  liability  for  workers' compensation and automobile claims.       Benefit Plans       We maintain defined benefit pension plans that cover most of our employees. Projected  benefit  obligations,  pension expense and amounts  included in other comprehensive  income are impacted by a number of  assumptions.  Key assumptions include the discount  rates to determine  benefit  obligations  and the expected long-term  rate of return on plan assets.  Discount  rates are applied to future cash  flows to  measure  benefit  obligations  on a present  value.  We  assumed weighted average discount rates of 7.00%,  6.50% and 6.00% to calculate  pension expense in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.  Based on pension plan obligations at year-end  2004,  a 0.50%  reduction  in the discount  rate  assumption  would increase pension expense by approximately  $0.8 million.  The estimated increase is primarily attributable to the impact on the pension expense component for the amortization  of net losses,  discussed  below.  Based on pension plan assets at year-end 2004, a 0.50% reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by approximately $0.5 million.  The amortization of net actuarial  losses  remains a  significant  component of pension  expense for the Company.  The net loss position of the pension plans was primarily the result of declining  discount  rates and  accumulated  returns  on  pension  assets  below expected  returns,  principally  in periods  before  2003.  The pension  expense component  for the  amortization  of net  actuarial  losses  is  expected  to be approximately  $3.2  million in 2005.  We  anticipate  funding  $7.4  million to retiree benefit plans in 2005.       Claims and Litigation       We  receive  claims for  damages  that are not  covered  by our  insurance. Management  evaluates these claims and records its estimate of liabilities  when such  liabilities are considered  probable and an amount or reasonable range can be estimated.       Environmental Remediation       We have a number of  manufacturing  facilities and certain idle  facilities that require remediation of soil and/or groundwater  contamination.  As required by applicable State and/or Federal compliance programs,  many of these sites are in the monitoring stage that requires periodic sampling of contamination  levels in conjunction with ongoing assessments of remediation actions. Accordingly, the recognition  of  environmental  liabilities  requires  estimates  concerning the duration of monitoring and  associated  costs,  often  projected to extend for a number  of  years.  To  the  extent  that  these  estimates  change,  additional environmental  costs could have a material  adverse  impact on future  financial results.  See the section below entitled  "Environmental  Health and Safety" for additional information.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Our cash requirements consist principally of accounts receivable, inventory and  accounts  payable,   scheduled   payments  of  interest  and  principal  on outstanding indebtedness,  capital expenditures,  and employee benefit plans. We believe that cash flow from our operating activities,  cash on hand and periodic borrowings  under our  credit  agreements  will be  adequate  to meet  liquidity requirements  for the next 12 months.  In addition,  we will  explore  potential sales  of  non-strategic   assets  during  this  period.  Our  ability  to  make distributions  to  Foamex  International  is  restricted  by  the  terms  of our financing agreements.                                          18         Cash and cash  equivalents were $5.3 million at January 2, 2005 compared to $6.6  million at December  28,  2003.  Working  capital at January 2, 2005 was a negative  $54.0  million and the current ratio was 0.85 to 1 compared to working capital at December 28, 2003 of $11.7  million and a current ratio of 1.04 to 1. The decrease in working capital is primarily due to the  reclassification of the $52.2 million of 13 1/2% Senior  Subordinated  Notes due August 15, 2005 as they mature in less than one year, and the establishment of a valuation  allowance on the current portion of deferred tax assets.       Total long-term debt and revolving credit borrowings at January 2, 2005 was $750.5 million, a $4.9 million increase from December 28, 2003. As of January 2, 2005, there were revolving credit  borrowings of $114.9 million under the Senior Secured  Credit  Facility with $25.0 million  available for borrowings and $22.1 million of letters of credit outstanding. Revolving credit borrowings at January 2, 2005 reflect working capital requirements.       On August 18,  2003,  Foamex  L.P.  entered  into a Senior  Secured  Credit Facility  with a new  group of  lenders  and a Secured  Term  Loan with  another lending group.  Proceeds  borrowed under these new facilities were used to repay all outstanding  balances under the Amended Credit Facility which was terminated as of August 18, 2003. In addition,  Foamex Canada's  revolving  credit facility that  did  not  have  any  outstanding   borrowings  and  had   availability  of approximately $5.9 million was terminated as of August 18, 2003. The termination of the Amended Credit Facility resulted in a write off of debt issuance costs of $12.9 million in 2003.       The Senior  Secured  Credit  Facility  initially  consisted  of a revolving credit  facility with a maximum  availability  of $190.0  million and an initial term loan of $50.0  million.  On November 3, 2004,  the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facility agreed to lend up to an additional $15.0 million under a new junior term loan.  The revolving  credit  facility  includes a $50.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and availability is limited to eligible  amounts, as defined, of accounts receivable and inventory. Borrowings under the term loan are limited to eligible  amounts,  as defined,  of  equipment  and real  estate. Substantially  all the assets of Foamex L.P. and its domestic  subsidiaries  and Foamex Canada are pledged as collateral for the related  borrowings.  Borrowings under the revolving  credit facility and the term loan bear interest at floating rates based upon and  including a margin  over either  LIBOR or a Base Rate,  as defined.  At January 2, 2005, the weighted average interest rates were 6.00% for both the revolving loans and the term loan. The margin for borrowings  under the revolving  credit  facility  and the term  loan  increased  by 0.25% in 2004 and increased by an  additional  0.25% as of March 31, 2005.  The term loan requires quarterly  installment payments of approximately $1.8 million.  Borrowings under the  junior  term loan can be used only  repay the 13 1/2%  Senior  Subordinated Notes at maturity and will bear interest at a floating rate based upon LIBOR, as defined plus 6.00%. All borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility will mature on April 30, 2007.  The Senior Secured  Credit  Facility  includes both a subjective  acceleration  clause and a lockbox  arrangement  which  requires all lockbox  receipts be used to repay  revolving  credit  borrowings.  Accordingly, borrowings  under the revolving credit facility are classified as current in the accompanying balance sheet as required by EITF No. 95-22.       The Secured Term Loan had an original  maturity  date of April 30, 2007. On November 3, 2004, the lenders agreed to lend up to an additional  $39.0 million, the proceeds of which could be used only to repurchase  prior to or repay the 13 1/2% Senior  Subordinated  Notes at maturity and certain fees related to the new financings.  The lenders  also agreed to extend the maturity of the Secured Term Loan to April 1, 2009.  Borrowings  under this  facility bear interest at a rate that is 9.25% plus the greater of  Reference  Rate,  as defined,  or 4.25%.  The minimum rate,  which was in effect as of December 28, 2003, is 13.50%.  The rate in effect at January 2, 2005 was 14.50%. In addition,  Foamex L.P. is subject to a 1.00%  facility  fee on the initial  $80.0  million term loan which is payable annually on the anniversary date, a 1.5% commitment fee on the unused portion of the $39.0 million  additional  commitment and a funding fee equal to 2.5% of the amount  borrowed  with a minimum  funding  fee of  approximately  $0.6  million. Borrowings under the Secured Term Loan are collateralized by the same collateral as the Senior Secured Credit Facility.  An intercreditor  agreement  governs the distribution  of collateral  among the lenders under the Senior  Secured  Credit Facility and the Secured Term Loan.       Under the Senior  Secured  Credit  Facility and the Secured  Term Loan,  as amended, Foamex L.P. is subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined, of 1.00 measured  quarterly.  For the two quarters ended December 28, 2003,  Foamex L.P.'s fixed charge  coverage  ratio was 1.09.  Amendments to the Senior Secured Credit  Facility  and Secured  Term Loan  executed  on November 3, 2004  allowed Foamex L.P. to exclude certain charges  aggregating                                          19    approximately  $3.7  million  and  approximately  $1.0  million in the first and second quarters of 2004, respectively,  from the computation of the fixed charge coverage ratio. For the four quarters ended January 2, 2005, Foamex L.P.'s fixed charge  coverage ratio was 0.98 and the lenders have agreed to waive  compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio for that period.  On March 31, 2005, Foamex L.P.  entered into amendments with the existing lenders under the Senior Secured Credit  Facility and the Secured Term Loan that set lower fixed charge  coverage ratios through April 2, 2006 and permit  borrowing of up to $25.0 million of the additional $39.0 million commitment under the Secured Term Loan, the proceeds of which would be used to repay  revolving  loans.  Foamex L.P.  incurred  fees and expenses for the waivers and amendments aggregating  approximately $1.0 million. Foamex L.P. is also subject to a maximum annual capital expenditure amount which was $36.0  million for the year ended  January 2, 2005 and will be $46.8 million for the year ending January 1, 2006.       Effective May 1, 2002, Foamex L.P. completed a series of interest rate swap transactions  with notional  amounts  aggregating  $300.0  million.  Foamex L.P. designated, documented and accounted for these interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of its 10 3/4%  Senior  Secured  Notes due April 1, 2009.  The risk being hedged in these  transactions was the change in fair value of the 10 3/4% Senior Secured Notes based on changes in the benchmark interest rate, LIBOR. The effect of these interest rate swap  transactions was to convert the fixed interest rate on the 10 3/4% Senior  Secured  Notes to floating  rates reset twice per year to correspond with the interest payment dates for the 10 3/4% Senior Secured Notes. On September 18, 2002,  Foamex L.P. unwound the interest rate swap  transactions in exchange for a net cash  proceeds of $18.4  million,  including  $3.6 million realized through lower effective interest rates while the swap transactions were in effect. The unwinding  resulted in a deferred credit of $14.8 million,  which is being amortized over the term of the 10 3/4% Senior Secured Notes,  using the effective interest rate method.       Cash Flow from Operating Activities       Cash provided by operating  activities in 2004 was $0.2 million compared to $18.1  million in 2003.  In 2004,  cash  provided  by  operations  consisted  of approximately  $5.6 million of cash generated  from results of operations  after adjusting  for non cash charges  included in net loss,  offset by  approximately $5.4 million of cash  requirements  used to fund working  capital  needs,  other operating  expenses and  restructuring  liabilities.  In 2003,  cash provided by operations  consisted of  approximately  $17.3  million of cash  generated  from results of operations  after adjusting for non cash charges included in net loss and approximately  $13.8 million of cash generated from working capital accounts offset by $13.0 million used to pay restructuring liabilities.       Cash Flow from Investing Activities       Cash used for investing  activities  totaled $5.2 million for 2004 compared to $8.6 million in 2003. Cash requirements included capital expenditures of $5.5 million and capitalized software  development costs of $2.4 million.  These uses were  partially  offset by proceeds from asset  disposals of $2.7 million.  Cash used for  investing  activities  in 2003 included  capital  expenditure  of $6.5 million and capitalized  software  development costs of $3.3 million.  Estimated capital  expenditures for 2005 are approximately $6 to $8 million.  In addition, we expect to spend approximately $5 million for internally developed software in 2005, a portion of which may be capitalized.       Cash Flow from Financing Activities       Cash provided by financing  activities was $3.7 million in 2004 compared to cash used of $7.2 million in 2003.  During 2004,  we utilized  $18.8  million of increased  revolving credit borrowings to reduce long-term debt by $10.9 million and to satisfy  working  capital  requirements.  During 2003, we utilized $130.0 million of  proceeds  from new term loans and an increase  in  revolving  credit borrowings  of $44.2  million to repay  $162.2  million of term loans  under our former Amended Credit Facility and to pay $11.9 million of debt issuance costs.                                           20          Contractual Obligations       Our  contractual  obligations  as of  January  2,  2005  are  shown  in the following table:                                                                       Payment due by Period                                       -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Contractual Obligations                 Total          2005         2006-07          2008-09     2010 and beyond - -----------------------               ---------     ---------      ---------         -------     ---------------                                                               (dollars in millions) Long-Term Debt, including                 Capital Leases                     $  740.1        $ 60.4        $293.7 (1)        $380.0          $  6.0 Interest (2)                             296.7          79.4         143.0              73.8             0.5 Operating Leases                          71.4          16.2          22.1              14.2            18.9 Purchase Obligations (3)                 688.4         232.0         190.9             177.0            88.5 Restructuring Liabilities                  7.4           1.8           1.9               1.6             2.1 Employee Benefits and Other (4)                                       --------        ------        ------            ------          ------ Total Contractual Obligations (5)     $1,804.0        $389.8        $651.6            $646.6          $116.0                                       ========        ======        ======            ======          ======   (1)  Includes  $114.9  million of revolving  credit  borrowings  due in 2007 but      classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet to comply with EITF      95-22. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.  (2)  Includes interest  applicable to borrowings  outstanding at January 2, 2005      computed  using  interest rates in effect as of January 2, 2005 through the      due  dates  of  the  borrowings  as  defined  by the  applicable  financing      agreements plus interest on replacement  financing after the 13 1/2% Senior      Subordinated Notes are repaid at maturity on August 15, 2005.  (3)  Includes  outstanding  purchase  orders and other  commitments  to purchase      minimum quantities of materials or services.  (4)  We also have obligations to provide employee benefits including those under      our  defined  benefit  and defined  contribution  retirement  plans and our      medical  benefit plan. In addition,  we are  partially  self-insured  for a      number of risks  including  workers'  compensation,  automobile and general      liability. Due to the many variables involved,  accurate estimates of these      future obligations cannot be made. In 2004,  payments for these obligations      aggregated approximately $37.7 million.

Business  segment results include  revenues and costs that are specifically identifiable and costs shared by business  segments have been allocated based on utilization.  2004 Compared to 2003       Net sales for 2004 decreased 3% to $1,266.4  million from $1,304.6  million in 2003. The decrease was primarily  attributable  to a $96.1 million decline in net sales in the  Automotive  Products  segment due to lower  volume,  including sourcing actions by major customers, partially offset by higher net sales in the Foam Products and Technical Products segments.       Gross profit was $141.8 million, or 11.2% of net sales, in 2004 compared to $143.7 million, or 11.0% of net sales, in 2003. Gross profit margin has improved primarily due to profit  improvement  as a result of better  product mix in Foam Products and lower costs in Carpet Cushion  Products,  partially offset by lower volume in the Automotive Products segment. However, gross profit margin declined in the last six months of 2004 and in the fourth  quarter was 8.7%. We were only partially able to recover raw material cost increases during 2004.       Income from  operations for 2004 was $51.8  million,  or 4.1% of net sales, which  represented a 20% decrease from the $64.4 million,  or 4.9% of net sales, reported for 2003. A decline of $14.2 million in the Automotive Products segment more than offset increases in the other operating segments. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $5.8 million, or 7%, principally due to a $3.0 million  net  charge  to bad  debt  expense  following  a  customer  bankruptcy, litigation related costs and higher  professional fees primarily for information technology  and the cost of our efforts under Section 404 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act,  partially offset by lower corporate expense and employee costs as a result of the closing of our New York City office.  Results  include net  restructuring charges of $3.2 million in 2004 and net restructuring credits of $1.8 million in 2003. Restructuring items are discussed under "Other" below.       Foam Products       Foam Products net sales for 2004 increased 9% to $551.4 million from $507.6 million in 2003  primarily  due to higher  volumes of  value-added  products and higher selling prices.  Income from operation  increased 19% to $52.4 million in 2004 from $44.0 million in 2003  principally as a result of improved  volume mix and higher selling prices partially offset by higher raw material costs.  Income from operations was 9.5% of net sales in 2004 and 8.7% of net sales in 2003.       Carpet Cushion Products       Carpet  Cushion  Products  net  sales  for  2004  of  $209.2  million  were essentially  flat compared to 2003.  Income from  operations was $8.5 million in 2004  compared to $5.4 million in 2003 with the increase due  primarily to lower material and operating  costs.  Income from  operations was 4.1% of net sales in 2004 and 2.6% of net sales in 2003.       Automotive Products       Automotive Products net sales for 2004 decreased 21% to $351.0 million from $447.1  million in 2003  principally  as a result of lower volumes from sourcing actions by major customers including a decrease in sales of                                          22    $54.4 million to our largest customer.  Income from operations  decreased 42% to $19.2  million  compared to $33.4  million in 2003  primarily due to lower sales volume and higher per unit labor and overhead costs.  Income from operations was 5.5% of net sales in 2004 and 7.5% of net sales in 2003.  We expect  that  sales will increase during 2005 but may be substantially less than in 2003.       Technical Products       Net sales for  Technical  Products in 2004  increased 6% to $124.1  million from $117.5  million in 2003 primarily due to higher unit volume and new product introductions.  Income from  operations  increased  2% to $32.9  million in 2004 compared to $32.1 million in 2003 primarily due to new product introductions and slightly higher overall pricing partially offset by higher selling,  general and administrative  expenses.  Income from operations was 26.5% of net sales in 2004 and 27.3% of net sales in 2003.       Other       Other  primarily   consists  of  certain   manufacturing   and  fabrication operations in Mexico City, corporate expenses not allocated to business segments and restructuring  charges (credits).  The increase in net sales associated with this segment resulted from our Mexico City operations.  The loss from operations was $61.3  million  in 2004 and $50.5  million  in 2003 and  reflects  generally higher  corporate  expenses in 2004 and includes  restructuring,  impairment and other  charges of $3.2  million,  discussed  below.  During  2003,  we  recorded restructuring credits of $1.8 million.       Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges       In 2004, we recorded  restructuring,  impairment  and other charges of $3.2 million,  primarily  consisting of a $1.7 million  charge related to lease costs and asset write offs in  connection  with the closing of our New York office,  a $0.7 million charge related to the realignment of our automotive  operations and an impairment charge of $0.6 million for an idle facility.       In 2003, we recorded  restructuring credits of $1.8 million consisting of a $3.2 million reduction in the liability  primarily for severance and termination benefits no longer required as the actions  contemplated under the related plans have been substantially  completed,  and a charge of $1.1 million for additional lease  termination  costs for a closed  facility  as a result of changes in real estate market conditions. Additionally, we recorded a $0.3 million restructuring charge reported in the Other segment as a result of an employee termination plan for approximately 300 employees at our Mexico City operations. The actions under this plan were substantially completed in 2003.       Interest and Debt Issuance Expense       Interest  and debt  issuance  expense  was  $76.7  million  in 2004,  which represented a 13% decrease from 2003 expense of $88.4  million.  The decrease is primarily due to lower  amortization  of debt issuance  costs,  which included a write off of $12.9 million in 2003 associated with the refinancing of our credit facilities       Income from Equity Interest in Joint Ventures       The income  from an equity  interest  in an Asian  joint  venture  was $0.5 million in 2004 and $1.2  million in 2003.  Income from an equity  interest in a joint  venture in Eastern  Europe was $0.2  million in 2004 and $0.3  million in 2003.       Other Income (Expenses), Net       Other  expense,  net was $0.2  million in 2004  compared to $3.4 million in 2003. The 2004 period includes  foreign currency  transaction  losses related to operations  in Mexico and Canada of $0.6  million  compared  to $2.7  million in 2003. Also included in 2004 were gains of $1.0 million on asset disposals.                                          23         Provision for Income Taxes       Foamex L.P.,  as a limited  partnership,  is not subject to Federal  income taxes;  therefore no current or deferred  provision  has been  provided for such taxes. However, we have provided for the income taxes of certain states in which we are  subject  to taxes and for  certain  subsidiaries,  which are  subject to Federal  and  state  income  taxes  and  for  subsidiaries  located  in  foreign jurisdictions  that file  separate  tax returns.  The partners  will provide for their  respective  shares of income or loss in their Federal or applicable state income tax returns.  Foamex L.P. has a tax sharing  agreement  that provides for the payment of  distributions to our partners for amounts that would be required to be paid if we were a corporation filing separate tax returns.  Our ability to make such  distributions  is limited by the terms of our credit  agreements  and indentures.  2003 Compared to 2002       Net sales for 2003 decreased 2% to $1,304.6  million from $1,328.1  million in 2002.  An  increase  in Foam  Products  net sales  were  more than  offset by decreases in the other  segments.  Selling price  increases in all segments were more than  offset,  in the  aggregate,  by  reductions  in  volume.  The  volume reductions were primarily due to the requirement to increase  selling prices and plant closures as we shifted away from unprofitable business.       Gross profit was $143.7 million, or 11.0% of net sales, in 2003 compared to $143.7 million, or 10.8% of net sales, in 2002. Gross profit margin has improved throughout 2003 from the depressed levels experienced in the second half of 2002 as we have been successful at recovering some of the raw material cost increases experienced in the second half of 2002 and we have realized  manufacturing  cost savings.       Income from  operations for 2003 was $64.4  million,  or 4.9% of net sales, which  represented a 45% increase from the $44.6 million,  or 3.4% of net sales, reported for 2002. Selling general and  administrative  expenses decreased $13.3 million, or 14%, due primarily to lower employee costs and professional fees. In 2002,  we incurred  $4.9  million of  organizational  and  transaction  costs in connection  with  a  proposed  public  offering  of  a  subsidiary,   which  was subsequently  terminated,  and a proposed  sale of the Carpet  Cushion  Products segment.  Restructuring,  impairment and other credits discussed below were $1.8 million in 2003, while we recorded  restructuring,  impairment and other charges of $4.8 million in 2002.       Foam Products       Foam Products net sales for 2003 increased 8% to $507.6 million from $471.0 million in 2002  primarily  due to increases in selling  prices to customers and increased volumes of consumer products,  partially offset by decreases in volume in other markets.  Income from operations decreased 3%, to $44.0 million in 2003 from  $45.5  million  in 2002,  primarily  due to  increases  in the cost of raw materials.  Income from operations was 8.7% of net sales in 2003 and 9.7% of net sales in 2002.       Carpet Cushion Products       Carpet Cushion  Products net sales for 2003 decreased 11% to $208.9 million from $234.0 million in 2002. Average selling prices increased but were more than offset by an  approximate  16% decline in volumes,  as we closed  several carpet cushion  facilities in 2002 and 2003 to focus this  business on more  profitable markets.  Income from operations  increased $4.2 million, or 335%, primarily due to cost  containment  from the  streamlining  of operations  and higher  selling prices. Income from operations represented 2.6% of net sales in 2003 and 0.5% of net sales in 2002.       Automotive Products       Automotive  Products net sales for 2003 decreased 4% to $447.1 million from $466.7 million in 2002.  Sales declined  throughout the second half of 2003 as a major  customer  decreased its  purchases  from us in an effort to diversify its supplier  base.  While  some of this  business  has been  recovered  from  other customers, automotive products net sales were just over $100 million per quarter in the second half of 2003,  which is an annual rate of more than $60.0  million less than the 2002 net sales. For the full year 2003, volumes were down about 1% and average                                          24    selling  prices  were  down  about 3% due to lower  fabric  costs  passed  on to customers.  Income from operations  decreased $0.7 million,  or 2%, as the lower sales were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs, resulting from a plant closure in early 2003 and labor and overhead reductions.  Income from operations represented 7.5% of net sales in 2003 and 7.3% of net sales in 2002.       Technical Products       Net sales for  Technical  Products in 2003  decreased 5% to $117.5  million from  $124.1  million  in 2002  primarily  due to a  decrease  in  volume  of 9% partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  average  selling  prices.  Income  from operations  decreased 9% to $32.1  million in 2003  compared to $35.2 million in 2002 due to higher raw  material  and  overhead  costs.  Income from  operations represented 27.3% of net sales in 2003 and 28.3% of net sales in 2002.       Other       Other  primarily   consists  of  certain   manufacturing   and  fabrication operations in Mexico City, corporate expenses not allocated to business segments and  restructuring,  impairment  and other  charges.  The $8.6 million,  or 27%, decrease in net sales associated with this segment  primarily  resulted from the Mexico  City  operation  and was  primarily  due to a  decline  in the  consumer products  business.  The loss  from  operations  was $50.5  million  in 2003 and included restructuring,  impairment and other credits of $1.8 million, discussed below.   The  loss  from  operations  in  2002  was  $71.5  million,   including restructuring,  impairment and other charges of $4.8 million,  discussed  below. Corporate  overhead  expenses and employee costs  decreased $7.8 million in 2003 compared to 2002.       Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges       In 2003, we recorded  restructuring credits of $1.8 million consisting of a $3.2 million reduction in the liability  primarily for severance and termination benefits no longer required as the actions  contemplated under the related plans have been substantially  completed,  and a charge of $1.1 million for additional lease  termination  costs for a closed  facility  as a result of changes in real estate market conditions. Additionally, we recorded a $0.3 million restructuring charge reported in the Other segment as a result of an employee termination plan for approximately 300 employees at our Mexico City operations. The actions under this plan were substantially completed in 2003.       In 2002,  we recorded net  restructuring,  impairment  and other charges of $4.8 million.  Fourth quarter  charges of $10.0 million  included  severance and other  termination  benefits for  approximately 200 employees and exit costs and remaining  lease  payments  related  to  the  reorganization  of  executive  and corporate management and the closure of six operations.  Approximately 60 of the planned terminations  occurred during 2002 with the remainder occurring in 2003. The charges also  included  $2.5  million of asset  impairments,  primarily  for leasehold  improvements  and  machinery  and  equipment  in the  Carpet  Cushion Products  segment.  Earlier in 2002, we recorded  restructuring,  impairment and other credits of $5.2 million including a reversal of approximately $3.7 million from the reevaluation of the 2001 Operational Reorganization Plan.       Interest and Debt Issuance Expense       Interest  and debt  issuance  expense  was  $88.4  million  in 2003,  which represented a 27% increase from 2002 expense of $69.7 million. The 2003 and 2002 periods  include  charges  of  $12.9  million  and $4.9  million,  respectively, relating  to the  write  off  of  debt  issuance  costs  as a  result  of  early extinguishment  of debt. Higher average debt levels,  higher effective  interest rates and higher  amortization  of debt issuance  costs all  contributed  to the increase in 2003.       Income from Equity Interest in Joint Ventures       The income  from an equity  interest  in an Asian  joint  venture  was $1.2 million in 2003 and $1.6  million in 2002.  Income from an equity  interest in a joint  venture in Eastern  Europe was $0.3  million in 2003 and $0.1  million in 2002.                                          25         Other Income (Expenses), Net       Other  expense,  net was $3.4  million in 2003  compared to $2.0 million in 2002. We incurred  foreign currency  transaction  losses of $2.7 million in 2003 compared to foreign currency transaction losses of $2.3 million in 2002.       Provision for Income Taxes       Foamex L.P.,  as a limited  partnership,  is not subject to Federal  income taxes;  therefore no current or deferred  provision  has been  provided for such taxes. However, we have provided for the income taxes of certain states in which we are  subject  to taxes and for  certain  subsidiaries,  which are  subject to Federal  and  state  income  taxes  and  for  subsidiaries  located  in  foreign jurisdictions  that file  separate  tax returns.  The partners  will provide for their  respective  shares of income or loss in their Federal or applicable state income tax returns.  Foamex L.P. has a tax sharing  agreement  that provides for the payment of  distributions to our partners for amounts that would be required to be paid if we were a corporation filing separate tax returns.  Our ability to make such  distributions  is limited by the terms of our credit  agreements  and indentures.       Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change       The  cumulative  effect of  accounting  change in 2002  includes a goodwill impairment charge of $72.0 million as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142.  OTHER  Environmental Health and Safety       We are subject to extensive and changing federal,  state, local and foreign environmental  laws  and  regulations,  including  those  relating  to the  use, handling, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances, the discharge or  emission  of  materials  into  the  environment,   and  the  remediation  of environmental contamination,  and as a result, are from time to time involved in administrative and judicial  proceedings and inquiries relating to environmental matters.  As of January 2, 2005, we had accruals of  approximately  $2.0 million for  environmental  matters  including  approximately  $1.7  million  related to remediating and monitoring soil and groundwater  contamination and approximately $0.3 million  relating to sites where we had been designated as a PRP by the EPA or a state authority and other matters.  Additional losses, if any, in excess of amounts currently accrued, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. If there are additional matters or if any current estimates are incorrect, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial  position,  results of operations and cash flows.       On  August  31,  2002,   Environment  Canada,  the  Canadian  environmental regulatory  agency,  finalized a rule which would require flexible  polyurethane foam manufacturing operations to reduce methylene chloride (dichloromethane) air emissions.  The  rule  establishes  a  50.0%  reduction  in  methylene  chloride emissions  by December 1, 2004 and 100.0%  reductions  by January 1, 2007.  This standard  will not require us to make  material  expenditures  for our  Canadian plants.       We have reported to the appropriate  state  authorities  that we have found soil and/or  groundwater  contamination  in excess of state standards at certain locations.  Seven sites are  currently  in various  stages of  investigation  or remediation. Accordingly, the extent of contamination and the ultimate liability is not known with certainty for all sites.       We have either  upgraded  or closed all  underground  storage  tanks at our facilities in accordance with applicable regulations.       The CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability without fault for the costs of  cleaning  up  contaminated  sites on certain  classes of persons  that contributed to the release of hazardous substances into the environment at those sites, for example, by generating wastes containing  hazardous  substances which were disposed at such sites. We are currently  designated as a PRP by the EPA or by state  environmental  agencies or other PRPs, pursuant to CERCLA or analogous state statutes,  with respect to 12 sites.  Estimates of total cleanup costs and                                          26    fractional  allocations  of liability  are often  provided by the EPA, the state environmental  agency or the  committee  of PRPs with  respect to the  specified site.  Based  on  these  estimates  (to  the  extent  available)  and  on  known information,  in each case and in the  aggregate,  we do not  expect  additional costs,  if any,  to be  material  to our  results of  operations,  cash flows or financial position.       Although it is possible that new information or future  developments  could require  us  to  reassess  the  potential   exposure  relating  to  all  pending environmental  matters,  including those described  above,  management  believes that, based upon all currently  available  information,  the resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial  position,   capital   expenditures  or  competitive   position.   The possibility  exists,   however,   that  new  environmental   legislation  and/or environmental  regulations may be adopted,  or other  environmental  conditions, including the presence of previously unknown environmental contamination, may be found  to  exist  or  a  reassessment  of  the  potential  exposure  to  pending environmental  matters  may  be  necessary  due  to new  information  or  future developments,  that may require expenditures not currently  anticipated and that may be material.  Claims and Litigation       We and our  subsidiaries are party to various  lawsuits,  both as defendant and  plaintiff,  arising in the normal course of business.  It is the opinion of management that the  disposition of these lawsuits will not,  individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of  operations or cash flows.  If  management's  assessment  is incorrect,  such actions  could  have a material  adverse  effect on our  consolidated  financial position,  results of operations  and cash flows.  As of January 2, 2005, we had accrued  approximately  $1.1 million for  litigation  and other legal matters in addition to the environmental matters discussed above.  Inflation, Raw Material Costs and Other Matters       On  average,  inflation  rates  for the  domestic  economy  continue  to be relatively low. Although long-term  inflation rates are difficult to predict, we believe we have the flexibility in operations and capital  structure to maintain a competitive position.  The prices of the two principal chemicals used by us in manufacturing,  TDI and  polyol,  are  influenced  by demand  and  manufacturing capacity. In addition, the prices of TDI and polyol are significantly influenced by  crude  oil  production  and  prices  and  by  world  political  instability, particularly in the Middle East. Results for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were negatively impacted by higher average costs for raw materials.  We experienced  significant increases in the prices of raw material from major chemical manufacturers during 2004 and 2002. We sought to recover these cost increases  through  manufacturing process  efficiencies  and  selling  price  increases,  but were only  partially successful.  We may not be  successful  in  implementing  further  selling price increases to fully recover raw material cost increases and  competitive  pricing pressure  may require us to adjust  selling  prices or lose  volume.  Results of operations have been and could be adversely  affected by delays in implementing, or inability to  implement,  additional  selling  price  increases to offset raw material  cost  increases.  Additionally,  we must  reduce and control our other operating and corporate expenses  including selling,  general and administrative expenses  to offset raw  material  cost  increases.  A failure  to recover  cost increases  could result in debt  covenant  violations  which may lead to lenders demanding  immediate  payment of our outstanding  debt and impair our ability to continue as a going concern.  ITEM 7a.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Our debt securities with variable interest rates are subject to market risk for changes in interest  rates. On January 2, 2005,  indebtedness  with variable interest rates totaled $239.3 million.  On an annualized  basis, if the interest rates on these  debt  instruments  increased  by 1.0%,  interest  expense  would increase by approximately $2.4 million.       The  two  principal   chemicals  used  in  the  manufacturing  of  flexible polyurethane  foam  are  TDI and  polyol.  The  prices  of TDI  and  polyol  are influenced by demand,  manufacturing capacity and oil and natural gas prices. We attempt to offset raw material price  increases  through selling price increases and manufacturing process efficiencies.                                          27    ITEM 8.
