ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Overview         Foamex L.P.  operates in the flexible  polyurethane  and advanced polymer foam products  industry.  As of December 31, 1999,  Foamex L.P.'s operations are conducted  directly and through its wholly owned  subsidiaries,  Foamex  Canada, Foamex  Mexico and Foamex  Asia.  Business  segments are listed  below.  Segment financial  information  is  included  in Note 15 to the  consolidated  financial statements.       o    Foam  Products -  manufactures  and  markets  foam used by the bedding           industry, the furniture industry and the retail industry.      o    Carpet Cushion Products - manufactures and distributes prime,  rebond,           sponge  rubber  and felt  carpet  cushion to Foamex  Carpet,  a sister           company wholly owned by Foamex International.      o    Automotive  Products - supplies foam primarily for automotive interior           applications to automotive manufacturers and tier one suppliers.      o    Technical  Products - manufactures and markets  reticulated  foams and           other custom  polyester and polyether foams for industrial,  specialty           and consumer and safety applications.      o    Other  -   primarily   consists  of  certain   foreign   manufacturing           operations,  corporate  expenses not  allocated to the other  business           segments and restructuring and other charges (credits).         Foamex L.P.'s sales are impacted by the sales of new and existing  homes, the  overall  level of  passenger  car and light  truck  production,  changes in personal  disposable income and seasonality.  Foamex L.P. typically  experiences two  seasonally  slow  periods  during  each  year,  in  early  July and in late December, due to scheduled plant shutdowns and holidays.         The  following   discussion  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the consolidated  financial  statements  and related  notes  included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS                                                    Carpet                                    Foam         Cushion     Automotive      Technical                                  Products       Products       Products      Products        Other       Total 1999                                                                (thousands)              Net sales                        $521,377     $187,668       $361,806         $92,180      $27,648    $1,190,679 Income (loss) from operations      54,439          869         22,853          23,048      (16,962)       84,247 Depreciation and amortization      16,390        6,436          4,596           2,564        2,604        32,590 Income (loss) from operations   as a percentage of net sales      10.4%         0.5%          6.3%            25.0%        n.m.*          7.1%  1998 Net sales                        $559,690     $210,313       $285,190         $79,140      $21,585    $1,155,918 Income (loss) from operations      36,253          (58)        17,319          14,919       (2,925)       65,508 Depreciation and amortization      17,418        5,092          4,582           2,615        1,972        31,679 Income (loss) from operations   as a percentage of net sales       6.5%         0.0%          6.1%            18.9%        n.m.*          5.7%  1997 Net sales                        $334,900     $273,920       $225,892         $76,254      $20,129      $931,095 Income (loss) from operations      30,974        8,795         24,885          18,071      (26,393)       56,332 Depreciation and amortization      10,237        4,166          3,309           2,290          880        20,882 Income (loss) from operations   as a percentage of net sales       9.2%         3.2%         11.0%            23.7%        n.m.*          6.1%   *  not meaningful                                           17   Acquisitions and Dispositions         On December 23, 1997, Foamex  International  acquired Crain pursuant to a merger agreement with Crain Holdings Corp. for a purchase price of approximately $213.7  million,  including  the  assumption  of  debt  with  a  face  value  of approximately $98.6 million (and an estimated fair value of approximately $112.3 million)  and  contributed  all of the  assets  of  Crain,  subject  to all  the liabilities of Crain, to Foamex L.P. In addition,  fees and expenses  associated with  the  Crain  Acquisition  were  approximately  $13.2  million.   The  Crain Acquisition  was  accounted  for as a  purchase  and the  results  of Crain were included from the acquisition date, except the results from December 24, 1997 to December 28, 1997 were not included in the consolidated statements of operations or cash flows for 1997 since the effect would be insignificant.         GFI Transaction         On February 27, 1998,  Foamex  International,  Foamex L.P. and certain of their affiliates  completed a series of transactions which changed Foamex L.P.'s structure  (collectively,  the "GFI Transaction").  Prior to the consummation of these transactions,  Foamex L.P. defeased the $4.5 million outstanding principal amount of its 9 1/2% senior  secured  notes due 2000.  Foamex  L.P.  settled its intercompany  payables to General Felt  Industries,  Inc.  ("General Felt") with $4.8 million in cash and a promissory note in the aggregate  principal amount of $34.0  million  supported by a $34.5  million  letter of credit under the Foamex L.P. credit facility (the "Foamex/GFI Note"). The initial  transaction  resulted in the transfer  from Foamex L.P. to Foam Funding LLC, an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of Trace, of all of the outstanding  common stock of General Felt, in exchange for (i) the  assumption by Foam Funding LLC of $129.0 million of Foamex L.P.'s  indebtedness and (ii) the transfer by Foam Funding LLC to Foamex L.P. of a 1%  non-managing  general  partnership  interest  in Foamex  L.P. As a result, General Felt ceased being a subsidiary  of Foamex L.P. and was relieved from all obligations under Foamex L.P.'s 9 7/8% senior subordinated notes due 2007 and 13 1/2%  senior  subordinated  notes due 2005.  Upon  consummation  of the  initial transaction,  Foamex  Carpet,  a newly formed wholly owned  subsidiary of Foamex International,  Foamex International, Foam Funding LLC, and General Felt entered into an Asset Purchase  Agreement dated February 27, 1998, in which General Felt sold  substantially  all of its assets (other than cash, the Foamex/GFI Note and its operating facility in Pico Rivera,  California) to Foamex Carpet in exchange for (i) $20.0 million in cash and (ii) a promissory note issued by Foamex Carpet to Foam Funding LLC in the  aggregate  principal  amount of $70.2  million.  The $20.0 million cash payment was funded with a distribution by Foamex L.P.         No gain has been recognized on the GFI Transaction. The net impact of the GFI transaction was an increase in Foamex L.P.'s partners'  capital (deficit) of approximately   $10.1  million,  a  distribution  of  $20.0  million  to  Foamex International  and approximately  $1.5 million of fees charged to earnings.  The $129.0  million of debt assumed by Foam Funding LLC in the GFI  Transaction  was used to repay  approximately  $125.1  million of term loan  borrowings  that was accounted for as an  extinguishment  of debt which resulted in an  extraordinary loss of  approximately  $3.2 million.  The 1% non-managing  general  partnership interest  acquired in connection with the GFI Transaction was accounted for as a redemption of equity.  1999 Compared to 1998         Total net sales for 1999 increased 3.0% to $1,190.7 million from $1,155.9 million in 1998. The increase was primarily the result of stronger volume growth in the Automotive  Products and Technical  Products segments partially offset by sales declines in the Foam Products and Carpet Cushion Products segments.         Income  from  operations  increased  28.6% to $84.2  million in 1999 from $65.5 million in 1998.  Results in 1999 included $10.8 million of  restructuring and other charges. In 1998, a net restructuring credit of previously established restructuring  accruals  increased  operating  income  by $10.1  million.  These restructuring  and other charges  (credits) are discussed  further under "Other" below.  Excluding the  restructuring and other charges  (credits)for  comparison purposes,  income from operations  increased 71.7% to $95.1 million in 1999 from $55.4 million in 1998. On this basis, income from operations represented 8.0% of net  sales in 1999,  up from  4.8% of net  sales in 1998.  The  improvement  was primarily  due to (i) the  increase in net sales,  (ii)  improved  gross  profit margins and (iii) lower selling, general and administrative expenses at both the business unit and  corporate  levels.  Improved  gross profit  margins  resulted primarily  from  operating  efficiencies,  the  benefits  of the first  phase of implementation of                                         18   improved  operating  practices  across a number  of  Foamex  L.P.'s  facilities, enhanced  raw  material   utilization  and  the  full  year  benefits  from  the consolidation   of  former  Crain   facilities.   Lower  selling,   general  and administrative  expenses  primarily  reflected  the  integration  of  the  Crain Acquisition,  staffing  reductions  in January  1999,  elimination  of the Trace management fee and the closure of the New York office.         Foam Products         Foam Products net sales for 1999  decreased  6.8% to $521.4  million from $559.7  million in 1998.  The decrease  was  primarily  due to  decreased  sales volumes resulting from Foamex L.P.'s decision to exit certain business lines and the closure of facilities related to the Crain Acquisition.  Despite the decline in sales,  income from operations  increased 50.2% to $54.4 million in 1999 from $36.3 million in 1998. Income from operations  represented 10.4% of net sales in 1999, up from 6.5% in 1998. The improvement was primarily driven by (i) enhanced raw material utilization, (ii) the benefits of the first phase of implementation of improved  operating  practices  across a number of Foamex L.P.'s  facilities, (iii) the benefits of consolidation of facilities in the Southeast region of the U.S.  and  in  Southern   California  and  (iv)  the  elimination  of  operating inefficiencies  incurred in 1998.  Income from operations for 1998 was adversely impacted by a number of  factors,  the most  significant  of which were (i) $4.0 million of costs  associated  with the Crain  Acquisition  transition  including inventory   adjustments  for  facilities   affected  by  the   consolidation  of manufacturing  facilities,  (ii) operating inefficiencies and logistics costs of $2.5 million  associated with the sales of juvenile and other consumer  products sold through mass  merchandisers  and discount stores and (iii) operating losses and  inefficiencies  of $1.0  million  resulting  from  fires at  Foamex  L.P.'s facilities in Orlando, Florida and Cornelius, North Carolina.         Carpet Cushion Products         Carpet  Cushion  Products  net sales for 1999  decreased  10.8% to $187.7 million  from  $210.3  million in 1998  primarily  due to lower  sales  volumes. Competitive  pressures in the carpet  cushion  marketplace  contributed to lower sales volumes.  Sales volumes were also reduced due to limited  production  from Foamex L.P.'s  Orlando,  Florida  facility as a result of the 1998 fire.  Income from  operations  for 1999 increased to $0.9 million from a loss of $0.1 million in 1998. Income from operations  continued to be impacted by lower sales volumes and the  Orlando  fire,  which  increased  product  transportation  costs as the fulfillment process was shifted to less geographically  optimal facilities.  The Orlando,  Florida carpet cushion line was brought back on stream and operational in the fourth  quarter of 1999.  These  effects were  partially  offset by lower expenses  associated  with  the   rationalization   associated  with  the  Crain Acquisition.  Results in 1998 were impacted by a $1.0 million charge  associated with the  Orlando,  Florida  fire and costs  related  to the  Crain  Acquisition transition of $0.9 million.         Automotive Products         Automotive  Products net sales for 1999 increased 26.9% to $361.8 million from $285.2  million in 1998,  primarily  as a result of higher  sales volume of lamination products.  Income from operations increased 32.0% to $22.9 million in 1999 from $17.3 million in 1998. Income from operations  represented 6.3% of net sales in 1999, up from 6.1% in 1998.  The  improvement  was primarily due to (i) operating  efficiencies  at Foamex L.P.'s Mexican border  facilities that became fully  operational  in the  fourth  quarter  of 1998  and (ii)  increased  sales volumes.  Income from  operations  for 1998 was  reduced by (i) $3.0  million of costs  incurred  during  the start up phase of new  lamination  business  at the Mexican border, (ii) contract price reductions of approximately $1.1 million and (iii) losses of $1.0 million  associated  with the production of  thermoformable headliners.         Technical Products         Technical  Products net sales for 1999  increased  16.5% to $92.2 million from $79.1  million in 1998.  Income from  operations  increased  54.5% to $23.0 million in 1999 from $14.9 million in 1998.  Income from operations  represented 25.0% of net sales in 1999, up from 18.9% in 1998. The improvement was primarily driven  by  favorable  market  conditions,  strong  growth in sales  volumes,  a higher-margin  product mix and  improved  manufacturing  efficiencies.  Plans to expand capacity for Technical  Products were initiated during the second half of 1999.                                          19         Other         Other  primarily  consists of certain foreign  manufacturing  operations, corporate  expenses not  allocated to business  segments and  restructuring  and other charges (credits).  The increase in net sales associated with this segment primarily  resulted from an increase in net sales from Foamex L.P.'s Mexico City operation.  The loss from  operations in 1999 was primarily  associated with the $10.8 million of restructuring  and other charges discussed below. The loss from operations in 1998 included $10.1 million of net restructuring credits discussed below. The loss from operations for 1998 was impacted by accounts receivable and inventory  writedowns of approximately  $8.5 million at the Mexico City facility and start up costs of $2.5 million for Foamex L.P.'s Asian joint venture.         Restructuring  and other  charges for 1999  amounted to $10.8 million and were comprised of restructuring  charges of approximately  $9.4 million for four restructuring  plans,  approximately  $1.1 million of restructuring  adjustments related to changes in estimates  primarily to the 1998  restructuring  plans and $0.3 million of other charges for additional reserves for Trace receivables. The $9.4  million  1999  restructuring  charge was  comprised  of $6.9  million  for personnel reductions, $1.0 million for plant closure and lease costs relating to the closure of one facility and certain product line rationalizations during the year and $1.5 million for asset writedowns associated with the plant closure and consolidations.  See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.         In 1998,  net  restructuring  credits were  approximately  $10.1 million, which  reflect a $14.8  million  reversal of prior year's  restructuring  plans, offset by other  charges of $4.7  million.  The $4.7 million was  comprised of a $2.4 million  reserve for net  receivables  due from Trace and a $2.3 million of impaired cost in excess of assets acquired  associated with a foreign  facility. However,  these  charges  were offset by a $14.8  million  restructuring  credit associated with modifications to the 1997 restructuring  plan. The $14.8 million credit reflected the reversal of $10.2 million of fixed asset  writedowns,  $3.5 million of plant closure and  operating  lease  obligations  and $1.1 million of personnel reductions.         As of December 31, 1999, all personnel affected by restructuring had been terminated.  Cash spending during 1999 for implementation of restructuring plans approximated  $8.6  million.  Future cash spending for the  restructuring  plans approximates  $11.0 million.  Foamex L.P.  expects to spend  approximately  $3.9 million during 2000 and the remaining $7.1 million (related principally to lease runout payments) is expected to be spent through 2006.         Interest and Debt Issuance Expense         Interest  and  debt  issuance  expense  totaled  $66.5  million  in 1999, slightly  higher than the 1998  expense of $66.1  million.  The benefit of lower average debt levels was offset by higher effective  interest rates and increased amortization expense related to additional debt issuance costs paid during 1999.         Other Income (Expense), Net         Other income (expense), net totaled $0.9 million and was primarily due to losses on the  disposal of fixed assets and letter of credit fees related to the GFI Transaction. Interest income totaled $2.2 million in 1999.         Other income (expense),  net for 1998 primarily consists of: $3.0 million of foreign currency translation and transaction losses; $1.5 million of fees and $1.0  million of  continuing  costs  related to the GFI  Transaction;  and other expenses offset by approximately $3.4 million of interest income.         Income Tax Expense         Foamex  L.P.,  as a limited  partnership,  is not  subject to Federal and certain state income  taxes.  However,  the  consolidated  financial  statements include a provision  for income taxes which  primarily  relates to certain state income  taxes of Foamex L.P.  and Federal and state  income  taxes of  corporate subsidiaries  and  subsidiaries  located  in  foreign  jurisdictions  that  file separate  income  tax  returns.  See  Note  8  to  the  consolidated   financial statements.                                         20           Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations         Income (loss) from continuing  operations  increased to $15.6 million for 1999 as compared to a loss of $5.9  million in 1998.  The  increase is primarily due to improved  operating results during 1999 as compared to 1998, as discussed above.         Extraordinary Loss         The  extraordinary  loss on the early  extinguishment of debt in 1998 was $3.2  million.  The charge  primarily  reflected  the write-off of debt issuance costs in connection with the GFI Transaction.  1998 Compared to 1997         Net sales for 1998 were $1,155.9 million as compared to $931.1 million in 1997, an increase of $224.8 million or 24.1%.  Income from operations  increased $9.2 million or 16.3% to $65.5 million for 1998 from $56.3 million in 1997.  The increase in net sales and income from operations were primarily  associated with the Crain Acquisition in December 1997, reduced  restructuring and other charges (credits) and the increase in automotive  lamination  products during the latter part of 1998 which were offset by the impact of the GFI  Transaction in February 1998 by which General Felt ceased to be a consolidated subsidiary of Foamex L.P. During 1998, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $7.4 million primarily  due  to  costs   associated   with  the  integration  of  Crain  (the "Transition").  Also during 1998,  Foamex L.P.  recorded income of $14.8 million for the reversal of 1997 restructuring charges,  offset by $4.7 million of other charges  associated  with the  impairment  of goodwill on the  Montreal,  Canada operations ($2.3 million), and an allowance for receivables due from Trace ($2.4 million).         Foam Products         Foam Products net sales for 1998  increased  67.1% to $559.7 million from $334.9  million  in 1997 and income  from  operations  increased  17.0% to $36.3 million  (6.5%  of net  sales)  from  $31.0  million  (9.2% of net  sales).  The increases in net sales and income from operations were primarily associated with the Crain  Acquisition in December 1997. The decrease in income from  operations as a  percentage  of net sales  was  primarily  the  result of (i) costs of $4.0 million  associated with the  Transition,  including  inventory  adjustments for facilities  affected by the  consolidation  of  manufacturing  facilities;  (ii) operating  inefficiencies and logistic costs of $2.5 million associated with the sales of juvenile and other  consumer  products sold through mass  merchandisers and discount stores;  (iii) operating losses and  inefficiencies of $1.0 million resulting from the fires at Orlando, Florida and Cornelius, North Carolina; (iv) selling  price  decreases of $0.5 million  resulting  from  competitive  pricing pressures due to market share challenges from competitors and (v) the inherently lower  margins of Crain when compared to Foamex L.P.'s  historical  margins.  In addition,  operating  margins  decreased in 1998 since  Foamex L.P.  carried the operating costs of both companies during the Transition.         Carpet Cushion Products         Carpet  Cushion  Products  net sales for 1998  decreased  23.2% to $210.3 million from $273.9 million in 1997 primarily due to the GFI Transaction  offset by an increase in net sales  associated  with the Crain  Acquisition in December 1997.  Income  (loss) from  operations  decreased to a loss of $0.1 million from income  of $8.8  million  (3.2% of net  sales).  The  decreases  were  primarily associated  with  the GFI  Transaction  and  increased  costs  of  $1.0  million associated  with the Orlando fire and costs  related to the  Transition  of $0.9 million.         Automotive Products         Automotive  Products net sales for 1998 increased 26.3% to $285.2 million from $225.9 million in 1997 and income from operations  decreased 30.4% to $17.3 million  (6.1% of net  sales)  from  $24.9  million  (11.0% of net  sales).  The increase  in net  sales  was  primarily  associated  with  increased  volume  of lamination products. Income from operations decreased principally as a result of (i)  higher  costs of $3.0  million  incurred  during  the start up phase of new lamination  business at the Mexican  border,  (ii) contract price  reductions of approximately  $1.1 million and (iii) losses of $1.0 million associated with the production of thermoformable headliners.                                         21          Technical Products         Technical  Products net sales for 1998  increased  3.8% to $79.1  million from $76.3 million in 1997 and income from  operations  decreased 17.4% to $14.9 million  (18.9% of net  sales)  from $18.1  million  (23.7% of net  sales).  The increased net sales were  primarily  associated  with Foamex  L.P.'s  industrial gasketing  and sealing  products.  The  decrease in income from  operations  was primarily  associated with a higher mix of lower margin industrial  products and production inefficiencies on certain products.         Other         Other  primarily  consists of certain foreign  manufacturing  operations, corporate   expenses  not  allocated  to  the  other   operating   segments  and restructuring  and other charges.  The increase in net sales was associated with the  facility in Mexico City that began  operations  in the second half of 1997. The increase in income from operations was primarily  associated with a reversal of $14.8  million of  restructuring  charges set up in 1997,  offset by accounts receivable and inventory writedowns of $8.5 million at the Mexico City facility, start up  costs of $2.5  million  for  Foamex  L.P.'s  Asian  joint venture  and duplicate administrative costs incurred during the Transition.         Interest and Debt Issuance Expense         Interest and debt issuance expense totaled $66.1 million in 1998 compared to $44.2 million in 1997. The increase was primarily due to the debt incurred in connection with the Crain  Acquisition  partially offset by the favorable effect of a debt refinancing in June 1997.         Other Income (Expense), Net         Other income (expense),  net for 1998 primarily consists of: $3.0 million of foreign currency translation and transaction losses; $1.5 million of fees and $1.0  million of  continuing  costs  related to the GFI  Transaction;  and other expenses offset by approximately $3.4 million of interest income.         Other  income  (expense),  net for 1997 was  comprised  primarily of $1.4 million of interest income and a gain on the sale of assets of $0.4 million.         Income Tax Expense         Foamex  L.P.,  as a limited  partnership,  is not  subject to Federal and certain state income  taxes.  However,  the  consolidated  financial  statements include a provision  for income taxes which  primarily  relates to certain state income  taxes of Foamex L.P.  and Federal and state  income  taxes of  corporate subsidiaries  and  subsidiaries  located  in  foreign  jurisdictions  that  file separate  income tax  returns.  Foamex L.P. did not  recognize  the tax benefits associated  with  losses  in  Mexico  because  it  appears  likely  that the net operating loss carryforwards  would not be realized in the near future. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.         Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations         Income  (loss) from  continuing  operations  decreased  to a loss of $5.9 million for 1998 as compared to income of $11.3 million in 1997. The decrease is primarily due to an increase of approximately $21.9 million in interest and debt issuance expense and a decrease in other income (expense) of approximately  $6.3 million, as previously discussed.         Extraordinary Loss         The  extraordinary  loss on early  extinguishment of debt in 1998 of $3.2 million was primarily  associated  with the write-off of debt issuance  costs in connection  with  the  GFI  Transaction.   The   extraordinary   loss  on  early extinguishment  of debt  in  1997 of  $48.6  million  primarily  relates  to the write-off of debt issuance costs and  redemption  premiums  associated  with the early  extinguishment  of long-term debt in connection  with a 1997  refinancing plan.                                         22   Liquidity and Capital Resources         Foamex L.P.'s operating cash requirements  consist principally of working capital   requirements,   scheduled   payments  of  principal  and  interest  on outstanding  indebtedness and capital  expenditures.  Foamex L.P.  believes that cash flow from its operating  activities,  cash on hand and periodic  borrowings under  its  credit  facility,  discussed  below,  will be  adequate  to meet its liquidity  requirements.  All  principal  and  interest  payments  were  made as scheduled in 1999.  The ability of Foamex L.P. to make  distributions  to Foamex International is restricted by the terms of its financing agreements; therefore, Foamex  International  is not expected to have access to the cash flow generated by Foamex L.P. for the foreseeable future.         Cash and cash equivalents  totaled $1.6 million at year-end 1999 compared to $3.2  million  at the end of  1998.  Working  capital  at the end of 1999 was $110.5  million and the current ratio was 1.7 to 1. Excluding the $715.8 million of  long-term  debt that was  classified  as a  current  liability  at  year-end December 31, 1998 for comparative  purposes,  working capital at the end of 1998 was  $113.5  million  and the  current  ratio  was 1.6 to 1.  Improved  accounts receivable and inventory management  contributed to a $57.5 million reduction in accounts  payable.  Total debt at year-end 1999 was $690.0  million,  down $36.4 million or 5.0% from the end of 1998.         Cash Flow from Operating Activities         Cash  provided  by  operating  activities  was $58.1  million for 1999 as compared to cash used of $27.8 million in 1998.  The  improvement  was driven by the increase in income from  operations  and improved  accounts  receivable  and inventory management.         Cash Flow from Investing Activities         Cash used for investing activities was $15.8 million for 1999 compared to $43.1 million in 1998. The decrease was primarily  driven by the sale of certain assets and lower capital spending. Cash provided by the sale of assets primarily represented the proceeds from the sale of Foamex L.P.'s packaging business ($1.5 million)  in  October  1999  which  was  part  of  a  1998  restructuring  plan. Additionally, capital expenditures in 1999 of $19.4 million were down from prior years. Foamex L.P. expects capital expenditures for 2000 to return to prior year levels  and  be in  excess  of  $30.0  million  primarily  as a  result  of  the construction  of two new VPFSM machines.  In addition,  Foamex L.P. is exploring the possible implementation of a new ERP software system.         Cash Flow from Financing Activities         Cash  required  for  financing  activities  was  $43.8  million  for 1999 compared  to cash  provided  of  $64.6  million  in 1998.  Requirements  in 1999 primarily  reflected  net debt  repayments,  distributions  paid to partners and costs  related to  amending  the debt  agreements.  Partially  offsetting  these requirements  was  the  repayment  of a tax  distribution  advance  from  Foamex International (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements).         Financial Condition         As of December 31, 1998,  Foamex L.P. was not in compliance  with various debt covenants included in agreements  totaling $415.4 million.  Had the lenders under these debt agreements  accelerated  the maturity of the  indebtedness as a result of the noncompliance, the acceleration would have constituted an event of default  and  given  the  holders  the  right  to  require  the   repurchase  of substantially all of Foamex L.P.'s long-term debt. As a result of these factors, approximately  $715.8  million  of  long-term  debt at  December  31,  1998  was classified  as a current  liability in the  consolidated  balance  sheet,  which produced a working capital deficit. As discussed below, amendments were executed to modify certain financial covenants.  As of December 31, 1999, Foamex L.P. was in compliance  with its financial  covenants and long-term  debt was  classified based on its maturity schedule as of December 31, 1999.                                         23           Foamex L.P. Credit Facility         In response to financial conditions at year-end 1998,  amendments to debt agreements  were executed  during the first half of 1999. As a result the Foamex L.P.  credit  facility,  which was amended and  restated in February  1998,  was further amended and restated in June 1999 (the "Foamex L.P. Credit Facility") to modify  financial  covenants  for net worth,  interest  coverage,  fixed  charge coverage and leverage  ratios  through  December  2006.  The  agreement was also amended to no longer permit Foamex L.P. to make certain cash payments, including the payment of an annual management fee of $3.0 million to a subsidiary of Trace and distributions to Foamex  International,  and to limit future  investments in foreign  subsidiaries  and joint  ventures.  The "change of control"  definition under the agreement was also modified to conform to the definition  discussed in "change of control" in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.  Changes in the  interest  rate  structure,  effective  in 2000,  were  also made and are discussed  below.  Foamex L.P. was in compliance with this agreement at year-end 1999.         At year-end  1999,  interest was based on the  combination  of a variable rate consisting of the higher of (i) the base rate of The Bank of Nova Scotia or (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5% plus a margin.  The margins for revolving, Term  B,  Term  C and  Term  D  loans  were  2.25%,  2.50%,  2.75%  and  2.875%, respectively.  At the option of Foamex L.P.,  portions of the outstanding  loans are  convertible  into  LIBOR  based  loans  plus  1.0%  added  to  the  margins identified.  The effective interest rates for the Foamex L.P. Credit Facility at the end of 1999 ranged between 9.69% and 10.06%.         Available  borrowings  under the revolving  credit facility totaled $24.2 million at year-end  1999.  Letters of credit  outstanding  at December 31, 1999 totaled $47.1  million.  Borrowings  under the Foamex L.P.  Credit  Facility are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of Foamex L.P. on a pari passu basis with the IRBs (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements).         As part of the Foamex L.P.  Credit  Facility,  excess cash flow generated annually,  as defined,  is required to prepay portions of Term B, C and D loans. The prepayment amount determined for 1999 was $13.3 million and will be financed through revolving loans under the facility.  The required payment is expected to be made during the second quarter of 2000. The repayment  schedules for the Term B, C and D loans  have been  adjusted,  as of  year-end  1999,  to  reflect  the prepayment required.         Effective  January 1, 2000, the interest rate on  outstanding  borrowings under the Foamex L.P.  Credit  Facility  will  increase by 25 basis  points each quarter that Foamex L.P.'s  leverage  ratio,  as defined,  exceeds 5.00 to 1.00. Once the leverage ratio is reduced below this level,  the  cumulative  amount of any 25 basis point  adjustments  to the  interest  rate on  borrowings  would be eliminated.  At December 31, 1999,  the  calculated  leverage  ratio was 5.48 to 1.00.  Consequently,  the basis  point  adjustment  will be  applicable  for the calculation of interest in the first quarter of 2000.  Buyout Proposals         On  February  9,  2000,  Foamex  International  announced  that  it is in discussions  with  respect to a proposal  involving  the  acquisition  of all of Foamex  International's  outstanding common stock for cash. Foamex International stated that the  proposal is subject to a number of  conditions,  including  the buyer's ongoing due diligence and the execution of definitive agreements. Foamex International  agreed to an exclusive  negotiating  period  ending five business days after  delivery  of its  audited  financial  statements  included in Foamex International's  Annual  Report  on Form  10-K  to the  prospective  buyer.  See "Business - Buyout Proposals".         On August  5,  1999,  Foamex  International  announced  that its Board of Directors signed a letter of intent with Sorgenti Chemical  Industries,  LLC and Liberty  Partners  Holdings  20,  LLC  (collectively,  the  "Purchasers")  for a business combination.  On December 15, 1999, Foamex International announced that the letter of intent with the  Purchasers,  which had been extended,  expired by its terms.         In 1998,  Foamex  International  received an unsolicited  buyout proposal from Trace, Foamex International's  principal stockholder.  Foamex International entered into two merger agreements, which were subsequently terminated by Trace.                                          24    Change in Control         Trace is a  privately  held  company,  which owned  approximately  29% of Foamex  International's  outstanding  voting common stock at March 10, 2000, and whose former  Chairman also serves as Foamex  International's  Chairman.  Foamex International's  common  stock owned by Trace is pledged as  collateral  against certain of Trace's  obligations.  Certain credit agreements and promissory notes of Foamex L.P.  provide that a "change of control"  would be an event of default and could  result in the  acceleration  of  substantially  all of Foamex  L.P.'s long-term debt.         Trace is  presently  in  bankruptcy  proceedings  under  Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy  Code in Federal Court in New York City.  Trace's  bankruptcy  filing does not  constitute  a "change of  control"  under the  provisions  of the debt agreements.  A "change of control" could take place  however,  if the bankruptcy court allows  Trace's  creditors  to  foreclose on and take  ownership of Foamex International's  common stock owned by Trace, or otherwise  authorizes a sale or transfer  of these  shares,  under  circumstances  in which a person or  related group,  other  than  Trace,  acquired  more than 25% of  Foamex  International's outstanding  voting  stock and owned a greater  percentage  of such voting stock than the amount beneficially owned by Trace.         Management  believes  that it is unlikely that a "change of control" will occur as a result of Trace's bankruptcy proceedings.  However, Foamex L.P. would seek to  resolve  the issues  that may arise  should  the  "change  of  control" provisions  be  triggered,  by  requesting  waivers  of such  provisions  and/or refinancing  certain debt, if necessary.  There can be no assurance  that Foamex L.P. or its subsidiaries will be able to do so, or that Foamex L.P. will be able to obtain waivers of such provisions. Such circumstances raise substantial doubt about Foamex L.P.'s  ability to continue as a going  concern.  The  accompanying financial  statements were prepared on a going-concern  basis and do not include any  adjustments  that might  result  from the  outcome of the Trace  bankruptcy filing.  Environmental Matters         Foamex L.P. is subject to extensive and changing  environmental  laws and regulations.  Expenditures to date in connection  with Foamex L.P.'s  compliance with  such  laws and  regulations  did not have a  material  adverse  effect  on operations,  financial position,  capital expenditures or competitive  position. Liabilities recorded by Foamex L.P. in connection with environmental  matters as of December  31, 1999  totaled $3.5  million.  Although it is possible  that new information  or future  developments  could require  Foamex L.P. to reassess its potential  exposure  to  all  pending  environmental  matters,  including  those described in the consolidated  financial statements,  Foamex L.P. believes that, based upon all  currently  available  information,  the  resolution  of all such pending  environmental  matters will not have a  significant  adverse  effect on Foamex  L.P.'s  operations,   financial   position,   capital   expenditures  or competitive position.  Inflation and Other Matters         On  average,  inflation  rates for the  domestic  economy  continue to be relatively  low.  Although  long-term  inflation rates are difficult to predict, Foamex L.P.  believes it has the flexibility in operations and capital structure to maintain a competitive  position. In recent years, results of operations were adversely  affected  by raw  material  cost  increases.  The  price  of the  two principal chemicals used, TDI and polyol, is influenced by demand, manufacturing capacity and oil prices. The recent increase in oil prices did not significantly impact raw material  costs in 1999.  Any  sustained  increase in oil prices will likely  result  in  higher  raw  material  cost  and also  increase  the cost of operations.  Results  for the  first  quarter  of  2000  are  anticipated  to be negatively  impacted  by  higher  transportation  costs  related  to  oil  price increases and higher costs for raw materials. Foamex L.P. attempts to offset raw material cost increases through selling price increases;  however,  there can be no assurance that Foamex L.P. will be successful in  implementing  selling price increases or that  competitive  pricing pressure will not require Foamex L.P. to adjust selling  prices.  Results of operations  have been and could be adversely affected  by  delays  in  implementing,  or the  inability  of  Foamex  L.P.  to implement, selling price increases to offset raw material cost increases.                                          25   Year 2000 Compliance         Foamex L.P.'s program to address potential  disruptions to operations and relationships  with our  business  partners  related  to the Year 2000  software problem was successful  and there were no significant  disruptions to operations or administration.         The cost to prevent the Year 2000 problem was approximately $2.0 million. The majority of this total project cost was incurred  during 1998 and 1999.  The project cost primarily  represented the cost for various  consultants and system upgrades.  Project  cost  included  internal  cost  for  information  technology employees that worked directly on software programming modifications.  ITEM 7a.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK         Foamex L.P.'s debt securities with variable interest rates are subject to market risk for changes in interest  rates.  On December 31, 1999,  indebtedness with variable interest rates totaled $426.9 million.  On an annualized basis, if the interest rates on these debt  instruments  increased by 1%, interest expense would increase by approximately $4.3 million.  ITEM 8.
