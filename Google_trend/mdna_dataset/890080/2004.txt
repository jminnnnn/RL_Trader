EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Overview       We operate in the flexible  polyurethane and advanced polymer foam products industry.  Our  operations are conducted  directly and through our  wholly-owned subsidiaries,  Foamex Canada,  Foamex Mexico and Foamex Asia.  Business segments are listed below and business segment financial  information is included in Note 11 to  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Please  see  Part  I,  Item  1 "Business"  for a more complete  description  of the  activities of our business segments.       An executive vice president heads each of our principal operating segments. Each executive vice president is responsible for developing budgets and plans as well as  directing  the  operations  of the  segment.  The  performance  of each operating  segment is  measured  based upon income  from  operations,  excluding restructuring,  impairment and other charges and corporate  overhead.  We do not allocate  restructuring,  impairment  and other  charges to  operating  segments because many of our facilities produce products for multiple segments.       Foam  Products -  manufactures  and markets  cushioning  foams for bedding,      furniture,  packaging and health care applications, and foam-based consumer      products, such as mattress pads and children's furniture.       Carpet Cushion Products - manufactures and distributes rebond,  prime, felt      and rubber carpet padding.                                          14        Automotive Products - distributes automotive foam products and laminates to      major Tier 1 suppliers and original equipment manufacturers, or "OEMs".       Technical  Products  -  manufactures  and  markets  reticulated  and  other      specialty foams used for  reservoiring,  filtration,  gasketing and sealing      applications.       Other - primarily  consists of certain  manufacturing  operations in Mexico      City,  corporate  expenses not allocated to the other business segments and      restructuring, impairment and other charges (credits).       Our sales are  primarily to markets in the United  States.  These sales are impacted by economic conditions in several sectors of the United States economy, including consumer spending,  sales of new and existing homes, the overall level of  passenger  car and light truck  production  and  seasonality.  We  typically experience  two  seasonally  slow periods during each year, in early July and in late December, due to scheduled plant shutdowns and holidays.       A small  number of major  customers  produce a  significant  portion of our sales.  In 2003,  our largest  customer  provided 16.3% of our net sales and our five largest customers  provided 34.7% of our net sales. Two of the five largest customers  are  customers  of the  Automotive  Products  segment  and  three are customers of the Foam Products segment.       The  following   discussion   should  be  read  in  conjunction   with  the consolidated  financial  statements  and related  notes  included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.       Operations       The  following  table  includes  key elements of our  financial  statements expressed as a percentage of net sales for the years 1999 through  2003,  except for net cash provided by (used for) operating  activities  which is expressed in millions of dollars.                                          2003           2002            2001           2000             1999                                     --------       --------        --------       --------         --------            Net Sales                            100.0%         100.0%          100.0%         100.0%           100.0%  Cost of Goods Sold                    89.0%          89.2%           85.8%          86.3%            86.1%  Gross Profit Margin                   11.0%          10.8%           14.2%          13.7%            13.9%  Selling, General and    Administrative Expenses             6.2%           7.1%            6.3%           5.4%             5.8%  Operating Income Margin                4.9%           3.4%            5.0%           7.7%             7.3%  Interest and Debt    Issuance Expense                    6.8%           5.2%            5.0%           6.0%             5.6%  Net Cash Provided by (Used    For) Operating Activities          $18.1         $(49.6)         $108.7          $52.9            $68.6        As demonstrated by the table above,  our results in the last two years have significantly  deteriorated  when  compared to the prior three years.  Our gross profit margin has been reduced by approximately  three  percentage  points while selling  general and  administrative  expenses and  interest  and debt  issuance expense have both increased as a percentage of net sales, as well as in absolute dollar terms. Net sales dollars have been relatively flat over the 5 year period with 2003 representing an increase of less than one percent compared to 1999.       Our management is focusing on restoring  former levels of  profitability by concentrating on the following key areas:                                          15         o    Managing raw material costs.       o    Maintaining  selling  price  increases  to  customers  to recover  raw           material and manufacturing cost increases.       o    Controlling   and   reducing   labor  and   overhead   costs  both  in           manufacturing and administration.       o    Developing  new and more  consumer-focused  products  and entering new           markets with increased profit potential.       Our  major  chemical  suppliers  increased  the  cost of our raw  materials several  times in late 2002.  Prices  stabilized  during 2003 but  average  unit prices  for 2003 were  higher  than for 2002.  There  can be no  assurance  that chemical  prices will not  increase  in 2004.  We manage raw  material  costs by seeking  alternative  sources of supply,  locking in prices  when  possible  and negotiating discounts and rebates for volume purchases.       We have been only partially successful in raising selling prices to recover raw material and other cost increases. Selling price increases, reduced cost and increased mix of higher profit products are the major factors in restoring gross profit margin  percentage to the 14% level experienced in 1999-2001 from the 11% level of 2002 and 2003.       We are  focused on reducing  both  manufacturing  costs and  administrative expenses.  We  believe  that  our  manufacturing   operations  are  now  of  the appropriate  scale and  location to meet demand for our  products as a result of closing several facilities in 2002 and 2003. We believe that manufacturing costs can be further  reduced  by  emphasizing  efficiency  and  better  supply  chain management.  Our focus areas for further  reductions in administrative  expenses are employee related costs and professional service fees. Effective February 10, 2004, the Chairman of Foamex International resigned by mutual agreement with the Foamex International Board of Directors. As a result of this resignation, we may close our New York office,  which was primarily  used by the former  Chairman of Foamex International.       In late  2003,  we began to market  an all foam  mattress  product  that is vacuum packed in a box and designed to be carried home and self-installed by the consumer.  We believe this product  provides the consumer with  convenience  and price  advantages  when compared to  traditional  bedding  products.  We plan to develop  and  market  additional  consumer  products  and enter  other  consumer markets.  We  believe  that we can  achieve  higher  net sales and gross  profit through this  approach.  We will also  continue our  development  efforts in our other product offerings, especially our Technical Products.       If we can  restore  our gross  profit  margin to 14% or more and reduce and control  administrative costs, we may be able to restore operating income to the level  experienced  in 1999 and 2000 and cash flow from  operations to the level experienced in 1999,  2000 and 2001. At those levels we should be able to reduce borrowings  and also  cash  interest  expense.  Our  next  large  required  debt repayment is $51.6 million  principal of our 13 1/2% Senior  Subordinated  Notes due August 15, 2005.       Financing       On August 18,  2003,  Foamex  L.P.  entered  into a $240.0  Million  Senior Secured Credit Facility with a new group of lenders and a Secured Term Loan with another lender.  Proceeds borrowed under these new facilities were used to repay all  outstanding  balances under the Foamex L.P.  Amended  Credit  Facility (the "Amended  Credit  Facility")  which was  terminated  as of August 18,  2003.  In addition,  Foamex  Canada's  revolving  credit  facility  that  did not have any outstanding  borrowings and had availability of  approximately  $5.9 million was terminated as of August 18, 2003. The termination of the Amended Credit Facility resulted in a write off of debt issuance costs of $12.9 million.       The $240.0 Million Senior Secured Credit  Facility  consists of a revolving credit facility with a maximum availability of $190.0 million and a term loan of $50.0 million.  The revolving credit facility  includes a $50.0 million sublimit for  letters of credit and  availability  is limited  to  eligible  amounts,  as defined, of accounts receivable and                                          16     inventory.  At December  28,  2003,  Foamex L.P.  had  available  borrowings  of approximately  $46.8 million and letters of credit outstanding of $20.9 million. Borrowings under the term loan are limited to eligible amounts,  as defined,  of equipment and real estate.  Substantially  all the assets of Foamex L.P. and its domestic  subsidiaries  and Foamex  Canada are  pledged  as  collateral  for the related borrowings.  Borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan bear  interest  at floating  rates  based upon and  including a margin over either LIBOR or a Base Rate,  as defined.  At December  28,  2003,  the weighted average interest rates were 4.53% and 4.42% for the revolving loans and the term loan,  respectively.  The term loan requires quarterly  installment  payments of approximately  $1.8 million.  All  borrowings  under the $240.0  Million  Senior Secured Credit Facility will mature on April 30, 2007. The $240.0 Million Senior Secured Credit  Facility  includes both a subjective  acceleration  clause and a lockbox  arrangement  which  requires  all  lockbox  receipts  be used to  repay revolving credit borrowings.  Accordingly, borrowings under the revolving credit facility  are  classified  as current in the  accompanying  balance  sheet as of December  28, 2003 as required  by EITF No. 95-22.       The Secured Term Loan will mature on April 30, 2007.  Borrowings under this facility  will bear  interest  at a rate that is 9.25%  plus the  greater of the Reference Rate, as defined, or 4.25%. The minimum rate, which is in effect as of December 28,  2003,  is 13.50%.  In addition,  Foamex L.P. is subject to a 1.00% facility fee which is payable annually on the anniversary date. Borrowings under the Secured Term Loan are  collateralized  by the same  collateral as the $240.0 Million Senior Secured Credit Facility.  An intercreditor  agreement governs the distribution  of collateral  among the lenders under the $240.0  Million  Senior Secured Credit Facility and the Secured Term Loan.       Under the $240.0 Million  Senior  Secured  Credit  Facility and the Secured Term Loan,  Foamex L.P. is subject to a minimum fixed charge  coverage ratio, as defined,  of 1.00. For the two quarters  ended December 28, 2003,  Foamex L.P.'s fixed charge  coverage ratio was 1.09.  Foamex L.P. is also subject to a maximum annual  capital  expenditure  amount which was $17.7  million for the year ended December 28, 2003 and will be $36.0 million for the year ending January 2, 2005.       Our 13 1/2% Senior  Subordinated  Notes with a face value of $51.6  million are due on August 15, 2005. We must generate sufficient cash flow to repay these notes or we must obtain additional  financing.  We cannot determine at this time if we will be able to obtain  financing at a reasonable  cost, or at all. The 13 1/2% Senior  Subordinated  Notes will be required to be  classified as a current liability on our  consolidated  balance sheet  beginning in the third quarter of 2004.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES       We prepared  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States of America.  As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates, judgments  and  assumptions  affect  the  reported  amounts  of the  assets  and liabilities and revenues and expenses.  Our significant  accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The accounting policies  which we believe are the most  critical to aid in fully  understanding and evaluating our reported  financial  results and which require  management to exercise judgment include the following:       Revenue Recognition       We record  net sales  when  product  title  and the  risks and  rewards  of ownership passes to the customer,  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably  assured.  Products are shipped FOB shipping point. Net sales are reduced by allowances  for estimated  discounts,  returns and customer rebates  based on our  experience.  Balances  for  allowances  and  rebates  are reviewed at least quarterly and are adjusted if warranted.       Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts       We actively monitor  customer  payments in conjunction with customer credit evaluations.  Accordingly,  an estimate of uncollectible  accounts is maintained and  is  based  on  historical   collection  experience  and  specific                                          17    customer  collection issues. A significant change in the financial  condition of one or more of our larger  customers  could have a  material  adverse  impact on future financial results.       Long-Lived Assets       We have a significant  investment in long-lived assets consisting primarily of property,  plant and equipment.  Impairment losses are recognized when events indicate  that certain  long-lived  assets may be impaired  and a projection  of future  undiscounted  cash  flows  generated  from the  assets are less than the current  carrying value of the assets.  These cash flow projections are based on the  combination  of historical  results  adjusted for  estimated  future market conditions  and  operating  plans.  To the extent that these  estimates  change, impairment  losses  could have a  material  adverse  impact on future  financial results.       Goodwill       We evaluate the  recoverability  of goodwill on an annual basis as required by Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 142,  "Goodwill  and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"). We perform this annual evaluation as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter,  or more frequently if events or changes in  circumstances,  such as declining sales,  earnings or cash flows or material adverse  changes in the business  climate,  indicate that the carrying  value of goodwill  might be impaired.  Goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds it estimated fair value.  Fair values are primarily   established   using  a  discounted   cash  flow   methodology.   The determination  of discounted cash flows is based on businesses'  strategic plans and long range planning forecasts.       Self Insurance       We are partially  self-insured  for a number of risks up to certain  limits including  workers  compensation,  medical,  automobile  and general  liability. Commercial  insurance  policies  are  carried  for  amounts  in  excess  of  the self-insured  amounts.  Management exercises  significant judgment in estimating the ultimate  liability for claims.  The services of an outside actuary are used to  assist  management  in  their  evaluation  of  the  liability  for  workers' compensation and automobile claims.       Retiree Benefit Plans       We provide  defined benefit pension plans that cover most of our employees. Projected  benefit  obligations,  pension expense and amounts  included in other comprehensive income are impacted by a number of assumptions.  These assumptions include the discount  rate on projected  benefit  obligations,  and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.  The discount rate on projected benefit obligations enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the  measurement  date. We have little latitude in selecting this rate, as it is required to represent the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments. We  assumed  weighted  average  discount  rates of  7.25%,  7.00%  and  6.50% to calculate  pension  expense  for  2001,  2002 and  2003,  respectively.  A 0.50% reduction in this  assumption  would increase the interest  component of pension expense by approximately $0.6 million.  To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension  plan assets,  we consider  the current and expected  asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets. We assumed that long-term returns on our pension plans were 9.0% in 2003, 2002 and 2001. A 0.50% reduction in this assumption would increase pension expense  by  approximately  $0.4  million.  Amortization  of losses has been and continues to be a significant component of pension expense and this amortization is expected to increase by  approximately  $0.4 million in 2004. The losses have resulted from actual returns that were less than the expected return assumption, particularly  over the 2000-2002  period,  and funding levels that have not been sufficient to offset the growth in benefit obligations.  In 2003, actual returns were  significantly  higher than the expected  return  assumption  and we expect pension  expense to decrease by $1.4 million to $1.8  million in 2004  primarily because of the growth in plan assets. We anticipated funding of $11.8 million to retiree benefit plans in 2004.                                          18        Claims and Litigation       We receive claims for damages that are outside of our insurance  coverages. Management  evaluates these claims and records its estimate of liabilities  when such  liabilities are considered  probable and an amount or reasonable range can be estimated.       Environmental Remediation       We have a number of  manufacturing  facilities and certain idle  facilities that require remediation of soil and/or groundwater  contamination.  As required by applicable State and/or Federal compliance programs,  many of these sites are in the monitoring stage that requires periodic sampling of contamination  levels in conjunction with ongoing assessments of remediation actions. Accordingly, the recognition  of  environmental  liabilities  requires  estimates  concerning the duration of monitoring and  associated  costs,  often  projected to extend for a number  of  years.  To  the  extent  that  these  estimates  change,  additional environmental  costs could have a material  adverse  impact on future  financial results.  See the section below entitled  "Environmental  Health and Safety" for additional information.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Our operating cash requirements consist principally of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable requirements,  scheduled payments of interest and principal  on  outstanding  indebtedness,  capital  expenditures,  and  employee benefit plans. We believe that cash flow from our operating activities,  cash on hand and periodic  borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate to meet liquidity  requirements for the next 12 months.  Scheduled principal payments on our debt are not significant until the second half of 2005. The ability of us to make  distributions  to Foamex  International  is restricted by the terms of our financing agreements.       Cash and cash  equivalents  were $6.6 million at December 28, 2003 compared to $4.4 million at December 29, 2002.  Working  capital at December 28, 2003 was $18.7 million and the current ratio was 1.06 to 1 compared to working capital at December  29,  2002 of  $118.0  million  and a  current  ratio of 1.59 to 1. The decrease in working  capital is  primarily  due to the  requirement  to classify $96.1 million of borrowings  under the  revolving  credit  portion of its $240.0 Million Senior Secured  Credit  Facility as current in accordance  with EITF No. 95-22 (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).       Total  long-term debt and revolving  credit  borrowings at December 28 2003 was $745.6  million,  a $7.0 million  increase  from  December  29, 2002.  As of December 28 2003, there were revolving credit  borrowings of $96.1 million under the $240.0 Million Senior Secured Credit  Facility with $46.8 million  available for  borrowings  and $20.9 million of letters of credit  outstanding.  Revolving credit borrowings at December 28, 2003 reflect working capital requirements.       On  November  15,  2002,  Foamex  L.P.  and its bank  lenders  executed  an amendment to the Amended Credit Facility.  Under the amendment,  Foamex L.P. was subject to minimum net worth,  minimum EBDAIT,  as defined,  and maximum capital expenditure  covenants  through  periods  ended  December 28, 2003.  The minimum EBDAIT  covenant was tested  monthly,  on a  cumulative  basis,  beginning  with December  2002.  Foamex L.P.  was in  compliance  with the revised  covenants at December  29, 2002 and  throughout  2003 until the Amended  Credit  Facility was terminated on August 18, 2003.       On August 18,  2003,  Foamex  L.P.  entered  into a $240.0  Million  Senior Secured Credit Facility with a new group of lenders and a Secured Term Loan with another lender.  Proceeds borrowed under these new facilities were used to repay all  outstanding  balances under the Foamex L.P.  Amended  Credit  Facility (the "Amended  Credit  Facility").  In addition,  Foamex  Canada's  revolving  credit facility that did not have any  outstanding  borrowings and had  availability of approximately $5.9 million was terminated. The termination of the Amended Credit Facility  resulted  in a write off of debt  issuance  costs of $12.9  million in 2003.       The $240.0 Million Senior Secured Credit  Facility  consists of a revolving credit facility with a maximum availability of $190.0 million and a term loan of $50.0 million.  The revolving credit facility  includes a $50.0 million sublimit for  letters of credit and  availability  is limited  to  eligible  amounts,  as defined,  of accounts  receivable and                                          19    inventory.  Borrowings under the term loan are limited to eligible  amounts,  as defined,  of equipment and real estate.  Substantially  all the assets of Foamex L.P. and its domestic  subsidiaries  and Foamex Canada are pledged as collateral for the related  borrowings.  Borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan bear interest at floating  rates based upon and including a margin over either LIBOR or a Base Rate, as defined. At December 28, 2003, the weighted average interest rates were 4.53% and 4.42% for the revolving loans and the term loan,  respectively.  The term loan requires quarterly  installment  payments of approximately  $1.8 million.  All  borrowings  under the $240.0  Million  Senior Secured Credit Facility will mature on April 30, 2007.       The Secured Term Loan will mature on April 30, 2007.  Borrowings under this facility  bear  interest at a rate that is 9.25% plus the  greater of  Reference Rate, as defined,  or 4.25%. The minimum rate, which is in effect as of December 28, 2003, is 13.50%. In addition, Foamex L.P. is subject to a 1.00% facility fee which is payable annually on the anniversary date.  Borrowings under the Secured Term Loan are collateralized by the same collateral as the $240.0 Million Senior Secured Credit Facility. An intercreditor  agreement governs the distribution of collateral  among the lenders under the $240.0  Million  Senior  Secured  Credit Facility and the Secured Term Loan.       Under the $240.0 Million  Senior  Secured  Credit  Facility and the Secured Term Loan,  Foamex L.P. is subject to a minimum fixed charge  coverage ratio, as defined,  of 1.00. For the two quarters  ended December 28, 2003,  Foamex L.P.'s fixed charge  coverage ratio was 1.09.  Foamex L.P. is also subject to a maximum annual  capital  expenditure  amount which was $17.7  million for the year ended December 28, 2003 and will be $36.0 million for the year ending January 2, 2005.       Effective May 1, 2002, Foamex L.P. completed a series of interest rate swap transactions  with notional  amounts  aggregating  $300.0  million.  Foamex L.P. designated, documented and accounted for these interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of its 10 3/4%  Senior  Secured  Notes due April 1, 2009.  The risk being hedged in these  transactions was the change in fair value of the 10 3/4% Senior Secured Notes based on changes in the benchmark interest rate, LIBOR. The effect of these interest rate swap  transactions was to convert the fixed interest rate on the 10 3/4% Senior  Secured  Notes to floating  rates reset twice per year to correspond with the interest payment dates for the 10 3/4% Senior Secured Notes. On September 18, 2002,  Foamex L.P. unwound the interest rate swap  transactions in exchange for a net cash  proceeds of $18.4  million,  including  $3.6 million realized through lower effective interest rates while the swap transactions were in effect. The unwinding  resulted in a deferred credit of $14.8 million,  which is being amortized over the term of the 10 3/4% Senior Secured Notes,  using the effective interest rate method.       As discussed above, our 13 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes with a face value of $51.6 million are due on August 15, 2005. We must  generate  sufficient  cash flow to repay these notes or obtain additional financing.  We may not be able to obtain financing at a reasonable cost, or at all.       Cash Flow from Operating Activities       Cash provided by operating activities in 2003 was $18.1 million compared to cash used of $49.6 million in the 2002.  Cash  provided by operating  activities consisted  principally of  depreciation  and  amortization  of $26.0 million and amortization  and write off of $17.4  million  of costs  associated  with  debt, reduced  by our net loss of  $27.4  million.  We also  had  cash  costs of $11.3 million to pay restructuring liabilities.       Cash Flow from Investing Activities       Cash used in  investing  activities  totaled  $8.6  million for 2003.  Cash requirements  included  capital  expenditures  of $6.5  million and  capitalized software  development costs of $3.3 million.  Cash used for investing activities in 2002 included capital  expenditure of $15.6 million and capitalized  software development costs of $8.0 million.  Estimated capital  expenditures for 2004 are approximately $10.0 million. In addition,  we expect to spend approximately $4.2 million for  internally  developed  software in 2004,  a portion of which may be capitalized.       Cash Flow from Financing Activities       Cash used for  financing  activities  was $7.2 million in 2003  compared to cash  provided by of $60.0  million in 2002.  During  2003,  we utilized  $130.0 million of  proceeds  from new term loans and an increase  in  revolving  credit                                          20    borrowings  of $44.2  million to repay  $162.2  million of term loans  under our former Amended Credit Facility and to pay $11.9 million of debt issuance costs.       Contractual Obligations       Our  contractual  obligations  as of  December  28,  2003 are  shown in the following table:                                                                Payment due by Period                                         ------------------------------------------------------------------- Contractual Obligations                  Total       2004       2005-06          2007-08    2009 and beyond - -----------------------                 -------    --------    ---------      ------------  ---------------                                                               (millions of dollars) Long-Term Debt, including                 Capital Leases                       $732.2      $  8.9       $ 67.7         $349.6 (1)      $306.0 Interest (2)                            $297.5      $ 72.2       $135.8         $ 73.0          $ 16.5 Operating Leases                        $ 44.9      $ 14.1       $ 16.7         $  8.2          $  5.9 Purchase Obligations (3)                $592.5      $224.7       $125.9         $122.9          $119.0 Restructuring Liabilities               $  9.7      $  3.9       $  1.9         $  1.3          $  2.6 Employee Benefits and Other (4)   (1)  Includes  $96.1  million of  revolving  credit  borrowings  due in 2007 but      classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet to comply with EITF      95-22. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.  (2)  Includes interest applicable only to borrowings outstanding at December 28,      2003  computed  using  interest  rates in effect as of  December  28,  2003      through  the due  dates of the  borrowings  as  defined  by the  applicable      financing agreements.  (3)  Includes  outstanding  purchase  orders and other  commitments  to purchase      minimum quantities of materials or services.  (4)  We have obligations to provide employee benefits  including those under our      defined benefit and defined  contribution  retirement plans and our medical      benefit plan. In addition,  we are partially  self-insured  for a number of      risks including  workers'  compensation,  automobile and general liability.      Due to the many  variables  involved,  accurate  estimates  of these future      obligations  cannot  be  made.  In 2003,  payments  for  these  obligations      aggregated approximately $34.6 million.

Business  segment results include  revenues and costs that are specifically identifiable and costs shared by business  segments have been allocated based on utilization.  At the end of 2003,  we changed our  measure of segment  operating income to exclude an  allocation  of corporate  overhead,  as our  management no longer evaluates the performance of our segments using this  allocation.  Rather we now  attempt  to manage  and  control  these  costs  independent  of  segment performance.  Segment  results  for 2002 and 2001 have been  adjusted to reflect this change for comparative purposes.  2003 Compared to 2002       Net sales for 2003 decreased 2% to $1,304.6  million from $1,328.1  million in 2002.  An  increase  in Foam  Products  net sales  were  more than  offset by decreases in the other  segments.  Selling price  increases in all segments were more than  offset,  in the  aggregate,  by  reductions  in  volume.  The  volume reductions were primarily due to the requirement to increase  selling prices and plant closures as we shifted away from unprofitable business.       Gross  profit was $143.7  million,  or 11.0%,  in 2003  compared  to $143.7 million,  or 10.8%,  in 2002.  Gross profit margin has improved  throughout 2003 from the depressed levels experienced in the second half of 2002 as we have been successful at recovering some of the raw material cost increases  experienced in the second half of 2002 and we have realized manufacturing cost savings.       Income from  operations for 2003 was $64.4  million,  or 4.9% of net sales, which  represented a 45% increase from the $44.6 million,  or 3.4% of net sales, reported for 2002. Selling general and  administrative  expenses decreased $13.3 million, or 14%, due primarily to lower employee costs and professional fees. In 2002,  we incurred  $4.9  million of  organizational  and  transaction  costs in connection  with  a  proposed  public  offering  of  a  subsidiary,   which  was subsequently  terminated,  and a proposed  sale of the Carpet  Cushion  products segment.  Restructuring,  impairment and other credits discussed below were $1.8 million in 2003, while we recorded  restructuring,  impairment and other charges of $4.8 million in 2002.       Foam Products       Foam Products net sales for 2003 increased 8% to $507.6 million from $471.0 million in 2002  primarily  due to increases in selling  prices to customers and increased volumes of consumer products,  partially offset by decreases in volume in other markets.  Income from operations decreased 3%, to $44.0 million in 2003 from  $45.5  million  in 2002,  primarily  due to  increases  in the cost of raw materials. Income from operations was 8.7% of net sales in 2003, and 9.7% of net sales in 2002.       Carpet Cushion Products       Carpet Cushion  Products net sales for 2003 decreased 11% to $208.9 million from $234.0 million in 2002. Average selling prices increased but were more than offset by an  approximate  16% decline in volumes,  as we closed  several carpet cushion  facilities in 2002 and 2003 to focus this  business on more  profitable markets.  Income from operations  increased $4.2 million, or 335%, primarily due to cost  containment  from the  streamlining  of operations  and higher  selling prices. Income from operations represented 2.6% of net sales in 2003 and 0.5% of net sales in 2002.                                          22         Automotive Products       Automotive  Products net sales for 2003 decreased 4% to $447.1 million from $466.7 million in 2002.  Sales declined  throughout the second half of 2003 as a major  customer  decreased its  purchases  from us in an effort to diversify its supplier  base.  While  some of this  business  has been  recovered  from  other customers, automotive products net sales were just over $100 million per quarter in the second half of 2003,  which is an annual rate of more than $60.0  million less than the 2002 net sales. For the full year 2003, volumes were down about 1% and average  selling  prices were down about 3% due to lower fabric costs passed on to customers.  Income from operations  decreased $0.7 million,  or 2%, as the lower sales were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs, resulting from a plant  closure  in early 2003 and labor and  overhead  reductions.  Income  from operations represented 7.5% of net sales in 2003 and 7.3% of net sales in 2002.       Technical Products       Net sales for  Technical  Products in 2003  decreased 5% to $117.5  million from  $124.1  million  in 2002  primarily  due to a  decrease  in  volume  of 9% partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  average  selling  prices.  Income  from operations  decreased 9% to $32.1  million in 2003  compared to $35.2 million in 2002 due to higher raw  material  and  overhead  costs.  Income from  operations represented 27.3% of net sales in 2003 and 28.3% of net sales in 2002.       Other       Other  primarily  consists of certain  manufacturing  operations  in Mexico City,  corporate  expenses not allocated to business segments and restructuring, impairment and other charges.  The $8.6 million,  or 27%,  decrease in net sales associated with this segment  primarily  resulted from the Mexico City operation and was primarily due to a decline in the consumer products  business.  The loss from operations was $50.5 million in 2003 and included restructuring, impairment and other credits of $1.8 million,  discussed below. The loss from operations in 2002 was $71.5 million, including restructuring, impairment and other charges of $4.8 million,  discussed below.  Corporate  overhead expenses and employee costs decreased $7.8 million in 2003 compared to 2002.       Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges       In 2003, we recorded  restructuring credits of $1.8 million consisting of a $3.2 million reduction in the liability  primarily for severance and termination benefits no longer required as the actions  contemplated under the related plans have been substantially  completed,  and a charge of $1.1 million for additional lease  termination  costs for a closed  facility  as a result of changes in real estate market conditions. Additionally, we recorded a $0.3 million restructuring charge reported in the Other segment as a result of an employee termination plan for approximately 300 employees at our Mexico City operations. The actions under this plan were substantially completed in 2003.       In 2002,  we recorded net  restructuring,  impairment  and other charges of $4.8 million.  Fourth quarter  charges of $10.0 million  included  severance and other  termination  benefits for  approximately 200 employees and exit costs and remaining  lease  payments  related  to  the  reorganization  of  executive  and corporate management and the closure of six operations.  Approximately 60 of the planned  terminations  occurred during 2002 with the remainder occuring in 2003. The charges also  included  $2.5  million of asset  impairments,  primarily  for leasehold  improvements  and  machinery  and  equipment  in the  Carpet  Cushion Products  segment.  Earlier in 2002, we recorded  restructuring,  impairment and other credits of $5.2 million including a reversal of approximately $3.7 million from the reevaluation of the 2001 Operational Reorganization Plan.       Interest and Debt Issuance Expense       Interest  and debt  issuance  expense  was  $88.4  million  in 2003,  which represented a 27% increase from 2002 expense of $69.7 million. The 2003 and 2002 periods  include  charges  of  $12.9  million  and $4.9  million,  respectively, relating  to the  write  off  of  debt  issuance  costs  as a  result  of  early extinguishment  of debt. Higher average debt levels,  higher effective  interest rates and higher  amortization  of debt issuance  costs all  contributed  to the increase in 2003.                                          23        Income from Equity Interest in Joint Ventures       The income  from an equity  interest  in an Asian  joint  venture  was $1.2 million in 2003 and $1.6  million in 2002.  Income from an equity  interest in a joint  venture in Eastern  Europe was $0.3  million in 2003 and $0.1  million in 2002.       Other Income (Expenses), Net       Other  expense,  net was $3.4  million in 2003  compared to $2.0 million in 2002. We incurred  foreign currency  transaction  losses of $2.7 million in 2003 compared to foreign currency transaction losses of $2.3 million in 2002.       Provision for Income Taxes       Foamex L.P.,  as a limited  partnership,  is not subject to Federal  income taxes;  therefore no current or deferred  provision  has been  provided for such taxes. However, we have provided for the income taxes of certain states in which we are  subject  to taxes and for  certain  subsidiaries,  which are  subject to Federal  and  state  income  taxes  and  for  subsidiaries  located  in  foreign jurisdictions  that file  separate  tax returns.  The partners  will provide for their  respective  shares of income or loss in their Federal or applicable state income tax returns.  Foamex L.P. has a tax sharing  agreement  that provides for the payment of  distributions to our partners for amounts that would be required to be paid if we were a corporation filing separate tax returns.  Our ability to make such  distributions  is limited by the terms of our  credit  agreement  and indentures.       Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change       The  cumulative  effect of  accounting  change in 2002  includes a goodwill impairment charge of $72.0 million as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142.  2002 Compared to 2001       Net sales for 2002 increased 6.0% to $1,328.1 million from $1,252.9 million in 2001.  The  increase  was  primarily  attributable  to improved  sales in the Automotive  Products and  Technical  Products  segments,  partially  offset by a decrease  in the Foam  Products  segment.  The  improvement  in sales  partially reflected the impact of sales related to the acquisition  discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.       The gross profit margin was $143.7  million,  or 10.8%, in 2002 compared to $178.5 million, or 14.2%, in 2001 primarily as a result of increases in the cost of our major  chemical raw materials  during the second half of 2002.  The gross profit margin was further reduced by higher  manufacturing  costs principally in the Foam Products segment,  unfavorable yields,  higher  manufacturing  overhead expenses and unfavorable  production mix. We are seeking to improve gross profit margins  through  customer  selling price  increases,  selective  elimination of unprofitable  customer  accounts and products,  and reductions in  manufacturing overhead expenses.       Income from operations for 2002 was $44.6 million,  which represented a 29% decrease from the $63.2 million  reported for 2001.  Income from  operations was 3.4% of net sales in 2002 compared to 5.0% of net sales in 2001. The decrease is attributable  to the  reduced  gross  profit  margins  as  discussed  above.  In addition,  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  increased  by $15.0 million,  or 19%,  which  included  $3.6  million  of  organizational  costs  in connection  with  a  proposed   public  offering  of  a  subsidiary   which  was subsequently  terminated.  Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  also included $1.3 million of transaction  costs associated with the proposed sale of our Carpet  Cushion  Products  segment which was  subsequently  terminated.  The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher professional  service fees for  information   technology  and  accounting  services  and  employee  related expenses,  partially offset by reduced goodwill  amortization and lower bad debt expense.  Partially  offsetting  the  decrease  in gross  profit  and  increased selling,  general and administrative  expenses was a decline of $31.3 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges which is more fully discussed below.                                          24         Foam Products       Foam Products net sales for 2002 decreased 6% to $471.0 million from $499.7 million in 2001. The decrease primarily  reflected  reduction in business from a major  bedding  manufacturer  and the slow recovery of sales after an odor issue caused by defective  chemicals from a major supplier in late 2001. Foam Products gross  profit  margin was 12.3% in 2002,  down from 18.8% in 2001.  Income  from operations  decreased  44%, to $45.5 million in 2002 from $81.1 million in 2001, primarily  due to  increased  raw  material  costs,  lower net sales and  higher manufacturing  costs. Income from operations was 9.7% of net sales in 2002, down from 16.2% of net sales in 2001.       Carpet Cushion Products       Carpet  Cushion  Products net sales for 2002 increased 1% to $234.0 million from $231.0  million in 2001. We were able to increase our market share in spite of market  weakness and overcome the loss of sales to one large retail  customer that exited the carpet  business.  Income  from  operations,  which  principally reflected higher raw material and other operating costs during 2002 and included expenses  of $1.3  million  in 2002  associated  with the  proposed  sale of the business which was  subsequently  terminated,  represented  0.5% of net sales in 2002 and 3.2% of net sales in 2001.       Automotive Products       Automotive Products net sales for 2002 increased 24% to $466.7 million from $377.8 million in 2001.  The  improvement  primarily  reflected a continued high build rate for new cars and new  product  programs.  We were  informed  that our largest  customer intends to reduce its purchases of certain products from us in 2003 to diversify its supply base.  Automotive  Products gross profit margin was 8.4% in 2002 and 2001 and  reflects  the  impact of higher  raw  material  costs offsetting the  contribution  from increased net sales.  Income from  operations represented 7.3% of net sales in 2002 and 7.2% of net sales in 2001.       Technical Products       Net sales for Technical  Products in 2002  increased 12% to $124.1  million from $111.0 million in 2001.  Higher sales  partially  reflected  sales from the acquisition  of  General  Foam  Corporation  in  July  2001  (see  Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). Income from operations increased 8% to $35.2 million in 2002  compared to $32.7  million in 2001.  The decrease  reflects the contribution from higher net sales offset by higher material costs and the costs related to a proposed public offering of a subsidiary as described above. Income from  operations  represented  28.3% of net sales in 2002  compared  to 29.4% in 2001.       Other       Other  primarily  consists of certain  manufacturing  operations  in Mexico City,  corporate  expenses not allocated to business segments and restructuring, impairment and other charges.  The 4% decrease in net sales associated with this segment  primarily  resulted  from the  Mexico  City  operation.  The loss  from operations was $71.5 million in 2002 and included restructuring,  impairment and other  charges,  discussed  below.  The loss from  operations  in 2001 was $85.1 million, including restructuring, impairment and other charges of $36.1 million, discussed  below.  Corporate  overhead  expenses and employee costs increased by $16.1 million in 2002.       Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges       In 2002,  we recorded net  restructuring,  impairment  and other charges of $4.8 million.  Fourth quarter  charges of $10.0 million  included  severance and other  termination  benefits for  approximately 200 employees and exit costs and remaining  lease  payments  related  to  the  reorganization  of  executive  and corporate management and the closure of six operations.  Approximately 60 of the planned  terminations  occurred  during  2002.  The charges also  included  $2.5 million of asset impairments, primarily for leasehold improvements and machinery and  equipment  in the Carpet  Cushion  Products  segment.  Earlier in 2002,  we recorded restructuring, impairment and other credits of $5.2 million including a reversal  of  approximately  $3.7  million  from  the  reevaluation  of the 2001 Operational Reorganization Plan.                                          25         In 2001, we recorded  restructuring,  impairment and other charges of $36.1 million, primarily related to our 2001 Operational Reorganization Plan including plant facility  closures,  reductions in management and support  personnel,  and cost  reductions in purchasing and logistics.  The charge included an impairment charge of $13.8 million (net of anticipated  proceeds of $4.6 million) to reduce certain assets,  primarily leasehold improvement and equipment,  included within the Foam Products and Carpet Cushion  Products  segments to their estimated fair values.  Approximately  700 employee  terminations  including  plant  personnel, support staff and executives and management were originally  planned pursuant to the  2001  Operational  Reorganization  Plan.  The  subsequent  reevaluation  of facilities closures reduced the number of planned  terminations to approximately 500. Approximately 340 employees were terminated in 2002.       Interest and Debt Issuance Expense       Interest  and debt  issuance  expense  was  $69.7  million  in 2002,  which represented a 10% increase from 2001 expense of $63.2 million.  The increase was attributable  to higher  amortization  of debt  issuance  cost.  We  capitalized interest of $0.3 million in 2002 compared to $1.4 million in 2001.       Income from Equity Interest in Joint Ventures       The income  from an equity  interest  in an Asian  joint  venture  was $1.6 million in both 2002 and 2001.  We have a 70%  ownership  interest  in the joint venture since December 2001. Previously our ownership interest was 49%.       Provision for Income Taxes       Foamex L.P.,  as a limited  partnership,  is not subject to Federal  income taxes;  therefore no current or deferred  provision  has been  provided for such taxes. However, we have provided for the income taxes of certain states in which we are  subject  to taxes and for  certain  subsidiaries,  which are  subject to Federal  and  state  income  taxes  and  for  subsidiaries  located  in  foreign jurisdictions  that file  separate  tax returns.  The partners  will provide for their  respective  shares of income or loss in their Federal or applicable state income tax returns.  Foamex L.P. has a tax sharing  agreement  that provides for the payment of  distributions to our partners for amounts that would be required to be paid if we were a corporation filing separate tax returns.  Our ability to make such  distributions  is limited by the terms of our  credit  agreement  and indentures.       Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change       The  cumulative  effect of  accounting  change in 2002  includes a goodwill impairment charge of $72.0 million as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142.  OTHER  Environmental Health and Safety       We are subject to extensive and changing federal,  state, local and foreign environmental  laws  and  regulations,  including  those  relating  to the  use, handling, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances, the discharge or  emission  of  materials  into  the  environment,   and  the  remediation  of environmental contamination,  and as a result, are from time to time involved in administrative and judicial  proceedings and inquiries relating to environmental matters.  As of December 28, 2003, we had accruals of approximately $2.5 million for  environmental  matters  including  approximately  $2.3  million  related to remediating and monitoring soil and groundwater  contamination and approximately $0.2 million  relating to sites where we had been  designated  as a  Potentially Responsible  Party or "PRP" by the EPA or a state  authority and other  matters. Additional  losses,  if any, in excess of amounts currently  accrued,  cannot be reasonably  estimated at this time.  If there are  additional  matters or if any current estimates are incorrect, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.                                          26        On  August  31,  2002,   Environment  Canada,  the  Canadian  environmental regulatory  agency,  finalized a rule which would require flexible  polyurethane foam manufacturing operations to reduce methylene chloride (dichloromethane) air emissions.  The  rule  establishes  a  50.0%  reduction  in  methylene  chloride emissions  by December 1, 2004 and 100.0%  reductions  by January 1, 2007.  This standard  will not require us to make  material  expenditures  for our  Canadian plants.       We have reported to the appropriate  state  authorities  that we have found soil and/or  groundwater  contamination  in excess of state standards at certain locations.  Seven sites are  currently  in various  stages of  investigation  or remediation. Accordingly, the extent of contamination and the ultimate liability is not  known  with  certainty  for  all  sites.  During  2000,  we  reached  an indemnification  agreement  with the former owner of the  Morristown,  Tennessee facility.  The  agreement  allocates the incurred and future  remediation  costs between the former owner and us. The  estimated  allocation  of future costs for the  remediation  of this  facility is not  significant,  based on current known information.  The former owner was Recticel  Foam  Corporation,  a subsidiary of Recticel.       We have either  upgraded  or closed all  underground  storage  tanks at our facilities in accordance with applicable regulations.       The CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability without fault for the costs of  cleaning  up  contaminated  sites on certain  classes of persons  that contributed to the release of hazardous substances into the environment at those sites, for example, by generating wastes containing  hazardous  substances which were disposed at such sites. We are currently  designated as a PRP by the EPA or by state  environmental  agencies or other PRPs, pursuant to CERCLA or analogous state statutes,  with respect to 11 sites.  Estimates of total cleanup costs and fractional  allocations  of liability  are often  provided by the EPA, the state environmental  agency or the  committee  of PRPs with  respect to the  specified site.  Based  on  these  estimates  (to  the  extent  available)  and  on  known information,  in each case and in the  aggregate,  we do not  expect  additional costs,  if any, to be material to liquidity,  results of operations or financial position.       Although it is possible that new information or future  developments  could require  us  to  reassess  the  potential   exposure  relating  to  all  pending environmental  matters,  including those described  above,  management  believes that, based upon all currently  available  information,  the resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial  position,   capital   expenditures  or  competitive   position.   The possibility  exists,   however,   that  new  environmental   legislation  and/or environmental  regulations may be adopted,  or other  environmental  conditions, including the presence of previously unknown environmental contamination, may be found  to  exist  or  a  reassessment  of  the  potential  exposure  to  pending environmental  matters  may  be  necessary  due  to new  information  or  future developments,  that may require expenditures not currently  anticipated and that may be material.  Claims and Litigation       We and our  subsidiaries are party to various  lawsuits,  both as defendant and  plaintiff,  arising in the normal course of business.  It is the opinion of management that the  disposition of these lawsuits will not,  individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of  operations or cash flows.  If  management's  assessment  is incorrect,  such actions  could  have a material  adverse  effect on our  consolidated  financial position,  results of operations and cash flows. As of December 28, 2003, we had accrued  approximately  $1.1 million for  litigation  and other legal matters in addition to the environmental matters discussed above.  Inflation, Raw Material Costs and Other Matters       On  average,  inflation  rates  for the  domestic  economy  continue  to be relatively low. Although long-term  inflation rates are difficult to predict, we believe we have the flexibility in operations and capital  structure to maintain a competitive position.  The prices of the two principal chemicals used by us in manufacturing,  TDI and  polyol,  are  influenced  by demand  and  manufacturing capacity. In addition, the prices of TDI and polyol are significantly influenced by  crude  oil  production  and  prices  and  by  world  political  instability, particularly  in the  Middle  East.  Results  for 2003 and 2002 were  negatively impacted by higher  average costs for raw  materials.  In 2001, the beginning of the economic  slowdown resulted in excess  manufacturing  capacity for the major chemical                                          27    suppliers.  This, coupled with declining oil prices, resulted in lower costs for raw materials in 2001. We experienced significant increases in the prices of raw material  from major  chemical  manufacturers  during 2002. We sought to recover these cost increases  through  manufacturing  process  efficiencies  and selling price increases,  but were only partially able to do so during 2003 and 2002. We may not be successful in  implementing  further selling price increases to fully recover raw material cost increases and competitive pricing pressure may require us to adjust selling prices or lose volume.  Results of operations have been and could  be  adversely  affected  by  delays  in  implementing,  or  inability  to implement,  additional  selling  price  increases  to offset raw  material  cost increases.  Additionally,  we must reduce and control  our other  operating  and corporate  expenses including  selling,  general and administrative  expenses to offset raw material cost  increases.  A failure to recover cost increases  could result in debt covenant violations which may lead to lenders demanding immediate payment of our  outstanding  debt and impair our  ability to continue as a going concern.       The lease for one of our foam  pouring  facilities  expires in 2004.  It is conceivable  that this  lease may not be  extended  or  renewed.  Like any other lease, if we are unable to extend or renew this lease, the costs associated with a relocation  could have a material  adverse  effect on our business,  financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.  ITEM 7a.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Our debt securities with variable interest rates are subject to market risk for changes in interest rates. On December 28, 2003,  indebtedness with variable interest rates totaled $231.3 million.  On an annualized  basis, if the interest rates on these  debt  instruments  increased  by 1.0%,  interest  expense  would increase by approximately $2.3 million.  ITEM 8.
