ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS       The  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995  provides a "safe harbor"  for  forward-looking   statements  so  long  as  those  statements  are identified as  forward-looking  and are  accompanied  by  meaningful  cautionary statements  identifying  important  factors that could cause  actual  results to differ  materially from those projected in such  statements.  In connection with certain forward-looking  statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and  those  that may be made in the  future  by or on  behalf  of us  which  are identified as forward-looking, we note that there are various factors that could cause  actual  results  to differ  materially  from  those set forth in any such forward-looking  statements,  such as the ability to implement  customer selling price  increases in response to higher raw material  costs,  raw material  price increases, general economic conditions, the interest rate environment, the level of automotive production,  carpet production,  furniture and bedding production, and housing starts, the achievement of management's  business plans, our capital and debt  structure  (including  various  financial  covenants),  litigation and changes  in  environmental   legislation  and  environmental   conditions.   The forward-looking  statements  contained  in this Annual  Report on Form 10-K were prepared  by  management  and are  qualified  by, and  subject  to,  significant business,  economic,   competitive,   regulatory  and  other  uncertainties  and contingencies,  all of which are  difficult or impossible to predict and many of which are beyond our control.       Accordingly,  there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained  in this  Annual  Report on Form 10-K will be  realized or that actual results  will  not  be  significantly   higher  or  lower.  The  forward-looking statements  have not been audited by,  examined by,  compiled by or subjected to agreed-upon  procedures  by  independent  accountants,  and no third  party  has independently  verified  or  reviewed  such  statements.  Readers of this Annual Report on Form 10-K should  consider these facts in evaluating  the  information contained  herein.  In  addition,  our business  and  operations  are subject to substantial risks which increase the uncertainty inherent in the forward-looking statements  contained in this Annual  Report on Form 10-K.  The inclusion of the forward-looking  statements  contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as a  representation  by us or any other  person that any of the forward-looking  statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will be achieved. In light of the foregoing,  readers of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are  cautioned  not to place undue  reliance on the  forward-looking  statements contained herein.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Overview       We operate in the flexible  polyurethane and advanced polymer foam products industry.  Our  operations are conducted  directly and through our  wholly-owned subsidiaries,  Foamex Canada,  Foamex Mexico and Foamex Asia.  Business segments are listed below and business segment financial  information is included in Note 13 to  our  consolidated  financial  statements.  Please  see  Part  I,  Item  1 "Business"  for a more complete  description  of the  activities of our business segments.       An executive vice president heads each of our principal operating segments. Each executive vice president is responsible for developing budgets and plans as well as  directing  the  operations  of the  segment.  The  performance  of each operating  segment is  measured  based upon income  from  operations,  excluding impairment,  restructuring and other charges and corporate  overhead.  We do not allocate  impairment,  restructuring  and other  charges to  operating  segments because many of our facilities produce products for multiple segments.       Foam  Products -  manufactures  and markets  cushioning  foams for bedding,      furniture, recreational and consumer applications.       Carpet Cushion  Products - manufactures  and  distributes  prime and rebond      carpet padding.       Automotive Products - manufactures and distributes automotive foam products      and laminates to major Tier 1 suppliers and OEMs.                                          15        Technical  Products  -  manufactures  and  markets  reticulated  and  other      specialty foams used for  reservoiring,  filtration,  gasketing and sealing      applications.       Other  -  primarily  consists  of  certain  manufacturing  and  fabrication      operations  in Mexico City,  corporate  expenses not allocated to the other      business   segments  and  impairment,   restructuring   and  other  charges      (credits).       Our sales are  primarily to markets in the United  States.  These sales are impacted by economic conditions in several sectors of the United States economy, including consumer spending,  sales of new and existing homes, the overall level of passenger car and light truck production and seasonality.       A small number of major customers produce a significant  portion of our net sales. In 2005, our largest  customer  provided  approximately  10.7% of our net sales and our five largest  customers  provided  approximately  27.1% of our net sales.  Two of the  five  largest  customers  are  customers  of the  Automotive Products  segment and three are  customers  of the Foam  Products  segment.  The following  discussion  should  be  read in  conjunction  with  the  consolidated financial  statements  and related notes  included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.       Operations       The  following  table  includes  key elements of our  financial  statements expressed as a percentage of net sales for the years 1999 through  2005,  except for net cash provided by (used for) operating  activities  which is expressed in millions of dollars.                                          2005       2004       2003       2002         2001       2000        1999                                      ------     ------     ------     ------       ------     ------      ------                Net Sales                            100.0%     100.0%     100.0%     100.0%       100.0%     100.0%      100.0%  Cost of Goods Sold                    89.6%      88.8%      89.0%      89.2%        85.8%      86.3%       86.1%  Gross Profit Margin                   10.4%      11.2%      11.0%      10.8%        14.2%      13.7%       13.9%  Selling, General and    Administrative Expenses             6.2%       6.9%       6.2%       7.1%         6.3%       5.4%        5.8%  Operating Income Margin                0.2%       4.1%       4.9%       3.4%         5.0%       7.7%        7.3%  Interest and Debt    Issuance Expense                    6.1%       6.1%       6.8%       5.2%         5.0%       6.0%        5.6%  Net Cash Provided by (Used    for) Operating Activities        $(22.0)      $0.2      $18.1     $(49.6)      $108.7      $52.9       $68.6        As demonstrated by the table above, our results significantly  deteriorated in 2002 and improved only marginally in 2003 and 2004 before  declining again in 2005 as a whole.  Our gross  profit  margin has been  reduced by more than three percentage  points  compared to 2001 while selling,  general and  administrative expenses and interest and debt issuance  expense have both increased.  Net sales dollars  have  been  relatively  flat  over the  seven  year  period  with  2005 representing an increase of 1.3% compared to 1999.       During the first three  quarters of 2005 our gross profit margin  continued to erode  and was 6.3%  for the  third  quarter  and  7.1% for the  first  three quarters. In the third quarter of 2005, three suppliers of TDI closed production facilities  that had  accounted  for  approximately  10% of  global  supply.  In addition,  the evacuation of portions of the U. S. Gulf Coast states as a result of Hurricanes  Katrina and Rita caused  curtailment of TDI and polyol production at several  facilities in that area. The reduced  availability  of raw materials caused temporary shortages of foam production throughout the industry. Partially as a result of these  shortages,  we were able to  implement  significant  price increases on an immediate basis during the fourth quarter of 2005,  particularly in our Foam Products Operating segment. As a result, our gross profit margin was 19.8% in the  fourth  quarter,  a portion of which was  temporary  due to market conditions  and inventory  impacts on our cost of goods sold. We expect that our gross profit margin in                                          16    future periods will be more consistent  with historical  levels prior to 2005 as reflected   in  the  above  table,   depending  on  future   supply  and  demand considerations,  but there can be no  assurance  that our  expectations  will be realized.       Our management is focusing on restoring and  maintaining  profitability  by concentrating on the following key areas:       o    Maintaining  selling  price  increases  to recover  raw  material  and           manufacturing cost increases.       o    Managing raw material costs.       o    Developing  new  value-added  products  that  leverage  our  technical           capability and entering new markets with increased profit potential.       o    Closing or selling unprofitable or non-core plants and business.       o    Controlling  labor  and  overhead  costs  both  in  manufacturing  and           administration.       On September  19, 2005 (the  "Petition  Date"),  Foamex  International  and certain of its  domestic  subsidiaries,  including  Foamex  L.P.,  (collectively referred  to as the  "Debtors"),  filed  voluntary  petitions  for relief  under Chapter 11 of the  United  States  Bankruptcy  Code  ("Bankruptcy  Code") in the United States  Bankruptcy  Court for the District of Delaware  (the  "Bankruptcy Court").       We  continue  to  operate  our   business   and  manage  our   property  as debtors-in-possession pursuant to Sections 1107 and 1108 of the Bankruptcy Code. On September 29, 2005,  the United  States  Trustee for the District of Delaware appointed an official committee of unsecured creditors in these Chapter 11 cases (the "Creditors' Committee"). The Creditors' Committee is currently comprised of The Bank of New  York,  the  Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation,  Newcastle Partners,  LP,  Lyondell  Chemical  Corporation,  Shell  Chemicals  L.P.,  Steel Partners II, L.P. and Donovan Williams. At a hearing held on September 20, 2005, the Bankruptcy  Court granted  various first day motions for relief  designed to stabilize our operations and business  relationships  with  customers,  vendors, employees and others,  and entered  orders  granting  permission to, among other things,  pay  employee  salaries,  wages  and  benefits,  pay  amounts  owing in connection with workers' compensation and other insurance policies;  utilize our existing cash management  systems;  continue our customer programs;  pay vendors for certain  critical  goods and services  provided  prior to September 19, 2005 and,  access,  on an  interim  basis,  up to  $221  million  of a  $240  million debtor-in-possession  (DIP)  revolving  credit facility and $80 million of a DIP term  loan.  A portion of the  proceeds  of the  debtor-in-possession  revolving credit  facility and all of the proceeds of the DIP term loan facility were used to repay Foamex L.P.'s prepetition revolving credit and term loan facilities. On October 17,  2005,  the  Bankruptcy  Court  granted  final  approval of the $240 million DIP revolving credit facility and the $80 million DIP term loan.       On November 17, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court approved a motion  authorizing a key executive retention program (the "KERP").  The KERP pertains to 77 employees who may receive cash distributions  aggregating up to $3.2 million. In addition, certain  participants,  at the  discretion  of the  Board  of  Directors  of the reorganized  Foamex   International,   may  receive   additional   distributions aggregating  up to $1.1  million in cash or in common  stock of the  reorganized Foamex  International at a price per share that reflects the value of the equity on the effective  date of the plan of  reorganization.  Distributions  under the KERP are generally to be made on or around  certain  milestone  dates during the Chapter  11 cases and on and  subsequent  to the  effective  date of the plan of reorganization.  Cash  distributions  pursuant  to the  KERP,  aggregating  $0.4 million,  were paid in December 2005 and  additional  amounts  aggregating  $1.1 million  have  been  paid  in  February   and  March  2006.   The  common  stock distributions,  if any, will be made at the six month and one year anniversaries of the effective date of the plan of  reorganization.  The KERP also includes an additional $0.5 million  discretionary cash pool to address specific  employment matters and unanticipated needs that may arise during the Chapter 11 cases.       We have notified all known or potential creditors of the Chapter 11 filings for the purposes of identifying  and quantifying  all  prepetition  claims.  The Chapter  11  filings  triggered  defaults  on  substantially  all debt and lease obligations.  Subject to  certain  exceptions  under the  Bankruptcy  Code,  the Chapter 11 filings  automatically  stayed the  continuation  of any  judicial or administrative  proceedings  or  other  actions  against  the  Debtors  or their property to                                          17     recover on,  collect or secure a claim  arising  prior to September 19, 2005. On October 18, 2005, the  Bankruptcy  Court entered an order (the "Bar Date Order") requiring  any person or entity  holding or  asserting  a  prepetition  claim(s) against the Debtors to a file a written proof of claim with the Debtors'  claims processing  agent on or before  December  8, 2005 (the  "Bar  Date"),  and,  for Governmental  Units (as defined in the  Bankruptcy  Code)  holding a prepetition claim(s)  against  the  Debtors'  on or before  March  20,  2006.  With  certain enumerated  exceptions,  the Bar Date Order further  provides that any person or entity which fails to timely file a proof of claim will, among other things,  be forever barred, estopped and enjoined from asserting a prepetition claim against the Debtors.       The Debtors are currently  assessing all of the proofs of claim filed as of the Bar Date. As of March 20, 2006 1,173 proofs of claim are  outstanding in the Chapter 11 cases in the aggregate amount of approximately  $3,576.2 million. The Debtors  believe  that  this  amount  is  vastly  overstated  and  have  devoted substantial time and effort to the claims  reconciliation  process.  The Debtors have already  objected to and expect to object to a number of additional  claims throughout the Chapter 11 cases in an effort to reduce  substantially the number and amount of claims that will be allowed as part of the bankruptcy cases.       The  uncertainty  regarding  our future  prospects  may hinder our  ongoing business  activities  and our ability to operate,  fund and execute our business plan by impairing  relations with existing and potential  customers;  negatively impacting our ability to attract and retain key employees;  limiting our ability to obtain trade credit;  impairing present and future relationships with vendors and service  providers;  and  impairing  our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.       As  a  result  of  the  Chapter  11  filings,  realization  of  assets  and liquidation  of  liabilities  are  subject  to  significant  uncertainty.  While operating  as a  debtor-in-possession  under the  protection  of Chapter 11, and subject to Bankruptcy  Court  approval or otherwise as permitted in the ordinary course of business,  we may sell or otherwise dispose of assets and liquidate or settle  liabilities  for amounts  other than those  reflected  in our  financial statements.  Further,  a plan of  reorganization  could  materially  change  the amounts and  classifications  reported in our historical  financial  statements, which do not give effect to any  adjustment  to the carrying  value of assets or amounts of liabilities  that might be necessary as a consequence of confirmation of a plan of reorganization.       To exit Chapter 11, we must obtain  confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court of a Chapter 11 plan.  On December 23, 2005,  we filed a Disclosure  Statement  and Proposed Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan") with the Bankruptcy Court. The Plan is  designed  to  complete a  financial  restructuring  which  will  result in a reduction of approximately $500 million of total debt from prepetition  amounts. The Plan was supported by an ad hoc committee of our Senior Secured  Noteholders comprising more than 50% of the outstanding  principal  amount of Senior Secured Notes. The terms of the Plan include the following:       o    Holders of Allowed  Administrative  Claims,  Priority Tax Claims,  DIP           Financing Claims, Other Priority Claims, and Other Secured Claims will           receive full payment in cash;       o    Holders of Allowed  Senior Secured Note Claims will receive a pro rata           share  of  100%  of  new  common  stock  of  the  reorganized   Foamex           International,  subject to dilution,  provided  that the class of such           Claims votes to accept the Plan;       o    Holders of Allowed Senior  Subordinated Note Claims will receive a pro           rata share of warrants to purchase up to 5% of new common stock of the           reorganized Foamex International,  subject to dilution,  provided that           the class of such Claims votes to accept the Plan;       o    Holders of Allowed  General  Unsecured  Claims will receive a pro rata           share of $1.5 million,  provided that the distribution does not exceed           5% of the  allowed  amount of each such  claim and  provided  that the           class of such Claims votes to accept the Plan;       o    Holders of Foamex International's  existing Preferred Stock and Common           Stock  will not  receive  any  distribution  under  the Plan and their           shares will be cancelled on the effective date of the Plan.                                          18        Since we filed our Plan,  we and our advisors  have  continued to work with its  significant  creditor  constituencies  and  their  respective  advisors  to negotiate  a fully  consensual  plan of  reorganization.  We expect that we will continue to do so in the hope of agreeing with these  constituents  on the terms of a fully  consensual  plan. There can be no guarantee that we will file and/or confirm such a plan. However, even in the absence of a fully consensual plan, it is likely  that we will need to modify the plan that is  currently  on file with the Bankruptcy Court.       Financing       DIP Revolving Credit Facility       On September  22,  2005,  Foamex L.P.  entered into a  Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement (the "DIP Revolving  Credit  Facility") with a group of lenders to provide a revolving  credit  facility with a maximum  availability  of $240.0 million.  The initial borrowing under the DIP Revolving Credit Facility was used to repay  outstanding  obligations  under the prepetition  Senior Secured Credit Facility  and  interest due under the  prepetition  Secured  Term Loan.  The DIP Revolving  Credit  Facility  includes a $40.0  million  sublimit  for letters of credit and availability is limited to eligible amounts,  as defined, of accounts receivable,  inventory,  equipment,  and real estate. At January 1, 2006, Foamex L.P.  had total  available  borrowings  of $53.6  million  and letters of credit outstanding  of $18.2 million under the facility.  As of March 24, 2006,  Foamex L.P.'s total available borrowings had increased to $106.1 million. Substantially all of the  assets of  Foamex L. P. and its  domestic  subsidiaries  and  Foamex Canada are pledged as collateral for the related  borrowings.  Borrowings  under the DIP Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at floating rates based upon and including a margin over either LIBOR or a Base Rate,  as defined.  At January 1, 2006, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 7.42%. All borrowings under the DIP Revolving  Credit Facility will mature on the earlier of March 22, 2007 or the date that we emerge  from  Chapter  11.  The  lenders  under the DIP Revolving Credit Facility have agreed to provide emergence financing, subject to a number of conditions,  of up to $275.0 million upon our emergence from Chapter 11. Fees and expenses  that will be incurred to put the  emergence  financing in place are expected to be  approximately  $4.3 million.  The DIP Revolving Credit Facility  includes  both  a  subjective  acceleration  clause  and  a  lock  box arrangement  that  requires  all lock box  receipts  be used to repay  revolving credit  borrowings.  Borrowings  under the DIP  Revolving  Credit  Facility  are classified as current in the accompanying  consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2006.       DIP Term Loan       On September  22,  2005,  Foamex L.P.  entered into a  Debtor-in-Possession Credit  Agreement  (the "DIP Term  Loan")  with a group of lenders to provide an $80.0  million  term  loan.  Proceeds  from the DIP Term Loan were used to repay outstanding  principal under the prepetition Secured Term Loan. Borrowings under the DIP Term Loan bear  interest  at a rate  that is either  (i) 8.00%  plus the greater  of the Base  rate,  as  defined,  or 6.50% or (ii) at  10.00%  plus the greater of the LIBOR rate or 3.00%.  At January 1, 2006,  the  weighted  average interest rate was 14.29%.  Borrowings under the DIP Term Loan are collateralized by the same collateral as the DIP Revolving  Credit  Facility.  An intercreditor agreement governs the distribution of collateral among the lenders under the DIP Revolving  Credit  Facility and the DIP Term Loan. All borrowings  under the DIP Term  Loan  will  mature on the  earlier  of March 22,  2007 or the date that we emerge  from  Chapter  11. The  lenders  under the DIP Term Loan have  agreed to provide emergence financing, subject to a number of conditions, of $80.0 million upon  emergence  from  Chapter  11.  The DIP Term  Loan may be  repaid  prior to maturity  by  paying a  prepayment  premium  initially  set at 8% and  declining ratably over a 48-month  period.  The DIP Term Loan is  classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2006.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES       We prepared  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States of America.  As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates, judgments  and  assumptions  affect  the  reported  amounts  of the  assets  and liabilities and revenues and expenses.  Our significant  accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated  financial  statements beginning on page F-11. The  accounting  policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully  understanding  and  evaluating our reported  financial  results and which require management to exercise judgment include the following:                                          19         Bankruptcy and Basis of Presentation       As  a  result  of  the  Chapter  11  filings,  realization  of  assets  and liquidation  of  liabilities  are  subject  to  significant  uncertainty.  While operating  as a  debtor-in-possession  under the  protection  of Chapter 11, and subject to the  Bankruptcy  Court  approval or  otherwise  as  permitted  in the ordinary  course of  business,  we may sell or  otherwise  dispose of assets and liquidate or settle  liabilities  for amounts other than those  reflected in our financial statements.  Further, a plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications reported in our historical financial statements, which do not give effect to any  adjustment  to the carrying  value of assets or amounts of liabilities  that might be necessary as a consequence of confirmation of a plan of reorganization.       Subsequent  to the  bankruptcy  filing date,  Statement  of Position  90-7, "Financial  Reporting by Entities in  Reorganization  Under the Bankruptcy Code" ("SOP 90-7")  applies to the  Debtors'  financial  statements  while the Debtors operate  under  the  provision  of  Chapter  11.  SOP 90-7 does not  change  the application of generally  accepted  accounting  principles in the preparation of financial  statements.  However,  SOP  90-7  does  require  that  the  financial statements, for periods including and subsequent to the filing of the Chapter 11 petition,  distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. A confirmed plan of  reorganization  could result in material  changes in the amounts reported in our  consolidated  financial  statements,  which  do  not  give  effect  to  any adjustments  of the  carrying  value of  assets  and  liabilities  that  will be necessary as a consequence of reorganization under Chapter 11.       Revenue Recognition       Revenue from sales, net of discounts and estimated returns,  allowances and customer rebates,  is recognized when product title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer,  the sales price is fixed and  determinable  and collection is reasonably  assured.  Products are shipped FOB shipping point. Net sales are reduced by allowances  for estimated  discounts,  returns and customer rebates. Balances for allowances and rebates are reviewed at least quarterly and are adjusted if warranted.  Shipping and handling costs are included in costs of goods sold.       Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts       We actively monitor  customer  payments in conjunction with customer credit evaluations.  Accordingly,  a reserve for  estimated  uncollectible  accounts is maintained  and is  based  on  historical  collection  experience  and  specific customer  collection issues. A significant change in the financial  condition of one or more of our larger  customers  could have a  material  adverse  impact on future financial results.       Long-Lived Assets       Net property,  plant and  equipment  totaled  $113.2  million at January 1, 2006.  Property and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment  testing at the plant level, the lowest level for which there are  identifiable  cash flows. Impairment  testing  of the asset  group  occurs  whenever  events or changes in circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of the  assets  may not be recoverable.  We assess  recoverability  by comparing the carrying amount of the asset  group to the  estimated  undiscounted  future  cash flows  expected to be generated  by  the  assets.  If an  asset  group  is  considered  impaired,  the impairment  loss to be  recognized  would be measured as the amount by which the asset group's  carrying  amount  exceeds its fair value.  Estimated  future cash flows are based on  historical  results  adjusted for  estimated  future  market conditions  and  operating  plans.  To the extent that these  estimates  change, impairment  losses  could  result  which may have a material  adverse  impact on future financial results.       Goodwill       We evaluate the  recoverability  of goodwill on an annual basis as required by Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 142,  "Goodwill  and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"). We perform this annual evaluation as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter,  or more frequently if events or changes in  circumstances,  such as declining sales,  earnings or cash flows or material adverse  changes in the business  climate,  indicate that the carrying  value of goodwill  might be impaired.  Goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair values are primarily   established   using  a  discounted   cash  flow                                          20    methodology.  The determination of discounted cash flows is based on businesses' strategic plans and long range planning forecasts.       Self Insurance       We are partially  self-insured  up to certain  limits for a number of risks including  workers  compensation,  medical,  automobile  and general  liability. Commercial  insurance  policies  are  carried  for  amounts  in  excess  of  the self-insured  amounts.  Management exercises judgment in estimating the ultimate liability  for claims.  The  services  of an outside  actuary are used to assist management  in their  evaluation  of the  liability  for workers'  compensation, automobile and general liability claims.       Benefit Plans       We  maintain  defined  benefit  pension  plans  that cover most of our U.S. employees.  Projected benefit obligations,  pension expense and amounts included in other  comprehensive  income are  impacted  by a number of  assumptions.  Key assumptions  include the discount rates to determine benefit obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.  Discount rates are applied to future cash flows to measure  benefit  obligations on a present value basis.  We assumed weighted  average discount rates of 6.50%,  6.00% and 5.50% to calculate pension  expense in 2003,  2004 and 2005,  respectively.  Based on pension  plan obligations  at year-end  2005, a 0.50%  reduction  in the  discount  rate would increase  pension expense by approximately  $0.8 million.  Based on pension plan assets at  year-end  2005,  a 0.50%  reduction  in the  expected  rate of return assumption  would increase pension expense by  approximately  $0.5 million.  The under funded position of the pension plans was primarily the result of declining discount rates and accumulated  returns on pension assets below expected returns for the last several years  resulting in an accumulated net actuarial loss which must be amortized in future years.  The  amortization of net actuarial losses is estimated  to be  approximately  $3.1  million in 2006.  We  anticipate  funding approximately  $16.0  million to the  pension  plans in 2006 as compared to $7.3 million in 2005.       Claims and Litigation       We receive claims for damages that are not covered by insurance. Management evaluates  these  claims and  records  its  estimate  of  liabilities  when such liabilities  are  considered  probable and an amount or reasonable  range can be estimated.       Environmental Remediation       We have a number of  manufacturing  facilities and certain idle  facilities that require remediation of soil and/or groundwater  contamination.  As required by applicable State and/or Federal compliance programs,  many of these sites are in the monitoring stage that requires periodic sampling of contamination  levels in conjunction with ongoing assessments of remediation actions. Accordingly, the recognition  of  environmental  liabilities  requires  estimates  concerning the duration of monitoring and  associated  costs,  often  projected to extend for a number  of  years.  To  the  extent  that  these  estimates  change,  additional environmental  costs could have a material  adverse  impact on future  financial results.  See the  section  below  entitled  "Other -  Environmental  Health and Safety" for additional information.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Our liquidity  requirements  consist  principally  of accounts  receivable, inventory and accounts payable,  scheduled payments of interest and principal on outstanding  indebtedness,  capital  expenditures,  and employee  benefit plans. Historically, cash flow from our operating activities, cash on hand and periodic borrowings  under our credit  agreements  have been  adequate to meet  operating liquidity requirements.       Cash and cash  equivalents were $7.4 million at January 1, 2006 compared to $5.3  million  at  January  2,  2005.  Working  capital at January 1, 2006 was a negative  $18.3 million and the current ratio was 0.95 to 1 compared to negative working  capital at January 2, 2005 of $54.0 million and a current ratio of 0.85 to 1.                                          21         Total debt,  including $500.9 million subject to compromise,  and revolving credit  borrowings  at  January  1, 2006 was  $742.1  million,  an $8.4  million decrease  from  January 2, 2005.  The  January  2, 2005  carrying  value of debt included  $10.3 million of deferred  credits and debt premium.  As of January 1, 2006,  there were  revolving  credit  borrowings of $154.6 million under the DIP Revolving Credit Facility with $53.6 million  available for borrowings and $18.2 million of letters of credit outstanding. Revolving credit borrowings at January 1, 2006 reflect working capital  requirements.  While we believe that cash flows from our operating activities,  cash on hand and additional borrowings under the DIP Revolving  Credit Facility will provide an adequate level of liquidity until we emerge from the Chapter 11 process,  there is no assurance  that we will have enough cash to meet all ongoing obligations during the Chapter 11 process.       DIP Revolving Credit Facility       As stated previously, on September 22, 2005, Foamex L.P. entered into a DIP Revolving  Credit Facility with a group of lenders to provide a revolving credit facility with a maximum  availability of $240.0 million.  The initial  borrowing under  the  DIP  Revolving  Credit  Facility  was  used  to  repay   outstanding obligations  under the  prepetition  Senior Secured Credit Facility and interest due under the prepetition  Secured Term Loan. The DIP Revolving  Credit Facility includes a $40.0  million  sublimit  for letters of credit and  availability  is limited to eligible  amounts,  as defined,  of accounts  receivable,  inventory, equipment,  and real estate. At January 1, 2006, Foamex L.P. had total available borrowings of $53.6 million and letters of credit  outstanding  of $18.2 million under that facility.  As of March 24, 2006,  Foamex L.P.'s available  borrowings had increased to $106.1 million. Substantially all of the assets of Foamex L. P. and its domestic  subsidiaries  and Foamex Canada are pledged as collateral  for the related borrowings.  Borrowings under the DIP Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at floating  rates based upon and  including a margin over either LIBOR or a Base Rate, as defined.  At January 1, 2006, the weighted  average  interest rate on borrowings  was 7.42%.  All  borrowings  under the DIP Revolving  Credit Facility will mature on the earlier of March 22, 2007 or the date that we emerge from Chapter 11. The lenders under the DIP Revolving Credit Facility have agreed to provide  emergence  financing,  subject to a number of  conditions,  of up to $275.0  million upon our emergence  from Chapter 11. Fees and expenses that will be  incurred  to put  the  emergence  financing  in  place  are  expected  to be approximately  $4.3 million.  The DIP Revolving Credit Facility  includes both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement that requires all lock box  receipts  be  used  to  repay  revolving  credit  borrowings.  Accordingly, borrowings  under the DIP Revolving Credit Facility are classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2006.       DIP Term Loan       As stated previously, on September 22, 2005, Foamex L.P. entered into a DIP Term Loan  with a group of  lenders  to  provide  an $80.0  million  term  loan. Proceeds from the DIP Term Loan were used to repay  outstanding  principal under the  prepetition  Secured  Term  Loan.  Borrowings  under the DIP Term Loan bear interest  at a rate that is either (i) 8.00% plus the  greater of the Base rate, as  defined,  or 6.50% or (ii) at 10.00%  plus the  greater of the LIBOR rate or 3.00%.  At January 1, 2006,  the  weighted  average  interest  rate was  14.29%. Borrowings under the DIP Term Loan are  collateralized by the same collateral as the DIP  Revolving  Credit  Facility.  An  intercreditor  agreement  governs the distribution  of collateral  among the lenders  under the DIP  Revolving  Credit Facility  and the DIP Term  Loan.  All  borrowings  under the DIP Term Loan will mature on the earlier of March 22,  2007 or the date that  Foamex  L.P.  emerges from  Chapter  11. The  lenders  under the DIP Term Loan have  agreed to provide emergence  financing,  subject to a number of conditions,  of $80.0 million upon our emergence from Chapter 11. The DIP Term Loan may be repaid prior to maturity by paying a prepayment  premium initially set at 8% and declining ratably over a 48-month period.  The DIP Term Loan is classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2006.  Debt Covenants       The DIP Revolving Credit Facility and the DIP Term Loan (together, the "DIP Facilities")  contain  certain  covenants  that limit,  among other things,  our ability  (i) to pay  distributions  or  redeem  equity  interests,  (ii) to make certain  restrictive   payments  or  investments,   (iii)  to  incur  additional indebtedness or issue Preferred  Equity  Interests,  as defined,  (iv) to merge, consolidate  or sell all or  substantially  all  assets,  or (v) to  enter  into certain  transactions with affiliates or related persons.  In addition,  the DIP Facilities  contain provisions that, in the event of a defined change of control or the occurrence of an undefined  material adverse change in the ability of the obligor to perform its                                          22    obligations, the indebtedness must be repaid, in certain cases, at the option of the holders.  Under the most restrictive of the distribution  restrictions as of January 1, 2006,  we were able to  distribute  funds to our partners only to the extent to enable our partners to meet their tax payment liabilities,  subject to Bankruptcy Court approval if such payments constitute  prepetition  liabilities, and Foamex  International's  normal  operating  expenses  of up to $2.3  million during the term of the DIP Facilities, so long as no default or event of default has occurred.       Under the DIP Facilities, we are subject to covenants, including an EBITDA, as defined, covenant beginning with the one month period ended October 30, 2005, a cumulative  net cash flow, as defined,  covenant  beginning with the two month period ending  December 4, 2005, and a capital  expenditure  restriction  for 12 month rolling periods  beginning  October 3, 2005. The cumulative EBITDA and net cash flow covenants will include an increasing number of months until they reach 12 months  ending on  October  1, 2006 and then will be the  trailing  12 months thereafter  through  February  2007.  We  are in  compliance  with  the  EBITDA, cumulative  cash flow and capital  expenditure  covenants  for the three  months ended January 1, 2006. The DIP facilities  also limit  expenditures  for certain prepetition  and post petition  liabilities,  as defined,  subject to Bankruptcy Court approval.       Cash Flow from Operating Activities       Cash used for operating  activities  in 2005 was $22.0 million  compared to $0.2  million  provided  by  operating  activities  in 2004.  In 2005,  cash was primarily  used  to fund  increases  in  accounts  receivable  and  inventories, primarily as a result of increases in selling prices to customers and higher raw material  costs. In 2004,  cash used for operations  consisted of  approximately $5.6 million of cash  generated from results of operations  after  adjusting for non cash charges  included in net loss offset by  approximately  $5.4 million of cash requirements used to fund working capital needs.       Cash Flow from Investing Activities       Cash  provided  by  investing  activities  totaled  $32.0  million for 2005 compared to cash used by investing activities of $5.2 million for 2004. Proceeds from the sale of the  rubber  and  felt  businesses  were  $38.7  million.  Cash requirements  in  2005  included  capital   expenditures  of  $5.2  million  and capitalized software development costs of $2.6 million.  Cash used for investing activities in 2004 included capital expenditures of $5.5 million and capitalized software development costs of $2.4 million.  These uses were partially offset by proceeds from asset disposals of $2.7 million.  Estimated  capital  expenditures for 2006 are approximately $12 to $18 million.  In addition,  we expect to spend approximately $9 million in connection with replacing our primary  financial and operating  information and transaction  processing systems in 2006, a portion of which may be capitalized.       Cash Flow from Financing Activities       Cash used for  financing  activities  was $7.9 million in 2005  compared to cash  provided by  financing  activities  of $3.7 million in 2004.  In 2005,  we incurred $6.3 million of debt  issuance  costs.  During 2004, we utilized  $18.8 million of increased  revolving  credit  borrowings to reduce  long-term debt by $10.9 million and to satisfy working capital requirements.       Contractual Obligations       Our  contractual  obligations  as of  January  1,  2006  are  shown  in the following table:                                                           Payment due by Period                                       ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Contractual Obligations                 Total        2006        2007-08         2009-10    2011 and beyond - -----------------------               --------      ------       -------         -------    ---------------                                                               (dollars in millions) Long-Term Debt, including                   Capital Leases (2)                 $  241.2      $  0.2        $235.0 (1)     $    -           $ 6.0 Interest (2) (3)                      $   30.0      $ 23.4        $  5.6         $  0.4           $ 0.6 Operating Leases                      $   71.4      $ 15.4        $ 24.8         $ 16.5           $14.7 Purchase Commitments (4)              $  851.2      $268.3        $352.9         $230.0           $   - Employee Benefits and Other (5)                                       --------      ------        ------         ------           ----- Total Contractual Obligations (6)     $1,193.8      $307.3        $618.3         $246.9           $21.3                                       ========      ======        ======         ======           =====                                           23    (1)  Includes $154.6 million of revolving credit borrowings and an $80.0 million      term loan due in 2007 but classified as current in the consolidated balance      sheet. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.  (2)  Excludes  amounts  classified as subject to compromise in the  consolidated      balance sheet at January 1, 2006.  (3)  Includes interest  applicable to borrowings  outstanding at January 1, 2006      computed  using  interest rates in effect as of January 1, 2006 through the      due  dates  of  the  borrowings  as  defined  by the  applicable  financing      agreements and excludes interest on liabilities subject to compromise.  (4)  Includes  outstanding  take  or  pay  purchase  commitments  with  chemical      suppliers  and  others to  purchase  minimum  quantities  of  materials  or      services.  As previously  noted, we have the ability to reject  prepetition      executory  contracts  and  therefore  it  is  possible  that  the  purchase      commitments  reflected  may be  reduced  to the  extent  that  any of  such      prepetition executory contracts are rejected.  (5)  We also have obligations to provide employee benefits including those under      our  defined  benefit  and defined  contribution  retirement  plans and our      medical  benefit plan. In addition,  we are  partially  self-insured  for a      number of risks  including  workers'  compensation,  automobile and general      liability. Due to the many variables involved,  accurate estimates of these      future obligations cannot be made. In 2005,  payments for these obligations      aggregated approximately $35.5 million.

Higher selling prices in Foam Products were partially  offset by lower volume principally in the Carpet Cushion operating segment, primarily due to the sale of the rubber and felt carpet  cushion  businesses  on April 29, 2005.  Net sales from the rubber and felt  carpet  cushion  businesses  were $28.0  million greater in 2004 than in 2005.       Gross profit was $135.8 million, or 10.4% of net sales, in 2005 compared to $141.8  million,  or 11.2% of net sales,  in 2004.  We have been only  partially successful in the timely execution of customer selling price increases to offset chemical raw material cost increases  which averaged  approximately  32% in 2005 due to time lags and because of pricing pressure from  competitors  particularly in Foam Products.  Our gross profit margin was 7.1% for the first three quarters of 2005 but improved to 19.8% in the fourth quarter as a result of selling price increases to customers.  We expect the gross profit margin in future  periods to be more  consistent  with  historical  levels prior to 2005  depending on market conditions and other factors.  Gross profit in 2005 was also reduced by a charge of $5.8 million for obsolete consumer products inventory.       Income from  operations  for 2005 was $2.5  million,  or 0.2% of net sales, compared to income from  operations of $51.8 million,  or 4.1% of net sales,  in 2004.  The $6.0  million  decline in gross  profit was offset by lower  selling, general and  administrative  expenses  which  decreased by $5.6 million,  or 6%, principally due to lower  professional  fees. The 2005 period includes  goodwill and asset impairment charges of $50.7 million. Results include net restructuring charges of $1.5  million in 2005 and $3.3 million in 2004.  Restructuring  items are discussed under "Other" below.       Foam Products       Foam  Products  net sales for 2005  increased  11% to $613.5  million  from $551.4 million in 2004 primarily due to average  selling price  increases of 25% partially  offset by a 9% decrease in overall volume.  The largest selling price increases were implemented in the fourth quarter of 2005. Income from operations increased 10% to $57.5 million in 2005 from $52.4 million in 2004 principally as a result of the higher  selling prices  partially  offset by higher raw material costs and charges of $5.8 million for obsolete consumer  products  inventory and $3.0 million for a customer product quality claim. Income from operations in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $39.8 million, compared to $17.7 million in the first three quarters,  primarily due to selling price  increases to customers.  Income from  operations  was 9.4% of net sales in 2005,  down from 9.5% of net sales in 2004.       Carpet Cushion Products       Carpet Cushion  Products net sales for 2005 decreased 15% to $178.3 million from $209.2 million in 2004  principally  due to the sale of the rubber and felt businesses on April 29, 2005.  Net sales from the rubber and felt carpet cushion businesses  were  $28.0  million  greater  in 2004  than in  2005.  Income  from operations  was $1.8 million in 2005 compared to income from  operations of $8.5 million in 2004 due  primarily to higher raw material and  manufacturing  costs, lower volume and reduced  operating  income from the rubber and felt businesses. Income  from  operations  was 1.0% of net  sales in 2005,  down from 4.1% of net sales in 2004.       Automotive Products       Automotive  Products net sales for 2005 increased 4% to $366.3 million from $351.0  million in 2004  primarily as a result of selling  price  increases  and volume increases from new customers  offset by soft industry demand,  especially during the first half of 2005.  Income from  operations  of $22.5 million was up $3.2 million,  or 17%,  compared to 2004  primarily due to higher selling prices partially  offset by higher chemical  costs.  Income from operations was 6.1% of net sales in 2005, up from 5.5% of net sales in 2004.       Technical Products       Technical  Products net sales for 2005  increased 3% to $127.7 million from $124.1 million in 2004 as selling price increases were partially offset by lower volume. Income from operations decreased 1% to $32.7 million in 2005 compared to $32.9 million in 2004  primarily  due to lower volume of higher margin  products and higher raw                                          25    material costs,  partially offset by customer  selling price  increases.  Income from  operations was 25.6% of net sales in 2005, down from 26.5% of net sales in 2004.       Other       Other  primarily   consists  of  certain   manufacturing   and  fabrication operations in Mexico City, corporate expenses not allocated to business segments and  impairment  and  restructuring  charges.  The  decrease in net sales of 16% associated with this segment resulted from our Mexico City operations.  The loss from  operations  was  $112.1  million  in 2005 and $61.3  million  in 2004.  We recorded $50.7 million of goodwill and asset impairment charges in 2005.       During 2005, we recorded  restructuring  charges of $1.5 million  primarily related to the closing of three  facilities  that  produced  consumer  products, including the  elimination  of 132 positions,  and the  elimination of 14 sales, administrative  and operating  positions in the carpet cushion business.  During 2004, we recorded  restructuring charges of $3.2 million primarily consisting of a $1.7 million charge to lease costs and asset write offs in connection with the closing of our New York office, a $0.7 million charge related to the realignment of our  automotive  operations  and an impairment  charge of $0.6 million for an idle facility.       Gain on Sale of Businesses       On April 29, 2005,  we sold our rubber and felt carpet  cushion  businesses consisting  principally  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  located  at  Cape Girardeau,  MO and Newton,  NC,  inventories,  and related goodwill to Leggett & Platt,  Incorporated for net cash proceeds of $38.7 million. The property, plant and  equipment,  inventories  and related  goodwill had carrying  values of $3.2 million,  $2.8  million and $2.5  million,  respectively.  The net gain of $29.7 million, on which there is no tax impact, has been reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for 2005. The rubber and felt carpet cushion businesses provided  approximately  $41.3  million and $4.5  million of net sales and gross profit, respectively, in 2004.       Interest and Debt Issuance Expense       Interest  and debt  issuance  expense  was  $79.7  million  in 2005,  which represented a 4% increase from 2004 expense of $76.7 million,  reflecting a $4.8 million increase in amortization and write off of debt issuance costs as well as higher average revolver borrowing levels and interest rates, partially offset by lower interest  accruals on  subordinated  debt which has been  reclassified  to liabilities subject to compromise as a result of our bankruptcy filings.       Income from Equity Interest in Joint Ventures       The income  from an equity  interest  in an Asian  joint  venture  was $1.8 million in 2005 and $0.5 million in 2004,  when the joint  venture had increased costs related to the start-up of a manufacturing facility. Income from an equity interest in a joint venture in Eastern Europe,  which was sold in 2005, was $0.2 million in 2004.       Reorganization Items, Net       On  September  19,  2005,  we filed  voluntary  petitions  for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  During 2005, we adjusted the carrying values of certain prepetition debt,  including related debt issuance costs and deferred credits,  incurred  professional  fees associated with the bankruptcy cases, and recorded gains from the rejection of certain leases and other  contracts.  These reorganization items resulted in net expense of $6.8 million.       Other Income (Expense), Net       Other expense, net was $1.5 million for 2005 compared to other expense, net of $0.2  million for 2004.  The 2005  period  included  $1.7  million of fees in connection with amendments to our credit agreements.                                          26         Provision for Income Taxes       Foamex L.P.,  as a limited  partnership,  is not subject to Federal  income taxes;  therefore no current or deferred  provision  has been  provided for such taxes. However, we have provided for the income taxes of certain states in which we are  subject  to taxes and for  certain  subsidiaries,  which are  subject to Federal  and  state  income  taxes  and  for  subsidiaries  located  in  foreign jurisdictions  that file  separate  tax returns.  The partners  will provide for their  respective  shares of income or loss in their Federal or applicable state income tax  returns.  We have a tax  sharing  agreement  that  provides  for the payment of  distributions  to our partners for amounts that would be required to be paid if we were a  corporation  filing  separate tax returns.  Our ability to make such  distributions  is limited by the terms of our credit  agreements  and bankruptcy proceedings.  2004 Compared to 2003       Net sales for 2004 decreased 3% to $1,266.4  million from $1,304.6  million in 2003. The decrease was primarily  attributable  to a $96.1 million decline in net sales in the  Automotive  Products  segment due to lower  volume,  including sourcing actions by major customers, partially offset by higher net sales in the Foam Products and Technical Products segments.       Gross profit was $141.8 million, or 11.2% of net sales, in 2004 compared to $143.7 million, or 11.0% of net sales, in 2003. Gross profit margin has improved primarily due to profit  improvement  as a result of better  product mix in Foam Products and lower costs in Carpet Cushion  Products,  partially offset by lower volume in the Automotive Products segment. However, gross profit margin declined in the last six months of 2004 and in the fourth  quarter was 8.7%. We were only partially able to recover raw material cost increases during 2004.       Income from  operations for 2004 was $51.8  million,  or 4.1% of net sales, which  represented a 20% decrease from the $64.4 million,  or 4.9% of net sales, reported for 2003. A decline of $14.2 million in the Automotive Products segment more than offset increases in the other operating segments. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $5.8 million, or 7%, principally due to a $3.0 million  net  charge  to bad  debt  expense  following  a  customer  bankruptcy, litigation related costs and higher  professional fees primarily for information technology  and the cost of our efforts under Section 404 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act,  partially offset by lower corporate expense and employee costs as a result of the closing of our New York City office.  Results  include net  restructuring charges of $3.2 million in 2004 and net restructuring credits of $1.8 million in 2003. Restructuring items are discussed under "Other" below.       Foam Products       Foam Products net sales for 2004 increased 9% to $551.4 million from $507.6 million in 2003  primarily  due to higher  volumes of  value-added  products and higher selling prices.  Income from operation  increased 19% to $52.4 million in 2004 from $44.0 million in 2003  principally as a result of improved  volume mix and higher selling prices partially offset by higher raw material costs.  Income from operations was 9.5% of net sales in 2004 and 8.7% of net sales in 2003.       Carpet Cushion Products       Carpet  Cushion  Products  net  sales  for  2004  of  $209.2  million  were essentially  flat compared to 2003.  Income from  operations was $8.5 million in 2004  compared to $5.4 million in 2003 with the increase due  primarily to lower material and operating  costs.  Income from  operations was 4.1% of net sales in 2004 and 2.6% of net sales in 2003.       Automotive Products       Automotive Products net sales for 2004 decreased 21% to $351.0 million from $447.1  million in 2003  principally  as a result of lower volumes from sourcing actions by major customers including a decrease in sales of $54.4 million to our largest customer. Income from operations decreased 42% to $19.2 million compared to $33.4 million in 2003 primarily due to lower sales volume and higher per unit labor and overhead  costs.  Income from operations was 5.5% of net sales in 2004 and 7.5% of net sales in 2003.  We expect that sales will  increase  during 2005 but may be substantially less than in 2003.                                          27         Technical Products       Net sales for  Technical  Products in 2004  increased 6% to $124.1  million from $117.5  million in 2003 primarily due to higher unit volume and new product introductions.  Income from  operations  increased  2% to $32.9  million in 2004 compared to $32.1 million in 2003 primarily due to new product introductions and slightly higher overall pricing partially offset by higher selling,  general and administrative  expenses.  Income from operations was 26.5% of net sales in 2004 and 27.3% of net sales in 2003.       Other       Other  primarily   consists  of  certain   manufacturing   and  fabrication operations in Mexico City, corporate expenses not allocated to business segments and restructuring  charges (credits).  The increase in net sales associated with this segment resulted from our Mexico City operations.  The loss from operations was $61.3  million  in 2004 and $50.5  million  in 2003 and  reflects  generally higher corporate  expenses in 2004 and includes  impairment,  restructuring  and other  charges of $3.2  million,  discussed  below.  During  2003,  we  recorded restructuring credits of $1.8 million.       Impairment, Restructuring and Other Charges       In 2004, we recorded  impairment,  restructuring  and other charges of $3.2 million,  primarily  consisting of a $1.7 million  charge related to lease costs and asset write offs in  connection  with the closing of our New York office,  a $0.7 million charge related to the realignment of our automotive  operations and an impairment charge of $0.6 million for an idle facility.       In 2003, we recorded  restructuring credits of $1.8 million consisting of a $3.2 million reduction in the liability  primarily for severance and termination benefits no longer required as the actions  contemplated under the related plans have been substantially  completed,  and a charge of $1.1 million for additional lease  termination  costs for a closed  facility  as a result of changes in real estate market conditions. Additionally, we recorded a $0.3 million restructuring charge reported in the Other segment as a result of an employee termination plan for approximately 300 employees at our Mexico City operations. The actions under this plan were substantially completed in 2003.       Interest and Debt Issuance Expense       Interest  and debt  issuance  expense  was  $76.7  million  in 2004,  which represented a 13% decrease from 2003 expense of $88.4  million.  The decrease is primarily due to lower  amortization  of debt issuance  costs,  which included a write off of $12.9 million in 2003 associated with the refinancing of our credit facilities       Income from Equity Interest in Joint Ventures       The income  from an equity  interest  in an Asian  joint  venture  was $0.5 million in 2004 and $1.2  million in 2003.  Income from an equity  interest in a joint  venture in Eastern  Europe was $0.2  million in 2004 and $0.3  million in 2003.       Other Income (Expenses), Net       Other  expense,  net was $0.2  million in 2004  compared to $3.4 million in 2003. The 2004 period includes  foreign currency  transaction  losses related to operations  in Mexico and Canada of $0.6  million  compared  to $2.7  million in 2003. Also included in 2004 were gains of $1.0 million on asset disposals.       Provision for Income Taxes       Foamex L.P.,  as a limited  partnership,  is not subject to Federal  income taxes;  therefore no current or deferred  provision  has been  provided for such taxes. However, we have provided for the income taxes of certain states in which we are  subject  to taxes and for  certain  subsidiaries,  which are  subject to Federal  and  state  income  taxes  and  for  subsidiaries  located  in  foreign jurisdictions  that file  separate  tax returns.  The partners  will provide for their  respective  shares of income or loss in their Federal or applicable state income tax  returns.  We have a tax  sharing                                          28    agreement  that  provides for the payment of  distributions  to our partners for amounts  that  would  be  required  to be paid if we were a  corporation  filing separate tax returns.  Our ability to make such distributions was limited by the terms of our credit agreements and indentures.  OTHER  Environmental Health and Safety       We are subject to extensive and changing federal,  state, local and foreign environmental  laws  and  regulations,  including  those  relating  to the  use, handling, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances, the discharge or  emission  of  materials  into  the  environment,   and  the  remediation  of environmental contamination,  and as a result, are from time to time involved in administrative and judicial  proceedings and inquiries relating to environmental matters.  As of January 1, 2006, we had accruals of  approximately  $2.1 million for  environmental  matters  including  approximately  $1.9  million  related to remediating and monitoring soil and groundwater  contamination and approximately $0.2 million relating to PRP Site Matters and other matters. The claims relating to PRP Site Matters are  liabilities  subject to compromise  and will be treated under the Plan as general unsecured claims. Additional losses, if any, in excess of amounts currently  accrued,  cannot be reasonably  estimated at this time. If there are additional  matters or if any current  estimates are incorrect,  there could be a  material  adverse  effect  on our  financial  position,  results  of operations and cash flows.       On  August  31,  2002,   Environment  Canada,  the  Canadian  environmental regulatory  agency,  finalized a rule which requires flexible  polyurethane foam manufacturing  operations to reduce  methylene  chloride  (dichloromethane)  air emissions.  The  rule  establishes  a  50.0%  reduction  in  methylene  chloride emissions by December 1, 2004 and 100.0%  reductions  by January 1, 2007.  We do not believe this standing will require us to make material  expenditures for our Canadian plants.       We have  reported  to state  authorities  that we have  found  soil  and/or groundwater  contamination  in excess  of state  standards.  Seven  sites are in various stages of investigation  or remediation.  To the extent of contamination and the ultimate liability is not known with certainty for all sites.       We have either  upgraded  or closed all  underground  storage  tanks at our facilities in accordance with applicable regulations.       The CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability without fault for the costs of  cleaning  up  contaminated  sites on certain  classes of persons  that contributed to the release of hazardous substances into the environment at those sites, for example, by generating wastes containing  hazardous  substances which were disposed at such sites. We are currently  designated as a PRP by the EPA or by state  environmental  agencies or other PRPs, pursuant to CERCLA or analogous state statutes,  with respect to 11 sites.  Estimates of total cleanup costs and fractional  allocations  of liability  are often  provided by the EPA, the state environmental  agency or the  committee  of PRPs with  respect to the  specified site.  Based  on  these  estimates  (to  the  extent  available)  and  on  known information,  in each case and in the  aggregate,  we do not  expect  additional costs,  if any,  to be  material  to our  results of  operations,  cash flows or financial position.       Although it is possible that new information or future  developments  could require  us  to  reassess  the  potential   exposure  relating  to  all  pending environmental  matters,  including those described  above,  management  believes that, based upon all currently  available  information,  the resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial  position,   capital   expenditures  or  competitive   position.   The possibility  exists,   however,   that  new  environmental   legislation  and/or environmental  regulations may be adopted,  or other  environmental  conditions, including the presence of previously unknown environmental contamination, may be found  to  exist  or  a  reassessment  of  the  potential  exposure  to  pending environmental  matters  may  be  necessary  due  to new  information  or  future developments,  that may require expenditures not currently  anticipated and that may be material.                                          29   Claims and Litigation       We and our  subsidiaries are party to various  lawsuits,  both as defendant and  plaintiff,  arising in the normal course of business.  It is the opinion of management that the  disposition of these lawsuits will not,  individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of  operations or cash flows.  If  management's  assessment  is incorrect,  such actions  could  have a material  adverse  effect on our  consolidated  financial position,  results of operations  and cash flows.  As of January 1, 2006, we had accrued  approximately  $0.8  million  relating  to the  Litigation  Matters  in addition to the environmental matters discussed above. The litigation claims are subject  to  compromise  that are  capable  of being  treated  under the Plan as general unsecured claims.       As a consequence  of our  Bankruptcy,  all litigation  pending  against the Debtors on the  Petition  Date was stayed  automatically  by Section  362 of the Bankruptcy  Code and,  absent  further order of the  Bankruptcy  Court  granting relief from the automatic  stay, no party may take any action in respect of such litigation  or to  recover  on  pre-petition  claims  against  the  Debtors.  In addition,  pursuant  to Section 365 of the  Bankruptcy  Code,  the Debtors  have rejected and may reject  pre-petition  executory contracts and unexpired leases, and the  non-debtor  parties to  contracts  or leases  that have been or will be rejected have  asserted or may in the future  assert  damages for breach of such contracts and leases as permitted by the Bankruptcy Code.  Inflation, Raw Material Costs and Other Matters       The prices of the  principal  chemicals  we use in  manufacturing,  TDI and polyol, are influenced by demand and manufacturing  capacity.  In addition,  the prices of TDI and polyol are  significantly  influenced by crude oil  production and prices and by world political instability,  particularly in the Middle East. Results for 2005, 2004 and 2003 were negatively impacted by higher average costs for raw  materials.  We experienced  significant  increases in the prices of raw material from major chemical manufacturers during this period. We have sought to recover these cost increases  through selling price increases,  but historically we have only been partially successful. We may not be successful in implementing further selling price increases to fully recover raw material cost increases and competitive  pricing  pressure may require us to adjust  selling  prices or lose volume.  Results of  operations  have been and could be  adversely  affected  by delays in  implementing,  or inability to  implement,  additional  selling price increases to offset raw material cost increases.  Additionally, we must continue to reduce  and  control  further  our other  operating  and  corporate  expenses including selling,  general and  administrative  expenses to offset raw material cost increases.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Our debt securities with variable interest rates are subject to market risk for changes in interest  rates. On January 1, 2006,  indebtedness  with variable interest rates totaled $240.6 million.  On an annualized  basis, if the interest rates on these  debt  instruments  increased  by 1.0%,  interest  expense  would increase by approximately $2.4 million.       The principal chemicals used in the manufacturing of flexible  polyurethane foam are TDI and polyol.  The prices of TDI and polyol are influenced by demand, manufacturing capacity and oil and natural gas prices. Historically,  the prices of raw materials have been cyclical and volatile and our principal  suppliers of raw  materials  used in the  manufacturing  of flexible  polyurethane  foam have significantly  increased the price of raw materials  several times over the past several years. We attempt to offset raw material price increases through selling price  increases  and  manufacturing  process  efficiencies,  but have been only partially successful in doing so. We were able to substantially increase selling prices to customers in the fourth quarter of 2005.  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
