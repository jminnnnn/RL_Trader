ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The information included in the Annual Report under the section entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is incorporated herein by reference.    ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK         The Company limits its interest rate risks by investing certain of its excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less. The Company does not expect any material losses from its invested cash balances and the Company believes that its interest rate exposure is modest. As of February 1, 2003, the Companys cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $267,642,000.       Additionally, the Company may from time to time borrow money under its revolving credit facility at various interest-rate options based on the prime rate or the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) depending upon certain financial tests. Accordingly, the Company may be exposed to interest rate risk on money that it borrows under its credit facility. The amount outstanding under the facility has been classified as long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets of the Company included in the Annual Report under the section entitled Consolidated Balance Sheets, which is incorporated by reference herein. The Company did not have any amounts outstanding under the facility at February 1, 2003.       We do not have any foreign currency exposure as nearly all of the Companys business is transacted in United States currency.
