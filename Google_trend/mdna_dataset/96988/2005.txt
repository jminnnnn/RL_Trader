ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  INTRODUCTION  The Company's business is the custom design, production and sale of exhibits and environments for trade shows,  museums,  theme parks, themed interiors,  arenas, corporate  lobbies  and retail  stores  for  clients  in  industry,  government, entertainment and commercial establishments.  Challenges  of the  past  year  included  replacement  of the  Company's  credit facility  that would have  expired  on May 16,  2004 with a new credit  facility expiring  on  February  6,  2008 as  amended  and  replacement  of sales  from a significant  client  lost at the end of 2003 with new  clients  obtained  during 2004.  The trade show exhibit industry  continues to be very competitive and several of the Company's competitors have filed for bankruptcy.  In addition, the Company's customer  base of primarily  Fortune  1000  companies is expected to continue to closely  manage  their  trade show  budgets.  This  budget  management  will put pressure on sales and margins for trade show exhibits and related  services.  In 2004,  the Company  negotiated  better  pricing and terms with its suppliers and implemented  cost reduction  initiatives to mitigate the impact of this industry trend.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  On March 15, 2005,  Sparks  Exhibits &  Environments  Corp., a subsidiary of the Company,  acquired  substantially  all  of  the  assets  and  assumed  specified liabilities  of  Showtime  Enterprises,   Inc.  and  its  subsidiary,   Showtime Enterprises West, Inc. (collectively "Showtime").  Showtime designs, markets and produces trade show exhibits,  point of purchase  displays,  museums and premium incentive plans. Showtime had sales of approximately $21 million in 2004, and on January 12, 2005, had filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. The purchase price paid by the Sparks subsidiary pursuant to the Agreement and related transactions consisted of (i)  approximately  $2.1 million in cash,  (ii) the  assumption  of approximately  $580,000  of  indebtedness  payable  to the United  States  Small Business   Administration,   (iii)  the  assumption  of  specified   contractual obligations and (iv) additional  consideration associated with Showtime's senior subordinated  debentures  consisting of approximately $0.4 million in cash, $0.4 million in 6% notes due March 15,  2009,  warrants  to acquire an  aggregate  of 600,000 shares of Common Stock  exercisable  through 2012 at a weighted  average exercise  price of $1.06  and one  percent  of  annual  sales  originating  from Showtime  customers and account  executives from April 1, 2005 through March 31, 2009. The Company  financed this  acquisition by increasing its revolving credit facility borrowing capacity and obtaining a new term loan in March 2005.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  2004 AS COMPARED WITH 2003  NET SALES                                       (in thousands) Revenue Sources                      2004        2003 - ---------------                    -------      ------- Trade show exhibits                $44,763      $40,457 Permanent and scenic displays       27,180       25,130                                    -------      ------- Total                              $71,943       65,587                                    =======      =======  Total net sales of $71.9 million for 2004 increased $6.4 million,  or 9.7%, from total net sales for 2003.  This  increase was  comprised of a $4.3  million,  or 10.6%,  increase in sales of trade show exhibits and related services and a $2.1 million,  or 8.2%,  increase in sales of permanent and scenic displays.  Selling prices  were  relatively  constant  in  2004  and  2003.  These  increases  were principally  attributable  to several new customers,  which more than offset the loss of a significant customer at the end of 2003.  GROSS PROFIT  Gross  profit,  as a  percentage  of net sales,  decreased to 21.4% in 2004 from 21.9% in 2003.  This  decrease was largely due to changes in customer  sales mix and lower margins on new exhibit  construction.  Management  continues to pursue cost reduction  initiatives,  including  operational  improvements  and supplier renegotiations.                                          7   SELLING EXPENSES  Selling  expenses  were $7.8  million in 2004 as compared  with $8.5  million in 2003. As a percentage of net sales,  these  expenses  decreased to 10.8% in 2004 from 13% in 2003.  The  decrease  was due,  in  large  part,  to cost  reduction initiatives  implemented near the end of 2003 that significantly reduced selling expenses in 2004.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND GENERAL EXPENSES  Administrative and general expenses of $6.5 million for 2004 decreased 5.3% from such expenses of $6.9 million for 2003. Costs of approximately $250,000 incurred in connection with a terminated  merger agreement were charged to administrative and  general  expenses  in 2003.  The  decrease  in general  and  administrative expenses in 2004 was  primarily due to these costs  incurred in connection  with this 2003 terminated merger transaction,  as well as cost reduction initiatives. During the fourth quarter of 2003, management implemented executive compensation reductions,  staff reductions and further cost cutting initiatives, the benefits of which were realized during 2004.  RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXPENSE  On August 1, 2003, a Company  subsidiary  acquired the assets of Exhibit Crafts, Inc.,  a Los  Angeles,  CA area  manufacturer  of trade show  exhibits and a 20% interest in International Exposition Services, Inc. (IES), a trade show shipping and installation  provider.  The initial purchase price was $694,000,  including the  assumption  of certain  liabilities  totaling  $310,000.  In addition,  the sellers  received 20% of the  subsidiary's  common  stock.  The  purchase  price approximated the fair value of the net assets acquired.  In addition,  the asset purchase agreement provided for contingent  aggregate payments of up to $750,000 based on operating performance in 2005, 2006 and 2007, including interest on the then remaining future potential contingent payments.  These contingent payments, if any, and interest on the remaining future potential  contingent payments will be  reflected  as an increase in  goodwill.  Interest  on the  remaining  future potential contingent payments increased goodwill by $37,000 in 2004.  The Company  relocated  its San Diego area  manufacturing  facility to the newly acquired Los Angeles,  CA area facility during the third quarter of 2003.  Costs recorded in 2003 in  connection  with this  relocation  and  consolidation  were approximately $1.1 million,  which included relocation and employee  termination expenses.  The  Company  also  recorded a charge for a portion of the  remaining lease obligation related to the vacated San Diego area facility.  OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)  The Company generated  operating income of $1.1 million in 2004 as compared with a $2.2 million  operating loss in 2003,  primarily due to higher sales and lower selling,  administrative  and  general  expenses  in  2004  and the  absence  of restructuring  costs for the relocation and  consolidation of the Company's West Coast operations recorded in 2003.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  Interest  expense  increased  to $510,000  in 2004 from  $236,000 in 2003 due to higher borrowings and to higher interest rates under the Company's new revolving credit facility.  BENEFIT FROM INCOME TAXES  The  Company is  currently  using  operating  loss carry  forwards to offset its taxable income. As a result,  the Company did not record an income tax provision for its 2004 pre-tax income.  In 2003, the Company  recognized the benefit of an income tax refund for $0.4 million related to a change in strategy whereby a net operating  loss was carried back to a prior year.  The Company  currently  has a full valuation allowance against its operating loss carry forwards.  BACKLOG  The  backlog  of orders at  December  31,  2004 and 2003 was  approximately  $23 million and $19  million,  respectively.  This  increase  was largely due to new customers.  Generally,  backlog of orders  are  recognized  as sales  during the subsequent six month period. The 2004 backlog relates primarily to expected 2005 sales. The Company maintains a client base from which new orders are continually generated,  including refurbishing of existing trade show exhibits stored in the Company's facilities.                                          8   2003 AS COMPARED WITH 2002  NET SALES                                        (In thousands) Revenue Sources                      2003        2002 - -----------------------------      -------      ------- Trade show exhibits                $40,457      $44,711 Permanent and scenic displays       25,130       26,471                                    -------      ------- Total                              $65,587      $71,182                                    =======      =======  Total net sales of $65.6  million for 2003  decreased  7.9% from total net sales for 2002.  Sales of trade show  exhibits  and related  services  decreased  9.5% primarily due to the loss of two trade show exhibit  clients and generally  weak economic  conditions.  Sales of permanent and scenic  displays  decreased  5.1%, which was the net  result of lower  store  fixtures  sales  partially  offset by higher permanent museum display sales.  GROSS PROFIT  Gross  profit,  as a  percentage  of net  sales,  increased  to 21.9% in 2003 as compared with 19.9% in 2002. This increase was largely due to profit improvement initiatives  implemented in the second half of 2002, which were realized for the full year in 2003.  SELLING EXPENSES  Selling  expenses  were $8.5 million in 2003 and 2002.  As a  percentage  of net sales,  these  expenses  increased  to 13% in  2003  from  11.9%  in  2002.  The percentage  increase  was due, in part,  to the impact of lower sales  volume as compared  with certain  fixed  selling  expenses such as sales office and salary expenses.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND GENERAL EXPENSES  Administrative and general expenses of $6.9 million for 2003 increased 1.6% from such expenses of $6.8 million for 2002. Costs of approximately $250,000 incurred in connection with a terminated  merger agreement were charged to administrative and general  expenses in the second and third  quarters of 2003. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to these costs incurred in connection  with  a  terminated   merger   transaction,   integration  costs  to consolidate  the  Company's  West  Coast  operations  and higher  insurance  and telecommunications   costs.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2003,  management implemented executive compensation reductions, staff reductions and further cost cutting initiatives in response to lower sales volume.  OPERATING LOSS  The Company  incurred an operating loss of $2.2 million in 2003 primarily due to lower  sales  volume  and  the  restructuring   costs  for  the  relocation  and consolidation of its West Coast operations  described above under the discussion of 2004 as compared with 2003.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  Interest expense decreased to $236,000 in 2003 from $382,000 in 2002 due in part to lower borrowings and to lower interest rates.  In the fourth  quarter of 2003,  the  Company  recorded  an  impairment  loss of $265,000  related to its  investment  in an  affiliate.  In the first quarter of 2002,  management  determined  that  the  Company's  investment  in  a  portable tradeshow  exhibit  manufacturer  was  not  recoverable,  which  resulted  in an impairment loss of $1.2 million from its investment in affiliates.                                          9   PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES  The Company  established  a valuation  allowance  of $5.4  million for  deferred income  tax  assets in the  fourth  quarter  of 2002,  principally  related to a deferred  income  tax  benefit  in  connection  with the write  off of  goodwill recorded in the first quarter of 2002.  The Company also  established  a valuation  allowance for the income tax benefit from the $1.2 million write down of  investments  in affiliates  recorded in the first  quarter of 2002 because this capital loss is not expected to be offset by capital gains within the required statutory period.  CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE  In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial  of  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS")  No. 142  "Goodwill  and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142), which supersedes APB No. 17 "Intangible  Assets". SFAS 142 requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings,  but instead be reviewed for impairment.  The Company  adopted SFAS 142 effective  January 1, 2002. This new accounting  standard requires a two-step test for operating units having unamortized  goodwill  balances.  The first step requires a comparison of the book value of the net assets to the fair value of the  respective  operating unit. If the fair value is  determined to be less than the book value,  a second step is  required  to  determine  the  impairment.  This  second  step  includes evaluation of other  intangible  assets,  and any shortfall of the adjusted book value below fair value  determines  the amount of the goodwill  impairment.  The adoption of SFAS 142 reduced  goodwill by $15.9  million and net income by $12.4 million (net of a $3.5 million income tax benefit) in the first quarter of 2002, identified  as a cumulative  effect of a change in  accounting  principle.  This impairment  charge related to goodwill  recorded in connection with the December 31, 1997  acquisition of DMS Store  Fixtures,  L.P. This charge differs from the previous accounting standard method, which was based on undiscounted cash flows, because the new method is based on fair value  measurement  estimates  as of the measurement date.  BACKLOG  The  backlog  of orders at  December  31,  2003 and 2002 was  approximately  $19 million.  Generally,  backlog  of orders  are  recognized  as sales  during  the subsequent six month period.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  On February 6, 2004,  the Company  replaced  its  revolving  credit and security agreement  with a new  credit  facility  provided  by a  commercial  asset-based lender.  The new credit  facility  originally  expired on  February  6, 2007 and provided  for  maximum  borrowing  capacity  of up to  $12  million  based  on a percentage of eligible accounts  receivable and inventories.  This facility bore interest  based  on the  30-day  dealer  placed  commercial  paper  rate  plus a formula-determined  spread  of  4.5% in 2004  (total  effective  rate of 7.0% at February 28,  2005),  restricts  the  Company's  ability to pay  dividends,  and includes  certain  financial  covenants (fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum capital  expenditure  amount).  Based on the Company's  performance in 2004, the formula-determined spread was reduced to 3.5% effective March 22, 2005 resulting in a total effective rate of 6% at such date. Proceeds from this credit facility are used primarily for working capital and other capital  expenditure  purposes. The Company expects its capital  expenditures to be  approximately $1 million in 2005.  As of March 21, 2005,  the Company  amended its credit  facility to increase the maximum borrowing capacity from $12 million to $15 million, to increase the caps on certain  inventories  and to extend the term by one year to February 6, 2008. The Company also obtained a one-year term loan for $1 million  bearing  interest at the  commercial  paper  rate plus 3.75% and  monthly  principal  payments  of $25,000 starting on April 1, 2005 with the remaining  balance of $700,000 due on March 21,  2006.  The Company had  borrowings  of  approximately  $9 million and borrowing  capacity of approximately  $12 million at March 21, 2005. This credit facility  amendment  and  term  loan  were  obtained  to  finance  the  Showtime acquisition discussed in "Recent Developments."  The  Company's  working  capital  increased to $4.5 million at December 31, 2004 from $3.0 million at December 31, 2003,  largely due to a $2.3 million  increase in  accounts  receivable.  Net  cash  of  $1.1  million  provided  by  operating activities  was  used  primarily  for  capital  expenditures  for  property  and equipment and rental assets. The increase in accounts receivable was principally attributable  to sales in the  fourth  quarter  to new  customers  and to slower payment  schedules  for  certain  of  the  Company's  significant  Fortune  1000 customers.                                          10   CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  The following  table  summarizes the Company's  contractual  obligations and the effect such  obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods.

The annual  lease commitment for this facility is $214,000  through  September 22, 2007,  which is not included with the above future operating lease commitments.  The Company leases a facility from a partnership  controlled by two shareholders of the Company.  This lease,  which expires on May 14, 2019,  contains an option for the  Company to  terminate  after May 14,  2009  subject  to the  landlord's ability to re-rent the premises. The minimum annual rent is $771,000 through May 14, 2009 and is reset thereafter (not included in the table above).  The Company is also responsible for taxes,  insurance and other operating  expenses for this facility.  OUTLOOK  The  Company  expects  sales of trade show  exhibits  and  related  services  to increase in 2005 due to the Showtime  acquisition and anticipates  that sales of store fixtures will be essentially unchanged in 2005 as compared with 2004.  Planned  profit  improvements  for the  Company's  base  businesses  in 2005 are expected  to be  offset  by  relocation  and  transition  costs  anticipated  to integrate  the  Showtime  business  with  the  Company's  existing   businesses. Subsequent  to this  relocation  and  transition,  the  Company  expects  profit improvements in 2006.  The Company wrote off accounts receivable and inventories in 2001 as a result of K-Mart,  a DMS Store  Fixtures  customer,  filing for  bankruptcy.  The  Company currently has an unrecorded  contingent  gain in connection  with the subsequent settlement  from its  bankruptcy  claim in the form of K-Mart common stock.  The Company  expects to receive the  majority of this common  stock  during 2005 and will  recognize any gain based on the market value at the time such common stock is received and  subsequently  sold.  Based on the current  market value of this common stock, the contingent gain is more than $600,000.  The Company acquired a past-due  accounts  receivable from mPhase  Technologies, Inc ("mPhase") in connection with the 2003  acquisition of Exhibit Crafts,  Inc. In  March  2005,   the  Company   settled  the  claim  with  this  customer  for approximately 213,000 shares of mPhase common stock. Based on the current market value of this common stock,  the Company has a contingent gain of  approximately $90,000. Any gain will be recognized when the stock is received and subsequently sold.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 146,  "Accounting  for Exit or Disposal  Activities" ("FASB Statement FAS 146"). FAS 146 addresses  significant issues regarding the recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities,  including restructuring  activities that are currently  accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the Emerging  Issues Task Force ("EITF") has set forth in EITF Issue No. 94-3, "Liability  Recognition for Certain  Employee  Termination  Benefits  and  Other  Costs to Exit an  Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a  Restructuring)."  Effective in the first quarter of 2003,  the  Company  adopted  the  provisions  of SFAS 146.  This new accounting  principle  had an  impact on the  timing  and  recognition  of costs associated  with the Company's  relocation and  consolidation  of its West Coast operations,  and is expected to have an impact on the timing and  recognition of costs associated with the Showtime acquisition and subsequent integration.                                          11   In December 2004, FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment  ("FAS123(R)"  or  the  "Statement").   FAS  123(R)  requires  that  the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in financial statements. That cost will be  measured  based on the fair  value of the  equity or  liability  instruments issued. FAS 123(R) covers a wide range of share-based compensation  arrangements including stock options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation  rights,  and  employee  share  purchase  plans.  FAS  123(R)  is a replacement   of  FASB   Statement   No.  123,   "Accounting   for   Stock-Based Compensation,"  and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and its related interpretive guidance.  The effect of the Statement  will be to require  entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock options based on the grant-date fair value of the award,  and to recognize the cost over the period the employee is required to provide  services for the award.  FAS 123(R) permits  entities to use any  option-pricing  model  that  meets  the  fair  value  objective  in the Statement.  The  Company  will be required  to apply FAS 123(R) as of the  beginning  of its first interim period that begins after June 15, 2005,  which will be its quarter ending September 30, 2005.  FAS 123(R) allows two methods for determining the effects of the transition: the modified prospective  transition method and the modified retrospective method of transition.  Under the modified  prospective  transition method, an entity would use the fair value based  accounting  method for all  employee  awards  granted, modified,  or  settled  after the  effective  date.  As of the  effective  date, compensation cost related to the non-vested  portion of awards outstanding as of that  date  would be based  on the  grant-date  fair  value of those  awards  as calculated  under the  original  provisions  of Statement  No. 123;  that is, an entity would not re-measure  the grant-date  fair value estimate of the unvested portion of awards granted prior to the effective  date of FAS 123(R).  An entity will have the further  option to either apply the Statement to only the quarters in the period of adoption and subsequent  periods, or apply the Statement to all quarters in the fiscal year of adoption. Under the modified retrospective method of transition, an entity would revise its previously issued financial statements to  recognize  employee   compensation  cost  for  prior  periods  presented  in accordance with the original provisions of Statement No. 123.  Although  it has not yet  completed  its study of the  transition  methods,  the Company believes it will elect the modified prospective transition method. Under this method,  the Company estimates that the adoption of FAS 123(R) will require the Company to record  approximately  $15,000 of stock  compensation  expense in 2005 related to employee  options  issued and  outstanding at December 31, 2004. Additional  stock options  granted in March 2005 in connection with the Showtime acquisition  are expected to have an impact of  approximately  $130,000 on stock compensation  expense in each year from 2005 through 2009. Any further impact of this Statement on the Company in fiscal 2005 and beyond will depend upon various factors including future compensation strategy. The pro forma compensation costs are  calculated  using the  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model and may not be indicative of amounts which should be expected in future years.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Financial statement preparation in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. One such estimate is possible losses in connection with financing  accounts  receivable.  Management  estimates these possible losses based on a review of the financial condition and payment history of specific  customers having  significant  accounts  receivable  balances,  and establishes a general  reserve for the remaining  accounts  receivable  based on historical bad debt experience.  Revenues on trade show exhibit sales,  themed  interiors,  custom store fixtures and point of purchase  displays  are  recognized  using the  completed  contract method.  The  Company's  contracts  are  typically  less  than  three  months in duration.  As a result,  the  Company's  revenue  recognition  would not  differ materially if another  method were used.  Progress  billings are generally  made throughout the  production  process.  Progress  billings which are unpaid at the balance sheet date are not  recognized  in the financial  statements as accounts receivable. Progress billings which have been collected on or before the balance sheet date are  classified  as  customer  deposits  and are  included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.                                          12   Measurement  of  goodwill  and  other  intangible   asset  impairment   involves assumptions  and estimates by management on a quarterly  basis.  The adoption of SFAS 142 requires  estimates of fair values for certain  operating units.  These estimates involve  discounted cash flow forecasts to determine the fair value of operating  units having  unamortized  goodwill  balances,  and also consider the Company's market capitalization.  The  evaluation  of  deferred  income  tax  assets  also  involves  management's estimates and judgment. Management considers several factors in this evaluation, including trailing three year financial performance history and future forecasts of operating income. A valuation  allowance is established based on management's estimates about the recoverability of deferred income tax assets.  Other significant accounting policies are also important to the understanding of the Company's  financial  statements.  These policies are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This report contains forward-looking  statements.  When used in this report, the words "intends,"  "believes,"  "plans,"  "expects,"  "anticipates,"  "probable," "could" and similar words are used to identify these forward looking statements. In  connection  with the "safe  harbor"  provisions  of the  Private  Securities Litigation  Reform Act of 1995, there are certain  important  factors that could cause the Company's  actual results to differ  materially from those included in such forward-looking statements. Some of the important factors which could cause actual results to differ  materially from those projected  include,  but are not limited  to: the  Company's  ability to  relocate  and  integrate  the  Showtime business  without  significant  loss of its  customer  base and  within the cost budget;  the Company's ability to continue to identify and enter new markets and expand  existing  business;  continued  availability  of  financing  to  provide additional  sources of funding for  capital  expenditures,  working  capital and investments;  the effects of  competition  on products and  pricing;  growth and acceptance  of new product  lines  through  the  Company's  sales and  marketing programs;  changes in  material  and labor  prices  from  suppliers;  changes in customers'  financial  condition;  the  Company's  ability to attract and retain competent employees; the Company's ability to add and retain customers;  changes in sales  mix;  the  Company's  ability to  integrate  and  upgrade  technology; uncertainties  regarding accidents or litigation which may arise;  uncertainties about the impact of the threat of future  terrorist  attacks on business  travel and  related  trade show  attendance;  and the  effects  of, and  changes in the economy,  monetary and fiscal  policies,  laws and  regulations,  inflation  and monetary  fluctuations  as well as  fluctuations  in interest  rates,  both on a national and international basis.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK  Fluctuations in interest rates,  foreign  currency  exchange rates and commodity prices do not significantly  affect the Company's financial position and results of operations.  The Company's  revolving  credit facility bears an interest rate based on 30-day dealer placed commercial paper rate, plus a formula amount based on the Company's fixed charge ratio,  which resulted in 4.5% for 2004. The total interest rate at February 28, 2005 was 7%. Based on the Company's performance in 2004, this rate was reduced to 6% at March 21, 2005.  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
