ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  GENERAL OVERVIEW  The Company's business is the custom design, production and sale of exhibits and environments for trade shows, museums, theme parks, themed interiors and retail stores for clients in industry, government, entertainment and commercial establishments.  On August 7, 1990, the Company acquired the business of Sparks Exhibits Corp. ("Sparks") in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Sparks custom designs and manufactures sophisticated trade show exhibits, displays, architectural and museum interiors, graphics and signage, provides trade show services and designs and sells portable exhibits. During the fourth quarter of 1990, the Company acquired the accounts and assets of the trade exhibit division of a competitor and also established a portable exhibits group. The Company subsequently formed (i) Sparks Exhibits, Inc. ("Exhibits") during July 1991 in the Atlanta, Georgia area, (ii) Sparks Exhibits, Ltd. ("Limited") during July 1992 in the San Diego, California area, and (iii) Sparks Exhibits Incorporated ("Incorporated") during December 1992 in the Orlando, Florida area, in each case by acquiring the assets of trade show exhibit manufacturing companies.  During July 1993, the Company and Abex Display Systems, Inc. ("ADSI"), an unaffiliated portable/modular trade show exhibit manufacturer based in Los Angles, California, entered into an agreement to organize a new California corporation, Expose Display System, Inc. ("EDSI"). The Company acquired 51% of EDSI with ADSI acquiring the balance. EDSI granted to ADSI exclusive worldwide distribution and marketing rights for Expose, a portable display product, through December 2005. Effective February 1, 1998, the Company exchanged its 51% majority interest in EDSI and paid approximately $180,000 in cash, for a 25% interest in ADSI.  During April 1996, the Company acquired Piper Productions, Inc. ("Sparks Florida") of Orlando, Florida which produces permanent displays, including business theaters, theme park attractions, themed interiors, theatrical scenery and special effects.  On December 31, 1997, the Company acquired DMS, which is engaged in the business of supplying custom store fixtures, showcases and point of purchase displays for retailers. DMS has expertise and capabilities to take a design from concept to installation. DMS utilizes various unaffiliated manufacturers with whom it has developed long-standing business relationships for the production of its products. The retail fixture industry includes outfitting new retail stores and remodeling existing stores, including specialty apparel chains, "category killer" stores, department stores, outlet stores, supermarkets, building supply stores and drug stores.  On April 1, 1998, the Company acquired Rusty Hinges, Inc. located in the San Francisco, California area, which produces exhibit properties for industrial and corporate theater events throughout the United States. The Company subsequently changed the name of this business to Sparks Productions Ltd.  During February, 1999, the Company invested in a 25% interest in a Netherlands-based organization focusing on exhibit fabrication, interior design, event displays and graphics production, which subsequently changed its name to Sparks Europe, B.V. ("Sparks Europe"). This investment should assist the Company to expand its international presence.  Management's aggressive growth plan, since the August 1990 acquisition of Sparks Exhibits Corp. ("Sparks"), has resulted in the dramatic expansion of the Company's client base, the development of new businesses and areas of expertise for expansion of its products and services, and the extension into major geographic markets in the United States and internationally. Management believes the acquisitions and the continuing development of new areas of expertise will position the Company to increase its revenue base and move toward its goal of becoming a leading exhibits and environments company through the continued offering of expanded products and services to a larger customer network.                                          8     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  1999 AS COMPARED WITH 1998  SALES                                   (in thousands)                                                                     % INCREASE REVENUE SOURCES                             1999       1998         (DECREASE) - ---------------                             ----       ----         ----------  Trade show exhibits                       $47,265     $41,777           13% Permanent/scenic displays                  47,319      48,957           (3) EDSI                                          ---         400         (100)                                           -------     -------        -----                    Total revenues         $94,584     $91,134            4%                                           =======     =======        =====  Total net sales increased $3.5 million, or 4%, in 1999 as compared with 1998, led by higher sales of trade show exhibits, which grew $5.5 million, or 13%. The increase in sales of trade show exhibits was principally attributable to a full year of sales for significant new clients secured near the end of 1998, resulting from the Company's continuing initiatives focused on client expansion. Net sales of permanent/scenic displays, comprised primarily of the DMS business acquired at the end of 1997 and the Sparks Florida ("permanent displays") business acquired in 1996, decreased $1.6 million, or 3%. This decrease was the net result of lower sales for DMS, partially offset by higher sales for permanent displays. Lower sales for DMS were due in large part to a decrease in purchases by a large client, and higher sales for permanent displays were the result of securing new clients during 1999. There were no sales in 1999 for EDSI as a result of an exchange of EDSI in connection with the acquisition of a minority interest in ADSI as of February 1, 1998.  OPERATING PROFITS  Operating profits decreased $0.9 million, or 16.5%, to $4.4 million in 1999 from $5.3 million in 1998. This decrease was principally attributable to lower operating profits generated by the permanent displays business as well as to lower sales for DMS. The permanent displays operating profit decrease resulted, in large part, to bids on large jobs that did not provide adequate profit margins. Management has taken steps to improve the bidding and production control process and believes that a recurrence of significant jobs providing inadequate profit margins in the future is unlikely. Selling expenses decreased to 9.8% of net sales in 1999 from 10.6% in 1998, while administrative and general expenses increased to 8.1% of net sales in 1999 from 7.3% in 1998. The decrease in selling expenses was due in large part to lower variable expenses incurred by DMS and to lower sales commission rates incurred for certain new clients for the trade show exhibit business. The increase in administrative and general expenses was principally attributable to higher depreciation related to investments in computer systems and to improvements in the Company's facilities in the western United States.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  Interest income decreased to $136,896 in 1999 from $240,645 in 1998 due to lower average cash balances, which was largely the result of reductions in accounts payable and other accrued expenses. Interest expense increased $122,509 in 1999 primarily due to short-term borrowings from the Company's revolving credit facility necessary to meet working capital requirements. A loss of $45,406 was incurred in 1999 from investments in affiliates as compared with income of $14,464 in 1998. A write-down of $465,106 was incurred in 1999, related to a write-down of the Company's investment in Abex Europe, which went into receivership on October 15, 1999.  INCOME TAXES  The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 41% in 1999 as compared with 38% in 1998. This increase was principally attributable to non-deductible goodwill amortization.                                          9   NET INCOME  Net income decreased to $1.7 million ($.22 per diluted share) in 1999 from $2.8 million ($.35 per diluted share) in 1998. The decrease was principally attributable to lower operating profit generated by the permanent displays business, lower sales for DMS, the write-down of investment in the Abex Europe affiliate and the higher income tax expense.  Backlog  The Company's manufacturing backlog of orders was approximately $30.8 million as of December 31, 1999 as compared with $27 million as of December 31, 1998.  1998 AS COMPARED WITH 1997  NET SALES                                   (in thousands)                                                                   % INCREASE REVENUE SOURCES                         1998          1997        (DECREASE) - ---------------                         ----          ----        ---------- Trade show exhibits                    $41,777      $32,659           28% Permanent/scenic displays               48,957       11,329          332 EDSI                                       400        4,728          (92)                                        -------      -------        -----             Total revenues             $91,134      $48,716           87%                                        =======      =======        =====   Total net sales for 1998, as compared with 1997, increased by 87%, to $91.1 million from $48.7 million. Approximately 74% of the overall sales increase during 1998 was due to sales generated by the December 31, 1997-acquired DMS business, which is included as part of permanent/scenic displays revenues. Trade show exhibits generated $9.1 of the overall $42.4 million increase in total sales for 1998 as compared with 1997, reflecting the Company's continuing program of client expansion. Permanent/scenic displays, comprising DMS, museum/productions, permanent displays and the April 1998-acquired Sparks Productions Ltd., experienced a $37.6 million increase in 1998 sales as compared with 1997 revenues. Exclusive of the sales generated by the December 31, 1997-acquired DMS, total sales for permanent/scenic displays increased during 1998 over 1997 revenues by 155%. This significant increase during 1998 was predominately due to expanding the scope of services in permanent display projects and the sales from Sparks Productions Ltd. Sales generated by EDSI amounted to $4.7 million during 1997 as compared with only $0.4 million during 1998 due to the exchange of EDSI in connection with the acquisition of a minority interest in ADSI as of February 1, 1998 (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). Sales and the related costs of operations generated by EDSI, formerly a consolidated 51% owned subsidiary of the Company, were recorded through January 31, 1998. Subsequent to the previously described exchange with ADSI, the Company recorded its pro-rata equity interest in ADSI's net profits using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, sales and related costs from EDSI's operations are not reflected in the Company's consolidated statement of operations subsequent to January 31, 1998.  OPERATING PROFITS  Operating profits more than doubled to $5.3 million during 1998 from approximately $2.3 million during 1997. The increase in 1998 operating profits occurred despite a 4.6% decrease in the gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, during 1998 as compared with 1997. This decrease is predominantly due to lower gross profit margins on sales generated by the December 31, 1997-acquired DMS. Due to the additional sales from DMS during 1998, a larger percentage of 1998 total revenues were generated by permanent/scenic displays. In addition to the lower gross profit margins relative to DMS, the Company experienced a lower gross profit margin on a specific museum project during 1998. This project was bid at a lower gross profit margin due to its large size and the competitive environment surrounding the project. In an effort to expand its opportunities in permanent display projects, the Company made investments in specialized production and installation techniques on these particular projects, which negatively impacted overall gross profit margins. While permanent/scenic displays caused lower overall gross profit margins, the additional sales they generated significantly contributed to the absorption of fixed overhead, selling, and general and administrative costs. Accordingly, the 4.6% lower gross profit margin percentage was more than offset                                          10     by 5.8% lower selling and administrative and general costs, as a percentage of sales, during 1998 as compared with 1997 selling and administrative and general costs.  OTHER INCOME/(EXPENSE)  Other expenses, net, increased $1.1 million during 1998 as compared with 1997 primarily due to interest expense attributable to term debt associated with the December 31, 1997 acquisition of DMS and the Company's utilization of its credit facility from a bank during 1998. Interest income during 1998 was less than 1997 interest income due to less cash being available for investment during 1998 as compared with 1997. Operating cash requirements for the December 31, 1997-acquired DMS and the Company's acquisition of property and equipment, particularly with respect to the Company's new management information system, also negatively impacted cash available for investment during 1998.  INCOME TAXES  The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, increased to approximately 38% during 1998 as compared with 24% during 1997. The 1997 rate reflects a benefit from the release of valuation allowances based upon the Company's expected ultimate realization of benefits from its business tax credit carryforwards.  NET INCOME  Net income increased to $2,820,631 ($.35 per diluted share) during 1998 from $2,003,316 ($.36 per diluted share) during 1997. This increase is attributed to the higher sales levels and related operating profits generated during 1998. Additionally, the tax provision during 1998, as a percentage of income before income taxes, increased to 38% from the 24% tax provision rate in 1997.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  During 1999, the Company's cash balance decreased $3.8 million as a result of several factors, the most significant of which were reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses, significant capital expenditures and an increase in inventories. Accounts payable and accrued expenses were reduced by $4.3 million to improve relations with valued suppliers and sub-contractors. Capital expenditures of $2.8 million were incurred to improve the Company's computer systems and to upgrade several facilities. Inventories were increased by $2.2 million to improve customer service for DMS and as a result of higher work in process inventories related to both new and existing trade show exhibit clients contracted for delivery in the first quarter of 2000. These reductions in cash were partially offset by depreciation and amortization of $2.6 million and net income of $ 1.7 million.  The Company borrowed $13.0 million and repaid $11.4 million under its revolving credit facility during 1999 to finance its working capital needs. There were borrowings of $1.6 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $0.8 million under a short-term construction loan as temporary financing for a facility expansion at December 31, 1999. The balance of a term loan incurred in connection with the DMS acquisition was reduced by $1.9 million to $10.6 million at December 31, 1999, in accordance with the term loan agreement. The Company was in compliance with its bank covenants as of December 31, 1999.  The Company's current ratio at December 31, 1999 improved slightly to 1.6:1 as compared with 1.5:1 at December 31, 1998, and the total liabilities to net worth ratio improved to 1.03:1 at December 31, 1999 from 1.24:1 at December 31, 1998.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT  On January 21, 2000, the Company restructured its bank debt with an amended revolving credit facility, providing for borrowing capacity up to $30 million. This new facility, which matures on January 21, 2005, was used to refinance the term loan and is intended to finance capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions and other working capital requirements as needed. The new facility is collateralized by all of the Company's assets and bears interest at rates based on the LIBOR, adjusted for applicable spreads ranging from 1.25% to 2.5%. The Company is subject to an annual commitment fee of 1/4% on the average unused portion of the revolving credit facility. This new facility includes certain financial covenants requiring a minimum net worth and maintenance of certain financial ratios, and                                           11    restricts the Company's ability to pay dividends. Loan origination fees totaling approximately $540,000, comprised of $440,000 of cash payments and issuance of 37,210 shares of the Company's common stock, will be amortized over five years.  OUTLOOK  The Company expects continued sales growth from trade show exhibits and improved sales from permanent/scenic displays during 2000. The investment in Sparks Europe in February 1999 was made to expand the Company's international presence throughout the European markets during 2000 and beyond. The lower gross profit margins experienced in 1999 are expected to improve in 2000 as management has taken steps to improve the management talent in the Sparks Florida permanent displays business, and has invested in new management talent in its western region facilities. Management believes that the trade show exhibit client base of Fortune 1000 companies will continue to tightly manage their marketing budgets, which may impact the Company's trade show exhibit profit margins. The Company has upgraded several facilities and continues to pursue operating efficiency improvements to mitigate the impact of margin pressure from its client base.  The Company converted its management information system at the beginning of 1999 and incurred inefficiencies as a result of the transition. This upgrade of both hardware and software is expected to better position the Company to manage the business and to meet the changing environment of information requirements of its clients and suppliers during 2000 and beyond.  Management plans ongoing investment in human resources, particularly for new sales executives and support staff to create long term growth opportunities, and believes that these investments combined with the new debt capacity, which may be used for acquisitions, will provide future opportunities for continued growth and business expansion.  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", which will require that all derivative financial instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. SFAS No. 133 will be effective no later than for the Company's first quarter of 2001. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operation, financial position or cash flows.

YEAR 2000 DATE CONVERSIONS  The Company completed a major project of converting its computer systems to year 2000 compliant software during 1999. The Company expended approximately $1.3 million in 1999 and $1.7 million during 1998 and 1997 in connection with this project. There were no significant disruptions to business operations during the first quarter of 2000 related to the Company's computer systems.                                          12    ITEM 7A.
