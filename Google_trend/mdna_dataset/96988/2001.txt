ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  GENERAL OVERVIEW  The Company's business is the custom design, production and sale of exhibits and environments for trade shows, museums, theme parks, themed interiors, arenas, executive briefing centers, corporate events and retail stores for clients in industry, government, entertainment and commercial establishments.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  2000 As Compared With 1999  Net Sales                                   (in thousands)                                                           % increase Revenue Sources                 2000          1999        (decrease) - ---------------                 ----          ----        ----------  Trade show exhibits          $56,182       $47,265            19% Permanent/scenic displays     36,351        47,319           (23)                              -------       -------           --- Total                        $92,533       $94,584            (2)%                              =======       =======           ===  Total net sales decreased $2.1 million, or 2%, in 2000 as compared with 1999 net sales as a result of higher sales of trade show exhibits, which grew $8.9 million or 19%, offset by lower sales of permanent/scenic displays, which decreased $11 million or 23%. Higher trade show exhibit sales were due primarily to new clients and to higher sales of services provided at trade shows. Lower sales of permanent/scenic displays were principally attributable to a decrease in business from a customer that became insolvent and to lower sales for the Company's store fixtures business as major retail customers delayed new store openings and renovations.  Operating Profits  The Company revised its 1999 financial statements. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.  Operating profit decreased to $60,000 in 2000 from $3.1 million, in 1999. A provision for accounts receivable and inventory related to customer insolvency and disputes reduced third quarter 2000 operating profit by $2 million. Additionally, relocation of operations and losses incurred by the Company's permanent/scenic displays operations reduced fourth quarter 2000 operating profit by approximately $1 million.  By the second quarter of 2001, the Company expects to have relocated and consolidated three of its operations within the past fifteen months. The Company's store fixtures business was relocated in March of 2000 and consolidated with its Philadelphia, PA, operations, and West Coast production operations were consolidated in the fourth quarter of 2000. In the first quarter of 2001, management decided to consolidate its Southeast region production operations, which is planned for completion during the second quarter of 2001. These actions are expected to improve the Company's competitive position and eliminate operating losses realized in the West Coast and Southeast region facilities that were relocated.  Selling expenses increased to $11 million, or 11.9% of sales, in 2000 from $9.3 million, or 9.8% of sales in 1999. This increase was due in part to higher trade show exhibit sales, which are subject to higher sales commissions and variable selling expenses. The Company also invested in additional sales personnel in 2000.  Administrative and general expenses increased $1.6 million to $9.2 million, or 10% of sales, in 2000 from $7.6 million, or 8% of sales, in 1999. This increase was attributable to several factors, including higher bad debt provisions ($0.8 million), higher business insurance costs, consulting fees, amortization of loan origination fees, management recruiting expenses and relocation costs to consolidate the Company's store fixtures business.                                         8  Other Income (Expense)  Interest expense increased to $1.4 million in 2000 from $1.1 million in 1999 due to higher borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility. This increase was due in part to finance working capital requirements resulting from losses incurred in the permanent/scenic displays businesses and from slower billing and collections of accounts receivable. The Company deployed new computer systems during 1999 and 2000, which caused delays in customer billings and collections.  A write down of $465,000 was incurred in 1999 related to the Company's investment in Abex Europe, which went into receivership under UK law in October 1999.  Income Taxes  The benefit from income taxes was 19% of the pre-tax loss in 2000 as compared with a 47% provision in 1999 largely due to differences between book and tax treatment of goodwill amortization.  Net Income  A net loss of $1.1 million ($.15 per fully diluted share) was incurred in 2000 as compared with net income of $0.8 million ($.10 per fully diluted share) in 1999. The decrease in 2000 was attributable primarily to losses associated with the permanent/scenic displays businesses that required higher bad debt and inventory provisions and higher selling, administrative and general expenses.  Backlog  The Company's backlog of orders was approximately $18 million at December 31, 2000 as compared with $30.8 million at December 31, 1999. This decrease was due in large part to lower orders for permanent/scenic displays.  1999 As Compared With 1998  Net Sales                                    (in thousands)                                                            % increase Revenue Sources                 1999           1998        (decrease) - ---------------                 ----           ----        ----------  Trade show exhibits           $47,265        $41,777            13% Permanent/scenic displays      47,319         48,957            (3) EDSI                               --            400          (100)                               -------        -------          ----     Total                     $94,584        $91,134             4%                               =======        =======          ====  Total net sales increased $3.5 million, or 4%, in 1999 as compared with 1998, led by higher sales of trade show exhibits, which grew $5.5 million, or 13%. The increase in sales of trade show exhibits was principally attributable to a full year of sales for significant new clients secured near the end of 1998, resulting from the Company's continuing initiatives focused on client expansion. Net sales of permanent/scenic displays, comprised primarily of the Company's store fixtures business acquired at the end of 1997 and the Sparks Florida business acquired in 1996, decreased $1.6 million, or 3%. This decrease was primarily the result of lower sales for store fixtures, partially offset by higher sales for scenic displays. Lower sales for store fixtures were due in large part to a decrease in purchases by a large client, and higher sales for scenic displays were the result of securing new clients during 1999. There were no sales in 1999 for Expose Display Systems, Inc. ("EDSI") as a result of an exchange of the Company's interest in EDSI in connection with the acquisition of a minority interest in Abex as of February 1, 1998.                                         9  Operating Profits  Operating profits decreased $2.3 million, to $3.1 million in 1999 from $5.3 million in 1998. This decrease was principally attributable to lower operating profits generated by the permanent displays and store fixtures businesses largely resulting from lower revenues. The permanent displays operating profit decrease resulted, in large part, from bids on large jobs that did not provide adequate profit margins. Trade show exhibits margins also decreased in 1999.  Selling expenses decreased to 9.8% of net sales in 1999 from 10.6% in 1998, while administrative and general expenses increased to 8.1% of net sales in 1999 from 7.3% in 1998. The decrease in selling expenses was due in large part to lower variable expenses incurred by the store fixtures business and to lower sales commission rates incurred for certain new clients for the trade show exhibit business. The increase in administrative and general expenses was principally attributable to higher depreciation related to investments in computer systems and to improvements in the Company's facilities in the western United States.  Other Income (Expense)  Interest income decreased to $137,000 in 1999 from $241,000 in 1998 due to lower average cash balances, which was largely the result of reductions in accounts payable and other accrued expenses. Interest expense increased $123,000 in 1999 primarily due to short-term borrowings from the Company's revolving credit facility necessary to meet working capital requirements. A write-down of $465,000 was incurred in 1999 for the Company's investment in Abex Europe Ltd., which went into receivership on October 15, 1999.  Income Taxes  The provision for income taxes increased to 47% of pre-tax income in 1999 as compared with 38% in 1998. This increase was principally attributable to non-deductible goodwill amortization, as well as to 1998 valuation allowances for net operating loss carryforwards.  Net Income  Net income decreased to $0.8 million ($0.10 per diluted share) in 1999 from $2.8 million ($.35 per diluted share) in 1998. The decrease was principally attributable to lower operating profit generated by the permanent displays business, lower sales of store fixtures, the write-down of investment in the Abex Europe affiliate, lower margins for trade show exhibits and a higher effective income tax rate.  Backlog  The Company's manufacturing backlog of orders was approximately $30.8 million at December 31, 1999 as compared with $27 million at December 31, 1998.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  On January 21, 2000, the Company restructured its bank debt by executing a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the "Facility") with its bank providing for borrowing capacity up to $30 million. This new Facility was used to refinance a term loan and a construction loan and to replace the Company's previous revolving credit facility. Fees for the new facility totaled $532,000, comprised of $432,000 of cash payments and issuance of 37,210 shares of the Company's common stock. The new Facility is collateralized by all of the Company's assets and bears interest at rates based on the LIBOR, adjusted for applicable spreads ranging from 2.0% to 2.75%. The Company is subject to an annual commitment fee of 1/4% on the average unused portion of the revolving credit facility. This new Facility includes certain financial covenants requiring a minimum net worth and maintenance of certain financial ratios, and restricts the Company's ability                                          10  to pay dividends. The Company was not in compliance with the financial covenants of this new Facility at September 30, 2000 and at December 31, 2000. An Amendment to the new Facility was executed on February 16, 2001, whereby the Company received the appropriate waivers and which changed the financial covenant provisions to remove $2 million of charges incurred during the third quarter of 2000 determined to be non-recurring under the terms of the Amendment.  On April 16, 2001, another Amendment and waiver to the Facility was executed which changed the financial covenant provisions to remove $1 million of charges incurred during the fourth quarter of 2000 determined to be non-recurring under the terms of the Amendment, to reduce the minimum net worth requirement from $29 million to $28 million, and to lower the Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio from 3.5:1 to 3.25:1 at June 30, 2000, to 3:1 at December 31, 2001 and to 2.75:1 thereafter. This Amendment also reduced the borrowing capacity to $25 million, shortened the maturity date of the credit facility to January 21, 2004, increased certain interest spreads above LIBOR and requires the bank's consent for future Company acquisitions and further investments in affiliates. This Amendment and waiver brought the Company into compliance with the new Facility. Costs of $10,000 incurred in connection with this Amendment will be amortized over the remaining term of the new Facility. Borrowings under the new Facility were $16 million at December 31, 2000.  The Company has maintained essentially the same cash balance at the end of 2000 as compared with the balance at the end of 1999. Cash provided by operating activities of $473,000 was largely the result of an increase of $4.7 million in accounts receivable, offset by depreciation and amortization of $2.7 million and a $2.4 million decrease in inventories. The accounts receivable increase was due to delays in billing and collection, which was attributable to several factors, including deployment of a new computer system. Capital expenditure totaled $2.6 million for 2000, and included investments in new rental assets, facilities expansion and computer upgrades. The current portion of long-term debt was reduced by $2.9 million as a result of the debt restructuring. Working capital increased to $15.4 million at the end of 2000 from $11.2 million at the end of 1999, largely as a result of the increase in accounts receivable and the debt restructuring.  OUTLOOK  The Company expects continued sales growth from trade show exhibits and lower sales from permanent/scenic displays during 2001. Management has taken steps to improve its human resource talent and has taken steps to consolidate operations. The Company's store fixtures operation and San Carlos, CA production and warehousing operations were consolidated with other operations during 2000. The Company also plans to relocate and consolidate its Orlando, Florida production operation in the second quarter of 2001. Consolidation of these operations it expected to reduce costs during the second half of 2001 and beyond.  The Company installed new computer systems during 1999 and upgraded the related software during the fourth quarter of 2000. Although these computer information systems have improved, the Company continues to experience problems related to these systems. Management is taking further steps to improve the software systems using outside consultants and to improve the hardware and communications reliability of the Company's computer systems.  Management believes that the trade show exhibit client base of Fortune 1000 companies will continue to tightly manage their marketing budgets, which may impact the Company's trade show exhibit profit margins. The Company continues to pursue operating efficiency improvements to mitigate the impact of margin pressure from its client base. Management plans ongoing investment in human resources, particularly for new sales executives and support staff to create long term growth opportunities.  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", which will require that all derivative financial instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. SFAS No. 133 will be effective no later than for the Company's first quarter of 2001. In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, which amended SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 138 provides additional guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. This statement is applicable for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The adoption of these statements is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operation, financial position or cash flows.                                         11  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This report contains forward-looking statements.
