ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL          CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  INTRODUCTION  The Company's business is the custom design, production and sale of exhibits and environments for trade shows, museums, theme parks, themed interiors, arenas, corporate lobbies and retail stores for clients in industry, government, entertainment and commercial establishments.  Challenges of the past year included the relocation and consolidation of the Company's West Coast operations and a terminated merger agreement discussed below. In addition, on February 6, 2004 the Company replaced its credit facility that would have expired on May 16, 2004 with a new facility expiring on February 6, 2007.  The trade show exhibit industry continues to be very competitive and several of the Company's competitors have filed for Chapter 11. In addition, the Company's customer base of primarily Fortune 1000 companies is expected to continue to closely manage their trade show budgets. This budget management will put pressure on sales and margins for trade show exhibits and related services. The Company is negotiating better pricing and terms with its suppliers and pursuing staff and cost reduction initiatives to mitigate the impact of this industry trend.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  2003 as Compared With 2002  Net Sales - --------                                                                               (in thousands)  Revenue Sources                                               2003                      2002 - ---------------                                               ----                      ----  Trade show exhibits                                        $40,457                  $ 44,711 Permanent and scenic displays                               25,130                    26,471                                                             ------                    ------ Total                                                      $65,587                   $71,182                                                             ======                    ======   Total net sales of $65.6 million for 2003 decreased $5.6 million, or 8%, from total net sales for 2002. This decrease was comprised of a $4.3 million, or 10%, decrease in sales of trade show exhibits and related services and a $1.3 million, or 5%, decrease in sales of permanent and scenic displays. Selling prices were relatively constant in 2003 and 2002. Lower sales of trade show exhibits and related services were primarily due to reductions in certain customers' trade show marketing budgets, which led to cancelled and reduced participation in trade shows that these customers attended in the past. The sales decrease for permanent and scenic displays was principally attributable to lower sales of store fixtures to national retail customers.  Gross Profit - ------------ Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, improved to 21.9% in 2003 from 19.9% in 2002. This improvement was largely due to profit improvement initiatives implemented in the second half of 2002, which were realized for the full year in 2003. Management continues to pursue cost reduction initiatives, including operational improvements, supplier renegotiations and staff reductions to offset the impact of lower sales volume.  Selling Expenses - ---------------- Selling expenses were $8.5 million in 2003 and in 2002. As a percentage of net sales, these expenses increased to 13% in 2003 from 11.9% in 2002. The percentage increase was due, in large part, to the impact of lower sales volume as compared with certain fixed selling expenses such as sales office and salary expenses. Cost reduction initiatives implemented near the end of 2003 are expected to reduce selling expenses in 2004.                                         9   Administrative and General Expenses - ----------------------------------- Administrative and general expenses of $6.9 million for 2003 increased 1.6% from such expenses of $6.8 million for 2002. The Company and Redwood Acquisition Corp. ("Redwood") entered into a merger agreement in February 2003 pursuant to which all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (other than the shares held by approximately eight shareholders) would be converted into the right to receive $0.30 per share. On June 19, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors approved a termination proposal submitted by Redwood, which terminated the proposed merger agreement with Redwood. Costs of approximately $250,000 incurred in connection with this proposed merger agreement were charged to administrative and general expenses in the second and third quarters of 2003. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to these costs incurred in connection with this terminated merger transaction, integration costs to consolidate the Company's West Coast operations and higher insurance and telecommunications costs. During the fourth quarter of 2003, management implemented executive compensation reductions, staff reductions and further cost cutting initiatives in response to lower sales volume.  Restructuring and other Expense - ------------------------------- On August 1, 2003, a Company subsidiary acquired the assets of Exhibit Crafts, Inc., a Los Angeles, CA area manufacturer of trade show exhibits and a 20% interest in International Exposition Services, Inc., (IES), a trade show shipping and installation provider. The initial purchase price was $694,000, including the assumption of certain liabilities totaling $310,000. In addition, the sellers received 20% of the subsidiary's common stock. The purchase price approximated the fair value of the net assets acquired. In addition, the asset purchase agreement provides for contingent aggregate payments of up to $750,000 based on operating performance in 2004, 2005 and 2006. The Company relocated its San Diego area manufacturing facility to the newly acquired Los Angeles, CA area facility during the third quarter of 2003. Costs incurred in connection with this relocation and consolidation were approximately $1.1 million, which included relocation and employee termination expenses and the Company recorded a charge for a portion of the remaining lease obligation related to the vacated San Diego area facility.  Operating Loss - -------------- The Company incurred an operating loss of $2.2 million in 2003 primarily due to lower volume and the restructuring costs for the relocation and consolidation of its West Coast operations.  Other Income (Expense) - --------------------- Interest expense decreased to $236,000 in 2003 from $382,000 in 2002 due in part to lower borrowings and to lower interest rates.  In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $259,000 related to the investment in its Sparks Europe affiliate.  Benefit From Income Taxes - ------------------------- In the third quarter of 2003, the Company recognized the benefit of an income tax refund for $0.4 million related to a change in strategy whereby a net operating loss was carried back to a prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company established a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets. As a result, the Company did not record an income tax benefit from the current period pre-tax loss.  Backlog - ------- The backlog of orders at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $19 million. Generally, backlog of orders are recognized as sales during the subsequent six month period. The current backlog relates primarily to expected 2004 sales. The Company maintains a client base from which new orders are continually generated, including refurbishing of existing trade show exhibits stored in the Company's facilities.                                         10   2002 As Compared With 2001  Net Sales - ---------                                                     (in thousands)  Revenue Sources                              2002                      2001                                              ----                      ---- Trade show exhibits                       $ 44,711                  $ 49,992 Permanent and scenic displays               26,471                    26,980                                             ------                    ------ Total                                      $71,182                  $ 76,972                                             ======                    ======  Total net sales of $71.2 million for 2002 decreased 8% from total net sales for 2001. Sales of trade show exhibits and related services decreased 10.6% primarily due to the loss of two trade show exhibit clients and generally weak economic conditions. Sales of permanent and scenic displays decreased 1.9%, which was the net result of lower store fixtures sales partially offset by higher permanent museum display sales.  Gross Profit - ------------ Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 19.9% in 2002 as compared with 22.2% in 2001. This decrease was principally attributable to lower gross profit margins for store fixtures and to shifts in sales mix to lower margin sales categories. The DMS store fixtures business had an unfavorable impact on the Company's gross profit in 2002.  Selling Expenses - ---------------- Selling expenses of $8.5 million decreased to 11.9% of net sales in 2002 from $9.8 million, or 12.7% of net sales in 2001. This decrease was largely due to higher permanent museum exhibit sales, which are subject to lower sales commission expense, and to lower commission expense for store fixtures sales.  Administrative and General Expenses - ----------------------------------- Administrative and general expenses were reduced to $6.8 million in 2002 from $7.4 million in 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the adoption of a new accounting principle discussed below, which eliminated goodwill amortization in 2002. Goodwill amortization in 2001 was $0.8 million. In connection with the DMS Store Fixtures acquisition, employment agreements were made with two shareholders of the Company, which provided for guaranteed minimum annual payments of approximately $0.5 million. These agreements were mutually terminated in January 2001 eliminating the guaranteed minimum payments after February 2, 2001, which reduced administrative and general expenses by approximately $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2001.  Operating Loss - --------------  The Company reported an operating loss of $1.1 million for 2002 as compared with an operating loss of $0.1 million for 2001. The increase in operating loss was principally attributable to lower sales and the lower gross profit percentage in 2002.  The Company's DMS Store Fixtures business unit generated significantly lower operating profit (loss) in 2002 as compared with 2001. Based on these results and projections for 2003, an impairment loss of $176,000, included as a component of the operating loss, was recognized for the net book value of remaining long-term assets for this business unit.  Other Income (Expense) - --------------------- Interest expense decreased to $0.4 million in 2002 from $1.2 million in 2001 as a result of lower borrowings and lower interest rates.                                         11  In the first quarter of 2002, management determined that the Company's investment in a portable tradeshow exhibit manufacturer was not recoverable, which resulted in an impairment loss of $1.2 million from investments in affiliates. A loss of $0.3 million was recognized in 2001 for a write-down of the Company's investment in its Sparks Europe affiliate.  Provision for (benefit from) income taxes - ----------------------------------------- The Company established a valuation allowance of $5.4 million for deferred income tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2002, principally related to a deferred income tax benefit in connection with the write off of goodwill recorded in the first quarter of 2002.  The Company also established a valuation allowance for the income tax benefit from the $1.2 million write down of investments in affiliates recorded in the first quarter of 2002 because this capital loss is not expected to be offset by capital gains within the required statutory period. The provision for income taxes recorded in the first quarter of 2002 also included a valuation allowance of $191,000 related to a 1999 capital loss incurred in connection with the Company's investment in a United Kingdom affiliate.  Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle - --------------------------------------------------- In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial of Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142), which supercedes APB No. 17 "Intangible Assets". SFAS 142 requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings, but instead be reviewed for impairment. The Company adopted SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002. This new accounting standard requires a two-step test for operating units having unamortized goodwill balances. The first step requires a comparison of the book value of the net assets to the fair value of the respective operating unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is required to determine the impairment. This second step includes evaluation of other intangible assets, and any shortfall of the adjusted book value below fair value determines the amount of the goodwill impairment. Goodwill amortization expense was $0.8 million in 2001 and in 2000. The adoption of SFAS 142 reduced goodwill by $15.9 million and net income by $12.4 million (net of a $3.5 million income tax benefit) in the first quarter of 2002, identified as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. This impairment charge related to goodwill recorded in connection with the December 31, 1997 acquisition of DMS Store Fixtures, L.P. This charge differs from the previous accounting standard method, which was based on undiscounted cash flows, because the new method is based on fair value measurement estimates as of the measurement date.  Backlog - ------- The backlog of orders at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was approximately $19 million and $13 million, respectively. The backlog increase is principally attributable to a higher level of open orders for permanent and scenic displays and new customers. Generally, backlog of orders are recognized as sales during the subsequent six month period. The Company maintains a client base from which new orders are continually generated, including refurbishing of existing trade show exhibits stored in the Company's facilities.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  On May 16, 2003, the Company amended its Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the "Facility") with its bank to change from and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") basis to an asset-based arrangement. The Facility provided for borrowing of up to $8 million based on a percentage of qualified accounts receivable and inventories. The Facility was collateralized by all the Company's assets and had interest at rates based primarily on the London Inter Bank Offering Rate (LIBOR) plus 3.25%. The Facility included certain financial covenants requiring a minimum tangible net worth and maintenance of certain financial ratios and restricted the Company's ability to pay dividends. Borrowings under this Facility were $4.9 million at December 31, 2003.  On February 6, 2004, the Company replaced the Facility with a new credit facility provided by a commercial asset-based lender. The new credit facility, which expires on February 6, 2007, provides for borrowing capacity of up to $12                                         12  million based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventories. This new facility bears interest based on the 30-day dealer placed commercial paper rate plus 4.50% (effective rate of 5.51% at February 6, 2004), restricts the Company's ability to pay dividends, and includes certain financial covenants (fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum capital expenditure amount of $1 million in 2004 and $1.25 million in 2005 and in 2006). The Company's borrowing capacity was $7 million at March 4, 2004. Proceeds from this credit facility are used primarily for working capital and other capital purposes.  The Company's working capital decreased to $3 million at December 31, 2003 from $3.5 million at December 31, 2002, largely due to a $0.6 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents. Available cash and proceeds of $0.9 million from the Company's credit facility were used for the acquisition discussed ($0.4 million) and for capital expenditures ($0.9).  The Company has lease commitments for certain facilities under non-cancelable operating leases. Timing of future lease commitments as well as maturities of long-term debt are as follows:                                                                            Payment due by period                                                              ---------------------                                                        Less than      1-3     3-5    More than        Contractual Obligations                 Total       1 Year   Years   Years     5 Years        -----------------------                 -----       ------   -----   -----     --------        Long-Term Debt Obligations            $ 5,235        $ 89   $5,146    $ --        $--        Capital Lease Obligations                  --          --       --      --         --        Operating Lease Obligations             8,237       2,267    4,910   1,060         --        Purchase Obligations                       --          --       --      --         --        Other Long-Term Liabilities        Reflected on the Registrant's        Balance Sheet Under GAAP                   --          --       --      --         --                                               ------       -----    -----   -----        ----                                   Total      $13,472      $2,356  $10,056  $1,060        $--                                               ======       =====   ======   =====        ====   The Company jointly leases a 31,000 square foot facility with International Expo Services, in which the Company holds a minority interest. The annual lease commitment for this facility is $214,000 through September 22, 2007, which is not included with the above future operating lease commitments.  The Company leases a facility from a partnership controlled by two shareholders of the Company. This lease, which contains a renewal option on May 14, 2009 and expires on May 14, 2019, requires minimum annual rent of $771,000 (included in the table above) at a fixed rate for the first 10 years, and the Company is responsible for taxes, insurance and other operating expenses.  OUTLOOK  The Company expects combined sales of trade show exhibits and of permanent and scenic displays in 2004 to decrease from 2003 levels. The Company's trade show exhibit client base of Fortune 1000 companies is expected to closely manage their marketing budgets, which would inhibit the Company's trade show exhibit sales and margins. The Company expects sales of store fixtures to increase in 2004 from 2003 levels. The Company continues to explore new sales opportunities while pursuing operating efficiency improvements and cost reduction initiatives to mitigate the impact of lower sales volume.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 146, "Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS 146"). Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 146 addresses significant issues regarding the recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities, including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") has set forth in EITF Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." Effective in the first quarter of 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 146. This new accounting principle had an impact on the timing and recognition of costs associated with the Company's relocation and consolidation of its West Coast operations (see Note 2).  In 2003, the FASB issues FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46") and its amendment FIN 46R. This interpretation clarifies existing accounting principles related to the preparation of                                         13  consolidated financial statements when the equity investors in an entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or when the equity at risk is not sufficient for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. FIN 46R requires a company to evaluate all existing arrangements to identify situations where a company has a "variable interest" in a "variable interest entity" and further determine when such variable interests require a company to consolidate the variable interest entities' financial statement with its own. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 46 in connection with the lease agreement with a related partnership and determined that there was no impact on its financial statements as a result of the adoption of this new accounting principle.  In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting For Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150"). SFAS 150 addresses the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of SFAS 150 on its financial statements.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Financial statement preparation in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. One such estimate is possible losses in connection with financing accounts receivable. Management estimates these possible losses based on a review of the financial condition and payment history of specific customers having significant accounts receivable balances, and establishes a general reserve for the remaining accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience.  Revenues on trade show exhibit sales, themed interiors, custom store fixtures and point of purchase displays are recognized using the completed contract method. The Company's contracts are typically less than three months in duration. As a result, the Company's revenue recognition would not differ materially if another method were used. Progress billings are generally made throughout the production process. Progress billings which are unpaid at the balance sheet date are not recognized in the financial statements as accounts receivable. Progress billings which have been collected on or before the balance sheet date are classified as customer deposits and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.  Measurement of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment involves assumptions and estimates by management on a quarterly basis. The adoption of SFAS 142 requires estimates of fair values for certain operating units. These estimates involve discounted cash flow forecasts to determine the fair value of operating units having unamortized goodwill balances, and also considers the Company's market capitalization.  The evaluation of deferred income tax assets also involves managements estimates and judgment. Management considers several factors in this evaluation, including trailing three year financial performance history and future forecasts of operating income. A valuation allowance is established based on management's estimates about the recoverability of deferred income tax assets.  Other significant accounting policies are also important to the understanding of the Company's financial statements. These policies are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This report contains forward-looking statements. When used in this report, the words "intends," "believes," "plans," "expects," "anticipates," "probable," "could" and similar words are used to identify these forward looking statements. In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, there are certain important factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those included in such forward-looking statements. Some of the important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected include, but are not limited to: the Company's ability to continue to identify and enter new markets and expand existing business; continued availability of financing to provide additional sources of funding for capital expenditures, working capital and investments; the effects of competition on products and pricing; growth and acceptance of new product lines through the Company's sales and marketing programs; changes in material and labor prices from suppliers; changes in customers' financial condition; the Company's ability to attract and retain competent employees; the Company's ability to add and retain customers; changes in sales mix; the Company's ability to integrate and upgrade technology; uncertainties regarding accidents or litigation which may arise; the financial impact of facilities consolidations; uncertainties about the impact of the threat of future terrorist attacks on business travel and related trade show                                         14   attendance; and the effects of, and changes in the economy, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, inflation and monetary fluctuations as well as fluctuations in interest rates, both on a national and international basis.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK          ---------------------------------------------------------  Fluctuations in interest, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices do not significantly affect the Company's financial position and results of operations. The Company's revolving credit facility, bears an interest rate based on 30-day dealer placed commercial paper rate, plus 4.5%.  ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
