ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS          OF OPERATIONS   General Overview  The Company's business is the custom design, production and sale of exhibits and environments for trade shows, museums, theme parks, themed interiors and retailers stores for clients in industry, government, entertainment, and commercial establishments.  On August 7, 1990, the Company acquired the business of Sparks Exhibits Corp. ("Sparks") in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Sparks custom designs and manufactures sophisticated trade show exhibits, displays, architectural and museum interiors, graphics and signage, provides trade show services and designs and sells portable exhibits. During the fourth quarter of 1990, the Company acquired the accounts and assets of the trade exhibit division of a competitor and also established a portable exhibits group. The Company subsequently formed (i) Sparks Exhibits, Inc. ("Exhibits") during July 1991 in the Atlanta, Georgia area, (ii) Sparks Exhibits, Ltd. ("Limited") during July 1992 in the San Diego, California area, and (iii) Sparks Exhibits Incorporated ("Incorporated") during December 1992 in the Orlando, Florida area, in each case by acquiring the assets of trade show exhibit manufacturing companies.  During July 1993, the Company and Abex Display Systems, Inc. ("ADSI"), an unaffiliated portable/modular trade show exhibit manufacturer based in Los Angles, California, entered into an agreement to organize a new California corporation, Expose' Display System, Inc. ("EDSI"). The Company acquired 51% of EDSI with ADSI acquiring the balance. EDSI granted to ADSI exclusive worldwide distribution and marketing rights for "Expose", a portable display product, through December 2005. Effective February 1, 1998, the Company exchanged its 51% majority interest in EDSI and paid approximately $180,000 in cash, for a 25% interest in ADSI.  During April 1996, the Company acquired Piper Productions, Inc. ("Piper") of Orlando, Florida which produces business theater, theme park attraction, themed interiors, theatrical scenery and special effects.  On December 31, 1997, the Company acquired DMS, which is engaged in the business of supplying custom store fixtures, showcases and point of purchase display for retailers. DMS has expertise and capabilities to take a design from concept to installation. DMS utilizes various unaffiliated manufacturers with whom it has developed long-standing business relationships for the production of its products. The retail fixture industry includes outfitting new retail stores and remodeling existing stores, including specialty apparel chains, "category killer" stores, department stores, outlet stores, supermarkets, building supply stores and drug stores.  On April 1, 1998, the Company acquired Rusty Hinges, Inc. d/b/a Steele Productions ("Steele") located in the San Francisco, California area. Steele produces exhibit properties for industrial and corporate theater events throughout the United States. The Company subsequently changed the name of Steele to Sparks Scenic, Ltd. ("Scenic").                                          8    During the third quarter of 1998, the Company completed a 20% equity investment in Abex Europe, Ltd. ("Abex Europe"), a producer of customized graphics and an assembler and distributor of ADSI products. This investment should assist the Company to expand its international presence and benefit ADSI, which is 25% owned by the Company,  Management's aggressive growth plan, since the August 1990 acquisition of Sparks Exhibits Corp. ("Sparks"), has resulted in the dramatic expansion of the Company's client base, the development of new businesses and areas of expertise for expansion of its products and services, and the extension into major geographic markets in the United States and internationally. Management believes the acquisitions and the continuing development of new areas of expertise will position the Company to increase its revenue base and move toward its goal of becoming a leading exhibits and environments company through the continued offering of expanded products and services to a larger customer network.                                            9      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  1998 As Compared with 1997    Sales                                                                (in thousands)                                                                                    % increase                                                   1998               1997          (decrease)                                                   ----               ----          ----------        Revenue sources EDSI                                              $  400            $ 4,728           (92%) Trade show exhibits                               41,777             32,659             28% Permanent/scenic displays                         48,957             11,329            332%                                                 --------           --------           ----                           Total revenues        $ 91,134           $ 48,716             87%                                                 ========           ========           ====   Total Company revenues for 1998, as compared with 1997, increased by 87%, to $91.1 million from $48.7 million. Approximately 74% of the overall sales increase during 1998 was due to revenues generated by the December 31, 1997-acquired DMS, which is included as part of permanent/scenic displays revenues. Trade show exhibits generated $9.1 of the overall $42.4 million increase in total revenues for 1998 as compared with 1997 total revenues, reflecting the Company's continuing program of client expansion. Sales generated by EDSI amounted to $4.7 million during 1997 as compared with only $.4 million during 1998, due to the exchange of EDSI in connection with the acquisition of a minority interest in ADSI as of February 1, 1998 (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). Permanent/scenic displays, comprising DMS, Museum/ productions, Piper and the April 1998-acquired Scenic, experienced a $37.6 million increase in 1998 revenues as compared with 1997 revenues. Exclusive of the sales generated by the December 31, 1997-acquired DMS, total revenues for permanent/scenic displays increased during 1998 over 1997 revenues by 155%. This significant increase during 1998 was predominately due to Piper expanding its scope of services in themed environment projects and the revenues from Scenic. Sales and the related costs of operations generated by EDSI, formerly a consolidated 51% owned subsidiary of the Company, were recorded through January 31, 1998. Subsequent to the previously described exchange with ADSI, the Company recorded its pro-rata equity interest in ADSI's net profits using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, sales and related costs from EDSI's operations are not reflected in the Company's consolidated statement of operations subsequent to January 31, 1998.  Operating Profits  Operating profits more than doubled to $5,315,000 during 1998 from approximately $2,274,000 during 1997. The increase in 1998 operating profits occurred despite a 4.6% decrease in the gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, during 1998 as compared with 1997. This decrease is predominantly due to lower gross profit margins on sales generated by the December 31, 1997-acquired DMS. Due to the additional sales from DMS during 1998, a larger percentage of 1998 total revenues were generated by permanent/scenic displays. In addition to the lower gross profit margins relative to DMS, the Company experienced a lower gross profit margin on a specific museum project during 1998. This project was bid at a lower gross profit margin due to                                           10   its large size and the competitive environment surrounding the project. Also having a negative impact on the overall lower gross profit margin were the completion of certain themed-environment projects by the Company's Orlando-based, Piper. In an effort to expand its opportunities in themed-environment projects, the Company made investments in specialized production and installation techniques on these particular projects, which negatively impacted overall gross profit margins. While permanent/scenic displays contributed lower overall gross profit margins, the additional revenues they generated significantly contributed to the absorption of fixed overhead, selling, and general and administrative costs. Accordingly, the 4.6% lower gross profit margin percentage was more than offset by 5.8% lower selling and general/administrative costs, as a percentage of sales, during 1998 as compared with 1997 selling and general/administrative costs.  Other Income/(Expense)  Other expenses, net, increased $1.1 million during 1998 as compared with 1997 primarily due to interest expense attributable to term debt associated with the December 31, 1997 acquisition of DMS and the Company's utilization of its credit facility from a bank during 1998. Interest income during 1998 was less than 1997 interest income due to less cash being available for investment during 1998 as compared with 1997. Operating cash requirements for the December 31, 1997-acquired DMS and the Company's acquisition of property and equipment, particularly with respect to the Company's new management information system, also negatively impacted cash available for investment during 1998.  Income Taxes  The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, increased to approximately 38% during 1998 as compared with 24% during 1997. The 1997 rate reflects a benefit from the release of valuation allowances based upon the Company's expected ultimate realization of benefits from its business tax credit carryforwards.                                            11   Net Income  Net income increased to $2,820,631 ($.35 per diluted share) during 1998 from $2,003,316 ($.36 per diluted share) during 1997. This increase is attributed to the higher sales levels and related operating profits generated during 1998. Additionally, the tax provision during 1998, as a percentage of income before income taxes, increased to 38% from the 24% tax provision rate in 1997, as more fully described in the "Income Taxes" section of this MD&A. Exclusive of the effects of the different tax rates used to provide for income taxes, 1998 net income per diluted common share increased approximately 20% as follows:                                                            1998           1997                                                           ----           ----  Income before income taxes                          $4,550,000     $2,623,000  Tax rate, adjusted                                         40%            40%                                                    -----------    ----------- Tax (provision), adjusted                          (1,820,000)    (1,049,000)                                                    -----------    ----------- Net income, as adjusted                             $2,730,000     $1,574,000                                                     ==========     ========== Diluted shares outstanding                           8,140,000      5,640,000 Net income per diluted common share, adjusted            $0.34          $0.28                                                          =====          =====  Backlog  The Company's manufacturing backlog of orders as of December 31, 1998 was approximately $27.0 million as compared with $23.6 million as of December 31, 1997.                                          12      1997 As Compared with 1996  Sales                                                                   (in thousands)                                                                                      %                                                     1997            1996         increase                                                     ----            ----         --------        Revenue sources EDSI                                              $4,728          $3,095              53% Trade show exhibits                               32,659          27,844              17% Permanent/scenic displays                         11,329           7,377              54%                                                  -------         -------             ---                           Total revenues         $48,716         $38,316              27%                                                  =======         =======             ===   Total Company revenues for 1997, as compared with 1996, increased by 27% to $48.7 million from $38.3 million. Approximately thirty-eight percent of the overall sales increase during 1997 was due to revenues generated by permanent/scenic displays. Trade show exhibits generated forty-six percent of the overall $10.4 million increase in revenues during 1997, as compared with the same period during 1996. EDSI generated 16% of the overall $10.4 million sales increase during 1997 as compared with 1996 revenues.  Trade show exhibit revenues were higher during 1997 as compared with 1996 revenues reflecting the Company's program of client expansion, experienced in all three custom trade show exhibit manufacturing facilities--Philadelphia, Atlanta and San Diego.  EDSI experienced 53% growth in revenues during 1997 as compared with its 1996 revenues due to the increased acceptance of EDSI's product lines by ADSI's national distribution network.  Permanent/scenic displays experienced a 54% increase in its 1997 revenues compared with 1996. The increase was due to the increase in sales generated by Piper during the twelve months of 1997 as compared with Piper's nine months of operations during 1996. The Museum/production group, included as part of permanent/scenic displays, experienced a 17% decline in its 1997 revenues as compared with its 1996 revenues due only to the timing of sales.  Operating Profits  The 27% increase in 1997 revenues as compared with 1996 revenues contributed to a 69% increase in the Company's operating profits during 1997. The Company maintained a relatively consistent gross profit level of 28.4% and 28.1% during the respective annual periods of 1997 and 1996. Selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of sales, fell by approximately 0.8% during 1997 as compared with 1996, also contributing to the higher operating profits recorded during 1997.                                          13    Other Income (Expense)  Other income decreased from $1,344,000 during 1996 to $349,000 during 1997. This significant decrease in other income during 1997 is attributable to the $1.2 million gain from the contract amendment recorded during 1996. Interest income increased during 1997 as compared with 1996 due to higher available cash balances during 1997. Interest expense decreased during 1997 due to the overall reduction of the Company's long-term debt balances from 1996.  Income Taxes  The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, increased to approximately 24% during 1997 as compared with 13% during 1996. The higher 1997 rate as compared with the 1996 rate reflects a reduced benefit from the release of valuation allowances based upon the Company's expected realization of future benefits from its net operating loss and business tax credit carryforwards.  Net Income  During 1997, net income decreased to $2,003,000 ($.36 per diluted share) as compared with 1996 net income of $2,340,000 ($.45 per diluted share). The decrease is attributable to the $1.2 million gain from the contractual amendment recorded during 1996. Additionally, the tax provision during 1997, as a percentage of income before income taxes, increased to 24% from the 13% tax provision rate utilized during 1996, as more fully described in the "Income Taxes" section of this MD&A. Exclusive of the effects of the different tax rates used to provide for income taxes and the 1996 gain from the contractual amendment, 1997 net income per diluted common share increased approximately 65% as follows:                                                      1997             1996                                                     ----             ----  Income before income taxes                         $2,623,000       $2,690,000 Gain from contract amendment                             -         (1,200,000)                                                   -----------        ---------                                                     2,623,000        1,490,000 Tax rate, adjusted                                        40%              40%                                                   -----------        --------- Tax (provision), adjusted                         (1,049,000)        (596,000)                                                   -----------        --------- Net income, as adjusted                            $1,574,000         $894,000                                                   ===========       ========== Diluted shares outstanding                          5,640,000        5,246,000 Net income per diluted common share, adjusted           $0.28            $0.17                                                   ===========       ==========                                          14     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  During 1998, the Company's cash balance decreased by approximately $2.3 million. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in trade receivables as a result of the higher sales levels achieved during 1998 and the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets which increased primarily due to advances made by DMS to its suppliers for product and equipment during 1998. Accounts payable and accrued expenses at December 31, 1998 increased by approximately $4.3 million when compared with December 31, 1997 levels.  On February 1, 1998 the Company invested approximately $180,000 in cash and exchanged its 51% majority interest in EDSI to obtain a 25% minority interest in ADSI. On April 1, 1998, the Company acquired 100% of the stock of Steele for a cash payment of approximately $395,000, with the balance paid in Company common stock and a note to the seller of Steele. The Company invested $500,000 on August 1, 1998 to acquire a 20% equity interest in Abex Europe.  The Company expended approximately $2.75 million (exclusive of assets acquired in the Steele acquisition) during 1998 for capital assets, including $1.3 million for MIS hardware and software, $525,000 for rental assets, $150,000 for leasehold improvements, $375,000 for computer-aided design equipment and telecommunications systems and $400,000 for other machinery and office equipment.  The Company borrowed and repaid $2.68 million against its $6.5 million revolving credit facility during 1998 to support the higher levels of trade receivables. The Company expects to utilize the credit facility during 1999 to continue supporting the higher levels of inventory and trade receivables expected with higher sales levels. The first three principal payments totaling $1,012,500 and requisite interest payments against the Company's term loan were made during 1998 in accordance with the terms and conditions of its lending agreement. The Company was in compliance with its lending institution covenants as of December 31, 1998.  The December 31, 1998, current ratio remained relatively consistent at 1.5 : 1 with the December 31, 1997 current ratio of 1.7 : 1. Additionally, the Company's debt to worth ratio remained relatively constant, at 1.24 : 1 to 1.26 : 1, on the respective balance sheet dates of December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997.                                               15         OUTLOOK  Sales volume of $91.1 million contributed greatly to the higher operating profits achieved by the Company during 1998. The Company expects continued sales growth from trade show exhibits and permanent/scenic displays during 1999. The August 1, 1998 investment in Abex Europe was made to expand the Company's international presence as well as to provide Abex Display Systems, the Company's 25% minority-owned affiliate, an opportunity to more effectively market the Abex products throughout the United Kingdom and European markets during 1999 and beyond.  The planned expansion of the Company's Western Region has created the need for a significantly larger facility in the San Diego area. Accordingly, the Company has entered into a lease, effective the second quarter of 1999, for a new sales, production and storage facility in that area. The April 1, 1998 acquisition of Sparks Scenic Ltd. provides the Company with a presence in the San Francisco/Silicon Valley region of California as well as an additional support facility. The Company acquired expertise in the techniques of producing industrial and corporate theater events with its acquisition, which may be advantageously utilized in trade show exhibits. The Company expects to continue making additional investments in facilities, systems and personnel during 1999 within the Western Region. These expected investments may reduce the Company's short-term operating profits during 1999 as management continues to build the infrastructure necessary to expand its market share for trade show exhibits and permanent/scenic display opportunities.  The lower gross profit margins experienced in 1998 will continue during 1999 as sales increase from permanent/ scenic displays and store fixtures, whose historic margins are less than trade show exhibit margins. Additionally, DMS incurred additional costs in its effort to diversify its customer base during 1998. DMS's gross profit margins, as a percentage of sales, have been lower on sales to new customers during 1998 due to the increasingly competitive nature of the store fixture and display marketplace. This trend is expected to continue during 1999. The Company's trade show exhibit client base of Fortune 1000 companies, as well as its Pacific Rim clients, continue to tightly manage their marketing budgets, which may negatively impact the Company's historic custom trade show exhibit margins. However, the expected higher revenues and gross profit dollars from both trade show exhibits and permanent/scenic displays should continue to enhance the Company's 1999 operating profits by generating more consistent operating efficiencies within all facilities.  The Company switched to its new management information system during January 1999. As expected, the Company has experienced certain inefficiencies and transitional problems with respect to integrating the new system during the first quarter of 1999. However, management believes these expected transitional issues will be significantly resolved during the second quarter of 1999. Replacement of the existing management information system hardware and software with state-of-the-art technology was necessary to position the organization to effectively meet the changing environment of information processing among its clients and suppliers as well as year 2000 issues.                                           16    Management is not fully-satisfied with the Company's overall performance during 1998 and realizes certain areas require additional attention and resources during 1999. As the Western Region develops, the Company will continue to seek additional account executives and invest in appropriate sales support and infrastructure to create long-term growth opportunities. The Atlanta operation has not generated significant new sales volume opportunities due to the Company's inability to attract and retain experienced account executives. However, the Atlanta operation continues to profitably produce custom exhibit work transferred from other facilities. Management continues to review the most effective utilization of this facility. Management is also focused on securing additional museum projects for 1999 and 2000 production. However, to date, these efforts have not brought the expected sales results. Museum-related volume is critical in maintaining manufacturing efficiencies throughout all of the Company's production facilities. Similarly, management will continue to monitor the gross profit margins generated by the Orlando facility as it continues its expansion into specialized themed-environment projects and expected sales volume increases. Management is also monitoring DMS' client expansion program which negatively impacted 1998 gross profit margins and overall operating results when compared with DMS' 1997 pre-acquisition margins and related results of operations. While short-term investments in new clients are necessary to reduce DMS' reliance upon any one or two customers, management continues to seek lower-cost production methods from suppliers and sub-contractors, yielding higher profitability margins to the Company.  Management is committed to growing the Company internally, while aggressively seeking acquisition possibilities that meet synergistic and financial-structure requirements. By following this strategy, the Company hopes to achieve its objective of increasing shareholder value.  YEAR 2000 DATE CONVERSIONS           Readiness:  The Company is completing a major project of implementing "off-the-shelf" software on its business systems including a sales and marketing database, inventory and purchasing, finance and control, project management and costing, human resources and payroll, and fixed assets. All vendor supplied code is Year 2000 compliant. Management believes that this implementation will not have a material effect on customers or significant disruption of business operations.           Costs:  Year 2000 issues are part of the Company's overall management information system project, including hardware and Year 2000 compliant software. During 1997 and 1998, the Company has expended approximately $1.7 million for new hardware, software, consulting and system implementation, relative to its new management information system.                                              17            Risk and Contingency Plans:  Failure to complete implementation of the new management information system by the end of 1999 would represent the worst case Year 2000 scenario for the Company. At the present time, the Company believes that the implementation efforts will be completed as scheduled. Accordingly, the risks of material adverse consequences to the Company's results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition, as a result of its Year 2000 readiness, should be mitigated.  In the event that feasible manual procedures cannot be implemented in the case of a Year 2000 related failure, appropriate contingency plans will be developed.           Forward Looking Statements:  The foregoing Year 2000 discussion includes forward-looking statements of the Company's efforts and management's expectations relating to Year 2000 readiness. The Company's ability to achieve Year 2000 compliance and the level of incremental costs associated therewith could be adversely affected by the availability and cost of remediation in addition to vendors and customers abilities to install or modify IT and non-IT systems.  The cost of the Year 2000 project and the dates by which the Company plans to complete the Year 2000 modifications are based on management's best estimates. There can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially.  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", which will require that all derivative financial instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. SFAS No. 133 will be effective no later than for the Company's first quarter of 2000. The Company is evaluating the effects of this new statement and when to implement the new requirements. However, management currently believes the adoption of SFAS 133 will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operation, financial position or cash flows.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This report contains forward-looking statements. In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, there are certain important factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those included in such forward-looking statements. Some of the important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected include, but are not limited to: the Company's ability to continue to identify and complete strategic acquisitions to enter new markets and expand existing business; continued availability of financing to provide additional sources of funding for future acquisitions; capital expenditure requirements and foreign investments; satisfying any potential year 2000 issues with no material adverse effect on operations; the effects of competition on products, pricing, and, growth and acceptance of new product lines through the Company's sales                                            18   and marketing programs; changes in material prices from suppliers; uncertainties regarding accidents or litigation which may arise in the ordinary course of business; and the effects of, and changes in the economy, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, inflation and monetary fluctuations as well as fluctuations in interest rates, both on a national and international basis.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK            Market Risk:  Fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates do not significantly affect the Companys' financial position and results of operations. The existing bank term debt bears a fixed rate of interest, 6.15%, plus an applicable spread from 75 to 100 basis points, dependent upon the Company's capitalization ratio, measured on a quarterly basis. The Company's revolving credit facility bears a floating rate of interest, based on LIBOR rates, plus an applicable spread similar to the term debt requirements. The Company utilized approximately, $2.7 million of its $6.5 million revolving credit facility during 1998. The Company holds a 20% equity interest in a United Kingdom based trade-show exhibit Company. Accordingly, the Company's financial positions and results of operations will not be significantly affected should foreign exchange rates fluctuate.           Environmental:  The Company believes it is in compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. The Company has not been identified by federal or state authorities as a potentially responsible party for environmental clean-ups at any of its sites.           Litigation:  The Company is a defendant and counterclaimant in various lawsuits that arise out of, and are incidental to, the conduct of its business. These suits concern labor-related matters. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending suits and claims, the ultimate resolution of these matters should not have a material effect upon the financial position of the Company.
