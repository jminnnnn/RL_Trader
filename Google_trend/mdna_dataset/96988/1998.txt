ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  General Overview  The Company's core business is the custom design, manufacture and sale of sophisticated trade show exhibits, displays, signage and graphics for clients in industry, government, consumer electronics, athletic goods, healthcare, telecommunications and other specialized fields.  During March 1995, the Company and a Japan-based diversified manufacturing and marketing company, Tsubasa System Company Ltd. ("Tsubasa") entered into an agreement to organize a new Japanese corporation, Sparks Exhibits Japan ("SEJ"), and grant exclusive Japan distribution rights to SEJ for the Company's portable exhibits products and technology and to license the name and logo of "Sparks Exhibits" in Japan. See Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements.  During April 1996, the Company acquired Piper Productions, Inc. ("Piper") of Orlando, Florida which produces business theater, theme park attractions, themed interiors, theatrical scenery and special effects. The acquisition of Piper enhanced the Company's ability to pursue exhibit opportunities within Piper's areas of expertise. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.  On December 31, 1997, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary ("DMS"), acquired all of the partnership interests (the "Acquisition") in DMS Store Fixtures, L.P. ("L.P.") held by L.P.'s three principals and three corporate holders (the "Sellers", collectively). The aggregate consideration paid by the Company was $14,500,000 in cash and 2.25 million unregistered shares of the Company's common stock of which 250,000 shares are contingent upon DMS achieving at least $12.5 million of cumulative pre-tax earnings through December 31, 2002. The Acquisition was funded, in part, by a $13.5 million five year collateralized term loan through a bank and is accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of DMS were recorded at their estimated fair value as of December 31, 1997 with the difference of approximately $17.0 million including related acquisition costs recorded as goodwill and other assets. As part of the Acquisition, the Company entered into five year employment agreements with each of the three individual principals of L.P. commencing January 1, 1998.  Management's aggressive growth plan, since the August 1990 acquisition of Sparks Exhibits Corp. ("Sparks"), and most recent acquisition of DMS, has resulted in the dramatic expansion of the Company's client base, the development of new business groups for expansion of its products and services, and the extension into major geographic markets in the United States and internationally. Management believes the acquisitions and the continuing development of the new business groups will position the Company to increase its revenue base and move toward its goal of becoming a leading dimensional marketing company through the continued offering of expanded products and services to a larger customer network.                                            9    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  1997 As Compared with 1996  Sales  Revenues for 1997 of $48.7 million exceeded 1996 revenues of $38.3 million by approximately 27%.  The $10.4 million revenue increase during 1997 over 1996 revenues was attributable to sales increases from the reported business groups as follows:                                         1997                        1996                                        ----                        ----  Trade show exhibits group           $37,387,000                 $30,939,000 Permanent and scenic   displays group                     11,329,000                   7,377,000                                    ------------               -------------            Total revenues            $48,716,000                $38,316,000                                     ===========                ===========  The Trade show exhibits group experienced a 21% increase in its 1997 revenues compared with 1996. The increase reflects the Company's continuing program of client expansion which was experienced in all three custom trade show exhibit manufacturing facilities - Philadelphia, Atlanta and San Diego. The Rental group experienced higher 1997 revenues as compared with their 1996 revenues due to the Company's investments in their marketing efforts. Expose' Display Systems, Inc. ("EDSI"), the Company's majority-owned joint venture, experienced 53% growth in revenues during 1997 as compared with 1996 due to the increased acceptance of EDSI's product lines by Abex Display Systems, Inc.'s ("ADSI") national distribution network and the increasing impact of the 1996 introduction of EDSI's LS (laminate system) into the marketplace. Sparks' Portable sales group, a distributor of ADSI's products, experienced an expected 42% reduction in 1997 revenues as compared with 1996 revenues due to the closing of two stand-alone portable exhibit sales distribution offices during the fourth quarter of 1996.  The permanent and scenic displays group experienced a 54% increase in its 1997 revenues compared with 1996. The increase was due to a dramatic increase in sales generated by Piper during the twelve months of 1997 as compared with Piper's nine months of operations during 1996. Piper was acquired by the Company on April 1, 1996. The Museum/Production group experienced a 17% decline in 1997 revenues as compared with 1996 revenues due, only, to the timing of sales. The Museums/Production group currently has approximately $5.3 million of in-process contracts. Revenues related to these contracts should be recognized predominantly during 1998.                                           10    Operating Profits  The 27% increase in 1997 revenues as compared with 1996 revenues contributed to a 69% increase in the Company's operating profits during the respective periods. The Company maintained a relatively consistent gross profit level of 28.4% and 28.1% during the respective annual periods of 1997 and 1996. Selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of sales, fell by approximately 0.8% during 1997 as compared with 1996, also contributing to the higher operating profits recorded during 1997.  Other Income (Expense)  Other income decreased from $1,344,000 during 1996 to $349,000 during 1997. This significant decrease in other income during 1997 is attributable to the $1.2 million gain from the contract amendment recorded during 1996. Interest income increased during 1997 as compared with 1996 due to additional interest and gains from the sale of certain investments during 1997. Interest expense decreased during 1997 due to the overall reduction of the Company's long-term debt balances from 1996.  Income Taxes  The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, increased to approximately 24% during 1997 as compared with 13% during 1996. The higher 1997 rate as compared with the 1996 rate reflects a reduced benefit from the release of valuation allowances based upon the Company's expected realization of future benefits from its net operating loss and business tax credit carryforwards.  Net Income  During 1997, net income decreased to $2,003,000 ($.36 per diluted share) as compared with 1996 net income of $2,340,000 ($.45 per diluted share). The decrease is attributable to the $1.2 million gain from the contractual amendment which took place during 1996. Additionally, the tax provision during 1997, as a percentage of income before income taxes, increased to 24% from the 13% tax provision rate utilized during 1996, as more fully described in the "Income Taxes" section of this MD&A. Exclusive of the effects of the different tax rates used to provide for income taxes and the 1996 gain from the contractual amendment, 1997 net income per diluted common share increased approximately 65% as follows:                                                     1997                 1996                                                    ----                 ----        Income before income taxes                $2,623,000          $2,690,000       Gain from contract amendment                  --              (1,200,000)                                                 ----------         -----------                                                  2,623,000           1,490,153       Tax rate, adjusted                                40%                 40%                                                 ----------        ------------ Tax provision, adjusted                         (1,049,000)           (596,000)                                                 ----------        ------------       Net income, as adjusted                   $1,574,000          $  894,000                                                 ----------          ----------       Diluted shares outstanding                 5,640,000           5,246,000 Net income per diluted common share, adjusted        $0.28               $0.17                                                      =====               =====                                          11    Backlog:  The Company's backlog of orders at December 31, 1997 was approximately $23.6 million as compared with approximately $8.5 million as of December 31, 1996. Exclusive of the $5.6 million of DMS' backlog of orders at December 31, 1997, the $9.5 million increase in backlog is attributable to new orders generated through the Museums and International groups, EDSI and Piper and from experienced account executives with established client bases in the Company's core business - Custom trade show exhibits. The entire current backlog relates to expected 1998 sales.  1996 As Compared with 1995  Sales  Revenues for 1996 of $38.3 million, represents a 38.5% increase over 1995 revenues of $27.7 million. The $10.6 million increase during 1996 over 1995 revenues was attributed to sales increases from the reported business groups as follows:                                                        1996             1995                                                      ----             ----  Trade show exhibits group                         $30,939,000     $24,856,000 Permanent and scenic displays group                 7,377,000       2,816,000                                                   -----------     -----------          Total revenues                           $38,316,000     $27,672,000                                                   ===========     ===========   The Trade show exhibits group experienced a 25% increase in its 1996 revenues as compared with its 1995 revenues due to higher sales generated by the Rental, International and Expose' groups during 1996. Additionally, the Company's core business - custom tradeshow exhibits, experienced a 17% increase in its 1996 revenues over 1995 revenues reflecting the Company's continued program of client expansion. However, the increase was only experienced in the Philadelphia and San Diego facilities where 1996 revenues exceeded those facilities' 1995 revenues by 35%. The Atlanta and Melbourne, Florida facilities experienced a decline in their core business revenues during 1996 as compared with 1995 predominantly due to less work having been transferred into those facilities by the Philadelphia location during 1996. Accordingly, management consolidated the Melbourne, Florida facility into the Orlando-based Piper Productions facility during January 1997. The Rental groups' 1996 increase was partially due to being operational for the entire year as compared with four months of operations during 1995. The International group experienced higher 1996 revenues as compared with its 1995 revenues due to their start-up growth and the Company's investments in their marketing since 1993. EDSI, the Company's majority-owned joint venture, experienced 45% growth in revenues during 1996 as compared with 1995 due to the increased acceptance of EDSI's Expose' product line by ADSI's national distribution network and the 1996 introduction of EDSI's Expose' LS (laminate system) into the marketplace.                                          12    Sales,  continued  The $4.6 million revenue increase experienced by the Permanent and scenic displays group during 1996 as compared with 1995 revenues was primarily due to the April 1996 acquisition of Piper Productions in Orlando, Florida. The Piper operations generated approximately 75% of the 1996 revenues for the Permanent and scenic displays group, the balance generated by the Museum sales group whose sales were 41% higher during 1996 than its 1995 sales level.  Operating Profits  The Company recorded an 82% (approximately, $600,000) increase in operating profits during 1996 as compared with 1995. The 1996 gross profit percentage decreased marginally from a 1995 gross profit percentage of 2.1% to 28.1% during 1996. This decrease was primarily due to the higher 1996 sales from the Permanent and scenic displays group which historically generate lower gross margins than the Trade show exhibits group. The 1996 selling costs, $1.7 million higher as compared with the same period during 1995, were attributed primarily to sales commissions on the higher revenues and increased sales and marketing costs in connection with the development of the Company's three-year strategic marketing plan initiated in 1997. However, as a percentage of sales, selling costs were approximately 0.5% lower during 1996 as compared with 1995. General and administrative costs, as a percentage of sales, decreased approximately 1.3% during 1996 as compared with 1995. The higher sales levels and related gross profits more than offset the increased selling and general and administrative costs, contributing to the $600,000 increase in 1996 operating profits as compared with 1995 operating profits.  Operating profits related to the Expose' product during 1996 were consistent with 1995 operating profits. While there was a 45% increase in 1996 revenues over 1995 revenues, EDSI's operating profit margin decreased 2.1% in 1996 as compared with 1995. Pursuant to the July 1993 agreement with ADSI, the minority partner in EDSI, contractual cost allocations from ADSI to EDSI increased as sales from the Expose' products became a larger percentage of ADSI's overall sales to its distribution network. Accordingly, while EDSI sales increased, so did the allocated fixed, selling and administrative costs; this had a direct impact on EDSI's 1996 operating results. Additionally, EDSI incurred higher expenses during 1996 in connection with the introduction of its newest product line, Expose' LS.  During the fourth quarter of 1996, management closed the two stand-alone Portable sales offices due to their consistently marginal returns and the fixed costs associated with maintaining separate showrooms away from the Company's manufacturing facilities.                                           13    Other Income (Expense):  Other income increased by approximately $1,368,000 during 1996 as compared with 1995. This increase is attributed to the $1,200,000 gain the Company recorded during 1996 in connection with the contractual amendment more fully described in Note 4 to the consolidated statements. Net interest income improved by $124,000 during 1996 as compared with 1995 due to larger cash reserves available for investment. Other items generated a $46,000 positive swing during 1996 as compared with 1995 other items.  Income Taxes:  The provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before taxes, increased to 13% during 1996. The provision incorporates federal, state and local income taxes of approximately $350,000 as compared with an income tax benefit of $538,000 during 1995. This increase was due to higher 1996 taxable income and a smaller effective tax rate benefit resulting from the release of valuation allowances.  Net Income:  During 1996, net income increased to $2,340,000 ($.45 per diluted share) as compared with 1995 net income of $1,253,000 ($.32 per diluted share). The dramatic increase, however, is partially attributable to the 1996 gain from the contractual amendment of $1,200,000. Exclusive of the effects of this gain, earnings per diluted share for 1996 increased 70%, or $.07 per share ($0.17 during 1996 as compared with $0.10 during 1995) as follows:                                                       1996             1995                                                      ----             ----   Income before income taxes                       $2,690,000       $  715,000  Gain from contract amendment                     (1,200,000)           --                                                  -----------       ----------                                                    1,490,000          715,000  Tax rate, adjusted                                       40%              43%  Tax provision,adjusted                             (596,000)        (307,000)                                                  -----------       ----------  Net income, as adjusted                         $   894,000       $  408,000                                                  ===========       ==========  Diluted shares outstanding                        5,246,000        3,936,000  Net income per diluted common share, adjusted         $0.17            $0.10                                                       ======            =====  This increase included the dilutive effect of issuing 500,000 additional shares of the Company's common stock during 1996 in connection with the contract amendment (Note 4).                                           14     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      During 1997, the Company increased its cash reserves by $2,285,830, exclusive of the $1,529,260 of cash transferred to the Company as part of the December 31,1997 acquisition of DMS. As a result of the record sales levels achieved during 1997 and the increased backlog of orders not yet delivered as of December 31, 1997, the Company increased its accounts receivable and inventory balances by approximately $5.9 million, exclusive of the $ 4.9 million of DMS-acquired trade receivables and inventory. This increase, however, was offset by a $7.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, net of $1.9 million of DMS-acquired accounts payable and accrued expenses. This increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, exclusive of the DMS-related current liabilities, primarily relates to the $5.4 million increase in customer deposits collected against contracts not completed as of December 31, 1997 as compared with customer deposit balances as of December 31, 1996. Other current assets, exclusive of $558,000 acquired as part of the DMS acquisition, increased approximately $327,000 predominantly due to increases in prepaid expense balances as of December 31, 1997 as compared with December 31, 1996 balances.       The Company spent approximately $1.3 million for capital assets during 1997, net of $161,000 of property and equipment acquired in the DMS acquisition. These expenditures included $391,000 for machinery, equipment, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and other office equipment. Additionally, the Company invested approximately $400,000 for revenue-producing rental property and equipment and approximately $100,000 to upgrade its Computerized Assisted Design ("CAD") equipment. The Company is currently installing a new management information system ("MIS") to replace its existing computerized business system during 1998. As part of that investment, the Company expended approximately  $400,000 during 1997 for hardware systems, consulting, site preparation and training toward the installation of new technology.  During 1997, the Company did not borrow against its revolving credit facility to support the higher trade receivables and inventory levels, as well as the capital investments it required during the year. Additionally during 1997, the Company repaid approximately $623,000 of bank term debt and $75,000 of scheduled principal payments to various sellers of businesses acquired by the Company prior to 1997. During 1997, the Sellers of Sparks exchanged $283,877 of convertible term notes into 206,456 shares of the Company's common stock (see Note 2).      The December 31, 1997 acquisition of DMS (see Note 2) by the Company significantly impacted the balance sheet ratios from a historically-comparative perspective. The addition of approximately $17.0 million of intangible assets (goodwill and other assets) and $13.5 million of new term debt related to the Acquisition greatly increased the Company's leverage ratio of debt to net worth as well as the current ratio (current assets/current liabilities). Accordingly, comparative information to December 31, 1996 ratios are not meaningful and is, therefore, not presented in this discussion. As of December 31, 1997, the Company maintained a current ratio of 1.7 to 1.0 and a debt to net worth ratio of 1.26 to 1.00. The Company was in compliance with all lending institution covenants (see Note 10) as of December 31, 1997 and no amounts were outstanding on the $6.5 million revolving credit facility.                                            15     OUTLOOK  The record sales volume of $48.7 million greatly contributed to the higher operating profits the Company experienced during 1997. The Company expects continued sales growth from its Tradeshow exhibits group and Permanent and scenic displays group during 1998. Sales growth is expected in all four of the Company's manufacturing facilities in Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Diego and Orlando. The expected continuing expansion of the Company's Western region has created the need for a significantly larger facility in San Diego county. Accordingly, the Company is currently negotiating a lease for another sales and production facility, within the San Diego area, to be used as a low-cost producer of tradeshow and permanent exhibitry, in addition to being a major storage facility for client exhibit properties.     The Company's historic overall gross profit percentages may be difficult to maintain in light of the expected increase in 1998 sales volume from the Museum and production group, the Rental group and Piper, whose historic margins fall below traditional custom exhibit margins. Additionally, the Company's core business client base of Fortune 1000 companies, as well as Pacific Rim clients, are more tightly managing their marketing budgets which could negatively impact the Company's historic custom exhibit margins. The expected higher revenues and gross profit dollars from the Trade show exhibits group and the Permanent and scenic displays group should enhance the Company's 1998 operating profits by aiding the Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Diego and Orlando facilities to generate more consistent operating efficiencies.  The Company and ADSI are negotiating the exchange of the Company's 51% majority interest in EDSI, forgiveness of $1.1 million of inter-company debt plus approximately $200,000 of cash, for a 25% interest in ADSI. Should this transaction be completed, the Company's investment in ADSI will be accounted for using the equity method, with the Company no longer consolidating EDSI's revenues and expenses within its operating results. The Company will only recognize its pro-rata portion, 25%, of ADSI's operating results within its statement of operations.  The Company is continuing its project of replacing existing management information systems hardware and software with state-of-the-art technology positioning the organization to effectively meet the changing environment of information processing among its clients and suppliers as well as year 2000 issues. Additionally, the new technology should increase operating efficiencies between the Company's four regional manufacturing facilities as information is processed and managed more seamlessly. The Company now maintains a formal Management Information System ("MIS") Department staffed with two experienced professionals who are responsible to guide the Company in its acquisition and utilization of new hardware and software technology. The Company believes this necessary investment in technology, approximating $1.1 million during 1997 and 1998, will assist it in minimizing the need for additional administrative personnel as its sales growth continues.  Again, management is encouraged by the Company's overall performance during 1997 and realizes certain areas will continue to require additional attention and resources during 1998. While the Company's West Coast operation continues to build upon its progress from 1996 and 1997, the Company will seek additional account executives for the Western region to enhance the possibility of positive trends in sales and operating profits during 1998 and beyond. Conversely, the Atlanta operation continues to perform below expectations. While management                                           16     OUTLOOK, continued  remains encouraged by the contributions of the Rental group in the Atlanta facility during 1997, the Company's core custom exhibits group continues to suffer from an insufficient Atlanta client base to support the fixed costs of that operation, becoming increasingly dependent upon the transfer of custom exhibit work from the Philadelphia, San Diego and Orlando facilities. The Company will continue its search for experienced sales executives with an existing base of custom exhibit clients to contribute the additional sales volume which will assist in stabilizing the Atlanta operation.  Sparks Japan did not significantly impact 1997 operating margins through the limited production by EDSI of certain exhibit products for Sparks Japan clients. However, portable / modular exhibit sales in the Japan marketplace remain relatively new, requiring significant time and effort to introduce these products to Japanese exhibitors who have traditionally built and scrapped their exhibits for each trade show. Portable / modular exhibits, successfully marketed in the United States, can provide the Japanese exhibitor a large assortment of design capabilities while simultaneously offering reconfigurability and reusability for their future trade shows. Additionally, these exhibits provide the Japanese exhibitor an alternative to the environmentally-unfriendly practice of exhibit disposal. Any increase in Sparks Japan sales volume should benefit the sales volume of EDSI and ADSI since Sparks Japan features the Expose' and Exposure (ADSI's proprietary exhibit product) product lines in most of its sales efforts.  The December 31, 1997 acquisition of DMS (see Note 2) has significantly impacted the Company's balance sheet as of the acquisition date and will significantly impact the Company's future results of operations. The acquisition of DMS will further expand the Company's range of exhibit and display products, contributing toward its objective of becoming a world-class leader in dimensional marketing services. The competency and experience of the DMS management group should provide the Company a firm base to expand the DMS business within an extremely fragmented industry without needing significant additions to its management structure. DMS' operating history of over 50 years and their long-term customer relationships (one of DMS' two largest customers has purchased product from DMS for over 40 years) should contribute to the Company a relatively consistent stream of revenues, cash flow and profitability, which should translate into higher shareholder value.  By meeting the challenges outlined above, maintaining the highest standards for product quality and customer service, and, aggressively seeking acquisition possibilities within industries that meet management's financial and synergistic requirements, the Company will be positioned to take advantage of future opportunities.                                              17     YEAR 2000 DATE CONVERSIONS  The Company's management information system department is currently replacing its computer systems and applications necessary to position the Company to meet the changing environment of information processing including meeting year 2000 date conversion with no material effect on customers or disruption to business operations. These actions are necessary to ensure that the systems and applications will recognize and process the year 2000 and beyond. Major areas of potential business impact have been identified and conversion efforts are underway. It is expected that the total cost of compliance over the cost of normal software and hardware upgrades/replacements will not be material to the Company's results of operations.  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  Effective January 1, 1998 the Company will adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income". SFAS 130 establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. Reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes is required. The Company is in the process of determining its preferred format. The adoption of SFAS 130 will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" effective with the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1998. SFAS 131 establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to stockholders. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. Financial statement disclosures for prior periods are required to be restated. The Company is in the process of evaluating the disclosure requirements. The adoption of SFAS 131 will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
