ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         ---------------------------------------------------------------  GENERAL OVERVIEW  The Company's business is the custom design, production and sale of exhibits and environments for trade shows, museums, theme parks, themed interiors, arenas, corporate lobbies and retail stores for clients in industry, government, entertainment and commercial establishments.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  2002 As Compared With 2001  Net Sales - ---------                                                   (in thousands)  Revenue Sources                               2002                2001 - ---------------                               ----                ----  Trade show exhibits                        $44,711            $ 49,992 Permanent and scenic displays               26,471              26,980                                            -------            -------- Total                                      $71,182            $ 76,972                                            =======            ========  Total net sales of $71.2 million for 2002 decreased 8% from total net sales for 2001. Sales of trade show exhibits and related services decreased 11% primarily due to the loss of two trade show exhibit clients and generally weak economic conditions. Sales of permanent and scenic displays decreased 2%, which was the net result of lower store fixtures sales partially offset by higher permanent museum display sales.  Operating Profit - ----------------  Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 19.9% in 2002 as compared with 22.2% in 2001. This decrease was principally attributable to lower gross profit margins for store fixtures and to shifts in sales mix to lower margin sales categories. The DMS store fixtures business had an unfavorable impact on the Company's gross profit in 2002. However, while there can be no assurances, the decrease in gross profit margin is not expected to continue into 2003.  Selling expenses of $8.5 million decreased to 11.9% of net sales in 2002 from $9.8 million, or 12.7% of net sales in 2001. This decrease was largely due to higher permanent museum exhibit sales, which are subject to lower sales commission expense, and to lower commission expense for store fixtures sales.  Administrative and general expenses were reduced to $6.8 million in 2002 from $7.4 million in 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the adoption of a new accounting principle discussed below, which eliminated goodwill amortization in 2002. Goodwill amortization in 2001 was $0.8 million.  The Company reported an operating loss of $1.1 million for 2002 as compared with an operating loss of $0.1 million for 2001. The increase in operating loss was principally attributable to lower sales and the lower gross profit percentage in 2002.  The Company's DMS Store Fixtures business unit generated significantly lower operating profit (loss) in 2002 as compared with 2001. Based on these results and projections for 2003, an impairment loss of $176,000, included as a component of the operating loss, was recognized for the net book value of remaining long-term assets for this business unit.                                          8     Other Income (Expense) - ----------------------  Interest expense decreased to $0.4 million in 2002 from $1.2 million in 2001 as a result of lower borrowings and lower interest rates.  In the first quarter of 2002, management determined that the Company's investment in a portable tradeshow exhibit manufacturer was not recoverable, which resulted in an impairment loss of $1.2 million from investments in affiliates. A loss of $0.3 million was recognized in 2001 for a write-down of the Company's investment in its Sparks Europe affiliate.  Provision for (benefit from) income taxes - -----------------------------------------  The Company established a valuation allowance of $5.4 million for deferred income tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2002, principally related to a deferred income tax benefit in connection with the write off of goodwill recorded in the first quarter of 2002.  The Company also established a valuation allowance for the income tax benefit from the $1.2 million write down of investments in affiliates recorded in the first quarter of 2002 because this capital loss is not expected to be offset by capital gains within the required statutory period. The provision for income taxes recorded in the first quarter of 2002 also included a valuation allowance of $191,000 related to a 1999 capital loss incurred in connection with the Company's investment in a United Kingdom affiliate.  Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle - ---------------------------------------------------  In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial of Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142), which supercedes APB No. 17 "Intangible Assets". SFAS 142 requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings, but instead be reviewed for impairment. The Company adopted SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002. This new accounting standard requires a two-step test for operating units having unamortized goodwill balances. The first step requires a comparison of the book value of the net assets to the fair value of the respective operating unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is required to determine the impairment. This second step includes evaluation of other intangible assets, and any shortfall of the adjusted book value below fair value determines the amount of the goodwill impairment. Goodwill amortization expense was $0.8 million in 2001 and in 2000. The adoption of SFAS 142 reduced goodwill by $15.9 million and net income by $12.4 million (net of a $3.5 million income tax benefit) in the first quarter of 2002, identified as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. This impairment charge related to goodwill recorded in connection with the December 31, 1997 acquisition of DMS Store Fixtures, L.P. This charge differs from the previous accounting standard method, which was based on undiscounted cash flows, because the new method is based on fair value measurement estimates as of the measurement date.  Backlog - -------  The backlog of orders at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was approximately $19 million and $13 million, respectively. The backlog increase is principally attributable to a higher level of open orders for permanent and scenic displays and new customers. Generally, backlog of orders are recognized as sales during the subsequent six month period. The current backlog relates primarily to expected 2003 sales. The Company maintains a client base from which new orders are continually generated, including refurbishing of existing trade show exhibits stored in the Company's facilities.                                           9   2001 As Compared With 2000  Net Sales - ---------                                                        (in thousands) Revenue Sources                                 2001                  2000 - ---------------                                 ----                  ----  Trade show exhibits                          $ 49,992              $ 56,182 Permanent and scenic displays                  26,980                36,351                                              --------              -------- Total                                        $ 76,972              $ 92,533                                              ========              ========  Total net sales decreased $15.6 million, or 17%, in 2001 from the total net sales in 2000. The decrease was comprised of a $6.2 million, or 11%, decrease in sales of trade show exhibits and a $9.4 million, or 26%, decrease in sales of permanent and scenic displays. The decrease in sales of trade show exhibits was principally attributable to the loss of a customer's international tradeshow exhibit program and to reductions in many customers' trade show marketing budgets in response to a slower economy. In addition, the events of September 11, 2001 led to many convention and trade show cancellations, which reduced fourth quarter 2001 sales volume. The decrease in sales of permanent and scenic displays was primarily due to lower sales of permanent themed displays previously manufactured at the Company's Orlando, Florida operation. This manufacturing operation was closed and consolidated with the Company's Atlanta, Georgia production facility in the second quarter of 2001.  Operating Profit - ----------------  Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, of 22.2% in 2001 was essentially unchanged from 22% in 2000. Management took several actions to reduce fixed manufacturing overhead costs in 2001, which mitigated the impact of lower sales volume. One such action was the consolidation of the Company's Southeastern manufacturing operations.  Selling expense decreased $1.3 million to $9.8 million in 2001 from $11 million in 2000 due in large part to lower sales commissions resulting from lower sales volume. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses increased to 12.7% in 2001 from 11.9% in 2000. This percentage increase was largely the result of certain fixed selling expenses such as sales office facility expenses as compared with the lower sales volume in 2001. The Company continued to invest in sales office facilities in Orlando, Florida and in the San Francisco and Los Angeles, California areas.  Administrative and general expenses were reduced by $1.8 million to $7.4 million in 2001 as compared with $9.2 in 2000. This decrease was attributable to several factors, including bad debt provision recorded in 2000, the mutual termination of certain employment agreements in 2001, and staff and cost reduction initiatives implemented by management in 2001.  The Company had an operating loss of $115,000 for 2001 as compared with an operating profit of $60,000 for 2000. The 17% sales decrease, the closing of the Orlando, Florida manufacturing operation and a $0.7 million inventory reserve for a customer that filed for Chapter 11 reduced operating profit in 2001. A $1.4 million bad debt provision and a $0.6 million inventory reserve reduced operating profit in 2000.  Other Income (Expense) - ----------------------  Interest expense decreased by $213,000 in 2001 as compared with 2000 as a result of lower borrowings and lower interest rates.  A loss of $397,000 in 2001 from investments in affiliates was principally attributable to losses recognized for the Company's investment in a portable exhibit manufacturer.  Income Taxes - ------------  The benefit from income taxes, as a percentage of pre-tax losses, was 29% in 2001 as compared with 19% in 2000. This increase was due in large part to non-taxable income in 2001.                                           10   Backlog - -------  The Company's backlog of orders was approximately $13 million at December 31, 2001 as compared with $18 million at December 31, 2000. This decrease was largely due to a lower level of open orders for permanent and scenic displays.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  On May 16, 2002, the Company amended its Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the "Facility") with its bank to change from an Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") basis to an asset-based arrangement. The Facility provides for borrowings based on a percentage of qualified accounts receivable and a percentage of up to $6.7 million of qualified inventories. The Facility is collateralized by all the Company's assets and bears interest at rates based primarily on the London Inter Bank Offering Rate (LIBOR) plus 3.25%. The Facility includes certain financial covenants requiring a minimum tangible net worth and maintenance of certain financial ratios and restricts the Company's ability to pay dividends. Borrowings under this Facility were $4 million at December 31, 2002. The Company's borrowing capacity under the Facility was $7.5 million at December 31, 2002.  The Company was not in compliance with the minimum tangible net worth covenant of the Facility at December 31, 2002 primarily as a result of the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes. To cure this non-compliance, the Facility was amended on March 11, 2003 to reduce the minimum tangible net worth covenant from $7.8 million to $6 million, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2002. Based on the adjusted covenant requirement, it is probably that the Company will meet its minimum tangible net worth and other covenants during 2003. This amendment also reduced the maximum borrowing amount from $12 million to $8 million and changed the expiration date from January 1, 2004 to May 16, 2004.  The company's working capital decreased to $3.5 million at December 31, 2002 from $6.9 million at December 31, 2001 primarily due to lower accounts receivable for the Company's store fixtures business. The Company's DMS Store Fixtures business had an unfavorable impact on cash flows and the results of operations during 2002. Available cash and $3.7 million of cash generated from operations was used to reduce long-term debt by $2.6 million, and for capital expenditures of $1.3 million.  The Company has lease commitments for certain facilities under non-cancelable operating leases. Timing of future lease commitments as well as maturities of long-term debt are as follows:                                                                      (in thousands)                                       2003           2004           2005           2006           2007     After 2007                                       ----           ----           ----           ----           ----     ----------              Lease commitments                   $2,130         $1,968         $1,916         $1,804         $1,027         $9,543  Debt maturities                        128          4,000             --             --             --             --   The Company leases a facility from a partnership controlled by two shareholders of the Company. This lease, which contains a renewal option on May 14, 2009 and expires on May 14, 2019, requires minimum annual rent of $771,000 (included in the table above) at a fixed rate for the first 10 years, and the Company is responsible for taxes, insurance and other operating expenses.  In connection with the DMS Store Fixtures acquisition, employment agreements were made with two shareholders of the Company, which provided for guaranteed minimum annual payments of approximately $0.5 million. These agreements were mutually terminated in January 2001 eliminating the guaranteed minimum payments after February 2, 2001, which reduced administrative and general expenses by approximately $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2001.  On November 20, 2001, the Company issued 5,300,000 shares of its common stock and warrants expiring on November 19, 2011 to purchase 5,300,000 shares of its common stock for an aggregate of $2,650,000. This transaction was approved by the Company's shareholders at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on November 7, 2001. Costs incurred in connection with this transaction were $378,000.                                         11   On February 21, 2003, the Company announced that it had entered into a merger agreement with Redwood Acquisition Corp. ("Redwood"). Redwood is controlled by four members of the Company's executive management, who are stockholders and directors of the Company, and certain other of the Company's shareholders and employees. If the merger is completed, shareholders of the Company, other than the shareholders included in the Redwood group, will receive $.30 in cash for each outstanding share of the Company's common stock. The members of the Redwood group will own Marlton's business if the merger is completed. The completion of the merger is subject to specified conditions, including the approval of the Company's shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders following a distribution of a proxy statement. Members of the Redwood group hold approximately 50% of the Company's common stock.  OUTLOOK  The Company expects sales and margins of trade show exhibits and sales of permanent and scenic displays in 2003 to remain at approximately the same level as in 2002. In view of current economic conditions, the Company's trade show exhibit client base of Fortune 1000 companies is expected to closely manage their marketing budgets, which would inhibit the Company's trade show exhibit sales. The Company continues to explore new sales opportunities while pursuing operating efficiency improvements and cost reduction initiatives to mitigate the impact of flat sales volume.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  In May 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 145 "Rescission of FASB Statement No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections as of April 2002" ("SFAS 145"). SFAS 145 among other things, rescinds various pronouncements regarding early extinguishment of debt. It allows extraordinary accounting treatment for early extinguishment of debt only when the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions", are met. SFAS 145 provisions regarding early extinguishment of debt are generally effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 145 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS 146"). SFAS 146 addresses significant issues regarding the recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities, including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) has set forth in EITF Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company believes this Statement will not materially affect the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In November 2002, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation ("FIN") No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantors, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantors will also be required to meet expanded disclosure obligations. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 are effective for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for the Company's 2002 financial statements.  In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure-an amendment of SFAS No. 123" ("SFAS 148"). SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee and director compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. SFAS 148 is effective for the Company's 2002 financial statements. The Company adopted the disclosure-only provision of SFAS 123.                                           12   In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46") FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements," to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The disclosure requirements of FIN 46 are effective for financial statements issued after January 31, 2003. The initial recognition provisions of FIN 46 are applicable immediately to new variable interests in variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. For a variable interest in a variable interest entity created before February 1, 2003, the initial recognition provisions of FIN 46 are to be implemented no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of FIN 46 on its financial statements.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Financial statement preparation in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. One such estimate is possible losses in connection with financing accounts receivable. Management estimates these possible losses based on a review of the financial condition and payment history of specific customers having significant accounts receivable balances, and establishes a general reserve for the remaining accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience.  Revenues on trade show exhibit sales, themed interiors, custom store fixtures and point of purchase displays are recognized using the completed contract method. The Company's contracts are typically less than three months in duration. As a result, the Company's revenue recognition would not differ materially if another method were used. Progress billings are generally made throughout the production process. Progress billings which are unpaid at the balance sheet date are not recognized in the financial statements as accounts receivable. Progress billings which have been collected on or before the balance sheet date are classified as customer deposits and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.  Measurement of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment involves assumptions and estimates by management. The adoption of SFAS 142 requires estimates of fair values for certain operating units. These estimates involve discounted cash flow forecasts to determine the fair value of operating units having unamortized goodwill balances.  The evaluation of deferred income tax assets also involves managements estimates and judgment. Management considers several factors in this evaluation, including trailing three year financial performance history and future forecasts of operating income. A valuation allowance is established based on management's estimates about the recoverability of deferred income tax assets.  Other significant accounting policies are also important to the understanding of the Company's financial statements. These policies are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This report contains forward-looking statements. When used in this report, the words "intends," "believes," "plans," "expects," "anticipates," "probable," "could" and similar words are used to identify these forward looking statements. In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, there are certain important factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those included in such forward-looking statements. Some of the important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected include, but are not limited to: the Company's ability to continue to identify and enter new markets and expand existing business; continued availability of financing to provide additional sources of funding for capital expenditures, working capital and investments; the effects of competition on products and pricing; growth and acceptance of new product lines through the Company's sales and marketing programs; changes in material and labor prices from suppliers; changes in customers' financial condition; the Company's ability to attract and retain competent employees; the Company's ability to add and retain customers; changes in sales mix; the Company's ability to integrate and upgrade technology; uncertainties regarding accidents or litigation which may arise; the financial impact of facilities consolidations; uncertainties about the impact of the war in Iraq and the threat of future terrorist attacks on business travel and related trade show attendance; and the effects of, and changes in the economy, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, inflation and monetary fluctuations as well as fluctuations in interest rates, both on a national and international basis.                                          13    ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK          ---------------------------------------------------------  Fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates do not significantly affect the Company's financial position and results of operations. The Company's revolving credit facility bears a floating rate of interest, based on LIBOR rates plus 3.25%.  ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
