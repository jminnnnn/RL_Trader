ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL          CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - ----------------------------------------------------------      Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is incorporated herein by reference from the corresponding section of Exhibit 13.  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS       The information presented with respect to earnings growth, the Company's plans and objectives in moving toward fee based business and otherwise is forward looking information. Forward looking statements are the Company's current estimates or expectations of future events or future results. As such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results discussed in this Report.  These include variations in management projections or market forecasts and the actions that management could take in response to these changes.       The Company or its executive officers and directors on behalf of the Company, may from time to time make forward looking statements. When used in this report, any press release or oral statements, the words "estimate", "project", "anticipate", "expect", "intend", "believe", "plan", "goal", and words of like import are intended to identify forward looking statements in addition to statements specifically identified as forward looking statements. These statements, projections or future plans, could be affected by a number of factors that the Company is necessarily unable to predict with accuracy, including future changes in interest rates, general credit quality, economic activity, consumer behavior, government monetary policy, legislation and regulation, competition, credit, market and operating risk, and loan demand. In addition, the Company's future results of operations, discussions of future plans and other forward looking statements contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis and elsewhere in this Form 10-K involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including risks relating to the uncertainties created by the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999. As a result of variations in such factors, actual results may differ materially from any forward looking statements.  Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made.  The Company will not update forward looking statements to reflect factual assumptions, circumstances or events which have changed after a forward looking statement was made.  Government Monetary Policies       The Federal Reserve Board has the primary responsibility for United States monetary policy.  Its actions have an important influence on the demand for credit and investments and the level of interest rates and thus on the earnings of the Company.    Legislation and Regulation       The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999:  a)  Allows bank holding companies meeting management, capital and Community Reinvestment Act standards to engage in a substantially broader range of nonbanking activities than currently is permissible, including insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies;  b)  Allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks;  c)  Removes various restrictions that currently apply to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies; and  d)  Establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations.  The Modernization Act also modifies current law related to financial privacy and community reinvestment.  The new financial privacy provisions would generally prohibit financial institutions, including the Company, from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information to third parties unless customers have the opportunity to "opt out" of the disclosure.   Competition       The businesses in which the Company operates are very competitive. Competition is provided by both unregulated and regulated financial services organizations, whose products and services span the local, national, and global markets in which the Company conducts operations.       Savings banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions actively compete for deposits, and money market funds and brokerage houses offer deposit-like services.  These institutions, as well as consumer and commercial finance companies, national retail chains, factors, insurance companies and pension trusts, are important competitors for various types of loans.  Issuers of commercial paper compete actively for funds and reduce demand for bank loans.  For personal and corporate trust services and investment counseling services, insurance companies, investment counseling firms, and other business firms and individuals offer active competition.  A wide variety of domestic and foreign companies compete for processing services.  ITEM 7A.
