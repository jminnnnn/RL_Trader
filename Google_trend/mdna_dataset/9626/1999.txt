ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL - ----------------------------------------------------------          CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS          -----------------------------------      Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results  of operations is incorporated herein by reference from the corresponding  section of Exhibit 13.  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS       The Company or its executive officers and directors on behalf of the  Company, may from time to time make forward looking statements.  To the extent  that any forward looking statements are made, the Company is necessarily  unable to predict future changes in interest rates, economic activity,  consumer behavior, government monetary policy, legislation and regulation,  competition, and loan demand.  In addition, the Company's future results of  operations and other forward looking statements contained in "Management's  Discussion and Analysis" and elsewhere in this Form 10-K involve a number of  risks and uncertainties, including risks relating to Year 2000 and the  introduction of the Euro (in particular, the Year 2000 readiness of third  parties with which the Company does business).  As a result of variations in  such factors, actual results may differ materially from any forward looking  statements.  Some of these factors are described below.  References made to  the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a  further discussion of such factors. The Company disclaims any obligation to  update forward looking statements.   Government Monetary Policies       The Federal Reserve Board has the primary responsibility for United  States monetary policy.  Its actions have an important influence on the demand  for credit and investments and the level of interest rates and thus on the  earnings of the Company.  Legislation and Regulation       Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking  industry are frequently introduced in Congress, in the state legislatures and  before the various bank regulatory agencies.  Such changes could, among other  things, increase the Company's overhead and capital costs or reduce fees  charged by the Company or increase competition for banks.  The likelihood and  timing of any such changes and the impact such changes might have on the  Company and its subsidiaries, however, cannot be determined at this time.   20  Competition       The businesses in which the Company operates are very competitive.   Competition is provided by both unregulated and regulated financial services  organizations, whose products and services span the local, national, and  global markets in which the Company conducts operations.       Savings banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions actively  compete for deposits, and money market funds and brokerage houses offer  deposit-like services.  These institutions, as well as consumer and commercial  finance companies, national retail chains, factors, insurance companies and  pension trusts, are important competitors for various types of loans.  Issuers  of commercial paper compete actively for funds and reduce demand for bank  loans.  For personal and corporate trust services and investment counseling  services, insurance companies, investment counseling firms, and other business  firms and individuals offer active competition.  A wide variety of domestic  and foreign companies compete for processing services.  ITEM 7A.
