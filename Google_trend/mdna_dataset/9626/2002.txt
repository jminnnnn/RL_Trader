ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL          CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - ----------------------------------------------------------      Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is incorporated herein by reference from the corresponding section of Exhibit 13.  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  The information presented with respect to, among other things, earnings outlook, projected business growth, the outcome of legal, regulatory and investigatory proceedings, the Company's plans, objectives and strategies reallocating assets and moving into fee-based businesses, and future loan losses, is forward looking information. Forward looking statements are the Company's current estimates or expectations of future events or future results.       The Company or its executive officers and directors on behalf of the Company, may from time to time make forward looking statements. When used in this report, any press release or oral statements, the words "estimate", "forecast", "project", "anticipate", "expect", "intend", "believe", "plan", "goal", "should", "may", "strategy", and words of similar meaning are intended to identify forward looking statements in addition to statements specifically identified as forward looking statements.       Forward looking statements, including the Company's discussions and projections of future results of operations and discussions of future plans contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which are discussed herein, that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results. Forward looking statements could be affected by a number of factors that the Company is necessarily unable to predict with accuracy, including disruptions in general economic activity, the economic and other effects of the WTC disaster and the subsequent U.S. military action, lower than expected performance or higher than expected costs in connection with acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses, changes in relationships with customers, the ability to satisfy customer requirements, investor sentiment, variations in management projections, methodologies used by management to evaluate risk or market forecasts and the actions that management could take in response to these changes, management's ability to achieve efficiency goals, changes in customer credit quality, future changes in interest rates, general credit quality, the levels of economic, capital market, and merger and acquisition activity, consumer behavior, government monetary policy, domestic and foreign legislation, regulation and investigation, competition, credit, market and operating risk, and loan demand, as well as the pace of recovery of the domestic economy, market demand for the Company's products and services and future global political, economic, business, market, competitive and regulatory conditions.  This is not an exhaustive list and as a result of variations in any of these factors actual results may differ materially from any forward looking statements.       Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. The Company will not update forward looking statements to reflect facts, assumptions, circumstances or events which have changed after a forward looking statement was made.   24  Government Monetary Policies       The Federal Reserve Board has the primary responsibility for United States monetary policy.  Its actions have an important influence on the demand for credit and investments and the level of interest rates and thus on the earnings of the Company.  Competition       The businesses in which the Company operates are very competitive. Competition is provided by both unregulated and regulated financial services organizations, whose products and services span the local, national, and global markets in which the Company conducts operations.       Commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions actively compete for deposits, and money market funds and brokerage houses offer deposit-like services.  These institutions, as well as consumer and commercial finance companies, national retail chains, factors, insurance companies and pension trusts, are important competitors for various types of loans.  Issuers of commercial paper compete actively for funds and reduce demand for bank loans.  For personal and corporate trust services and investment counseling services, insurance companies, investment counseling firms, and other business firms and individuals offer active competition.  A wide variety of domestic and foreign companies compete for processing services.  ITEM 7A.
