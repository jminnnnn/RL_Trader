(13)%     (23)%       4%                                                                ====      ====      ====        Net Revenue. Net revenue increased 9% to $745.7 million in 2000 from $683.7 million in 1999, including a $22.4 million increase in revenue from McAfee.com. Net revenue decreased 31% to $683.7 million in 1999 from $990.0 million in 1998, including an $18.2 million increase in revenue from McAfee.com. The increase in net revenue from 1999 to 2000 is due to increases in new customer purchases and increases in customer renewals of product licenses, as well as continued acceptance of our support services. In addition, the increase also reflects positive results from our recent reorganization into four product groups, with four separate sales groups focused on selling their respective products . The overall increase in net revenue in 2000 occurred despite the adverse impact in the fourth quarter of our decision to transition to a sell-through model, which resulted in some of our distribution partners reducing their inventory levels, as described below. The decrease in net revenue from 1998 to 1999 is due to our decision to limit distributor orders in an effort to realign channel inventory levels as a result of Year 2000 concerns and increasing sales cycles for our products.       In December 2000, in light of the business decision by some of our distributors, including our largest distributor, to reduce inventory levels, and due to the unpredictability of demand in the distribution channel, we began a transition from a sell-in to a sell-through business model. Results reported for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2000, include a significant reduction to net revenue due to some our distribution partners' business decision to reduce their inventory levels by not replenishing their inventory and requesting returns                                         34    36  over and above their contractual rights.We expect to complete our transition to the sell-through model in the first quarter of 2001.       Product revenue includes revenue from product licenses and hardware. Product revenue increased 7% to $505.9 million in 2000 from $474.1 million in 1999. Product revenue decreased 43% to $474.1 million in 1999 from $831.4 million in 1998. The increase in product revenue from 1999 to 2000 is due to increases in new customer purchases and positive results from our recent reorganization into four product groups, with four separate sales groups focused on selling their respective products.       Services and support revenues include revenues from software support and maintenance contracts, education and consulting services, which are deferred and recognized over the related service period. Service revenues increased 14% to $239.8 million in 2000 from $209.6 million in 1999. Service revenue increased 32% to $209.6 million in 1999 from $158.7 million in 1998. The increase in services and support revenues resulted from growth in all categories of service revenues, principally due to the growth of our installed customer base and the resulting renewal of support and maintenance contracts.       Our future profitability and rate of growth, if any, will be directly affected by increased price competition, a maturing anti-virus market and an increasingly higher revenue base from which to grow. Our growth rate and net revenue depend significantly on renewals of existing orders as well as expanding our customer base. If our renewal rate or our pace of new customers slows, our net revenues and operating results would be adversely affected.       International revenue accounted for approximately 37%, 40%, and 36%, of net revenue for 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. The decrease in international net revenue as a percentage of net revenue from 1999 to 2000 was due to under performance in sales operations, changes in sales management, a slow down due to softening market conditions, and continued weakness of the Euro. To minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we use non-leveraged forward currency contracts. However, our future results of operations may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations or by costs associated with currency risk management strategies. Other risks inherent in international revenue include the impact of longer payment cycles, greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, seasonality due to the slowdown in European business activity during the third quarter, tariffs and other trade barriers, uncertainties relative to regional economic circumstance, political instability in emerging markets and difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international license revenue. Further, in countries with a high incidence of software piracy, we may experience a higher rate of piracy of our products.       Cost of Net Revenue. Cost of net revenue increased 21% to $152.5 million in 2000 to $126.5 million in 1999, and decreased 29% from $177.0 million in 1998. The increase in cost of net revenues from 1999 to 2000 was primarily due to the increase in net revenue. From 1998 to 1999, the decrease in cost of net revenues was primarily due to the decrease in net revenue.       Our cost of product revenue consists primarily of the cost of media, manuals and packaging for products distributed through traditional channels, royalties, and with respect to hardware based Sniffer and E-ppliance products, computer platforms and other hardware components. Cost of product revenues increased 29% to $114.4 million in 2000 from $88.7 million in 1999. From 1998 to 1999, cost of product revenues decreased 35% from $137.4 million in 1998. The increase in product cost of revenue from 1999 to 2000 was primarily due to an increase in product revenues. The decrease in cost of product revenues from 1998 to 1999 was primarily due to a corresponding decrease in product revenues. As a percentage of net product revenue, cost of product revenue was 23% in 2000, 19% in 1999, and 17% in 1998.       Cost of services and support revenue consists principally of salaries and benefits related to employees providing customer support and consulting services. In 2000, the cost of services and support revenue increased 1% to $38.1 million from $37.7 million in 1999. From 1998 to 1999, cost of services and support revenue decreased 5% to $37.7 million from $39.7 million in 1998. Costs remained relatively flat in 1999 and 2000. Cost of services and support revenue as a percentage of net services and support revenue was 16% in 2000, 18% in 1999, and 25% in 1998.                                          35    37       To the extent that the percentage of our net revenue, which is generated through traditional distribution channels, increases, our cost of net revenue will increase.* In future periods, we expect that cost of product revenue will increase in absolute terms and as a percentage of net revenue in conjunction with an expected increase in the number of hardware based products sold by us.*       Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits for our development and technical support staff. Excluding the effects of stock-based compensation of $1.9 million and $4.5 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, research and development expenses increased 16% to $171.6 million in 2000 from $148.2 million in 1999. Research and development expenses increased from 1999 to 2000 due to the increase in staffing and equipment expense to support growth in our product and service offerings. From 1998 to 1999, excluding the effects of stock-based compensation in 1999, research and development expenses increased 9% from $135.5 million. These increases were primarily due to the increase in staffing and equipment expense to support growth in our product and service offerings. As a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 23% in 2000, 22% in 1999, and 14% in 1998. We anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars, but may fluctuate as a percentage of net revenue.*       We believe that our ability to maintain our competitiveness will depend in large part upon our ability to enhance existing products, develop and acquire new products and develop and integrate acquired products. The market for computer software is characterized by low barriers to entry and rapid technological change, and is highly competitive with respect to timely product introductions. The timing and amount of research and development expenses may vary significantly based upon the number of new products and significant upgrades under development and products acquired during a given period.*       Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salary, commissions and benefits for marketing, sales and customer support personnel and costs associated with advertising and promotions. Excluding the effects of stock-based compensation of $4.6 million and $7.2 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, marketing and sales expenses increased 9% to $400.5 million from $367.3 million in 1999. From 1998 to 1999, excluding the effect of stock-based compensation in 1999, marketing and sales expenses increased 25% from $294.8 million in 1998. These increases were primarily due to continued investment in the marketing of our products and services, hiring and training of our enterprise level sales force, and advertising and promotions for McAfee.com. As a percentage of net revenue, marketing and sales expense was 54% in 2000, 55% in 1999, and 30% in 1998. We anticipate that marketing and sales expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars, but will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net revenue.*       General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist principally of salary and benefit costs for administrative personnel and general operating costs. Excluding the effect of stock-based compensation of $2.3 million and $3.9 million for 2000 and 1999, respectively, general and administrative expenses decreased 21% to $98.1 million in 2000 from $124.7 million. In 1999, we recorded charges to cover $31.8 million in doubtful accounts, the development of our E-commerce business systems, expansion of our IT infrastructure and the implementation of our new SAP Human Resources module. In 2000, we recorded a charge of $15.8 million for accounts receivable for which collection is doubtful. From 1998 to 1999, excluding the effects of stock-based compensation in 1999, general and administrative expenses increased 49% from $83.9 million in 1998 for the above mentioned events. As a percentage of net revenues, general and administrative expenses were 14%, 19%, and 8% in the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION       We expensed $8.7 million and $15.6 million in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Stock-based compensation charges relate to the repricing of employee stock options and the issuance of McAfee.com stock options to our executives and employees. We do not expect to incur charges related to these McAfee.com option grants in  - ---------------  * This statement is forward looking statement reflecting current expectations.   There can be no assurance that our actual performance will meet our current   expectations. See "Risk Factors" discussion beginning on page 12 of this   document.                                         36    38  the future. However, we do expect significant stock-based compensation charges related to repriced employee stock options.       On April 22, 1999, we offered to substantially all our employees, excluding executive officers, the right to cancel certain outstanding stock options and receive new options with exercise prices at the current fair value of the stock. Options to purchase a total of 10.3 million shares were canceled and the same number of new options were granted at an exercise price of $11.063, which was based on the closing price of our common stock on April 22, 1999. The new options vest at the same rate that they would have vested under previous option plans. As a result, options to purchase approximately 3.4 million shares at $11.063 were vested and outstanding at December 31, 2000.       In accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," we recorded an initial stock-based compensation charge in connection with this repricing. This charge was calculated based on the difference between the exercise price of the new options and their market value on the date of acceptance by employees. Approximately $6.7 million were expensed in the twelve months ended December 31, 2000, respectively.       As a result of the introduction of FIN 44, stock options repriced by us on April 22, 1999 are subject to variable plan accounting treatment from July 1, 2000. Accordingly, we have and will continue to remeasure compensation costs for the repriced options until the options are exercised, forfeited or canceled without replacement. The first valuation period began with the effective date of FIN 44 which was July 1, 2000. The valuation has and will be based on any excess of the closing stock price at the end of the reporting period or date of exercise, forfeiture or cancellation without replacement, if earlier, over the fair value of our common stock on July 1, 2000, which was $20.375. The resulting compensation charge to earnings will be recorded over the remaining vesting period, using the accelerated method of amortization discussed in FASB Interpretation No. 28. When options are fully vested, the charge will be recorded to earnings immediately. Depending upon movements in the market value of our common stock, this accounting treatment may result in significant additional compensation charges in future periods.       In addition, variable plan accounting as described above, applies to options issued to employees of McAfee.com and myCIO.com as a replacement for our options which were subject to the repricing described above. As a result, we will record variable charges based on the movements in the fair value of McAfee.com and myCIO.com common stock from July 1, 2000.       As a result, during 2000, we recorded a compensation charge to earnings of approximately $2.0 million. As of December 31, 2000, we, McAfee.com and myCIO.com had options, outstanding and subject to variable plan accounting, amounting to 4.5 million, 0.1 million, and 0.3 million, respectively.       Amortization of Intangibles. We expensed $66.3 million, $58.4 million, and $43.2 million of amortization related to intangibles in the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Intangibles consist of purchased goodwill and certain acquired technology. The increase in amortization in 2000 was primarily a result of the amortization of the additions to goodwill related to McAfee.com's acquisitions during 2000. In addition, in accordance with its accounting policy our subsidiary, McAfee.com, performed a review of the carrying of the goodwill associated with one of its acquisitions and recognized an impairment charge of $3.6 million. The impairment charge was recorded as a result of McAfee.com's year-end review of technology acquired in the year 2000 and an assessment of its future potential. McAfee.com determined that certain storage technology purchased as part of the original acquisition was not to be incorporated into future products as a result of the nonviable Internet advertising business model. Accordingly the full carrying value of the unamortized goodwill and purchased technology was written off. The increase in amortization in 1999 related to a full year of amortization of intangibles that resulted from the 1998 acquisitions of Magic Solutions, Inc., and CyberMedia.                                          37    39  ACQUISITION AND OTHER RELATED COSTS       The following table is a summary of acquisitions by the Company in the three years ended December 31, 2000:                                                         COMMON STOCK                                                       ISSUED IN            PURCHASE PRICE OF                                                  POOLING OF INTERESTS    PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS                                                  --------------------    ---------------------      2000 McAfee.com acquisitions........................                             $ 22.3 million 1999 - - none - 1998 Syscon.........................................        1,230 shares Nordic.........................................       30,508 shares Magic Solutions................................                             $140.3 million TIS............................................    6,755,540 shares Secure.........................................      567,000 shares CSB............................................        9,815 shares QA.............................................      305,557 shares Anyware........................................      228,204 shares Dr. Solomon's..................................   15,813,142 shares CyberMedia.....................................                             $174.3 million   PURCHASE COMBINATIONS       McAfee.com completed two acquisitions for total consideration, including the issuance of approximately 550,000 of its Class A common stock, valued at approximately $22.3 million. The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the total combined purchase price was approximately $22.3 million, including transaction costs. McAfee.com analyzed the intangible assets to determine whether any amount should be recorded as in-process research and development, however McAfee.com determined that the acquired technologies and products are largely dependent on the core technology and that new versions are released frequently and contain incremental rather than fundamental improvements. Based on this analysis $22.3 million was recorded as goodwill and purchased technology, and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over three years.       In December 2000, in accordance with its accounting policy, McAfee.com, performed a review of the carrying of the goodwill associated with one of it's acquisitions and recognized an impairment charge of $3.6 million. McAfee.com performed a review of the carrying value of the goodwill as it had been assessed that McAfee.com would not use the technology purchased as part of the original acquisition. Accordingly the full value of the unamortized goodwill was written off. The historical operations of these acquisitions were not material to the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.       Network Associates, Inc. made no acquisitions in 2000 and 1999.       The following table summarizes the activity during the year ended December 31, 1999, in the reserves for acquisition and other costs established in the second and third quarters of 1998 (in thousands):                                             DIRECT                              ASSET                                        TRANSACTION   SEVERANCE     LEASE     WRITE                                           COSTS      & BENEFITS    COSTS     DOWNS     OTHER     TOTAL                                        -----------   ----------   -------   -------   -------   --------              Balance, December 31, 1998...........    $ 9,900      $ 8,338     $ 5,508   $ 1,405   $ 2,144   $ 27,295 Paid out or charged against the   related assets.....................

All expenditures related to these accruals have been completed and an additional expense, $254,000, was charged to acquisition and related charges.       In connection with the acquisitions accounted for as poolings of interests, we incurred direct transaction costs and other restructuring and related charges in the amount of $85.8 million in the year ended December 31, 1998. In connection with the acquisitions accounted for as purchase transactions, we incurred charges of $49.8 million in the year ended December 31, 1998, consisting principally of the write-off of acquired in-process research and development. The following is a summary of these charges together with charges for certain restructuring activities taken by us during the year ended December 31, 1998 (in thousands):                                                                       LEASE COSTS                                                                     AND ASSET                                        DIRECT         SEVERANCE       WRITE      IN-PROCESS                                   TRANSACTION COSTS   & BENEFITS      DOWNS         R&D       OTHER    TOTAL                                   -----------------   ----------   -----------   ----------   -----   --------              TIS.............................       $15,023         $ 3,818       $ 4,414      $    --     $(924)  $ 22,331 Dr. Solomon's...................        19,898          11,425        18,312           --         0     49,635 Secure..........................           500             500         1,200           --       100      2,300 Magic...........................            --              --            --       27,014        --     27,014 CyberMedia......................            --              --            --       22,830        --     22,830 Restructuring Costs -- Q2.......            --          11,318         8,644           --       610     20,572 Restructuring Costs -- Q3.......            --           3,285           370           --        --      3,655 Reversal of excess reserves.....

Lease costs and asset write downs include the costs of closing approximately 33 facilities throughout the world ($12.2 million), the disposal of excess and obsolete assets (primarily computer equipment which did not comply with our standards ($12.0 million), and the write-off of goodwill and intangibles associated with discontinued Dr. Solomon's products ($4.8 million). The Dr. Solomon's write-off related to two minor products which we discontinued and which had no sales subsequent to the Dr. Solomon's acquisition.       The severance and benefits charges related to company-wide reductions in workforce following our major acquisitions in the second and third quarters of 1998 of approximately 784 employees of which 107 were in research and development functions, 302 were in sales and marketing functions and the remainder were in administrative and other support functions. Substantially all terminated employees left our employment in the period the related accounting charge was recorded. We retained a limited number of employees from each                                          39    41  acquisition for short transition periods. The cost of these employees was charged to operating expenses during the transition period.       The lease costs represent an estimate of lease expense during the period prior to re-leasing the property together with losses on subleases, if any. The leased facilities were substantially vacated in the period in which the related accounting charges were recorded. The costs related to any facilities, which we used during this period, were charged to operations. However, these charges were not material. Asset write downs, exclusive of the intangible assets of Dr. Solomon's described above, comprised $5.6 million in losses on company owned buildings (which were written down to estimated values) and $10.3 million in net losses of computer and other miscellaneous assets. In general, this equipment was discarded or sold for nominal value. Due to the immediate consolidation of facilities, depreciation allocable to these facilities and the related assets, during the transition period, was not material. All the facilities acquired in our 1998 acquisitions identified for closure have been disposed of or subleased as of December 31, 1999.       The in-process research and development costs comprise approximately $22.8 million and $27.0 million in connection with the acquisitions of CyberMedia in the three months ended September 30, 1998 and Magic Solutions in the three months ended June 30, 1998, respectively. The following is a summary of the projects acquired and the assumptions used in determining the value of the in-process research and development costs.    CyberMedia:       The ongoing projects at CyberMedia at the time of the purchase included upgrade versions of four products (First Aid 6.0 and 7.0, UnInstaller 6.0, Guard Dog 3.0, and Oil Change 3.0) as well as work on technologies to be used in two of the our projects (a replacement product for PC Medic and McAfee Office). These upgrades will include new interfaces with the Internet, enhanced use of Active-X controls and Java and enhanced user interfaces. At the date we acquired CyberMedia, we estimated that, on average, 42% of the development effort had been completed and that the remaining 58% of the development effort would take approximately 12 months to complete and would cost $2.7 million. The efforts required to complete the development of these projects principally relate to additional design efforts to integrate the technologies into our line of products, finalization of coding, and completion of prototyping, verification, and testing activities required to establish that products associated with the technologies can be successfully introduced. The value of the in-process technologies was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to products, including costs to complete the development of the technologies or products, and the future net revenues that may be earned from the products, excluding the value attributed to integration with our products or that may have been achieved due to efficiencies resulting from the combined sales force or the use of our more effective distribution channel. In conformity with the SEC's revised guidelines for accounting for in-process technologies, these cash flows were discounted back to their net present value using a discount rate of 28% (which represents a premium of approximately 5% over our average weighted cost of capital) and excluding the value attributable to the use of the in-process technologies in future products. As of December 31, 1999, the projects related to this acquisition were completed.    Magic Solutions:       The ongoing projects at Magic Solutions at the time of the purchase comprised an upgrade version of Support Magic 4.0, Magic Solutions current product. This upgrade, known as Merlin Enterprise, represents new technologies with significant enhanced functionality, including increased scalability, a 32-bit browser-based technology, an enhanced user interface and integrated management features. At the date we acquired Magic Solutions, we estimated that, on average, 80% of the development effort had been completed and that the remaining 20% of the development effort would take approximately 12 months to complete and would cost $1.8 million. The efforts required to complete the development of these projects principally relate to additional design efforts to integrate the technologies into our line of products, finalization of coding, and completion of prototyping, verification, and testing activities required to establish that products associated with the technologies can be successfully introduced. The value of the in-process technologies was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to products, including costs to complete the development of the technologies or products, and the future net revenues that may be earned from the products, excluding the value attributed to                                         40    42  integration with our products or that may have been achieved due to efficiencies resulting from the combined sales force or the use of the our more effective distribution channel. In conformity with the SEC's revised guidelines for accounting for in-process technologies, these cash flows were discounted back to their net present value using a discount rate of 28% (which represents a premium of approximately 5% over our average weighted cost of capital) and excluding the value attributable to the use of the in-process technologies in future products. As of December 31, 1999, the projects related to this acquisition were completed.       Interest and Other Income. Interest and miscellaneous income increased to $42.0 million in 2000 from $30.7 million in 1999 and decreased from $33.3 million in 1998. Interest and other income increased from 1999 to 2000 due to an increase in higher average cash balances invested at slightly higher interest rates. From 1998 to 1999, interest income decreased due to the reduced cash balances resulting from the acquisitions of Magic and CyberMedia and cash used to fund operating activities during the year.       Interest and Other Expense. Interest and other expense increased to $18.2 million in 2000 from $17.3 million in 1999 and from $15.2 million in 1998. Interest and other expense remained flat in 2000. Interest and other expense remained relatively flat from 1998 to 1999.       Gain (Loss) on Investments. In 2000, we recognized a total gain of $30.4 million on the sale of our venture and strategic investments, including a gain on the sale of shares of Network Associates Japan, amounting to $11.9 million. This gain is offset by a $10.0 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2000 related to an other than temporary decline in the value of certain of our venture and strategic investments. This decline was based on the likelihood that the related company would have insufficient cash flows to operate for the next twelve months. In 1999 and 1998, we recognized a loss of $3.6 million and a gain of $0.2 million, respectively from sale of marketable securities. Additionally, we recognized a loss of $2.5 million on the liquidation of our Direct Web investment.       Provision for Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes was $9.9 million, $29.2 million, and $101.7 million in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2000, 1999, and 1998 was 10%, 22%, and 74%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 1999 to 2000 was primarily attributable to a decrease in non-deductible acquisition related expenses, and a decrease in foreign earnings subject to taxation in foreign jurisdictions. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 1998 to 1999 was primarily due to the losses incurred in 1999, and a decrease in non-deductible acquisition related expenses.       The valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets increased from 1999 to 2000, as well as, from 1998 to 1999. The increase was due to increased uncertainty of the Company's ability to utilize certain deferred tax assets primarily foreign tax credits.       If we cease to own at least 80% of McAfee.com's outstanding common stock, we may be required to include in our consolidated federal taxable income an amount equal to the excess of the cumulative McAfee.com net operating losses absorbed in our prior year consolidated tax returns over our tax basis in McAfee.com. As of December 31, 2000, there were no excess amounts.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       At December 31, 2000, we had $275.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $418.6 million in marketable securities, for a combined total of $694.1 million.       Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $26.7 million, $(18.1) million and $94.0 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2000 consisted primarily of net loss before depreciation and amortization, bad debt expense, stock-based compensation charge, and interest on our debentures offset by deferred taxes and gain on sale of investments. In addition, there were decreases in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred revenue, which amounts were offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. Net cash used in operating activities in 1999 consisted primarily of net loss before depreciation and amortization, bad debt expense, stock-based compensation charge, interest on our debentures, realized loss on investments, and deferred taxes. In addition, there were decreases in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, which amounts were offset by a decrease in deferred revenue. Net                                         41    43  cash provided by operating activities in 1998 consisted primarily of net income before acquired in-process research and development, depreciation and amortization and interest on our debentures as well as an increase in deferred revenue and the tax benefit from exercise of non-qualified stock options. Increases in accounts receivable and prepaid and other assets and decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities offset these factors.       Our accounts receivable balance as a percentage of sales may increase due to our increased emphasis on server/enterprise based sales and expanding international sales, both of which typically have longer payment terms. Additionally, our receivable collection has become more dependent on the longer payment cycle for VARs, distributors and system integrators. To address this increase in accounts receivable and to improve cash flow, we may from time to time take actions to encourage earlier payment of receivables and sell receivables. To the extent that our accounts receivable balance increases, we will be subject to greater general credit risks with respect thereto.       Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $10.4 million, $(173.8) million and $(316.8) million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, primarily reflecting purchases of marketable securities and additions to fixed assets. In 2000, we obtained proceeds of $36.8 million and $11.9 million from our sale of Goto.com shares and the sale of less than 5% of the shares of our Japanese subsidiary, Network Associates Japan, respectively.       Net cash used in financing activities was $(39.4) million in 2000 consisting primarily of the repurchase of our common stock which represented approximately $100.4 million. The repurchases of our common stock were slightly offset by proceeds associated with the exercise of non qualified stock options and the sale of put options. Net cash provided by financing activities was $96.6 million in 1999 consisting primarily of the proceeds from McAfee.com's initial public offering as well as proceeds associated with the exercise of non- qualified stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities was $489.8 million in 1998 and consisted primarily of the proceeds associated the issuance on the debentures noted above together with proceeds from the exercise of non-qualified stock options.       As discussed above, in December 2000, in light of the business decision by some of our distributors, including our largest distributor, to reduce inventory levels and due to the unpredictability of demand in the distribution channel, we began a transition from a sell-in to a sell-through business model. We expect that our transition to the sell-through model will be completed in the first quarter of 2001. In addition, some of our distributors are experiencing financial difficulties worldwide. These factors may adversely impact our collection of accounts receivable from our distributors in 2001.       In February 2001, we settled all outstanding put options for a payment of approximately $53.8 million.       As discussed below, in February 2003 we may be required to use a significant portion of our cash balances to redeem our outstanding zero coupon debentures.       We believe that our available cash and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months.*  EURO       On January 1, 1999, the "Euro" was introduced. On that day, the exchange ratios of the currencies of the eleven countries participating in the first phase of the European Economic and Monetary Union were fixed. The Euro became a currency in its own right and the currencies of the participating countries, while continuing to exist for a three-year transition period, are now fixed denominations of the Euro. The conversion to the Euro will have significant effects on the foreign exchange markets and bond markets and is requiring significant changes in the operations and systems within the European banking industry. Our information  - ---------------  * This statement is forward looking statement reflecting current expectations.   There can be no assurance that our actual performance will meet our current   expectations. See "Risk Factors" discussion beginning on page 12 of this   document.                                         42    44  system is designed to accommodate multi-currency environments. As a result, we have the flexibility to transact business with vendors and customers in either Euro or traditional national currency units.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT       The following discussion about our risk management activities includes "forward-looking statements" that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.       As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Historically, our primary exposures related to nondollar-denominated sales and operating expenses in Japan, Canada, Australia, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. We have recently expanded our business activities in Europe. As a result, we expect to see an increase in exposures related to nondollar- denominated sales in several European currencies. At the present time, we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and do not generally hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The success of this activity depends upon estimates of transaction activity denominated in various currencies, primarily the Euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, and certain European currencies. To the extent that these estimates are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses.       We maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers, types and maturities. These securities are classified as available-for-sale, and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading.       We also maintain minority investments in non-publicly traded companies. These investments amounting to $18 million are carried at cost less reductions for other-than-temporary impairments. Reasons for reductions for other-than-temporary impairments include but are not limited to, decline in value as if the related company would have insufficient cash flow to operate for the next twelve months.       The following tables present the hypothetical changes in fair values in the securities held at December 31, 2000 that are sensitive to the changes in interest rates. The modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS over six and twelve-month time horizons. Beginning fair values represent the market principal plus accrued interest and dividends at December 31, 2000. Ending fair values are the market principal plus accrued interest, dividends and reinvestment income at six and twelve month time horizons.

The debentures, with an aggregate face amount at maturity of $885.5 million, generated net proceeds to us of approximately $337.6 million (after deducting the fee paid to the initial purchaser of our debentures, but no other expenses of the placement). The initial price to the public for our debentures was $391.06 per $1,000 of face amount at maturity, which equates to a yield to maturity over the term of the bonds of 4.75% (on a semi-annual bond equivalent basis). The debentures are convertible into common stock at the rate of 8.538 shares per $1,000 of face amount at maturity, which equates to an initial conversion price of $45.80 per share. The debentures are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future Senior Indebtedness (as defined in the related indenture) and effectively subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. The debentures may be redeemed for cash at our option beginning on February 13, 2003. At the option of the holder, we will purchase the debentures as of February 13, 2003, February 13, 2008 and February 13, 2013 at purchase prices (to be paid in cash or common stock or any combination thereof and subject to certain conditions) equal to the initial issue price plus the accretion of the discount on the debentures to such dates. The debentures may also be redeemed at the option of the holder if there is a Fundamental Change (as defined in the related indenture) at a price equal to the issue price plus the accretion of the discount on the debentures to the date of redemption, subject to adjustment.       Assuming that as of February 13, 2003 all debenture holders require that we redeem their debentures, we would be required to pay an aggregate redemption price in cash and/or shares of common stock equal to approximately $437.9 million. The number of shares, if any, issued in connection with any redemption will be based on the fair value of our common stock at the time of redemption.

For example, in the fourth quarter of 2000, our revenue decreased 73% from the fourth quarter of 1999 due to some of our distribution partners' business decision to reduce their inventory levels by not replenishing their inventory and requesting returns over and above their contractual rights.       Our revenues and results of operations have been subject to significant fluctuations, particularly on a quarterly basis, and our revenues and results of operations could fluctuate significantly quarter to quarter and year to year. Causes of such fluctuations may include the volume and timing of new orders and renewals, the sales cycle for our products, the introduction of new products, distributor inventory levels and return rates, inventory levels, product upgrades or updates by us or our competitors, changes in product mix, changes in product prices and pricing models, seasonality, trends in the computer industry, general economic conditions (such as the recent economic slowdown), extraordinary events such as acquisitions or litigation and the occurrence of unexpected events.       Significant quarterly fluctuations in revenues will cause significant fluctuations in our cash flows and the cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and deferred revenue accounts on our balance sheet. In addition, the operating results of many software companies reflect seasonal trends, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be affected by such trends in the future. These trends may include higher net revenue in the fourth quarter as many customers complete annual budgetary cycles, and lower net revenue in the summer months when many businesses experience lower sales, particularly in the European market.
