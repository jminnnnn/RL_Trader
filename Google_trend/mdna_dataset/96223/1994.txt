Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition                -----------------------------------------------------------      and Results of Operations.      -------------------------       LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES            The Company.  During each of the three years in the period ended           -----------      December 31, 1993, the Company operated profitably and in the year      ended December 31, 1991 net cash was provided from operations.  For      the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, in spite of increased      earnings, net cash was used for operations.  The 1992 net cash used      principally resulted from a 1991 reinsurance transaction, which had      the effect of reducing CPI's premium to surplus ratio for 1991, and      the 1993 net cash used principally related to the transfer of blocks      of insurance described below.            Principally as a result of the acquisition of the minority      interest in Phlcorp (the "Phlcorp Minority Interest") on December 31,      1992 and the Company's continuing profitable operations, ratings of      the Company's debt obligations were upgraded in 1993 by Moody's, S&P      and Duff & Phelps Inc., three of the leading bond rating agencies, all      of which rated the Company's senior debt as "investment grade."  The      Company believes the higher ratings have made it substantially easier      to raise additional funds, including the offerings described below, on      favorable terms.  Ratings issued by bond rating agencies are subject      to change at any time.            In February 1993, the Company sold $100,000,000 principal amount      of its newly authorized 5 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due      2003 (the "Convertible Debentures") in an underwritten public      offering.  The Convertible Debentures are convertible into Common      Shares at $57.50 per Common Share (an aggregate of 1,739,130 Common      Shares), subject to anti-dilution provisions.  In August 1993, the      Company sold $100,000,000 principal amount of its newly authorized 7      3/4% Senior Notes due 2013 (at 99% of principal amount) in an      underwritten public offering.  The net proceeds of these offerings      were added to working capital.            Principally as a result of the public offerings and increased      cash flow from affiliates, including tax sharing payments, the Company      and its non-regulated affiliates had aggregate cash and temporary      investments of approximately $204,000,000 at February 28, 1994.  Such      funds are available for general corporate purposes, including      acquisitions.  However, the interest rate currently earned on such      funds is less than the interest paid on the 1993 debt offerings.  In      addition, at February 28, 1994 the Company had available aggregate      credit agreement facilities of $150,000,000.  During 1994, the credit      agreements were renewed and now expire in 1997.  No amounts were      outstanding at February 28, 1994 under these credit agreement      facilities.            Effective as of January 1, 1993, as described more fully in Note      1(a) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company      adopted SFAS 106 (postretirement benefits), SFAS 109 (income taxes),      SFAS 112 (postemployment benfits), SFAS 113 (reinsurance) and EITF      93-6 (retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements).  Although      adoption of these statements resulted in an aggregate credit of      $129,195,000 being reported as an element of net income for 1993 and      an increase in shareholders' equity of $138,605,000, adoption of such      statements will not affect cash flows, actual income taxes paid or the      actual utilization of the Company's substantial tax loss      carryforwards.  However, adoption of SFAS 109 is likely to increase      reported provisions for income taxes in most periods.            In addition, as of December 31, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS      115.  SFAS 115 requires that most securities, other than those meeting      the requirements for classification as "held-to-maturity," be carried      on the consolidated balance sheet at market value, either through an      adjustment to earnings (if classified as "trading securities") or      through shareholders' equity (if classified as "available for sale").       The Company has classified substantially all of its investment      portfolio as "available for sale," which resulted in an increase of      shareholders' equity at December 31, 1993 of approximately      $49,500,000.  The Company believes SFAS 115 will result in                                          31          substantial fluctuations in reported shareholders' equity, but is      unlikely to have a material effect on results of operations.  For      additional information with respect to the changes in accounting      principles, see "Results of Operations," below and Notes to      Consolidated Financial Statements.            During 1992, the Company concluded that the profitability of its      existing SPDA and SPWL business was unlikely to achieve acceptable      operating results in the future.  Accordingly, principally starting in      the fourth quarter of 1992, the Company offered certain of its      existing SPDA policyholders the opportunity to exchange their policies      for SPDA policies of an unrelated insurer and entered into a      reinsurance agreement (which closed in stages in 1992 and 1993) to      reinsure certain blocks of SPDA business with a second unrelated      insurer.  In connection with the 1993 SPDA closing (which involved      reinsurance of policies with account balances of approximately      $47,187,000 on the date of closing in 1993), there was no significant      net gain or loss.  The Company is maximizing the return on any      remaining SPDA policies by reducing crediting rates to the minimum      permitted.  As a result, the Company believes that a substantial      portion of the remaining SPDA policyholders will terminate their      policies over a period of time.            On June 23, 1993, the Company reinsured substantially all of its      existing blocks of SPWL business with a subsidiary of John Hancock      Mutual Life Insurance Company ("John Hancock").  In connection with      the transaction, the Company realized a net pre-tax gain of      approximately $16,700,000.  Such net pre-tax gain consists of net      gains on sales of investments sold in connection with the transaction      (approximately $24,100,000), which are included in the caption "Net      securities gains," reduced by a net loss of approximately $7,400,000      (principally the write-off of deferred policy acquisition costs of      approximately $26,900,000 less the premium received on the      transaction), which is included in the caption "Provision for      insurance losses and policy benefits."  Further, the Company may      receive additional consideration based on the subsequent performance      of this block of business.  For financial reporting purposes, the      Company will reflect the policy liabilities assumed by John Hancock      (in policy reserves), with an offsetting receivable from John Hancock      of the same amount (in reinsurance receivable, net), until the Company      is relieved of its legal obligation to the SPWL policyholders.            During the first quarter of 1994, the Company and an equal      partner agreed to acquire a 60% interest in Caja de Ahorro y Seguro      S.A. ("Caja") for a purchase price of approximately $85,000,000,      subject to final adjustment.  Caja is a holding company whose      subsidiaries are engaged in property and casualty insurance, life      insurance and banking in Argentina.  Caja has (unaudited) assets in      excess of approximately $500,000,000.  Reliable historical operating      data for Caja is not available.  The Company believes that Caja will      not constitute a "significant subsidiary."            On August 16, 1991, the Company acquired CPG.  As described in      "Results of Operations," CPG has operated profitably and has been a      substantial contributor to the Company's performance.  Prior to the      acquisition of CPG, particularly in 1989 and 1990, the property and      casualty insurance operations of CPG had provided significant      additional amounts for losses.  At December 31, 1991, the Company      stated it believed that the reserves established for the Colonial Penn      P&C Group were adequate, including amounts applicable to the Special      Risks business.  Since acquisition, the claims and settlement      experience of the acquired business has been satisfactory and the      Company continues to believe (in part based on the recent report of an      independent consulting actuary) that the reserves established for the      Colonial Penn P&C Group, including the Special Risks business and      amounts that may be assessed by California and New Jersey, are      adequate.            The Company records trading stamp revenues and provides for the      cost of redemptions at the time trading stamps are furnished to      licensees.  A liability for unredeemed trading stamps is estimated      based on the cost of merchandise, cash and related redemption service      expenses required to redeem the trading stamps which                                           32          are expected to be presented for redemption in the future.  The      Company periodically reviews the appropriateness of the estimated      redemption rates based upon recent experience, statistical evaluations      and other relevant factors.  At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the      liability for unredeemed trading stamps reflected in the Company's      consolidated balance sheet was $58,541,000 and $74,964,000,      respectively.  The most recent statistical studies of trading stamp      redemptions have indicated that the historical pattern of redemptions      has changed and that the recorded liability for unredeemed trading      stamps is in excess of the amount that ultimately will be required to      redeem trading stamps outstanding.  The amount of this excess may be      different than indicated by these studies.  Accordingly, the Company      is amortizing the aggregate apparent excess over a five year period      (starting in 1990 with respect to approximately $34,000,000 of such      apparent excess and in 1991 with respect to approximately $28,000,000      of such apparent excess).  Based upon the latest studies, the      unamortized apparent excess was approximately $17,067,000 at December      31, 1993.  The Company will continue to monitor current redemptions      and estimates of ultimate redemptions.            The government of El Salvador and representatives of the Company      had previously reached agreement as to the amount to be paid for the      assets of an electric utility in El Salvador in which the Company had      an interest.  Pursuant to such agreement, on March 30, 1993, the      Company received cash of approximately $5,300,000 and approximately      $12,000,000 principal amount of 6% U.S. dollar denominated El Salvador      Government bonds due in instalments through 1996.  The gain recognized      during 1993 was not material.  As a result of receiving required      prepayments and the sale of the bonds, the Company will report a pre-      tax gain of approximately $8,458,000 in the first quarter of 1994.            In connection with the formation of JII on June 1, 1988, John W.      Jordan II, a director and significant shareholder of the Company,      acquired from the Company most of the Company's direct interest in JII      in exchange for a zero coupon note which matured in 1993.  On June 1,      1993 Mr. Jordan delivered to the Company 224,175 of the Company's      Common Shares valued at $8,294,000 (the maturity value of the zero      coupon note) as payment in full of the zero coupon note.  The Common      Shares were valued at $37.00 per share, the closing price of a Common      Share on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape on May 24, 1993,      the last full trading day prior to the authorization by the Company's      Board of Directors of the agreement.            The Company is to receive the residual interest in CLIC and      Credit from the Wisconsin Insurance Commissioner without additional      consideration.  The Company estimates that the value of the net      tangible assets of such companies to the Company was approximately      $32,800,000 in excess of their carrying amount at December 31, 1993.       The underlying assets of such companies are principally invested in      high quality interest earning securities.  The timing for receipt of      such assets is uncertain.            During 1993 and 1992, the property and casualty insurance      industry suffered unprecedented losses from natural disasters,      principally Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and snow storm and fire related      losses in 1993.  The Company's insurance subsidiaries also suffered      certain of such losses, although as described below in "Results of      Operations," reinsurance reduced the economic loss to the Company      related to Hurricane Andrew.  However, as a result of the industry's      losses, the Company has seen a notable decrease in the availability of      catastrophe reinsurance at reasonable rates, particularly at low      levels of deductibility.  Although the reinsurance programs were      completed at acceptable upper loss limits (albeit at a somewhat      increased cost), the insurance subsidiaries have been unable to obtain      previous levels of deductibility at reasonable cost.  Accordingly, for      1994 and 1993 the Company has increased its retention of lower level      losses to $11,000,000.  In 1992, the Company did not incur losses in      excess of its maximum reinsurance.  Further, the Company did not incur      catastrophic losses in excess of its retained limits in 1993 and to      date in 1994.  In January 1994, Los Angeles experienced severe      earthquakes.  As a result, the Company suffered losses estimated at      approximately $7,000,000 to $10,000,000.  In addition, severe winter      storms in 1994 resulted in unusually high losses.                                           33               New Jersey's insurance laws require all automobile insurers to      share in the losses of the MTF based on their depopulation share of      the JUA, as set by the New Jersey Department of Insurance.  Although      the amount of the MTF deficit has not yet been finalized, based on      certain current estimates of the MTF deficit (which are subject to      change), the Colonial Penn P&C Group would be assessed approximately      $11,100,000.  While the New Jersey Insurance Department has adopted      regulations which would permit an insurer, with the approval of the      Insurance Department, to recover amounts paid to the MTF through      surcharges to policyholders, there can be no assurance that the      Colonial Penn P&C Group would be permitted to surcharge its      policyholders for all or even part of any future deficit assessment.       The Colonial Penn P&C Group has provided for its portion of the      estimated MTF losses.            The NAIC has adopted a model law incorporating the concept of a      "risk based capital" ("RBC") requirement for insurance companies,      although the model law is not intended to apply to property and      casualty insurance companies until year end 1994 financial statements      are available.  Generally, RBC is designed to measure the adequacy of      an insurer's statutory capital in relation to the risks inherent in      the business.  The RBC formula will be used by the states as an early      warning tool to identify weakly capitalized companies for the purpose      of initiating regulatory action.  The RBC ratios of the Company's      insurance subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 were substantially in      excess of the minimum requirements.            The Company and certain of its subsidiaries including Phlcorp and      its subsidiaries, have substantial loss carryforwards and other tax      attributes (see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial      Statements).  The amount and availability of tax loss carryforwards      are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties,      including, with respect to Phlcorp and its subsidiaries, tax sharing      payments pursuant to a tax settlement agreement with the Internal      Revenue Service and the Department of Justice.  In order to reduce the      possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations      on the use of these carryforwards which could reduce their value to      the Company, the Company's shareholders, at a special meeting held on      December 30, 1992, imposed certain charter restrictions which      generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from accumulating      five percent or more of the Common Shares and the ability of persons      or entities now owning at least five percent of the Common Shares from      acquiring additional Common Shares.  Upon implementation of SFAS 109,      the Company recognized as an asset (net of reserves) certain of the      benefits of such loss carryforwards and other tax attributes.       However, the amount of the asset recognized only reflects the minimum      Phlcorp tax loss carryforwards and assumes that certain proposed      regulations affecting the use of Phlcorp's tax loss carryforwards are      finalized without significant change.  As described in the      accompanying financial statements, significant additional amounts may      be available under certain circumstances.            The Company's fixed maturity investments are generally      "investment grade" or U.S. governmental agency issued or guaranteed      obligations, although limited investments in "non-rated" or rated less      than "investment grade" securities have been made from time to time.       The Company believes that it provides for potential losses on its      investments upon early indications that a decline in the market value      of a particular security may be other than temporary.  The cost and      market/carrying value of the Company's investments in "non-rated" or      less than "investment grade" rated securities was approximately      $40,218,000 and $48,351,000 at December 31, 1993, respectively.  At      December 31, 1993, less than 1% of the insurance subsidiaries fixed      maturity investment portfolio was rated by Moody's and/or S&P as less      than "investment grade" or was not rated.            The Company continuously evaluates its existing operations and      investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses and dispositions      of businesses in order to maximize its ultimate economic value to      shareholders.  Accordingly, while the Company does not have any      material arrangement, commitment or understanding with respect      thereto, except as described in this Report, further acquisitions,      divestitures, investments and changes in                                          34          capital structure are possible.  The Company also believes based on      discussions with commercial and investment bankers that it has the      ability to raise significant additional funds under acceptable      conditions for use in its existing businesses or for appropriate      investment opportunities.            Parent.  Leucadia National Corporation (the "Parent") is a           ------      holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock of its      several direct subsidiaries.  As described below, its principal      sources of funds are derived from its available cash resources, bank      borrowings, public financings, repayment of advances, funds      distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management      and other fees, and borrowings and dividends from its regulated and      non-regulated subsidiaries.  It has no substantial recurring cash      requirements other than payment of interest and principal on its debt,      tax payments and expenses of its corporate offices.            The Parent maintains the principal borrowings for the Company and      its non-banking subsidiaries and has provided working capital to      certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries.  These borrowings have      primarily been made on an unsecured basis from banks through various      credit agreement facilities and term loans, and through public      financings.  As noted above, during 1993, the Company issued an      aggregate of $200,000,000 principal amount of senior debt securities      and subordinated convertible debt securities in underwritten public      offerings.  Although the Company had no specific use for such funds      (the proceeds of the offerings were principally invested on a      temporary basis), the Company believes that it was prudent to borrow      long term funds at rates that were historically attractive.  As a      result of these offerings and other sources of funds, at February 28,      1994, the Company and its wholly owned non-regulated subsidiaries had      cash and temporary investments of approximately $204,000,000.            There are no restrictions on distributions from the wholly owned      non-regulated subsidiaries and therefore all cash available to these      subsidiaries (including proceeds from sales of their investments in      marketable securities) is available to the Parent.  At December 31,      1993, a maximum of approximately $50,590,000 was available to the      Parent as dividends from the regulated subsidiaries without regulatory      approval.  Additional amounts may be available to the Parent in the      form of loans or cash advances from such regulated subsidiaries.  The      Parent (and Phlcorp) also receive tax sharing payments from their      subsidiaries included in consolidated tax returns, including certain      regulated subsidiaries.  Because of the tax loss carryforwards      available to the Parent (and Phlcorp) and current interest deductions,      the amount paid by the Parent (and Phlcorp) for income taxes is      substantially less than tax sharing payments received from the      subsidiaries.  In addition, the Company believes significant amounts      are available from the regulated and non-regulated entities for      services provided by the Parent.  The Parent also has borrowed      short-term funds from time to time from its regulated subsidiaries (as      permitted by applicable regulations), although no amounts were      outstanding at December 31, 1993 and no amounts were borrowed to date      in 1994.  Furthermore, as previously noted, the Parent has recently      renewed its credit agreements which provide for aggregate credit      agreement facilities of $150,000,000.  No significant amounts were      borrowed in 1993 or to date in 1994 under such agreements.         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS            CPG is included in results of operations from its date of      acquisition, August 16, 1991.  For the year ended December 31, 1992,      CPG contributed revenues of approximately $836,552,000 (including net      gains on sales of securities of approximately $23,543,000) and      contributed approximately $131,757,000 to consolidated pre-tax income      (exclusive of financing costs).  For the period from August 16, 1991      to December 31, 1991, CPG contributed revenues of approximately      $359,088,000 (including net gains on sales of securities of      approximately $16,323,000) and contributed approximately $59,995,000      to consolidated pre-tax income (exclusive of financing costs).  Due to      changes in the Company's insurance operations it is not practicable to                                            35          provide meanful comparable information for CPG for 1993.  Except as      disclosed herein, the material changes in results of operations for      the year ended December 31, 1992 compared to the preceding year result      from the acquisition of CPG.            Premium receipts on investment oriented products of the life      insurance subsidiaries (which are not reflected as revenues) were      approximately $88,312,000 in 1993, $68,035,000 in 1992 and $43,164,000      in 1991.  The principal investment oriented product sold during the      three year period ended December 31, 1993 was a tax-advantaged VA      product marketed directly to consumers.  Increases in premium receipts      in 1993 and 1992 may in part result from Federal tax law changes      anticipated in 1992 and enacted in 1993.  Substantially all other life      insurance earned premiums relate to the CPG operations.            Earned premium revenues of the life and health insurance      operations were approximately $181,800,000 for 1993 compared to      $233,700,000 for 1992.  The decrease reflected the termination of      certain assumed life and health reinsurance contracts which had      revenues of approximately $28,750,000 for 1992 and minimal      profitability (except for termination gains of approximately      $6,200,000 recognized in 1992).  In addition, earned premium revenues      decreased as a result of the run-off of the agent sold medicare      supplement business, which the Company ceased marketing at December      31, 1992 due to inadequate profitability.              During 1993, based on its experience since acquisition, the      Company concluded that it would be able to generate significant new      premiums for its Graded Benefit Life business at acquisition cost      levels that result in adequate profitability.  Accordingly, starting      in 1993, the Company increased its marketing efforts with respect to      this product.            Earned premium revenues and commissions of the property and      casualty insurance operations of the Empire Group were approximately      $259,400,000 in 1993, $243,100,000 in 1992 and $210,700,000 in 1991.       The increases (as compared to the preceding year) are principally due      to increases in certain premium rates        (4.3% in 1993 and 6.2% in      1992) and increased premium volume (2.4% in 1993 and 9.2% in 1992).            Earned premium revenues of the Colonial Penn property and      casualty insurance operations were approximately $452,600,000 in 1993      and $456,000,000 in 1992.  Earned premiums in 1993 reflect an increase      in involuntary auto insurance resulting from assigned risk business.       The 1993 decline in other business was anticipated and is principally      the result of the substantial reduction in marketing costs incurred      prior to acquisition, which the Company believes were not justified by      prior operating results.  As described more fully elsewhere herein,      the Colonial Penn property and casualty insurance operations are using      other means to market their products.  The Company believes its      present marketing efforts have resulted in new business which to some      degree offsets the normal attrition of existing business.  The Company      believes that it is likely that new business generated in 1994 will be      greater than business lost through normal attrition, although there      can be no assurance that this will be achieved.              Manufacturing revenues and cost of goods sold in 1993 and 1992      increased slightly from amounts from the preceding year.       Manufacturing gross profit was substantially unchanged in 1993 and      lower in 1992 than 1991.  The decline in 1992 was due to certain      manufacturing inefficiencies and start up costs associated with the      Company's new bathroom vanity manufacturing facility,      under-utilization of facilities in part due to general unfavorable      economic conditions and pricing pressures.  These inefficiencies      contributed to the manufacturing operations having a small loss in      1991 and a substantially larger loss in 1993 and 1992.  Although the      new manufacturing plant decreased its inefficiencies in 1993, the      plant continues to operate at unacceptable efficiency levels.  During      1993, the Company instituted actions that it believes should improve      efficiency to acceptable levels in 1994 and 1995, although there can      be no assurance as to that effect.                                              36               Trading stamps revenues were lower in 1993 and 1992 than the      preceding year principally due to the loss of business of certain      customers.  The Company believes the historical decline in usage of      trading stamps will continue.  The Company provided the liability for      unredeemed trading stamps based on the estimate that approximately 75%      of stamps issued in each of 1993, 1992 and 1991 ultimately will be      redeemed.  The gross profit rate was higher in 1992 than in 1991      principally due to lower merchandise costs.  In early 1993, the      Company contributed the net assets of its motivation services business      to a new joint venture formed with an unrelated motivation services      company in exchange for a 45% equity interest in the joint venture.       The joint venture is recorded on the equity basis of accounting.       Results of operations of the motivation services business have      historically not been significant and are not expected to be      significant in the future.            Finance revenues reflect the level of consumer instalment loans.       In 1992 the Company sold at a profit substantially all of its consumer      loan development offices, which had aggregate consumer instalment      loans at the time of sale of approximately $68,500,000.  As expected,      the operating profit applicable to this segment increased in 1993 as      the offices sold in 1992 operated at a loss.  Based on its experience      since 1988 in providing automobile collateralized loans to individuals      with poor credit histories, during 1993 the Company concluded that      there were excellent opportunities for successful expansion of this      business.  Accordingly, on a controlled basis, the Company increased      its investment in such loans.  Such loans approximated $73,321,000 at      December 31, 1993 and $47,890,000 at December 31, 1992.  The Company      expects to further increase such loans in 1994.            Investment and other income decreased in 1993 compared to 1992.       The decrease was the result of a lower level of investments due to      disposition of the SPWL and SPDA business and lower interest rates.       Exclusive of CPG, investment and other income decreased in 1992      compared to 1991.  The investment earnings of the non-CPG insurance      subsidiaries were lower in 1992 compared to the prior year in part due      to a reduction in Charter's investment portfolio to fund a substantial      portion of the CPG purchase price.  The estimated average yield to      maturity of bonds and notes in the Company's investment portfolio was      lower at December 31, 1993 and 1992 than at the preceding year end.       The decreased yield resulted in part from the reinvestment of sales      proceeds at the generally prevailing lower interest rates.  Further,      other income in 1991 includes approximately $9,359,000 related to the      resolution of certain pre-acquisition contingencies related to      Cambrian, a consolidated subsidiary.  The $12,981,000 gain in 1993      from the sale of a portion of the investment in Bolivian Power and the      $12,128,000 gain in 1992 from sale of the consumer loan development      offices is reflected in other income.                                                                 37              Net securities gains (losses) in each of the three years ended      December 31, 1993 were as follows (in thousands):                                                               1993        1992        1991                                                          ----        ----        ----                Net gains on fixed maturities:         Resulting in additional provision          for policyholder benefits                     $ 6,800    $  2,700    $  8,800         Resulting in increase in amortization          of deferred policy acquisition costs           24,100      11,230        -            Other                                           19,352      51,797      26,103                                                        -------    --------    --------                                                         50,252      65,727      34,903       Provision for write-down of investments        in certain fixed maturity investments            (2,000)    (19,677)     (7,783)       Provision for write-down of investments        in certain equity and other securities             -           (364)       (757)       Net unrealized holding loss on trading        securities                                         (685)       -           -          Gain on sale of investment in Molins PLC            -           -         18,437       Net gains on equity and other securities           4,356       6,092       5,591                                                        -------    --------      ------                                                        $51,923    $ 51,778    $ 50,391                                                        =======    ========    ========               The proceeds from sales of investments were primarily reinvested      at the generally lower prevailing interest rates.  Since these      reinvestment rates were, in certain instances, lower than had      previously been expected on certain fixed rate annuity policies issued      by the life insurance subsidiaries, in 1993 and 1991 the Company      provided approximately $6,800,000 and $8,800,000, respectively, which      is included in results of operations under the caption, "Provision for      insurance losses and policy benefits."  In 1992, as a result of      realizing securities gains and reinvestment of sales proceeds at the      lower prevailing interest rates, and securities gains realized in      connection with the termination or transfer of the SPDA business, the      Company recalculated and eliminated deferred policy acquisition costs      applicable to certain of its investment oriented products (including      the SPDA policies), reviewed the expected and required return on      certain fixed income products and, as a result, provided additional      reserves of approximately $13,900,000, which is included in the      caption "Provision for insurance losses and policy benefits" in 1992      results of operations.  These reinvestment risks do not apply to the      Company's currently offered variable investment oriented products.            The provision for insurance losses and policy benefits of the      life and health operations decreased in the 1993 period compared to      the 1992 period, principally due to lower earned premiums and      insurance in force, (including the SPDA and SPWL business that was      sold in late 1992 and 1993).  However, the provision for insurance      losses and policy benefits of the life and health operations for 1993      includes a net loss of approximately $7,400,000 (principally the      write-off of deferred policy acquisition costs less the premium      received) applicable to the SPWL business sold to John Hancock and      additional provisions of approximately $6,800,000 applicable to      certain fixed rate policies due to realization of securities gains and      reinvestment of proceeds at the lower prevailing interest rates, as      described more fully above.            The provision for insurance losses and policy benefits of the      life and health operations exclusive of CPG increased in 1992 compared      to 1991 principally due to the growth in earned premiums and the      additional amounts provided by the life insurance subsidiaries as a      result of the realized securities gains described above.  Further, the      spread between amounts credited to policyholders by the life insurance      subsidiaries and amounts earned on investments was reduced in 1992 as      compared to 1991.  As a result of the termination of certain      reinsurance arrangements by the life insurance subsidiaries,      approximately $6,200,000, representing amounts                                          38          provided for policyholder benefits that were no longer required, is      reflected as a reduction in the provision for insurance losses and      policy benefits for 1992.            The Company's property and casualty insurance operations combined      ratios as determined under GAAP and SAP were as follows:       Year ended December 31,                   GAAP          SAP                                                ------       ------       1993                                    96.9%       93.7%                                                1992      101.7%102.8%                                                1991      102.1%103.3%            For the Colonial Penn P&C Group, the severity of personal      automobile claims was substantially more favorable in 1993 than in      1992 and the frequency of such claims was substantially more favorable      in 1992 than in the prior year.  The Company believes this experience      reflects its improved underwriting procedures, emphasis on over 50      year old insureds and prior rate increases.  In addition, the combined      ratio and the provision for losses applicable to the property and      casualty operations for 1993 were favorably affected due to settlement      of prior years' claims at amounts less than had been provided.  The      overall loss experience of the Empire Group's property and casualty      insurance subsidiaries was less favorable in 1992 than in 1991      primarily as a result of unfavorable loss experience in automobile      lines and an approximately $3,000,000 retroactive assessment for a      workers' compensation fund.  The Company believes that as a result of      the reduction in claims outstanding for the Colonial Penn P&C Group,      there will be a reduced positive effect on future results of      operations from settlement of claims at less than amounts previously      provided in spite of providing loss reserves on current operations at      very conservative levels.            The provision for insurance losses and policy benefits in 1993      and 1992 (including CPG) also includes catastrophe losses (net of      reinsurance recoveries in 1992) estimated at an aggregate of      approximately $10,900,000 in 1993 and $12,300,000 in 1992 (including      amounts related to Hurricane Andrew in 1992).  In addition, in 1992,      the Company provided approximately $1,000,000 to reinstate certain      reinsurance coverage which was exhausted in connection with Hurricane      Andrew.              Interest expense principally reflects the level of external      borrowings outstanding during the period and, in each year compared to      the preceding year, the effect of lower interest rates.  Interest      expense in 1992 also reflects a lower level of intercompany borrowings      from Phlcorp during 1992, which resulted in increased interest charges      of approximately $4,880,000 in 1992 compared to 1991.  Additionally,      interest expense reflects the level of Deposits at AIB and the ILCs.       Generally, interest rates on Deposits are lower than on other      available funds.  Interest on Deposits was approximately $9,001,000 in      1993, $11,954,000 in 1992 and $15,138,000 in 1991.  The Company      estimates that in 1993, the interest expense on its borrowings which      were invested in temporary investments exceeded interest earned by      approximately $2,500,000.            Selling, general and other expenses in 1991 includes costs      applicable to development by the trading stamps subsidiary of a      database marketing program of approximately $8,237,000 (including      close down costs).  In 1991 the Company discontinued development of      the program due to a lack of acceptance by food manufacturers.            Minority interest in 1992 and 1991 was principally applicable to      the Phlcorp Minority Interest.  On December 31, 1992, the Company      acquired the Phlcorp Minority Interest in exchange for approximately      4,408,000 Common Shares.                                               39               Income before income taxes and the effects of accounting changes      was $176,868,000 in 1993, $143,553,000 in 1992 and $95,030,000 in      1991.  The amount for 1993 was the highest in the history of the      Company.            The provision for income taxes for 1993 was calculated under SFAS      109 which does not reflect the benefit from utilization of tax loss      carryforwards.  The provisions for income taxes for 1992 and 1991 have      been reduced for the benefit from utilization of tax loss      carryforwards.  The provision for income taxes for 1993 was reduced by      approximately $8,315,000 as a result of tax law changes and a      reduction in the valuation allowance applicable to certain deferred      tax assets.  The Company estimates that if the 1993 tax provision had      been calculated as it was in 1992 and 1991, such provision would have      been lower by, and net income (exclusive of amounts applicable to      changes in accounting principles) would have been higher by      approximately $42,614,000 (or $1.46 per primary earnings per share and      $1.38 per fully diluted earnings per share).            The provisions for income taxes for 1992 and 1991 principally      consist of state income taxes, the federal alternative minimum income      tax, federal income taxes applicable to the life insurance      subsidiaries which cannot utilize the Company's tax loss carryforwards      and United Kingdom income taxes applicable to Cambrian.  The 1991      provision reflects credits of approximately $5,400,000, resulting from      the favorable outcome of certain prior years' United Kingdom income      tax matters.  As noted above, the tax provisions for 1992 and 1991      reflect the benefit from utilization of accounting and tax loss      carryforwards, including capital loss carryforwards.            The number of shares used to calculate primary earnings per share      was 29,270,000, 24,435,000 and 23,704,000 for 1993, 1992 and 1991,      respectively.  The number of shares used to calculate fully diluted      earnings per share was 30,743,000, 24,516,000 and 23,916,000 for 1993,      1992 and 1991, respectively.  The increase in 1993 was principally      caused by the acquisition of the Phlcorp Minority Interest and, with      respect to fully diluted per share amounts, the effect of the assumed      conversion of the 5 1/4% Convertible Debentures.  The increase in the      number of shares utilized in calculating per share amounts in 1992      compared to 1991 was principally caused by the exercise of options to      purchase common shares and the increase in the market price per common      share.
