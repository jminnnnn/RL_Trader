Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results          of Operations. - ------  ---------------          The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the Company's consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and results of operations. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this Report.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  General         The Company's investment portfolio, shareholders' equity and results of operations can be significantly impacted by the changes in market values of certain securities, particularly during times of increased volatility in security prices. Changes in the market values of publicly traded available for sale securities are reflected in other comprehensive income (loss) and shareholders' equity. However, changes in the market prices of investments for which the Company has elected the fair value option, and declines in the fair values of public and non-public securities that the Company deems to be other than temporary are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and shareholders' equity. The Company also has non-controlling investments in entities that are engaged in investing and/or securities transactions activities that are accounted for on the equity method of accounting (classified as investments in associated companies), for which the Company records its share of the entities' profits or losses in its consolidated statements of operations. These entities typically invest in public securities with changes in market values reflected in their earnings, which increases the Company's exposure to volatility in the public securities markets.         During the second half of 2008, there was enormous volatility and loss of value in public securities markets worldwide, and the market prices of the Company's largest investments declined significantly. The Company's investment in the common shares of Fortescue, which is accounted for as an available for sale security, declined in value from $1,824,700,000 at December 31, 2007 to $377,000,000 at December 31, 2008, which is reflected as an after-tax loss in other comprehensive income (loss) and a decline in shareholders' equity of $921,000,000. The market values of the Company's investments in ACF and Jefferies, for which the fair value option was elected, also declined significantly with unrealized losses reflected in operations as a component of income (losses) related to associated companies. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized unrealized losses related to its investment in ACF of $155,300,000 and unrealized losses related to its investment in Jefferies of $111,200,000. The Company also recorded impairment losses for declines in value of securities deemed to be other than temporary in its consolidated statement of operations of $143,400,000, reflected as a component of net securities gains (losses) and $63,300,000, reflected as a component of income (losses) related to associated companies.         Public securities markets have remained volatile subsequent to December 31, 2008; as of February 20, 2009, the fair value of the Company's investment in ACF has declined to $126,900,000 and the fair value of the Company's investment in Jefferies has declined to $529,600,000. If the aggregate market value of the Company's investments in ACF and Jefferies remain unchanged at March 31, 2009, these declines in market value would result in the recognition of an aggregate unrealized loss during the first quarter of 2009 of $276,500,000. Further declines in market values are possible, which would result in the recognition of additional unrealized losses that would reduce shareholders' equity and, depending upon the method of accounting employed for the investment, could result in recognition of additional unrealized losses in the consolidated statements of operations.                                         32     Liquidity         Leucadia National Corporation (the "Parent") is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock of its direct subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents and other non-controlling investments in debt and equity securities. The Parent continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing operations and investments and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value. Accordingly, further acquisitions, divestitures, investments and changes in capital structure are possible. Its principal sources of funds are its available cash resources, liquid investments, bank borrowings, public and private capital market transactions, repayment of subsidiary advances, funds distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management and other fees, and borrowings and dividends from its subsidiaries, as well as dispositions of existing businesses and investments.         In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the Company also considers investments classified as current assets and investments classified as non-current assets on the face of its consolidated balance sheet as being generally available to meet its liquidity needs. Securities classified as current and non-current investments are not as liquid as cash and cash equivalents, but they are generally convertible into cash within a relatively short period of time. As of December 31, 2008, the sum of these amounts aggregated $1,632,000,000. However, since $529,300,000 of this amount is pledged as collateral pursuant to various agreements, represents investments in non-public securities or is held by subsidiaries that are party to agreements that restrict the Company's ability to use the funds for other purposes (including the Inmet shares), the Company does not consider those amounts to be available to meet the Parent's liquidity needs. The $1,102,700,000 that is available is comprised of cash and short-term bonds and notes of the U.S. Government and its agencies, U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises and other publicly traded debt and equity securities (including the investment in Fortescue common shares). The Parent's available liquidity, and the investment income realized from the Parent's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is used to meet the Parent company's short-term recurring cash requirements, which are principally the payment of interest on its debt and corporate overhead expenses.         The Parent's only long-term cash requirement is to make principal payments on its long-term debt ($1,794,300,000 principal outstanding as of December 31, 2008), of which $475,000,000 is due in 2013, $221,100,000 is due in 2014, $500,000,000 is due in 2015, $500,000,000 is due in 2017 and $98,200,000 is due in 2027. Historically, the Parent has used its available liquidity to make acquisitions of new businesses and other investments, but, except as disclosed in this Report, the timing of any future investments and the cost can not be predicted. Should the Company require additional liquidity for an investment or any other purpose, the Parent also has an unsecured bank credit facility of $100,000,000 that expires in June 2011 and bears interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate or the prime rate. No amounts are currently outstanding under the bank credit facility.         From time to time in the past, the Company has accessed public and private credit markets and raised capital in underwritten bond financings. The funds raised have been used by the Company for general corporate purposes, including for its existing businesses and new investment opportunities. However, given the current ongoing turmoil in the credit markets, if the Company were to try to raise funds through an underwritten bond offering it would be at a higher interest rate than in the past, or with terms that the Company may not find acceptable. The Company has no current intention to seek additional bond financing, and will rely on its existing liquidity to fund corporate overhead expenses and corporate interest payments and, to fund new investing opportunities, it may also dispose of existing businesses and investments. The Parent's senior debt obligations are rated two levels below investment grade by Moody's Investors Services and one level below investment grade by Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings. Ratings issued by bond rating agencies are subject to change at any time.         As of December 31, 2008, the Company had acquired approximately 25% of the outstanding common shares of ACF for aggregate cash consideration of $405,300,000 ($70,100,000 was invested as of December 31, 2007). ACF is an independent auto finance company that is in the business of purchasing and servicing automobile sales finance contracts, historically for consumers who are typically unable to obtain financing from other sources. The Company has entered into a standstill agreement with ACF for the two year period ending March 3, 2010, pursuant to which the Company has agreed not to sell its shares if the buyer would own more than 4.9% of the outstanding shares, unless the buyer agreed to be bound by terms of the standstill agreement, to not increase its ownership interest to more than 30% of the outstanding ACF common shares, and received the right to nominate two directors to the board of directors of ACF. ACF also entered into a registration rights agreement covering all of the common shares owned by the Company. At December 31, 2008, the Company's investment in ACF is classified as an investment in an associated company and carried at fair value of $249,900,000; the investment in ACF is one of two eligible items for which the Company elected the fair value option described in SFAS 159.                                          33           In March 2008, the Company increased its equity investment in the common shares of IFIS Limited ("IFIS"), a private company that primarily invests in operating businesses in Argentina, from approximately 3% to 26% for an additional cash investment of $83,900,000. IFIS owns a variety of investments, and its largest investment is approximately 32% of the outstanding common shares of Sociedad Anonima Comercial, Inmobiliaria, Financiera y Agropecuaria ("Cresud"), an Argentine agricultural company involved in a range of activities including crop production, cattle raising and milk production. Cresud's common shares trade on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange (Symbol: CRES); in the U.S., Cresud trades as American Depository Shares or ADSs (each of which represents ten common shares) on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (Symbol: CRESY). When the Company acquired its additional interest in IFIS in 2008, it was classified as an investment in associated companies and accounted for under the equity method of accounting due to the size of the Company's voting interest. In January 2009, IFIS raised a significant amount of new equity in a rights offering in which the Company did not participate. As a result, the Company's ownership interest in IFIS was reduced to 8% and the Company will no longer apply the equity method of accounting for this investment.         The Company also acquired a direct equity interest in Cresud for an aggregate cash investment of $54,300,000. At December 31, 2008, the Company owned 3,364,174 Cresud ADSs, representing approximately 6.7% of Cresud's outstanding common shares, and currently exercisable warrants to purchase 11,213,914 Cresud common shares (or 1,121,391 Cresud ADSs) at an exercise price of $1.68 per share. The Company's direct investment in Cresud is classified as a non-current available for sale investment and carried at fair value.         As a result of significant declines in quoted market prices for Cresud and other investments of IFIS, combined with declines in worldwide food commodity prices, the global mortgage and real estate crisis and political and financial conditions in Argentina, the Company has determined that its investments in IFIS and Cresud ADSs and warrants were impaired. As of December 31, 2008, the fair value of the Company's investment in IFIS was determined to be $14,600,000, resulting in an impairment charge of $63,300,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008. This charge is in addition to the Company's share of IFIS's operating losses, which was $8,400,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, the fair value of the Company's direct investment in Cresud ADSs and warrants was determined to be $31,100,000, resulting in an impairment charge of $23,200,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008.         In April 2008, the Company sold to Jefferies 10,000,000 of the Company's common shares, and received 26,585,310 shares of common stock of Jefferies and $100,021,000 in cash. The Jefferies common shares were valued based on the closing price of the Jefferies common stock on April 18, 2008, the last trading date prior to the acquisition ($398,248,000 in the aggregate). Including shares acquired in open market purchases during 2008, as of December 31, 2008 the Company owns an aggregate of 48,585,385 Jefferies common shares (approximately 30% of the Jefferies outstanding common shares) for a total investment of $794,400,000. At December 31, 2008, the Company's investment in Jefferies is carried at fair value of $683,100,000; the investment in Jefferies is one of two eligible items for which the Company elected the fair value option described in SFAS 159. Jefferies is a full-service global investment bank and institutional securities firm serving companies and their investors.         In connection with its investment in Jefferies, the Company entered into a standstill agreement, pursuant to which for the two year period ending April 21, 2010, the Company agreed, subject to certain provisions, to limit its investment in Jefferies to not more than 30% of the outstanding Jefferies common shares and to not sell its investment, and received the right to nominate two directors to the board of directors of Jefferies. Jefferies also agreed to enter into a registration rights agreement covering all of the Jefferies shares of common stock owned by the Company.         As discussed above, in April 2008, the Lake Charles Harbor & Terminal District of Lake Charles, Louisiana sold $1,000,000,000 in tax exempt bonds that will support the development of a $1,600,000,000 petroleum coke gasification plant project by the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Lake Charles Cogeneration LLC ("LCC"). LCC does not currently have access to the bond proceeds, which are being held in an escrow account by the bond trustee, and it will not have access to the bond proceeds until certain conditions are satisfied. Upon the completion of pending permitting, regulatory approval, design engineering and the satisfaction of certain other conditions of the financing agreements, the bonds will be remarketed for a longer term and the proceeds will be released to LCC to use for the payment of development and construction costs for the project. If all conditions have been met and LCC begins to draw down on the bond proceeds, any amounts drawn will be recorded as long-term indebtedness of LCC and reflected on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The Company is not obligated to make equity contributions to LCC until it completes its investigation and the project is approved by the Company's board of directors.                                          34           In September 2008, the Company invested an additional $20,000,000 in Sangart upon its exercise of certain existing warrants, which increased its ownership interest to approximately 89%. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company invested an additional $28,500,000 in Sangart upon the exercise of its remaining warrants, which increased its ownership interest to approximately 92%. The additional investment the Company made in 2009, along with Sangart's existing cash resources is expected to provide Sangart with sufficient capital to fund activities into 2010. Thereafter, significant additional funding will be needed for product development and clinical trial activities prior to regulatory approval and commercial launch; the source of such funding has not as yet been determined.         During 2008, the Company issued 5,611,913 common shares upon the conversion of $128,887,000 principal amount of the Company's 3 3/4% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014, pursuant to privately negotiated transactions to induce conversion. The number of common shares issued was in accordance with the terms of the notes; however, the Company paid the former noteholders $12,200,000 in addition to the shares. The additional cash payments were expensed.         During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company received distributions totaling $44,900,000 from its subsidiary, Empire Insurance Company ("Empire"), which has been undergoing a voluntary liquidation since 2001. The Company had classified Empire as a discontinued operation in 2001 and fully wrote-off its remaining book value based on its expected future cash flows at that time. Although Empire no longer writes any insurance business, its orderly liquidation over the years has resulted in reductions to its estimated claim reserves that enabled Empire to pay the distributions, with the approval of the New York Insurance Department. Since future distributions from Empire, if any, are subject to New York insurance law or the approval of the New York Insurance Department, income will only be recognized when received.         In February 2009, the Board of Directors authorized the Company, from time to time, to purchase its outstanding debt securities through cash purchases in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend upon prevailing market conditions, the Company's liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Depending upon market conditions and other factors, such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without notice.         In March 2007, the Board of Directors increased the number of the Company's common shares that the Company is authorized to purchase. As a result, the Company is authorized to purchase up to 12,000,000 common shares. Such purchases may be made from time to time in the open market, through block trades or otherwise. Depending on market conditions and other factors, such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without notice. During the three year period ended December 31, 2008, the only common shares acquired by the Company were in connection with the exercise of stock options. As of February 20, 2009, the Company is authorized to repurchase 11,992,829 common shares.         The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have substantial NOLs and other tax attributes. The amount and availability of the NOLs and other tax attributes are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations on the use of the NOLs, the Company's certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from acquiring ownership (including through attribution under the tax law) of five percent or more of the common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning five percent or more of the common shares from acquiring additional common shares. The restrictions will remain in effect until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2024, (b) the repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any comparable successor provision) or (c) the beginning of a taxable year of the Company to which certain tax benefits may no longer be carried forward. For more information about the NOLs and other tax attributes, see Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows          As discussed above, the Company relies on the Parent's available liquidity to meet its short-term and long-term needs, and to make acquisitions of new businesses and investments. Except as otherwise disclosed herein, the Company's operating businesses do not generally require material funds from the Parent to support their operating activities, and the Parent does not depend on positive cash flow from its operating segments to meet its liquidity needs. The components of the Company's operating businesses and investments change frequently as a result of acquisitions or divestitures, the timing of which is impossible to predict but which often have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows in any one period. Further, the timing and amounts of distributions from certain of the Company's investments in partnerships accounted for under the equity method are generally outside the control of the Company. As a result, reported cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities do not generally follow any particular pattern or trend, and reported results in the most recent period should not be expected to recur in any subsequent period.                                          35           Net cash of $8,800,000 was provided by operating activities in 2008 as compared to $18,400,000 of net cash used for operating activities in 2007. The change reflects increased funds generated from the trading portfolio, increased distributions of earnings from associated companies and a use of funds for increased interest expense payments. Funds used for operating activities during 2008 include the results of companies acquired during 2007, STi Prepaid and ResortQuest, and the results of Premier following its reconsolidation in the third quarter of 2007. STi Prepaid's telecommunications operations generated funds from operating activities of $5,900,000 and $26,700,000 during the 2008 and 2007, respectively, the Company's property management and services segment used funds of $7,800,000 in 2008 and generated funds from operating activities of $4,000,000 in 2007, Premier generated funds of $13,300,000 in 2008 and used funds of $30,100,000 in 2007 and the Company's manufacturing segments generated funds of $36,900,000 and $30,400,000 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in funds generated by STi Prepaid principally reflects reduced operating profits and additional investments in net working capital of acquired businesses. The reduction in Premier's use of funds principally reflects cash used in 2007 for bankruptcy and reconstruction related items. The decrease in operating cash flows at the property management and services segment principally results from the net change in restricted cash at ResortQuest. Funds used by Sangart, a development stage company, increased to $35,000,000 during 2008 from $24,800,000 during 2007. Funds provided by operating activities in 2008 also include $44,900,000 of funds distributed by Empire, a discontinued operation. In 2008, distributions from associated companies principally include earnings distributed by Shortplus ($50,000,000), JHYH ($4,300,000), Jefferies ($5,500,000), Goober Drilling ($16,100,000) and Garcadia ($10,300,000). In 2007, distributions from associated companies principally include earnings distributed by JPOF II ($29,200,000), EagleRock ($15,000,000) and Garcadia ($6,700,000).         Net cash of $18,400,000 was used for operating activities during 2007 as compared to $91,500,000 of net cash provided by operating activities during 2006. The change reflects decreased collections of receivables and distributions of earnings from associated companies, increased income tax payments and greater corporate overhead expenses. The change in operating cash flows also reflects increased funds generated from activity in the trading portfolio, decreased payment of incentive compensation and decreased defined benefit pension plan contributions. During 2006, cash provided by operating activities reflects the collection of the balance of certain receivables from AT&T Inc. ($198,500,000). The AT&T receivables resulted from a termination agreement entered into between WilTel and its largest customer during 2005. In 2006, distributions from associated companies principally include earnings distributed by JPOF II ($23,600,000) and EagleRock ($48,200,000). Contributions to the defined benefit pension plans were $50,100,000 in 2006; no material contributions were made in 2007.          During 2007, STi Prepaid's telecommunications operations generated funds from operating activities of $26,700,000 and the Company's property management and services segment generated funds of $4,000,000. While it was a consolidated subsidiary, Premier used funds of $30,100,000 in 2007 and $25,900,000 in 2006. Funds provided by the Company's manufacturing segments decreased to $30,400,000 in 2007 as compared to $45,300,000 in 2006, reflecting reduced profitability. Funds used by Sangart increased to $24,800,000 during 2007 from $19,400,000 during 2006. Funds provided by operating activities for 2006 also include $9,100,000 of funds used by discontinued operations.          Net cash flows used for investing activities were $403,000,000 in 2008, $957,400,000 in 2007 and $186,200,000 in 2006. During 2007, funds provided by the disposal of real estate, property and equipment and other assets include the sale of WilTel's former headquarters building for $53,500,000. During 2006, funds provided by the disposal of real estate, property and equipment and other assets include the sale of 8 acres of unimproved land in Washington, D.C. by 711 Developer, LLC ("Square 711"), a 90% owned subsidiary of the Company, ($75,700,000) and the sale of two associated companies ($56,400,000). During 2008, acquisitions, net of cash acquired principally include an acquisition by the wineries ($19,200,000) and various small acquisitions by STi Prepaid. During 2007, acquisitions, net of cash acquired principally include assets acquired by STi Prepaid from Telco ($85,400,000) and ResortQuest ($9,700,000) and cash acquired upon the reconsolidation of Premier ($17,300,000). During 2006, acquisitions, net of cash acquired principally include the acquisition of Premier ($105,700,000). During 2006, proceeds from the disposal of discontinued operations net of expenses and cash sold were $120,200,000, principally reflecting the sale of Symphony Healthcare Services, LLC ("Symphony") and ATX Communications, Inc. ("ATX") and the resolution of WilTel's working capital adjustment relating to the December 2005 sale of WilTel. During 2006, collection of insurance proceeds relate to Premier's recoveries with respect to Hurricane Katrina. Investments in associated companies include Jefferies ($396,100,000), ACF ($335,200,000), IFIS ($83,900,000), CLC ($56,700,000) and Garcadia ($34,000,000) in 2008, JHYH ($250,000,000), Pershing Square ($200,000,000), Goober Drilling ($108,000,000), Ambrose ($75,000,000), Highland Opportunity ($74,000,000), Shortplus ($25,000,000), CLC ($53,500,000) and Premier ($160,500,000) in 2007, and Goober Drilling ($188,000,000), Safe Harbor ($50,000,000), Wintergreen ($30,000,000) and CLC ($12,100,000) in 2006. Capital distributions from associated companies principally include Safe Harbor ($19,300,000), Goober Drilling ($36,000,000), Highland Opportunity ($40,000,000), Ambrose ($72,900,000) and EagleRock ($12,500,000) in 2008 and Goober Drilling ($33,200,000) and Safe Harbor ($25,000,000) in 2007.                                          36            During 2008, funds used for acquisitions of and capital expenditures for real estate investments principally relate to the Myrtle Beach project ($67,000,000), land used by certain Garcadia dealerships ($20,400,000) and the real estate development projects in Maine ($7,500,000). During 2007, the change in restricted cash principally results from the $56,500,000 escrow deposit made in connection with the Panama City real estate project. Pursuant to the indenture governing the Premier Notes, Premier was required to put insurance proceeds it collected into restricted accounts, which is the principal reason for the net change in restricted cash during 2006. Premier's cash flow activity is reflected in the Company's 2006 consolidated statement of cash flows only during the period it was a consolidated subsidiary (April through September 2006).          Net cash of $174,800,000 in 2008 and $1,145,500,000 in 2007 was provided by financing activities and net cash of $5,200,000 was used for financing activities in 2006. During 2007, issuance of debt, net of expenses, includes $500,000,000 principal amount of 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $500,000,000 principal amount of 8 1/8% Senior Notes. The increase in debt during 2008 principally relates to the Myrtle Beach project's debt obligation and to repurchase agreements, which are discussed below, and during 2006 principally relates to repurchase agreements. Reduction of debt in 2008 includes the termination of a capital lease obligation upon the Company's exercise of its right to purchase corporate aircraft secured by a capital lease ($8,200,000). The reduction of debt during 2007 principally relates to the repurchase agreements. The reduction of debt during 2006 includes the repayment of debt of Square 711 ($32,000,000), which was sold, and the maturity of the Company's 7 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes ($21,700,000). Issuance of common shares during 2008 principally reflects cash consideration received on the sale of the Company's common shares to Jefferies. Issuance of common shares for 2007 principally reflects the issuance and sale of 5,500,000 of the Company's common shares. In addition, issuance of common shares reflects the exercise of employee stock options for all periods.          Debt due within one year includes $151,100,000 and $125,000,000 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, relating to repurchase agreements of one of the Company's subsidiaries. These fixed rate repurchase agreements have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.25%, mature in January 2009 and are secured by non-current investments with a carrying value of $164,700,000 at December 31, 2008. Debt due within one year also includes $90,200,000 related to the Myrtle Beach project, which matures in October 2009. The Company has an option to extend the maturity of the loan for two successive twelve month periods; however, the right to extend the loan is contingent upon the relationship between the appraised value of the property and the aggregate loan commitment as of the initial maturity date and the debt service coverage ratio. Although the Company believes it will be able to extend the maturity date of the loan, since the right to do so is not completely within the control of the Company the loan has been classified as a current liability.          During 2001, a subsidiary of the Company borrowed $53,100,000 secured by certain of its corporate aircraft, of which $37,100,000 is currently outstanding. The Parent company has guaranteed this financing.          The Company's senior note indentures contain covenants that restrict its ability to incur more Indebtedness or issue Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries unless, at the time of such incurrence or issuance, the Company meets a specified ratio of Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Tangible Net Worth, limit the ability of the Company and Material Subsidiaries to incur, in certain circumstances, Liens, limit the ability of Material Subsidiaries to incur Funded Debt in certain circumstances, and contain other terms and restrictions all as defined in the senior note indentures. The Company has the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness or make distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions. If the Company is unable to meet the specified ratio, the Company would not be able to issue additional Indebtedness or Preferred Stock, but the Company's inability to meet the applicable ratio would not result in a default under its senior note indentures. The Company's bank credit agreement also contains covenants and restrictions which are generally more restrictive than the senior note indentures; however, the Company has the ability to terminate the bank credit agreement if no amounts are outstanding. Certain of the debt instruments of subsidiaries of the Company require that collateral be provided to the lender; principally as a result of such requirements, the assets of subsidiaries which are subject to limitations on transfer of funds to the Company were approximately $374,600,000 at December 31, 2008.

Estimated payments related to a currency swap agreement are based on the currency rate in effect at December 31, 2008. Amounts related to the Company's consolidated pension liability ($62,200,000) are included in the table in the less than 1 year period ($4,200,000) and the remainder in the 1-3 year period; however, the exact timing of those cash payments is uncertain. The above amounts do not include liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as the timing of payments, if any, is uncertain. Such amounts aggregated $11,100,000 at December 31, 2008; for more information, see Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.          At December 31, 2008, the Company had recorded a liability of $62,200,000 on its consolidated balance sheet for its unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligations. This amount represents the difference between the present value of amounts owed to current and former employees (referred to as the projected benefit obligation) and the market value of plan assets set aside in segregated trust accounts. Since the benefits in these plans have been frozen, future changes to the unfunded benefit obligation are expected to principally result from benefit payments, changes in the market value of plan assets, differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience and interest rates.          Although the Company did not make any significant pension plan contributions during 2008, the Company does expect to make substantial contributions to the segregated trust accounts in the future to reduce its plan liabilities and reduce administrative and insurance costs associated with the plans. The tax deductibility of these contributions is not a primary consideration, principally due to the availability of the Company's NOLs to otherwise reduce taxable income. Other than the $4,200,000 expected 2009 contribution, the timing and amount of additional contributions are uncertain; however, the Company believes it will make substantial contributions over the next few years to reduce, but not to entirely eliminate, its defined benefit pension plan liability.          The Company maintained defined benefit pension plans covering certain operating units prior to 1999, and WilTel also maintained defined pension benefit plans that were not transferred in connection with the sale of WilTel. As of December 31, 2008, certain amounts for these plans are reflected separately in the table below (dollars in thousands):                                         38                                                                               The Company's          WilTel's                                                                             Plans               Plans                                                                          -------------        -----------       Projected benefit obligation                                               $50,628            $172,613 Funded status - balance sheet liability at December 31, 2008                 2,623              59,626 Deferred losses included in other comprehensive income (loss)               11,318              49,921 Discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation             5.25%               6.20%            Calculations of pension expense and projected benefit obligations are prepared by actuaries based on assumptions provided by management. These assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis, including assumptions about discount rates, interest credit rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. For the Company's plans, a discount rate was selected to result in an estimated projected benefit obligation on a plan termination basis, using current rates for annuity settlements and lump sum payments weighted for the assumed elections of participants. For the WilTel plans, the timing of expected future benefit payments was used in conjunction with the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve to develop a discount rate that is representative of the high quality corporate bond market.          These discount rates will be used to determine pension expense in 2009. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.25% change in these discount rates would affect aggregate pension expense by $500,000 and the aggregate benefit obligation by $7,800,000.           The deferred losses in other comprehensive income (loss) primarily result from differences between the actual and assumed return on plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions, including changes in discount rates and changes in interest credit rates. Deferred losses are amortized to expense if they exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year; such amount aggregated $38,900,000 at December 31, 2008 for all plans. A portion of these excess deferred losses will be amortized to expense during 2009 based on an amortization period of twelve years.          The assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets are based on the investment objectives of the specific plan, which are more fully discussed in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to 2008, differences between the actual and expected rates of return on plan assets have not been material. During 2008, the fair value of the WilTel plan assets declined significantly due to the decline in securities markets worldwide. This decline is the reason for the significant increase in the balance sheet liability for the WilTel plans during 2008.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements          At December 31, 2008, the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees and letters of credit aggregating $101,800,000. Pursuant to an agreement that was entered into before the Company sold CDS Holding Corporation ("CDS") to HomeFed in 2002, the Company agreed to provide project improvement bonds for the San Elijo Hills project. These bonds, which are for the benefit of the City of San Marcos, California and other government agencies, are required prior to the commencement of any development at the project. CDS is responsible for paying all third party fees related to obtaining the bonds. Should the City or others draw on the bonds for any reason, CDS and one of its subsidiaries would be obligated to reimburse the Company for the amount drawn. At December 31, 2008, the amount of outstanding bonds was $5,000,000, which expires at various times through 2010. Subsidiaries of the Company have outstanding letters of credit aggregating $14,200,000 at December 31, 2008, principally to secure various obligations. Substantially all of these letters of credit expire before 2012.          As discussed above, the Company has also guaranteed 30% of the amounts outstanding under CLC's senior secured credit facility and senior secured bridge credit facility. At December 31, 2008, $215,000,000 was outstanding under the senior secured credit facility and (euro)47,000,000 was outstanding under the senior secured bridge credit facility; as a result, the Company's outstanding guaranty at that date was $64,500,000 and (euro)14,100,000 ($18,100,000 at exchange rates in effect on February 20, 2009), respectively.                                         39   Critical Accounting Estimates          The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions. The following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements, and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect, at a specific point in time, events whose ultimate outcome won't be known until a later date. Actual results could differ from these estimates.         Income Taxes - At December 31, 2008, the Company's net deferred tax asset before valuation allowances was $2,347,500,000, of which $2,090,000,000 represents the potential future tax savings from federal and state NOLs. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"), the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of any valuation allowance recorded does not in any way adversely affect the Company's ability to use its NOLs to offset taxable income in the future. If in the future the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to realize its net deferred tax asset in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to increase the net deferred tax asset would increase income in such period. If in the future the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net recorded deferred tax asset, an adjustment to decrease the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in such period. SFAS 109 requires the Company to consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, and to weight the evidence when determining whether a valuation allowance is required. Generally, greater weight is required to be placed on objectively verifiable evidence when making this assessment, in particular on recent historical operating results.          In prior periods, the Company's long track record of generating taxable income, its cumulative taxable income for more recent past periods and its projections of future taxable income were the most heavily weighted factors considered when determining how much of the net deferred tax asset was more likely than not to be realizable. During 2005 the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that it would have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the Company's net deferred tax asset; accordingly, $1,135,100,000 of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense. An additional $542,700,000 of the valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense in 2007. The Company's estimate of future taxable income considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, about its operating businesses and investments, included an aggregation of individual projections for each material operating business and investment, estimated apportionment factors for state and local taxing jurisdictions and included all future years that the Company estimated it would have available NOLs.          During the second half of 2008 the Company recorded significant unrealized losses on many of its largest investments (Fortescue, Inmet, Jefferies, ACF and Cresud), recognized other than temporary impairments for a number of other investments and reported reduced profitability from substantially all of its operating businesses, all of which contributed to the recognition of a pre-tax loss of $859,500,000 in the consolidated statement of operations and a pre-tax loss in other comprehensive income (loss) of $1,579,200,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008. The worldwide economic downturn has adversely affected many of the Company's operating businesses and investments, and the nature of the current economic difficulties make it impossible to reliably project how long the downturn will last. Additionally, the 2008 losses result in a cumulative loss in the Company's total comprehensive income (loss) during the past three years. In assessing the realizability of the net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2008, the Company concluded that its operating losses for the more recent periods and current economic conditions worldwide should be given more weight than its projections of future taxable income during the period that it has NOLs available (until 2028), and be given more weight than the Company's long track record of generating taxable income. As a result, the Company concluded that a valuation allowance was required against substantially all of the net deferred tax asset, and increased its valuation allowance by $1,672,100,000 with a corresponding charge to income tax expense.          Pursuant to SFAS 109, the Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of its net deferred tax asset in future periods. However, before the Company would reverse any portion of its valuation allowance, it will need historical positive cumulative taxable income over a period of years to overcome the recent negative evidence. At that time, any decrease to the valuation allowance would be based significantly upon the Company's projections of future taxable income, which are inherently uncertain.                                         40           The Company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities based on the Company's assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining its tax filing positions.         Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", the Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. When testing for impairment, the Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group). The determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on management's estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value. If the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company recorded impairment losses on various long-lived assets aggregating $3,200,000 during 2008; there were no impairment losses recorded during 2007 or 2006.         As discussed in this Report, current economic conditions have adversely affected most of the Company's operations and investments. A worsening of current economic conditions or a prolonged recession could cause a decline in estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the Company's operations and investments. If future undiscounted cash flows are estimated to be less than the carrying amounts of the asset groups used to generate those cash flows in subsequent reporting periods, particularly for those with large investments in property and equipment (for example, manufacturing, gaming entertainment and certain associated company investments), impairment charges would have to be recorded.         Impairment of Securities - Investments with an impairment in value considered to be other than temporary are written down to estimated fair value. The write-downs are included in net securities gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis.          The Company's determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information; GAAP requires the exercise of judgment in making this assessment, rather than the application of fixed mathematical criteria. The Company considers a number of factors including, but not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, the reason for the decline in fair value, changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date, the ability and intent to hold investments to maturity, and other factors specific to the individual investment. The Company's assessment involves a high degree of judgment and accordingly, actual results may differ materially from the Company's estimates and judgments. The Company recorded impairment charges for securities of $143,400,000, $36,800,000 and $12,900,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.         Business Combinations - At acquisition, the Company allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their relative fair values. Significant judgments and estimates are often made to determine these allocated values, and may include the use of appraisals, consider market quotes for similar transactions, employ discounted cash flow techniques or consider other information the Company believes relevant. The finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete, and if final values are materially different from initially recorded amounts earlier issued financial statements may have to be restated. Any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill, which is not amortized to expense. Recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis, and between annual testing dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value. At December 31, 2008, the book value of goodwill was $9,300,000.                                          41            Subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation, any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Once final, the Company is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price, even if subsequent events or circumstances prove the Company's original judgments and estimates to be incorrect. In addition, long-lived assets recorded in a business combination like property and equipment, amortizable intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss. The assumptions and judgments made by the Company when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future.          Purchase price allocations for all of the Company's acquisitions have been finalized. Adjustments to the initial purchase price allocations were not material.          Use of Fair Value Estimates - Effective January 1, 2008 (except as described below), the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), the next priority to inputs that don't qualify as Level 1 inputs but are nonetheless observable, either directly or indirectly, for the particular asset or liability (Level 2), and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The Company elected to defer the effectiveness of SFAS 157 for one year only with respect to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The adoption of SFAS 157 did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements other than expanded disclosures; however, fair value measurements for new assets or liabilities and fair value measurements for existing nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities may be materially different under SFAS 157.         Over 80% of the Company's investment portfolio is classified as available for sale securities, which are carried at estimated fair value in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair values are principally based on publicly quoted market prices (Level 1 inputs), which can rise or fall in reaction to a wide variety of factors or events, and as such are subject to market-related risks and uncertainties. The Company has a segregated portfolio of mortgage pass-through certificates issued by U.S. Government agencies (GNMA) and by U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises (FHLMC or FNMA) which are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value of $293,200,000. Although the markets that these types of securities trade in are generally active, market prices are not always available for the identical security. The fair value of these investments are based on observable market data including benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids and offers. These estimates of fair value are considered to be Level 2 inputs, and the amounts realized from the disposition of these investments has not been materially different from their estimated fair values.         The Company has a segregated portfolio of corporate bonds, which are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value of $31,400,000. Although these bonds trade in brokered markets, the market for certain bonds is sometimes inactive. The fair values of these investments are based on reported trading prices, bid and ask prices and quotes obtained from independent market makers in the securities. These estimates of fair values are also considered to be Level 2 inputs.         Contingencies - The Company accrues for contingent losses when the contingent loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred and of contingent loss amounts normally require significant judgment by management, can be highly subjective and are subject to material change with the passage of time as more information becomes available. Estimating the ultimate impact of litigation matters is inherently uncertain, in particular because the ultimate outcome will rest on events and decisions of others that may not be within the power of the Company to control. The Company does not believe that any of its current litigation will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, if amounts paid at the resolution of litigation are in excess of recorded reserve amounts, the excess could be material to results of operations for that period. As of December 31, 2008, the Company's accrual for contingent losses was not material.                                          42   Results of Operations  General         Substantially all of the Company's operating businesses sell products or services that are impacted by general economic conditions in the U.S. and to a lesser extent internationally. Poor general economic conditions have reduced the demand for products or services sold by the Company's operating subsidiaries and/or resulted in reduced pricing for products or services. Troubled industry sectors, like the residential real estate market, have had an adverse direct impact not only on the Company's real estate and property management and services segments, but have also had an adverse indirect impact on some of the Company's other operating segments, including manufacturing and gaming entertainment. The discussions below concerning revenue and profitability by segment consider current economic conditions and the impact such conditions have had and may continue to have on each segment; however, should general economic conditions worsen and/or if the country experiences a prolonged recession, the Company believes that all of its businesses would be adversely impacted.         The Company does not have any operating businesses that are participants in the sub-prime real estate lending sector, though a tightening in consumer lending standards has had and will continue to have a direct or indirect negative impact on certain of the Company's operations. The Company's investment portfolio includes mortgage-backed securities of $293,200,000 at December 31, 2008; however, all of these securities are issued by U.S. Government agencies or U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises. The Company has also invested in certain investment partnerships (one of which is consolidated) that invest in securities whose values are directly affected by the sub-prime lending crisis. The Company's exposure to changes in their values is limited to the net book value of its investment in such partnerships. At December 31, 2008, the aggregate book value of the Company's investments in such partnerships was approximately $83,100,000.  Manufacturing - Idaho Timber         Revenues and other income for Idaho Timber for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $235,300,000, $292,200,000 and $345,700,000, respectively; gross profits were $11,600,000, $25,100,000 and $30,000,000, respectively; salaries and incentive compensation expenses were $6,400,000, $7,800,000 and $9,400,000, respectively; depreciation and amortization expenses were $4,400,000, $4,600,000 and $4,900,000, respectively; and pre-tax income was $800,000, $9,100,000 and $12,000,000, respectively. Idaho Timber's 2008 revenues and other income include $4,200,000 from the settlement of an insurance claim.          Idaho Timber's revenues for 2008 continued to reflect the weak demand resulting from reductions in housing starts and the abundant supply of high-grade lumber in the marketplace. Shipment volume in 2008 declined by 20% as compared to 2007; average selling prices did not significantly change in 2008 as compared to 2007. Idaho Timber expects that the abundance of existing homes available for sale in the market will continue to negatively impact housing starts and Idaho Timber's revenues during 2009. Until housing starts begin to increase, annual dimension lumber shipping volume may remain flat or could decline further. Curtailment of production at primary sawmills due to their operating losses could reduce excess supply to some degree; however, spread (as discussed below) may not improve since price pressure for low-grade lumber may increase if supplies are reduced. Idaho Timber's revenues for 2008 also reflect the loss of a large home center board customer, which discontinued purchasing pine boards through its vendor managed inventory program effective July 1, 2008. Revenues from this customer pursuant to this program were $8,000,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2008.         The weak demand resulting from reductions in housing starts and the abundant supply of high-grade lumber in the marketplace also impacted Idaho Timber's revenues for 2007. Although shipment volume increased throughout much of 2007 as compared to the last quarter of 2006, the full year shipment volume in 2007 declined by 3.5% as compared to 2006. In addition, average selling prices for 2007 declined almost 12% as compared to 2006.         While raw material costs, the largest component of cost of sales (approximately 80% of cost of sales), declined for 2008 as compared to 2007, principally due to the same market conditions that negatively impacted revenues, raw material cost per thousand board feet did not significantly change for 2008 as compared to 2007. The difference between Idaho Timber's selling price and raw material cost per thousand board feet (spread) is closely monitored, and the rate of change in pricing and cost is not necessarily the same. The spread for 2008 declined by 14% as compared to 2007, and was significantly lower in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the prior quarters in 2008, 2007 and 2006. Although Idaho Timber reduced its manufacturing costs in the fourth quarter, the smaller spread combined with low shipment volume resulted in negative gross profit for the quarter. To the extent that shipment volume remains depressed and cost of raw material remains high relative to selling price, Idaho Timber could experience negative gross profit in future quarters.                                         43          Raw material costs declined during 2007 as compared to 2006 principally due to the same market conditions that negatively impacted revenues. However, raw material costs gradually increased throughout 2007, reflecting less availability of low-grade lumber due to increased shipments to Asia and Europe and lower Canadian lumber imports. Spreads declined throughout 2007, and were lower by approximately 8% for the full year as compared to 2006.  Manufacturing - Conwed Plastics          Pre-tax income for Conwed Plastics was $14,000,000, $17,400,000 and $17,900,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Its manufacturing revenues and other income were $106,000,000, $105,400,000 and $106,400,000, and gross profits were $30,000,000, $31,300,000 and $34,400,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.         While Conwed Plastics' revenues from the packaging and filtration markets increased during 2008 largely due to acquisitions made in 2007, and in the European markets due to an acquisition in 2007, new customers and the impact of foreign exchange, its business continued to be adversely impacted in those markets related to the housing industry. Markets that are impacted by the slowdown in the housing industry, which began in the second half of 2006, include the carpet cushion, building and construction, erosion control and turf reinforcement markets. In addition, revenues from the erosion control market declined in 2008 as some business was lost to competitors. Conwed Plastics expects revenues to continue to be adversely impacted in those markets related to housing, and also expects that the poor domestic and international economic conditions will continue to adversely impact its other markets in the future.         The slowdown in housing starts and a slow start in road construction due to weather conditions were principally responsible for the revenue decline in most of Conwed Plastics' markets during 2007. In addition, increased competition in the erosion control market caused a decline in revenues during 2007. Revenues also declined due to the removal of netting as a component of a customer's bedding product. Conwed Plastics did realize increased revenues of $7,000,000 from its packaging market, principally due to acquisitions in May 2006, and in February, July and October of 2007.          Raw material costs increased by approximately 23% in 2008 as compared to 2007 and by approximately 13% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The primary raw material in Conwed Plastics' products is a polypropylene resin, which is a byproduct of the oil refining process, whose price tends to fluctuate with the price of oil. The increasing volatility of oil and natural gas prices along with current general economic conditions worldwide make it difficult to predict future raw material costs. In addition to managing resin purchases, Conwed Plastics has improved its ability to reduce and/or reuse scrap and continues to seek further improvements in order to increase raw material utilization.         Gross margins declined in 2008 as compared to 2007 principally due to product mix and raw material cost increases. Gross margins declined in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to product mix, increased raw material costs and greater depreciation and amortization expense related to acquisitions and equipment upgrades. Gross margin and pre-tax results for 2007 as compared to 2006 reflect $800,000 of greater amortization expense on intangible assets resulting from acquisitions and depreciation expense.         Pre-tax results for 2008 reflect $1,300,000 of higher salaries and incentive compensation expense as compared to 2007 principally due to an increase in estimated incentive bonus expense and greater headcount related to acquisitions. Pre-tax results for 2007 reflects $2,200,000 of lower salaries and incentive compensation expense as compared to 2006 principally due to lower pre-tax profits and the conversion of certain European management employees from salaried employees to contract based professionals.                                          44    Telecommunications         STi Prepaid's telecommunications revenues and other income for the year ended December 31, 2008 and for the period from the asset acquisition (March 2007) through December 31, 2007 were $452,400,000 and $363,200,000, respectively; telecommunications cost of sales were $392,500,000 and $309,000,000, respectively; salaries and incentive compensation expenses were $10,600,000 and $8,100,000, respectively; depreciation and amortization expenses were $1,400,000 and $500,000, respectively; selling, general and other expenses were $35,900,000 and $27,000,000, respectively; and pre-tax income was $11,900,000 and $18,400,000, respectively.         Prepaid calling card revenue, which increased from $316,700,000 for the 2007 period to $342,600,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, includes $18,800,000 of revenues from acquisitions made by STi Prepaid during the year. While prepaid calling card revenues have either declined or largely been flat throughout most of 2008 (exclusive of the revenues from acquisitions), and have declined compared to those for the fourth quarter of 2007, gross margins have improved principally due to fewer launches of new prepaid calling cards with low introductory rates and a reduction in certain unprofitable prepaid calling card business. During the fourth quarter of 2008, prepaid calling card revenues (excluding revenues from acquisitions), declined compared to the third quarter of 2008. STi Prepaid believes that the adverse economic conditions may have contributed to this decline and may continue to adversely affect its business. Carrier wholesale service business, which has lower gross margins than the prepaid calling card business, increased from $29,700,000 for the 2007 period to $79,800,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008. Pre-tax results for 2008 also reflect $2,900,000 of higher selling, general and other expenses and $1,100,000 of higher salaries and incentive compensation expense from the acquisitions.  Property Management and Services         Property management and services revenues and other income for the year ended December 31, 2008 and from the date of acquisition of ResortQuest (June 2007) through December 31, 2007 were $142,000,000 and $81,500,000, respectively; direct operating expenses were $113,800,000 and $66,000,000, respectively; salaries and incentive compensation expenses were $5,600,000 and $4,000,000, respectively; depreciation and amortization expenses were $4,600,000 and $3,100,000, respectively; selling, general and other expenses were $19,900,000 and $14,900,000, respectively; and pre-tax losses were $1,900,000 and $6,500,000, respectively.         While ResortQuest's occupancy percentage for the year ended December 31, 2008 did not significantly change as compared to that for 2007 (inclusive of the pre-acquisition period), its occupancy percentage for the fourth quarter of 2008 declined as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. In addition, its average daily rates ("ADR") for 2008, particularly those for the fourth quarter, declined compared to those for the same periods in 2007. The declines in occupancy and ADRs primarily reflect fewer reservations for its ski locations, which typically have higher ADRs than beach locations, an increase in available properties in certain beach locations, as well as rate discounts given on properties due to competition and excess availability. Reservations did increase at beach and golf locations but not enough to offset the overall decline in occupancy percentage. Subsequent to year-end, ResortQuest has seen a further decline in advance reservations for its ski locations and many of its beach locations. ResortQuest believes that the decline in advance reservations is largely due to the adverse economic conditions, and with respect to its fly to markets, fewer flights at increased fares. Both ResortQuest and its competitors have begun offering large discounts to entice customers.         ResortQuest recorded net real estate brokerage revenues of $8,700,000 for 2008, principally upon the completion of certain large development projects. Its real estate brokerage services, which are concentrated in Northwest Florida, tend to be cyclical, and experience the same volatility that residential real estate and new construction markets experience. Since acquisition, its real estate brokerage business has been and will continue to be negatively impacted by the depressed real estate market.                                         45    Gaming Entertainment         As more fully discussed above, Premier was accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary when acquired during 2006; however, while in bankruptcy proceedings from September 19, 2006 to emergence on August 10, 2007, Premier was accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, Premier was once again consolidated by the Company. Premier's casino and hotel operations opened to the public on June 30, 2007; prior to opening, Premier's activities principally consisted of rebuilding and repairing the hotel and casino facilities that were severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina, and its bankruptcy proceedings.         For the year ended December 31, 2008 and for the period from emergence from bankruptcy (date of reconsolidation) through December 31, 2007, Premier's revenues and other income were $119,100,000 and $38,500,000, respectively; direct operating expenses were $94,000,000 and $37,800,000, respectively; interest expense was $900,000 and $500,000, respectively; salaries and incentive compensation expenses were $2,500,000 and $1,400,000, respectively; depreciation and amortization expenses were $17,000,000 and $6,300,000, respectively; selling, general and other expenses were $3,800,000 and $1,800,000, respectively; and pre-tax income (losses) were $1,000,000 and $(9,300,000), respectively. For the period from date of acquisition (April 2006) through its filing for bankruptcy in September 2006, Premier's pre-tax losses were not material. The Company's share of Premier's net loss under the equity method of accounting from January 1, 2007 to the date of emergence from bankruptcy was $22,300,000 and not material during 2006.         Revenues and other income for 2008 include a $7,300,000 gain from the settlement and collection of Premier's remaining insurance claim relating to Hurricane Katrina and $5,600,000 resulting from capital contributions from the minority interest. In prior periods, the Company recorded 100% of the losses after cumulative loss allocations to the minority interest had reduced the minority interest liability to zero. Since the minority interest liability remains at zero after considering the capital contributions, the entire capital contribution was recorded as income, effectively reimbursing the Company for a portion of the minority interest losses that were not previously allocated to the minority interest. Pre-tax results for 2008 include $1,100,000 of charges relating to Hurricane Gustav, primarily to write off damaged assets, for which there will not be any insurance recovery, and a charge of $800,000 to write down certain gaming assets that will not be used.         Gaming revenues increased in each quarter of 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. However, gaming revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 declined compared to the prior quarters of 2008 reflecting seasonality in the Gulf Coast gaming market and unfavorable economic conditions. During the fourth quarter of 2008, Premier reduced its workforce and implemented other cost reductions. Premier believes that current adverse economic conditions are likely to have a negative impact on the local gaming market in 2009, which could cause competition among gaming operations in Biloxi to escalate. Since Premier's competitors in the Gulf Coast gaming market have been in operation longer, they have more established gaming operations and customer databases, and many are larger and have greater financial resources.  Domestic Real Estate          Pre-tax income (loss) for the domestic real estate segment was $(14,400,000), $(8,200,000) and $44,000,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Pre-tax results for the domestic real estate segment are largely dependent upon the performance of the segment's operating properties, the current status of the Company's real estate development projects and non-recurring gains or losses recognized when real estate assets are sold. As a result, pre-tax results for this segment for any particular year are not predictable and do not follow any consistent pattern.          The Company did not have any major real estate sales during 2008 or 2007, resulting in significantly lower pre-tax results than in 2006. Real estate revenues and other income for 2008 include income of $3,700,000 from the favorable settlement of a lawsuit. During 2008 and 2007, real estate revenues and other income include $4,600,000 and $3,900,000, respectively, of charges related to the accounting for the mark-to-market value of an interest rate derivative relating to the Myrtle Beach project's debt obligation. Pre-tax results for 2007 include $1,600,000 of incentive compensation accruals related to the Myrtle Beach project. During 2006, pre-tax income includes the sale by Square 711, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $48,900,000, and the sale of other land parcels in Utah for a pre-tax gain of $11,200,000. In addition, in 2006, the Company recognized pre-tax profit related to its 95-lot development project in South Walton County, Florida of $3,600,000. Such amount principally resulted from the completion of certain required improvements to land previously sold. Pre-tax results for 2006 reflect $8,100,000 of incentive compensation accruals related to the Myrtle Beach project.                                          46           Residential property sales volume, prices and new building starts have declined significantly in many U. S. markets, including markets in which the Company has real estate operations in various stages of development. The slowdown in residential sales has been exacerbated by the turmoil in the mortgage lending and credit markets during the past two years, which has resulted in stricter lending standards and reduced liquidity for prospective home buyers. The Company has deferred its development plans for certain of its real estate development projects, and is not actively soliciting bids for its fully developed projects. The Company intends to wait for market conditions to improve before marketing certain of its projects for sale.  Medical Product Development         Pre-tax losses (net of minority interest) for Sangart for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $32,300,000, $31,500,000 and $21,100,000, respectively. Sangart's losses for these periods reflect research and development costs (which are included in selling, general and other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations) of $13,900,000, $22,100,000 and $16,500,000, respectively, and salaries and incentive compensation expenses of $13,100,000, $8,800,000 and $6,400,000, respectively.         As more fully discussed above, Sangart is a development stage company that does not have any revenues from product sales. Earlier this year Sangart, completed patient enrollment in two Phase III clinical trials in Europe of Hemospan(R), its current medical product candidate that were designed to demonstrate Hemospan's safety and effectiveness in preventing and treating low blood pressure during orthopedic hip replacement surgeries and in reducing the incidence of operative and postoperative complications. Because these Phase III trials were conducted in a patient population having a relatively low incidence of medical complications, they were unable to demonstrate a clinical benefit of better outcomes than the control group. Sangart has decided not to pursue marketing approval to use Hemospan for these purposes at this time, but plans to conduct additional clinical trials of Hemospan in a different therapeutic area that may better demonstrate its clinical benefit and strengthen the likelihood of regulatory approval. Such studies will take several years to complete at substantial cost, and until they are successfully completed, if ever, Sangart will not be able to request marketing approval and generate revenues from Hemospan sales. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company invested an additional $28,500,000 in Sangart upon the exercise of its remaining warrants. The Company is unable to predict with certainty when, if ever, it will report operating profits for this segment.         When the Company increases its investment in Sangart, the additional investment is accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method, the price paid is allocated to Sangart's individual assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values; in Sangart's case, a portion of the fair value of assets acquired was initially allocated to research and development. However, since under current GAAP the Company is not permitted to recognize research and development as an asset under the purchase method, any amounts initially allocated to research and development are immediately expensed. The Company expensed acquired research and development of $2,100,000, $4,100,000 and $7,500,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which is included in the caption selling, general and other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Purchase accounting rules have been amended subsequent to December 31, 2008; as a result any amounts allocated to research and development will no longer be immediately expensed in future periods.         The increase in salaries and incentive compensation in 2008 as compared to 2007 was principally due to increased headcount in connection with the Phase III trials and development efforts, greater share-based compensation expense, and compensation costs for a newly hired officer. The increase in salaries and incentive compensation in 2007 as compared to 2006 was due to increased headcount in connection with the commencement of the Phase III trials, including the need to increase Hemospan production for the clinical trials. Pre-tax results for 2008 also reflect $1,600,000 of severance expense relating to a former officer and headcount reductions.                                          47    Corporate and Other Operations          Investment and other income decreased in 2008 as compared to 2007. Investment income declined $41,500,000 in 2008 principally due to lower interest rates on a reduced amount of fixed income securities. Other income, which increased $33,300,000 in 2008, includes $40,500,000 of income related to Fortescue's Pilbara iron ore and infrastructure project in Western Australia. The Company is entitled to receive 4% of the revenue, net of government royalties, invoiced from certain areas of Fortescue's project, which commenced production in May 2008. Amounts are payable semi-annually within thirty days of June 30th and December 31st of each year subject to restricted payment provisions of Fortescue's debt agreements; payments are currently being deferred pursuant to those agreements. Depreciation and amortization expenses for 2008 include prepaid mining interest amortization of $2,800,000, which is being amortized over time in proportion to the amount of ore produced. Other income for 2008 also reflects an increase of $7,500,000 in income from purchased delinquent credit card receivables. Investment and other income for 2007 includes the receipt of escrowed proceeds from the sale of an associated company in 2006 of $11,400,000 that had not been previously recognized, and $8,500,000 related to the termination of a joint development agreement with another party. This amount substantially reimbursed the Company for its prior expenditures, which were fully expensed as incurred. Investment and other income includes income (charges) of $(1,800,000), $(1,900,000) and $1,200,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to the accounting for mark-to-market values of Corporate derivatives.          Investment and other income decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006. Investment and other income during 2006 includes $34,700,000 related to the sales of two associated companies; investment and other income during 2007 includes the receipt of escrowed proceeds from one of those sales of $11,400,000 that had not been previously recognized. In addition, investment and other income for 2006 includes $7,400,000 from the recovery of bankruptcy claims. Interest income also declined by $22,400,000 in 2007 as compared to 2006, principally due to the sale of interest bearing securities to generate cash to purchase Fortescue's securities and interests in associated companies. For 2007, investment and other income includes $8,500,000 related to the termination of a joint development agreement with another party, and $4,200,000 of foreign exchange gains.          Net securities gains (losses) for Corporate and Other Operations aggregated $(144,500,000), $95,600,000, and $117,200,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net securities gains (losses) are net of impairment charges of $143,400,000, $36,800,000 and $12,900,000 during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The impaired securities include the Company's investment in various debt and equity securities and reflect the significant decline in value of worldwide securities markets during 2008. The impairment charges result from declines in fair values of securities believed to be other than temporary, principally for securities classified as available for sale securities. Included in net securities gains for 2007 is a gain of $37,800,000 from the sale of Eastman. Included in net securities gains for 2006 is a gain of $37,400,000 from the sale of Level 3 common stock.          The Company's decision to sell securities and realize security gains or losses is generally based on its evaluation of an individual security's value at the time and the prospect for changes in its value in the future. The decision could also be influenced by the status of the Company's tax attributes or liquidity needs; however, sales in recent years have not been influenced by these considerations. Therefore, the timing of realized security gains or losses is not predictable and does not follow any pattern from year to year.          The increase in interest expense during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily reflects interest expense relating to the 8 1/8% Senior Notes issued in September 2007 and the 7 1/8% Senior Notes issued in March 2007. Interest expense for 2008 also reflects decreased interest expense related to the fixed rate repurchase agreements and the 3 3/4% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes, $128,900,000 of which were converted during 2008. The increase in interest expense during 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily reflects interest expense relating to the 7 1/8% Senior Notes, the 8 1/8% Senior Notes and the fixed rate repurchase agreements. Interest expense during 2006 also includes interest on $21,700,000 principal amount of 7 7/8% Subordinated Notes, which matured in the third quarter of 2006, and interest expense relating to Premier prior to its deconsolidation of $8,000,000.          Principally due to reductions in incentive bonus expense and less share-based compensation expense, salaries and incentive compensation expense decreased by $9,100,000 in 2008 as compared to 2007 and by $4,900,000 in 2007 as compared to 2006. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R in 2006, the Company recorded share-based compensation expense relating to grants made under the Company's senior executive warrant plan and the fixed stock option plan of $10,100,000 in 2008, $11,200,000 in 2007 and $15,200,000 in 2006. Share-based compensation expense in 2007 reflected increased expenses relating to the stock option plan due to the accelerated vesting of stock options of an officer of the Company who resigned. Share-based compensation expense in 2006 reflected grants made under the warrant plan in 2006 for which a portion vested upon issuance.                                          48            The increase in selling, general and other expenses of $28,300,000 in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily reflects greater expenses (largely professional fees and other costs) related to the investigation and evaluation of energy projects, $16,200,000 of expenses incurred relating to the induced conversion of $128,887,000 principal amount of the Company's 3 3/4% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes during the fourth quarter of 2008 and $6,100,000 of severance expense. Selling, general and other expenses for 2008 also include charges of $5,300,000 from asset disposals and writedowns. Selling, general and other expenses related to energy projects were $31,000,000, $18,400,000 and $8,300,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Selling, general and other expenses for 2007 include a charge of $7,500,000 for the settlement of litigation related to MK Resources Company, greater legal fees, including those incurred in connection with that litigation, and higher professional fees.          The increase in selling, general and other expenses of $32,900,000 in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily reflects higher professional fees and other costs, which largely relate to analyses of potential and existing investments and projects, including energy projects, and increased legal fees, including those incurred in connection with litigation related to MK Resources. This litigation was settled during 2007, and selling, general and other expenses include a charge of $7,500,000 for that settlement.          As more fully discussed above, during 2008 the Company concluded that a valuation allowance was required against substantially all of the net deferred tax asset, and increased its valuation allowance by $1,672,100,000 with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. During 2007 the Company's revised projections of future taxable income enabled it to conclude that it was more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the Company's net deferred tax asset; accordingly, $542,700,000 of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense. The income tax provision reflects the reversal of tax reserves aggregating $4,100,000, $2,300,000 and $8,000,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, as a result of the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and the favorable resolution of various state and federal income tax contingencies.  Associated Companies          Income (losses) related to associated companies includes the following for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in thousands):                                                          2008                     2007                   2006                                                 -----------                --------               ---------         ACF                                             $ (155,300)               $   --                  $  -- Jefferies                                         (105,700)                   --                     -- IFIS                                               (71,700)                   --                     -- Pershing Square                                    (77,700)                (85,500)                  -- Shortplus                                           10,500                  54,500                   -- Highland Opportunity                               (17,200)                (17,600)                  -- Wintergreen                                        (32,600)                 14,000                  11,000 EagleRock                                          (19,000)                (11,800)                 16,400 Goober Drilling                                     24,900                  13,600                   2,000 HomeFed                                             (3,100)                  1,500                   2,900 JPOF II                                               --                     3,000                  26,200 JHYH                                               (69,100)                  4,300                    -- Ambrose                                             (1,000)                 (1,100)                   -- Premier                                               --                   (22,300)                   (300) Safe Harbor                                           --                     1,800                  (7,600) CLC                                                 (5,900)                  4,000                   3,800 Other                                              (13,900)                 10,400                   5,700                                                 ----------                --------                --------   Income (losses) related to associated    companies before income taxes                  (536,800)                (31,200)                 60,100 Income tax (expense) benefit                        (2,300)                  9,300                 (22,400)                                                 ----------                --------                --------   Income (losses) related to associated    companies, net of taxes                      $ (539,100)               $(21,900)               $ 37,700                                                 ==========                ========                ========                                           49           As discussed above, the Company elected the fair value option to account for its investments in Jefferies and ACF, resulting in the recognition of unrealized losses in the consolidated statements of operations for these investments.         The Company's share of IFIS's losses include an impairment charge of $63,300,000. In January 2009, IFIS raised a significant amount of new equity in a rights offering in which the Company did not participate. As a result, the Company's ownership interest in IFIS was reduced to 8% and the Company will no longer apply the equity method of accounting for this investment.         In June 2007, the Company acquired a 10% limited partnership interest in Pershing Square, a newly-formed private investment partnership whose investment decisions are at the sole discretion of Pershing Square's general partner. The stated objective of Pershing Square is to create capital appreciation by investing in Target Corporation. Losses recorded by Pershing Square principally result from a decline in the market value of Target Corporation's common stock.         Shortplus, Highland Opportunity, Wintergreen, EagleRock, Ambrose and Safe Harbor are investment partnerships or limited liability corporations whose investment decisions are at the sole discretions of their respective general partners or managing members. These entities invest in a variety of debt and equity securities. The Company has fully redeemed its interests in Highland Opportunity, Ambrose and Safe Harbor and has sent redemption notices to the managers of EagleRock and Wintergreen.         The Company owns approximately 31.4% of HomeFed, a California real estate development company, which it acquired in 2002. The Company's share of HomeFed's reported earnings fluctuates with the level of real estate sales activity at HomeFed's development projects.         In April 2007, the Company and Jefferies expanded and restructured the Company's equity investment in JPOF II, and formed JHYH. The Company contributed $250,000,000 to JHYH along with its investment in JPOF II. The Company's share of JPOF II's earnings was distributed to the Company shortly after the end of each period.         The Company accounted for Premier under the equity method of accounting while it was in bankruptcy (September 2006 to August 2007).  Discontinued Operations         Symphony          In July 2006, the Company sold Symphony for $107,000,000 and classified its historical operating results as a discontinued operation. After satisfaction of Symphony's outstanding credit agreement by the buyer ($31,700,000 at date of sale) and certain sale related obligations, the Company realized net cash proceeds of $62,300,000. Pre-tax income of Symphony was $200,000 for 2006. Gain on disposal of discontinued operations for 2006 includes a pre-tax gain on the sale of Symphony of $53,300,000 ($33,500,000 after tax).         ATX         In September 2006, the Company sold ATX for $85,700,000 and classified its historical operating results as a discontinued operation. Pre-tax losses of ATX were $1,200,000 for 2006. Gain on disposal of discontinued operations for 2006 includes a pre-tax gain on the sale of ATX of $41,600,000 ($26,100,000 after tax). Losses of $1,100,000 in 2008 relate to an indemnification obligation to the purchaser.         WilTel         The Company sold WilTel in December 2005. Gain on disposal of discontinued operations for 2007 includes a pre-tax gain of $800,000 ($500,000 after tax) from the resolution of sale-related contingencies. Gain on disposal of discontinued operations during 2006 includes $2,400,000 of pre-tax gains ($1,500,000 after tax) principally for the resolution of certain sale-related contingencies and obligations and working capital adjustments.                                         50           Other         As discussed above, during the fourth quarter of 2008 the Company received distributions totaling $44,900,000 from Empire, a subsidiary of the Company that had been classified as a discontinued operation in 2001 and fully written-off. For income tax purposes, the payments are treated as non-taxable distributions paid by a subsidiary.         Gain on disposal of discontinued operations for 2007 includes a pre-tax gain of $4,000,000 ($2,800,000 after tax) related to the collection of additional amounts from the sale of the Company's interest in an Argentine shoe manufacturer in 2005 that had not been previously recognized (collectibility was uncertain).         In 2006, the Company sold its gas properties and recorded a pre-tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations of $900,000. Income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2006 includes $2,900,000 of pre-tax losses related to these gas properties.         In 2006, the Company received $3,000,000 from a former insurance subsidiary which, for many years, had been undergoing liquidation proceedings controlled by state insurance regulators. The Company reflected the amount received as a gain on disposal of discontinued operations. For income tax purposes, the payment is treated as a non-taxable distribution paid by a subsidiary; as a result, no tax expense was recorded.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards         In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" ("SFAS 161"). SFAS 161, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, requires enhanced disclosures about an entity's derivative and hedging activities, including the objectives and strategies for using derivatives, disclosures about fair value amounts of, and gains and losses on, derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 161 on its consolidated financial statements.         In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141R, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141R") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements" ("SFAS 160"). SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS 141R will change how business combinations are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. Adoption of SFAS 141R is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements although it may have a material impact on accounting for business combinations in the future which can not currently be determined. SFAS 160 will materially change the accounting and reporting for minority interests in the future, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of stockholders' equity. Upon adoption of SFAS 160, the Company will be required to apply its presentation and disclosure requirements retrospectively, which will require the reclassification of minority interests on the historical consolidated balance sheets, require the historical consolidated statements of operations to reflect net income attributable to the Company and to noncontrolling interests, and require other comprehensive income to reflect other comprehensive income attributable to the Company and to noncontrolling interests.

Such statements may relate, but are not limited, to projections of revenues, income or loss, development expenditures, plans for growth and future operations, competition and regulation, as well as assumptions relating to the foregoing. Such forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.                                          51           Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which cannot be predicted or quantified. When used in this Report, the words "estimates," "expects," "anticipates," "believes," "plans," "intends" and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Future events and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by or underlying the forward-looking statements.          Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any results projected, forecasted, estimated or budgeted or may materially and adversely affect the Company's actual results include, but are not limited to, those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Report and in the Company's other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.         Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which are applicable only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this Report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.   Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. - --------  -----------------------------------------------------------            The following includes "forward-looking statements" that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.           The Company's market risk arises principally from interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and its borrowing activities and equity price risk.           The Company's investment portfolio is primarily classified as available for sale, and consequently, is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in shareholders' equity. Included in the Company's available for sale investment portfolio are fixed income securities, which comprised approximately 47% of the Company's total investment portfolio at December 31, 2008. These fixed income securities are primarily rated "investment grade" or are U.S. governmental agency issued or U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises. The estimated weighted average remaining life of these fixed income securities was approximately 1.6 years at December 31, 2008. The Company's fixed income securities, like all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. At December 31, 2007, fixed income securities comprised approximately 34% of the Company's total investment portfolio and had an estimated weighted average remaining life of 1.7 years.           Also included in the Company's available for sale investment portfolio are equity securities, which are recorded on the balance sheet at an aggregate fair value of $561,400,000 (aggregate cost of $422,000,000) and which comprised approximately 40% of the Company's total investment portfolio at December 31, 2008. The majority of this amount consists of two publicly traded securities, including the investment in Fortescue common shares, which is carried at fair value of $377,000,000, and the investment in Inmet, which is carried at fair value of $90,000,000. Although the Company is currently restricted from selling the Inmet common shares, the investment is subject to price risk. As discussed more fully above in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the Company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis.           The Company is also subject to price risk related to its investments in ACF and Jefferies, for which it has elected the fair value option. At December 31, 2008, these investments are classified as investments in associated companies and carried at fair values of $249,900,000 and $683,100,000, respectively.         At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company's portfolio of trading securities was not material to the total investment portfolio.         The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its long-term fixed interest rate debt. Generally, the fair market value of debt securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall, and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise.           The following table provides information about the Company's financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are primarily sensitive to changes in interest rates. For investment securities and debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates.
