Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition               -----------------------------------------------------------               and Results of Operations.               -------------------------            The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the      Company's consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital      resources and results of operations.  This analysis should be read in      conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related      notes which appear elsewhere in this report.       LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES            Parent Company Liquidity.  Leucadia National Corporation (the           ------------------------      "Parent") is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the      stock of its several direct subsidiaries.  Additionally, the Parent      continuously evaluates its existing operations and investigates      possible acquisitions of new businesses and dispositions of businesses      in order to maximize its ultimate economic value to shareholders.       Accordingly, while the Parent does not have any material arrangement,      commitment or understanding with respect thereto, further      acquisitions, divestitures, investments and changes in capital      structure are possible.  Its principal sources of funds are its      available cash resources, bank borrowings, public financings,      repayment of subsidiary advances, funds distributed from its      subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management and other fees, and      borrowings and dividends from its regulated and non-regulated      subsidiaries.  It has no substantial recurring cash requirements other      than payment of interest and principal on its debt, tax payments and      corporate overhead expenses.            The Parent maintains the principal borrowings for the Company and      its non-banking subsidiaries and has provided working capital to      certain of its subsidiaries.  These borrowings have primarily been      made on an unsecured basis from banks through various credit agreement      facilities and term loans, and through public financings.  During the      year ended December 31, 1994, the Company did not utilize its      $150,000,000 bank credit agreement facilities, except for certain      minor amounts borrowed to meet daily cash requirements.  These      agreements were renewed during 1994 to expire in June 1997.  In June      1994, the Parent entered into a $50,000,000 five-year term loan      agreement with certain of its bank lenders. The term loan and the bank      credit agreement facilities bear interest based on the prime rate or      LIBOR.  The Company is exposed to interest rate risk related to its      variable rate borrowings.  The Company has entered into interest rate      swap and interest rate option agreements to reduce the impact of      changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt.  Counterparties      to these agreements are major financial institutions, which the      Company believes are able to fulfill their obligations; however, if      they are not, the Company believes that any losses would not be      material.            There are no restrictions on distributions from the non-regulated      subsidiaries and therefore all cash available to these subsidiaries is      available to the Parent for general corporate purposes, including      acquisitions.  The Parent and its non-regulated subsidiaries had      aggregate cash and temporary investments of approximately $63,500,000      at December 31, 1994.  Based on discussions with commercial and      investment bankers, the Company believes that it has the ability to      raise additional funds under acceptable conditions for use in its      existing businesses or for appropriate investment opportunities.       Since 1993, the Company's senior debt obligations have been rated as      "investment grade" by Moody's, S&P and Duff & Phelps Inc.  Ratings      issued by bond rating agencies are subject to change at any time.            At December 31, 1994, a maximum of approximately $38,200,000 was      available to the Parent as dividends from the regulated subsidiaries      without regulatory approval.  Additional amounts may be available to      the Parent in the form of loans or cash advances from regulated      subsidiaries, although no amounts were outstanding at December 31,      1994 or borrowed to date in 1995.  The Parent also receives tax      sharing payments from subsidiaries included in its consolidated income      tax return, including certain regulated subsidiaries.  Because of the      tax loss carryforwards available to the Parent and certain      subsidiaries, together with current interest deductions and corporate      expenses, the amount paid by the Parent for income taxes is      substantially less                                         25           than tax sharing payments received from its subsidiaries.  In      addition, the Parent receives payments from the regulated and      non-regulated entities for services provided by the Parent.  Payments      from regulated subsidiaries for dividends, tax sharing payments, other      services and purchases of assets totaled $105,400,000 and $101,000,000      during the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.            Consolidated Liquidity.  During each of the three years in the           ----------------------      period ended December 31, 1994, the Company operated profitably and in      the year ended December 31, 1994, net cash was provided from      operations.  For the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, in spite      of increased earnings, net cash was used for operations, principally      as a result of payments made in connection with reinsurance      transactions.            In April 1994, the Company acquired a 30% interest in Caja from      the government of Argentina for a preliminary purchase price of      approximately $46,000,000, including costs.  The preliminary purchase      price is subject to adjustment based upon the reduction in Caja's net      assets from December 31, 1993 to the acquisition date.  The Company      believes that the level of Caja's operating costs could not be      justified by its existing revenue base.  Accordingly, the new      management of Caja has implemented an extensive restructuring plan      including a substantial reduction in the number of employees and a      consolidation of Caja's offices.  The Company believes Caja's      restructuring efforts have increased its operating efficiency since      acquisition, although there can be no assurance that this will      continue.  Amounts included in the Company's results of operations for      Caja since acquisition have not been material.            Recent economic instability in Mexico has affected several Latin      American countries and has caused a withdrawal of foreign funds      invested in publicly traded Argentine government and corporate      securities, a contraction in the money supply and significantly higher      interest rates in Argentina.  Although Argentina's economic policies      appear sound, and the recently announced multi-billion dollar      international loan package for Argentina should aid its economic      program, if the liquidity crisis does not improve, the Company's      investment in Caja could suffer.  In addition, the Company's      investment is subject to the foreign currency exchange risk of a      devaluation of the Argentine peso against the United States dollar,      although the Argentine government has indicated that a devaluation is      not being considered.            During 1994, the Company invested approximately $25,000,000 in      the Russian privatization program.  Through this program, the Company      acquired equity interests in various companies through auctions      conducted by the Russian government.  Investing in the emerging      markets of Russia is subject to foreign exchange risk, political risk      and uncertainty concerning the government's ability to succeed in its      program to convert to a market economy, all of which are beyond the      Company's control.  Given these uncertainties, the Company is      accounting for these investments under the cost recovery method.       These investments have a balance of approximately $19,600,000 at      December 31, 1994.            In May 1994, the Company acquired a 615,000 square foot office      building located near Grand Central Terminal in New York City for      approximately $50,800,000.  The building has approximately 355,000      square feet of contiguous space available for occupancy.  After      certain improvements to the building are completed, the Company      intends to lease the available space to third parties.  Should lease      rates not be deemed adequate, the Company may use some of the      available space for its operations.             In July 1994, the Company acquired HSD Venture, a California      general partnership which was in reorganization proceedings under      chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, for approximately $42,000,000.  HSD      Venture is the developer and owner of two luxury condominium towers in      downtown San Diego, California.  The property includes approximately      202 residential units, of which approximately 180 are available for      sale, and approximately 42,000 square feet of retail space.        Marketing of the remaining units has commenced.                                          26                The funds for the investments described above were provided from      general corporate funds available to the Parent company.            The investment portfolios of the Company's insurance subsidiaries      are principally fixed maturity investments rated "investment grade" or      U.S. governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations, although      limited investments in "non rated" or rated less than "investment      grade" securities have been made from time to time.  The investment      strategy of the insurance subsidiaries has been to maintain a high      quality portfolio of publicly traded, fixed income securities with a      relatively short duration.  Principally as a result of increases in      market interest rates during 1994, the unrealized gain on investments      at the end of 1993 of approximately $49,912,000 (net of taxes) became      an unrealized loss of approximately $41,309,000 (net of taxes) as of      December 31, 1994.  While this has resulted in a reduction in      shareholders' equity, it had no effect on results of operations or      cash flows.  The estimated average yield to maturity of bonds and      notes in the Company's investment portfolio was higher at December 31,      1994 than at the end of the preceding year.            During the three years ended December 31, 1994, the property and      casualty insurance industry suffered unprecedented losses from natural      disasters, including the Northridge, California earthquake and winter      storms in 1994, winter storm and fire related losses in 1993 and      Hurricane Andrew in 1992.  The Company's insurance subsidiaries also      suffered certain of such losses, although as described below in      "Results of Operations," their catastrophe reinsurance programs      substantially reduced the economic losses in 1994 and 1992.  As a      result of the industry's losses, the Company has seen a notable      decrease in the availability of reinsurance at reasonable rates,      particularly at low levels of deductibility.  Although the reinsurance      programs have been completed at acceptable upper loss limits (albeit      at a somewhat increased cost), the insurance subsidiaries have been      unable to maintain previous levels of deductibility at reasonable      cost.  Accordingly, in 1995, the Company raised its retention of lower      level losses from $11,000,000 to $15,000,000.  In spite of the natural      disasters, the Company did not incur losses in excess of its maximum      reinsurance during the last three years.  Further, the Company has not      experienced any material losses to date in 1995, including losses      relating to recent storm damage in California.            On November 8, 1988, California voters passed Proposition 103, an      insurance initiative that requires, among other things, a 20% rollback      in insurance rates for policies written or renewed during the twelve      month period beginning November 8, 1988.  In November 1994, the      Colonial Penn P&C Group received an order requiring it to refund      $35,300,000, plus $21,700,000 of interest as its rollback obligation.       The Colonial Penn P&C Group disagrees with the calculation of the      assessment.  The Company is in discussions with the California      Department of Insurance and has filed a request for a formal hearing      should informal discussions fail to come to a satisfactory conclusion.       The Company believes that the ultimate resolution of this matter will      not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial      condition or results of operations and will not exceed reserves      established in prior years.            In recent years there has been significant uncertainty with      respect to potential additional assessments from the New Jersey      insurance pool for high-risk drivers.  During 1994, there were      significant legislative and other developments which resolved the      uncertainty. In February 1994, the Colonial Penn P&C Group paid      approximately $5,300,000, which had been reserved for in prior years,      representing its share of the losses of this insurance pool.            The NAIC has adopted a model law incorporating the concept of a      risk based capital ("RBC") requirement for insurance companies.       Generally, RBC is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's      statutory capital in relation to the risks inherent in the business.       The RBC formula is used by the states as an early warning tool to      identify weakly capitalized companies for the purpose of initiating      regulatory action.  Each                                             27           of the Company's insurance subsidiaries' RBC ratio as of December 31,      1994 substantially exceeded the minimum requirements.            Based on its experience since 1988 in providing collateralized      automobile loans to individuals with poor credit histories, during      1993 the Company concluded that there were excellent opportunities for      successful expansion of this business.  Accordingly, on a controlled      basis, the Company, increased its investment in these loans.  The      Company's investment in these loans was $129,512,000, $73,321,000 and      $47,890,000 at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The      Company expects to further increase its investment in these loans in      1995.            The government of El Salvador and representatives of the Company      had previously reached agreement as to the amount to be paid for the      assets of an electric utility in El Salvador in which the Company had      an interest.  Pursuant to such agreement, on March 30, 1993, the      Company received cash of approximately $5,300,000 and approximately      $12,000,000 principal amount of 6% U.S. dollar denominated El Salvador      Government bonds due in instalments through 1996.  As a result of      receiving required prepayments and the subsequent sale of the bonds in      the first quarter of 1994, the Company reported a pre-tax gain of      $8,458,000.            In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company sold its remaining      interest in Bolivian Power Company Limited ("Bolivian Power") to an      unaffiliated party for cash of approximately $18,000,000.  The Company      recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $14,500,000.            The Company's liability for unredeemed trading stamps is      estimated based on the cost of merchandise, cash and related      redemption service expenses required to redeem the trading stamps      which are expected to be presented for redemption in the future.  The      Company periodically reviews the appropriateness of the estimated      redemption rates based upon recent experience, statistical evaluations      and other relevant factors.  The most recent statistical studies of      trading stamp redemptions have indicated that the recorded liability      for unredeemed trading stamps is in excess of the amount that      ultimately will be required to redeem trading stamps outstanding.  The      amount of this excess may be different than indicated by these      studies.  Accordingly, the Company has been amortizing the aggregate      apparent excess over a five year period.  Based upon the most recent      studies, the unamortized apparent excess was approximately $5,358,000      at December 31, 1994 and $17,067,000 at December 31, 1993.  The      Company will continue to monitor current redemptions and estimates of      ultimate redemptions.            The Company is to receive, without additional consideration, the      residual interest in two subsidiaries that remain under the control of      the Wisconsin Insurance Commissioner; however the timing of receipt of      these assets is uncertain.  The Company estimates that the fair value      of the net tangible assets of these subsidiaries was approximately      $34,000,000 in excess of their carrying amount at December 31, 1994.       The underlying assets of these subsidiaries are principally invested      in high quality, interest bearing securities.            The Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including Phlcorp      and its subsidiaries, have substantial loss carryforwards and other      tax attributes (as more fully discussed in the Notes to Consolidated      Financial Statements).  The amount and availability of tax loss      carryforwards are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and      uncertainties, including, with respect to Phlcorp and its      subsidiaries, tax sharing payments pursuant to a tax settlement      agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of      Justice.  In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in      ownership could impose limitations on the use of these carryforwards,      which could reduce their value to the Company, the Company's      certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally      restrict the ability of a person or entity from accumulating at least      five percent of the Common Shares and the ability of persons or      entities now owning at least five percent of the                                             28          Common Shares from acquiring additional Common Shares.  The Company      has recognized as an asset (net of reserves) certain of the benefits      of such loss carryforwards and other tax attributes.  However, the      amount of the asset recognized only reflects the minimum Phlcorp tax      loss carryforwards and is based, in part, on certain proposed      regulations affecting the use of Phlcorp's tax loss carryforwards.  As      described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,      significant additional amounts may be available under certain      circumstances.       Results of Operations      ---------------------            The Company's most significant operations are its insurance      businesses, where it is a specialty markets provider of property and      casualty and life insurance to its niche markets.  For the year ended      December 31, 1994, the Company's insurance segments contributed 79% of      total revenues and, at December 31, 1994, constituted 78% of total      assets.            Earned premium revenues and commissions of the property and      casualty insurance operations of the Empire Group were approximately      $299,200,000 in 1994, $259,400,000 in 1993 and $243,100,000 in 1992.       The increase in 1994 principally resulted from growth in policies in      force, while the increase in 1993 was attributable to a combination of      increased premium rates and increased insurance in force.            Earned premium revenues of the Colonial Penn P&C Group were      approximately $447,200,000 in 1994, $452,600,000 in 1993 and      $456,000,000 in 1992.  The decline in earned premiums principally      reflects the Company's strategy to substantially reduce the marketing      programs employed prior to acquisition, which the Company believes      were not justified by prior operating results.  The Company's current      marketing efforts have resulted in new business, which to some degree      has offset the normal attrition of existing business.  Additionally,      the rate of decline in policies in force has slowed in each year since      acquisition of the Colonial Penn P&C Group.  The Company believes that      new business generated in 1995 will exceed lapsed business, although      there can be no assurance that this will be achieved.  Earned premiums      in 1994 and 1993 also reflect an increase, as compared to the prior      year, resulting from acquired blocks of automobile assigned risk      business from other insurance companies.            The Company's property and casualty insurance operations combined      ratios as determined under GAAP and SAP were as follows:            Year Ended December 31,                       GAAP        SAP        -----------------------                       ----        ---                      1994                                  99.1%      98.8%               1993                                  96.9%      93.7%               1992                                 101.7%     102.8%              The provision for insurance losses and policy benefits includes      natural catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, estimated      at approximately $18,300,000, $10,900,000 and $12,300,000 for the      years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The 1994      losses include approximately $11,700,000 related to the Northridge,      California earthquake and the 1992 losses include approximately      $6,000,000 related to Hurricane Andrew.              In addition to higher catastrophe losses, the combined ratio for      1994 increased as compared to 1993 principally due to settlements in      1993 of Colonial Penn P&C Group prior years claims at amounts less      than provided.  The Company believes this experience reflects its      improved underwriting procedures, emphasis on mature adult insureds,      prior rate increases and improved claims handling and settlement      practices.  Although Colonial Penn's loss experience continued to      develop favorably in 1994, the Company believes that as a result                                          29           of the reduction in claims outstanding, there will be a reduced      positive effect on future results of operations from claim      settlements, in spite of providing loss reserves on current operations      at conservative levels.  The increase in the 1994 combined ratio was      partially offset by increased fee income related to acquired blocks of      automobile assigned risk business.  Loss experience for 1992 included      a $3,000,000 retroactive assessment for a workers' compensation fund      applicable to the Empire Group.            Premium revenue receipts on IOP products of the life insurance      subsidiaries (which are not reflected as revenues) were approximately      $108,080,000 in 1994, $88,312,000 in 1993 and $68,035,000 in 1992.       The principal IOP product sold during the three year period ended      December 31, 1994 was a variable annuity product marketed directly to      consumers.              Earned premium revenues of the life and health insurance      operations were approximately $172,400,000 for 1994, $181,800,000 for      1993 and $233,700,000 for 1992.  The decline in earned premium      revenues reflect the run-off of the agent sold Medicare supplement      business, which the Company ceased marketing at December 31, 1992 due      to inadequate profitability.  In addition, the Company terminated      certain assumed life and health reinsurance contracts which had      revenues of approximately $28,750,000 for 1992 and minimal      profitability.            During 1992 the Company concluded that it would be able to      generate significant new premiums for its Graded Benefit Life business      at acquisition cost levels that result in adequate profitability.       Accordingly, the Company increased its marketing efforts with respect      to this product.  Earned premiums for this product were $113,700,000,      $109,800,000 and $109,600,000 for the years ended December 31, 1994,      1993 and 1992, respectively.            Insurance losses, policy benefits and amortization of deferred      acquisition costs of the life and health insurance operations were      $138,300,000, $179,100,000 and $261,300,000 for the years ended      December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The decrease reflects      the run-off of the agent sold Medicare supplement business and also      reflects improved loss experience in this business during 1994.  In      addition, due to expectations of decreased or inadequate future      profitability of its Single Premium Deferred Annuity ("SPDA") and      Single Premium Whole Life ("SPWL") products, in 1992 and 1993 the      Company sold blocks of such business or otherwise made permitted      exchanges, which substantially reduced the amount of remaining      policies.  The SPWL business was reinsured in 1993, resulting in a net      pre-tax gain of approximately $16,700,000.  Such net pre-tax gain      consisted of net security gains on investments sold in connection with      the transaction (approximately $24,100,000), which are included in the      caption "Net securities gains (losses)," reduced by a net loss of      approximately $7,400,000 (principally the write-off of deferred policy      acquisition costs of approximately $26,900,000, less the premium      received on the transaction), which is included in the caption      "Insurance losses, policy benefits and amortization of deferred      acquisition costs."            During 1993, the Company reinvested proceeds from sales of      certain securities at the lower prevailing interest rates.  Since      these reinvestment rates were, in certain instances, lower than had      previously been expected on certain fixed rate annuity policies, the      Company recorded an additional provision for insurance losses in the      amount of $6,800,000.            Principally starting in the fourth quarter of 1992, the Company      realized security gains and reinsured or exchanged a substantial      portion of its SPDA business.  The Company also reinvested proceeds      from security sales at prevailing interest rates lower than had been      expected on certain fixed income products.  In connection with these      transactions, the Company recorded an additional provision for      insurance losses and policy benefits of approximately $13,900,000,      principally from the elimination of deferred policy acquisition costs.       In addition, as a result of the termination of certain reinsurance      agreements in 1992, the provision for insurance                                           30           losses and policy benefits was reduced by approximately $6,200,000,      representing amounts that were no longer required.             Although manufacturing revenues in 1994 were higher than in each      of 1993 and 1992, gross profit declined significantly, principally at      the bathroom vanities division.  This division has experienced      manufacturing inefficiencies during the last three years that, in      combination with pricing pressures and provisions for obsolete      inventory, have resulted in operating losses.  During 1994, the      Company commenced a restructuring program of this division to      reevaluate and reduce existing product lines, to review the      manufacturing process and to reduce overhead.  The Company is unable      to predict if this division's restructuring efforts will result in a      return to profitability.            Trading stamps revenues declined in each of the last three years      principally due to the loss of business of certain customers.  The      Company believes that the historical decline in usage of trading      stamps will continue.  The Company provided the liability for      unredeemed trading stamps based on the estimate that approximately 75%      of stamps sold in each of the last three years ultimately will be      redeemed.  In early 1993, the Company contributed the net assets of      its motivation services business to a new joint venture formed with an      unrelated motivation services company in exchange for a 45% equity      interest in the joint venture.  The joint venture is recorded on the      equity basis of accounting.  Results of operations of the motivation      services business have not been material.            Finance revenues reflect the level of consumer instalment loans,      which increased during 1994 as discussed above.  The operating profit      applicable to this segment increased in 1993 as compared to 1992 due      to the 1992 sale of certain consumer loan development offices which      had operated at a loss.            Investment and other income was substantially unchanged in 1994      as compared to 1993 and lower in both years as compared to 1992.       Investment and other income reflects the lower level of investments      due to the disposition of the SPWL and SPDA business and lower      interest rates in both 1994 and 1993.  Other income in 1994 includes      $8,458,000 related to the disposition of the El Salvador government      bonds receivable and $14,500,000 related to the sale of the Company's      remaining shares in Bolivian Power.  Other income in 1993 includes a      $12,981,000 gain from the sale of a portion of the investment in      Bolivian Power and other income in 1992 includes a $12,128,000 gain      from sale of certain consumer loan development offices.              Net securities gains (losses) were ($12,004,000), $51,923,000 and      $51,778,000 for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992,      respectively.  Realized security losses during 1994 principally      reflected the Company's strategy to further shorten the duration of      its investment portfolio during a time of rising interest rates.       Security gains in 1993 and 1992 were realized, in part, to effect the      reinsurance and transfer of the SPWL and SPDA businesses described      above.  The decision to exit these businesses also resulted in write-      downs of deferred policy acquisition costs and additional provisions      for policyholder benefits, which do not reduce security gains but do      reduce pre-tax income.  As described above, in 1993, reserves for      policyholder benefits were also increased for certain fixed rate      annuity policies because the proceeds from security sales were      reinvested at rates lower than previously expected.  Net securities      gains (losses) include provisions for write-downs of investments of      $3,126,000, $2,000,000 and $20,041,000 for the years ended December      31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.            Higher interest expense in each of 1994 and 1993 compared to the      prior year principally reflects the increased level of borrowings      outstanding.  Interest expense also reflects the level of deposits at      AIB and AIF.  Generally, interest rates on deposits are lower than on      other available funds.  Interest expense on deposits was approximately      $8,304,000 in 1994, $9,001,000 in 1993 and $11,954,000 in 1992.                                              31                The provisions for income taxes for 1994 and 1993 were calculated      under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting      for Income Taxes", which does not reflect the benefit from utilization      of tax loss carryforwards.  The provision for income taxes for 1992      has been reduced for the benefit from utilization of tax loss      carryforwards.  The provision for income taxes for 1994 and 1993 is      below the expected normal corporate income tax rate principally      because of a reduction in the valuation allowance applicable to the      deferred tax asset due to the resolution of certain contingencies.  In      addition, the provision for income taxes for 1993 was reduced by      approximately $4,215,000 as a result of changes in federal income tax      rates.            The provision for income taxes for 1992 principally consists of      state income taxes, the federal alternative minimum income tax and      federal income taxes applicable to the life insurance subsidiaries      which cannot utilize the Company's tax loss carryforwards.  As noted      above, the tax provision for 1992 also reflects the benefit from      utilization of tax loss carryforwards.            The number of shares used to calculate primary earnings per share      was 29,101,000, 29,270,000 and 24,435,000 for 1994, 1993 and 1992,      respectively.  The number of shares used to calculate fully diluted      earnings per share was 30,857,000, 30,743,000 and 24,516,000 for 1994,      1993 and 1992, respectively.  The increase in 1994 and 1993 as      compared to 1992 was principally caused by the acquisition of the      minority interest in Phlcorp and, with respect to fully diluted per      share amounts, the effect of the assumed conversion of the Company's       5 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures.
