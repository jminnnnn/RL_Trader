Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and           Results of Operations.        The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the Company's consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and results of operations. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this Report.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Parent Company Liquidity        Leucadia National Corporation (the "Parent") is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock of its several direct subsidiaries and cash and liquid investments. The Parent continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing operations and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value. Accordingly, while the Parent does not have any material arrangement, commitment or understanding with respect thereto (except as disclosed in this Report), further acquisitions, divestitures, investments and changes in capital structure are possible. Its principal sources of funds are its available cash resources, bank borrowings, public financings, repayment of subsidiary advances, funds distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management and other fees, and borrowings and dividends from its regulated and non-regulated subsidiaries. It has no substantial recurring cash requirements other than payment of interest and principal on its debt, tax payments and corporate overhead expenses. As of December 31, 1998, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding those amounts held by its regulated subsidiaries and collateralizing letters of credit, totaled approximately $1,219,000,000. In addition, the book value of the principal amount of promissory notes received from Conseco, Inc. upon the 1997 sale of the Colonial Penn Life Group was $400,000,000 at December 31, 1998.        In 1998, the Company announced that it was considering the payment of a significant cash dividend. The Company has received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service providing that any gain realized on such a dividend (up to a maximum of approximately $812,000,000) would be treated as a capital gain. The Company anticipates that, prior to the date of its 1999 Annual Meeting scheduled for May 5, 1999, its Board of Directors will declare a dividend in an aggregate amount of approximately $812,000,000, minus amounts paid to repurchase Common Shares from March 17, 1999 through the date of declaration. Payment of such dividend would require the Company to make an offer to purchase all of its outstanding 8-1/4% Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2005 and its 7-7/8% Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2006, outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $235,000,000, at a purchase price of 101% of principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon pursuant to the terms of the indentures governing these Debentures. These offers would be required to be made within five business days after the payment of such dividend, unless the terms of the Debentures can be modified on terms that are acceptable to the Company.        Except for the Euro denominated debt of Fidei, which is described below, the Parent maintains the principal borrowings for the Company and its non-banking subsidiaries and has provided working capital to certain of its subsidiaries. These borrowings have primarily been made from banks through various credit agreement facilities and through public financings. The Company borrowed $62,300,000 under its $100,000,000 bank credit facility to fund the purchase price of Fidei, including expenses. In addition, the Company entered into currency swap agreements to hedge approximately $55,000,000 of its foreign currency exposure. The counterparties to these currency swap agreements are major financial institutions, which management believes are able to fulfill their obligations. The swap agreements mature in tranches in March 2000 and September 2001. At December 31, 1998, $65,500,000 was outstanding under the bank credit facility.                                            22        During 1998, the Company's Board of Directors increased to 6,000,000 the maximum number of its Common Shares that the Company is authorized to purchase. Through December 31, 1998, the Company repurchased in the open market 1,996,400 Common Shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $58,071,000. From January 1, 1999 through March 12, 1999, the Company acquired 1,738,570 Common Shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $52,119,000. As a result, as of March 13, 1999, the Company is authorized to repurchase 3,788,717 Common Shares.        At December 31, 1998, a maximum of approximately $25,200,000 was available to the Parent as dividends from its regulated subsidiaries without regulatory approval. Additional amounts may be available to the Parent in the form of loans or cash advances from regulated subsidiaries, although no amounts were outstanding at December 31, 1998 or borrowed to date in 1999. There are no restrictions on distributions from the non-regulated subsidiaries. The Parent also receives tax sharing payments from subsidiaries included in its consolidated income tax return, including certain regulated subsidiaries. Because of the tax loss carryforwards available to the Parent and certain subsidiaries, together with current interest deductions and corporate expenses, the amount paid by the Parent for income taxes has been substantially less than tax sharing payments received from its subsidiaries. Payments from regulated subsidiaries for dividends, tax sharing payments and other services totaled approximately $1,295,600,000 (including $1,230,000,000 relating to the sales of the Colonial Penn companies in 1997) for the year ended December 31, 1998.        Based on discussions with commercial and investment bankers, the Company believes that it has the ability to raise additional funds under acceptable conditions for use in its existing businesses or for appropriate investment opportunities. Since 1993, the Company's senior debt obligations have been rated as investment grade by S&P and Duff & Phelps Inc. Ratings issued by bond rating agencies are subject to change at any time.  Consolidated Liquidity        In 1998, net cash was used for operations, principally to purchase investments classified as trading and for the payment of income taxes, partially offset by the repayment of the Company's bridge financing to PIB, its Russian joint venture described below. In 1997, net cash was used for operations principally to fund the Company's capital commitments and bridge financing to PIB, and for the purchase of investments classified as trading.        In December 1998, a subsidiary of the Company repurchased for $42,200,000 plus accrued interest, $51,800,000 liquidation amount of 8.65% trust issued preferred securities of Leucadia Capital Trust I, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The difference between the book value and the amount paid was credited directly to shareholders' equity.        During 1998, the Company's previously announced agreement to sell substantially all of its interest in Caja to its Argentine partner was restructured and, in March 1999, the Company sold all of its interest in Caja to Assicurazioni Generali Group, an Italian insurance company, for $126,000,000 in cash and a $40,000,000 collateralized note maturing April 2001 from its Argentine partner. The Company will record a pre-tax gain of approximately $120,000,000 in its first quarter 1999 results of operations in connection with this transaction.        In September 1998, the Company reinsured, retroactive to January 1, 1998, substantially all of its remaining life insurance business to Allstate and a subsidiary thereof in an indemnity reinsurance transaction. While the premium received on this transaction was approximately $28,675,000, the gain on the reinsurance transaction was deferred and is being amortized into income based upon actuarial estimates of the premium revenue of the underlying insurance contracts. In December 1998, the Company signed an agreement to sell its                                           23  remaining life insurance subsidiaries, Charter and Intramerica, to Allstate for statutory surplus at the date of sale (approximately $62,200,000 at December 31, 1998), plus $3,575,000. The transaction is expected to result in a pre-tax gain of approximately $20,000,000, principally resulting from recognition of deferred gains from prior reinsurance transactions (including the September 1998 Allstate transaction described above). The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of 1999.        As of December 31, 1998, the Company's consolidated debt was $722,601,000 as compared to $352,872,000 as of December 31, 1997. This increase is primarily related to the Company's acquisition of 95.4% of Fidei in 1998. At December 31, 1998, the principal amount of Fidei's Euro denominated outstanding debt, all of which is non-recourse to the Company, was approximately $249,400,000 (approximately 213,656,000 Euros). Inasmuch as Fidei's Euro demoninated assets will be sold over time and such assets are presently funded with Fidei's Euro demoninated debt, the Company has determined not to acquire a currency hedge for Fidei's Euro denominated debt.        In 1996, the Company formed PIB, a joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc., to be the exclusive bottler and distributor of PepsiCo beverages in a large portion of central and eastern Russia, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakstan. The Company contributed $79,500,000 to PIB for a 75% equity interest. Effective as of January 30, 1998, the Company entered into an agreement with PepsiCo, pursuant to which, among other things, PIB repaid in full the Company's $77,705,000 bridge financing (which was funded in 1997) and the Company's equity interest in PIB was reduced to 37.9%. The agreement relieved the Company of any future funding obligation with respect to PIB and created an option, exercisable by either the Company or PepsiCo, pursuant to which PepsiCo was obligated to purchase all of the Company's interest in PIB (the "Option") for $37,000,000, plus interest. In February 1999, PepsiCo exercised the Option for approximately $39,190,000, including interest, and the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $29,545,000. However, when combined with the Company's share of the joint venture losses since inception, the Company's net loss from this investment was approximately $40,310,000.        The investment portfolios of the Company's insurance subsidiaries are principally fixed maturity investments; the balance of their portfolio consists largely of preferred securities. Of the fixed maturity securities, the majority consists of those rated "investment grade" or U.S. governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations, although limited investments in "non-rated" or rated less than investment grade securities have been made from time to time.         Principally as a result of changes in market interest rates during 1998, the unrealized gain on investments at the end of 1997 of approximately $5,630,000 (net of taxes) decreased to an unrealized loss of approximately $982,000 (net of taxes) as of December 31, 1998. While this has resulted in a decrease in shareholders' equity, it had no effect on results of operations or cash flows.        The Company provides collateralized automobile loans to individuals with poor credit histories. Prior to 1998, the Company's loan volume was in decline primarily as a result of heavy competition in this line of business. However, in 1998, the Company began to see growth in its automobile lending business as it expanded into new locations and developed new programs. The Company also benefited from the decline in competition due to the failure of certain competitors and a reduction in capital available for securitizations. In addition, in December 1998, the Company purchased a $36,900,000 sub-prime automobile portfolio. The Company's investment in automobile loans was $140,400,000, $77,607,000 and $96,338,000 at December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. During 1998, the Company's banking and lending subsidiaries sold substantially all of their executive and professional loan portfolios for aggregate proceeds of $89,500,000 and reported a pre-tax gain on these sales of approximately $6,500,000.                                            24        The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. The amount and availability of tax loss carryforwards are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. As described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, significant additional amounts of loss carryforwards may be available under certain circumstances. In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations on the use of these carryforwards, the Company's certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from accumulating at least five percent of the Common Shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning at least five percent of the Common Shares from acquiring additional Common Shares.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Property and Casualty Insurance        The Company's most significant operation is its insurance business, where it is a provider of property and casualty insurance primarily in the New York metropolitan area. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company's insurance segment contributed 57% of total revenues from continuing operations and, at December 31, 1998, constituted 25% of total assets.        Net earned premium revenues of the Empire Group were $228,600,000, $275,000,000 and $326,400,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. In 1998, the decrease in earned premium revenues was primarily due to a decline in the number of assigned risk automobile pool contracts acquired due to competition and the depopulation of the assigned risk automobile pools ($24,600,000) and a reduction in certain lines, principally voluntary commercial automobile ($8,500,000), private passenger automobile ($6,000,000), commercial package policies ($4,300,000) and workers' compensation ($3,700,000), due to tighter underwriting standards, reunderwriting and increased competition. In 1997, the decline in earned premium revenues was primarily due to the depopulation of the assigned risk pools ($31,700,000) and a reduction in certain commercial lines, principally voluntary commercial automobile ($10,200,000) and workers' compensation ($8,800,000) due to competition, reunderwriting and repricing. In addition, earned premium revenues were reduced in 1997 by $5,500,000 to record premiums due under retrospectively rated reinsurance contracts written for 1995 and prior accident years. The Empire Group re-estimated the premium due based upon its then current estimate of loss ratios for 1995 and prior accident years. Partially offsetting these reductions was an increase in certain voluntary personal lines, principally private passenger automobile and homeowners.        The Empire Group's combined ratios as determined under GAAP and SAP were as follows:                                          Year Ended December 31,                                        -----------------------                                      1998       1997        1996                                      ----       ----        ----        GAAP                          129.3%     118.5%      114.7%       SAP                           134.0%     117.8%      107.9%          The Empire Group's combined ratios increased in 1998 primarily due to the reduction in premium volume at a rate greater than the reduction in net underwriting and other costs. In addition, the reduction in servicing fees in 1998 negatively affected the expense ratios. Included in the Empire Group's results for 1998, 1997 and 1996 were approximately $42,000,000, $27,000,000 and $28,000,000, respectively, for reserve strengthening related to losses from prior accident years.                                            25        During 1998, the Empire Group reviewed the adequacy of the reserves carried for its open claims' files, focusing on workers' compensation, commercial auto and other commercial liability lines of business. Such reviews are part of the Empire Group's normal ongoing practice. Particular emphasis during this review was placed on reserves carried for the workers' compensation line of business. As part of the review, substantially all open workers' compensation claim files were reviewed for every accident year up to and including 1998. The Empire Group also conducted a comprehensive review of reserves carried for other commercial liability lines of business in which approximately 28% of the open claim files were reviewed, with a primary focus on accident years 1995 to 1997. As a result of these reviews, the Empire Group revised its assumptions regarding average claims costs and probable ultimate losses and, accordingly, reserves were strengthened by $13,000,000 for workers' compensation and $14,000,000 for other commercial liability lines of business. Additionally, during 1998, the Empire Group reorganized the commercial auto claims department. As part of this realignment, more complex claims files were reviewed by the most experienced claims examiners and assumptions regarding average claims severity and probable ultimate losses were revised and reserves were strengthened by $14,000,000 for commercial automobile lines of business.        The 1997 reserve strengthening included approximately $11,000,000 for commercial package lines of business and approximately $7,000,000 for voluntary commercial automobile lines of business. During 1997, the Empire Group reviewed the adequacy of the reserves carried for its open claims' files, as part of its normal ongoing practice, focusing on the commercial package, general liability and commercial automobile lines of business. As a result of this review and the continued unfavorable development of prior accident years losses, particularly the 1992 through 1994 accident years, the Empire Group revised its assumptions regarding future increases in average claims severity and reserves were strengthened.        The 1996 reserve strengthening included approximately $20,000,000, for voluntary commercial automobile lines of business and approximately $8,000,000 for commercial package lines of business. Beginning in 1992, the Empire Group entered into new market segments of the voluntary commercial business, including specialty programs for sanitation trucks, gas stations, fuel oil deliveries and limousines. Initially, the Empire Group based its loss ratio estimate upon its experience with similar lines of business, industry statistics and standard actuarial ultimate loss projection techniques, which consider expected loss ratios. During 1996, claims began to develop unfavorably and the Empire Group used such claim development to revise the assumptions that formed the basis of actuarial studies and reserves were increased. With respect to commercial package lines, general liability claims for business written in 1992 through 1994 also developed unfavorably. These claims showed an increased frequency of losses as well as an increase in the time between the date the loss occurred and when the loss was reported compared to prior experience. General liability claims are susceptible to the emergence of losses over an extended period of time.        For the lines of business discussed above, as well as all other property and casualty lines of business, the Company employs a variety of standard actuarial ultimate loss projection techniques, statistical analyses and case-basis evaluations to estimate its liability for unpaid losses. The actuarial projections include an extrapolation of both losses paid and incurred by business line and accident year and implicitly consider the impact of inflation and claims settlement patterns upon ultimate claim costs based upon historical patterns. These estimates are performed quarterly and consider any changes in trends and actual loss experience. Any resulting change in the estimate of the liability for unpaid losses, including those discussed above, is reflected in current year earnings during the quarter the change in estimate is identified.        The reserving process relies on the basic assumption that past experience is an appropriate basis for predicting future events. The probable effects of current developments, trends and other relevant matters are also considered. Since the establishment of loss reserves is affected by many factors, some of which are outside the Company's control or affected by future conditions, reserving for property and casualty claims is a complex and uncertain process requiring the use of informed estimates and judgements. As additional experience and                                           26  other data become available and are reviewed, the Company's estimates and judgements may be revised. While the effect of any such changes in estimates could be material to future results of operations, the Company does not expect such changes to have a material effect on its liquidity or financial condition.        In management's judgment, information currently available has been appropriately considered in estimating the Company's loss reserves. The Company will continue to evaluate the adequacy of its loss reserves on a quarterly basis, incorporating any future changes in trends and actual loss experience, and record adjustments to its loss reserves as appropriate.  Manufacturing        In December 1997, the Company completed the disposition of certain of its manufacturing operations. As a result, since December 1997, the Company's manufacturing operations solely have consisted of its plastics division. In 1998, the gross profit for the plastics division increased by 14% to approximately $21,400,000. This increase was primarily due to greater sales in most of the division's product lines and lower raw material costs. The decline in manufacturing revenues during the last three years was due to the sale of certain divisions and the discontinuance of certain non-performing product lines in 1997 and prior years. The Company recorded charges of $4,300,000 in 1997 and $3,700,000 in 1996 for losses on sales and shutdown expenses, which are primarily reflected in the caption "Selling, general and other expenses."  Banking and Lending        Finance revenues and operating profits reflect the level of consumer instalment loans, and for 1998, the sale of substantially all of the Company's executive and professional loan portfolio which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $6,500,000, as discussed above. In addition, automobile loan losses declined in 1998 and 1997. In 1997, operating profit was also adversely affected by $3,500,000 in costs to settle litigation related to a lending program that is in liquidation. In 1996, operating profit was also affected by increased interest expense on customer banking deposits.  Other        In 1998, investment and other income increased by approximately $16,300,000 primarily due to increased interest income ($63,700,000), the sale of the Company's executive and professional loan portfolio referred to above ($6,500,000) and increased income from real estate activities ($8,800,000), partially offset by reduced gains from sales of real estate and other assets ($40,700,000) and reduced income relating to the service business ($19,100,000). In 1997, investment and other income increased by approximately $81,800,000, primarily due to increased gains from sales of real estate properties ($63,500,000) including the sale of a New York City office building and increased interest income ($28,100,000) including earnings on the proceeds from the sales of the Colonial Penn Life Group and Colonial Penn P&C Group. Such increases were partially offset by reduced trading stamp and miscellaneous other revenues in 1997 and a litigation settlement gain recorded in 1996.        During 1998, due to declines in values that were deemed other than temporary, the Company recorded a pre-tax writedown of approximately $75,000,000 related to its investments in Russian and Polish debt and equity securities. Such writedowns are reflected in the caption "Net securities gains (losses)." At December 31, 1998, the remaining book value of the Company's investments in these debt and equity securities was approximately $19,000,000.        Equity in income (losses) of associated companies improved in 1998 as compared to 1997 primarily due to a reduction of approximately $48,400,000 in the Company's equity losses related to PIB resulting from                                           27  discontinuance of the equity method of accounting in early 1998 and income from an investment partnership of approximately $30,800,000. In December 1997, the Company invested $20,000,000 to acquire a limited partnership interest in this partnership. The partnership currently is in the process of liquidating and making final distributions. The Company does not anticipate that the amount of income to be realized from this investment will be significant in 1999. Equity in losses of associated companies increased in 1997 as compared to 1996 primarily due to start-up losses from the Company's equity investment in PIB of $50,481,000 in 1997 as compared to $17,104,000 in 1996. The equity in losses of associated companies included losses from the Company's investment in MK Gold of $4,251,000 in 1997 and $6,478,000 in 1996 and a write-off of $6,540,000 in 1996, representing the Company's investment in an unsuccessful well drilled by its Siberian oil exploration joint venture.        Interest expense primarily reflects the level of external borrowings outstanding throughout the periods. The reduction in interest expense in 1997 was primarily due to the decline in such borrowings.        The decrease in selling, general and other expenses in 1998 as compared to 1997 principally reflects decreased expenses of the manufacturing segment principally as a result of the sale of certain divisions in 1997, decreased pension expense due to the recognition of net curtailment gains of $6,500,000, a 1997 charge for estimated costs to settle litigation relating to a lending program that is in liquidation and lower provisions for bad debts. The decrease in selling, general and other expenses in 1997 as compared to 1996 principally reflects the Empire Group's decreased expenses related to reduced premium volume, decreased operating expenses of real estate properties, decreased expenses relating to certain investment activities and lower provisions for bad debts. This decrease was partially offset by the losses recorded by the manufacturing segment related to sold divisions and the charge for estimated costs to settle litigation relating to a lending program that is in liquidation.        Income taxes for 1998 reflect a benefit of approximately $39,000,000 for a change in the Company's estimated 1997 federal tax liability and the favorable resolution of certain contingencies. The 1997 and 1996 income tax benefits were greater than the expected normal corporate tax rate primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain contingencies.        As discussed above, in December 1998, the Company signed an agreement to sell its remaining life insurance subsidiaries, Charter and Intramerica, to Allstate. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of 1999. In 1998, the Company classified these life insurance operations as discontinued operations and the consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been restated to be consistent with such presentation.        The number of shares used to calculate basic earnings (loss) per share was 63,409,000, 62,205,000 and 60,301,000 for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings (loss) per share was 63,510,000, 62,205,000 and 60,301,000 for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. For diluted per share amounts, the Company's 5-1/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2003 (which were redeemed in 1997) were not assumed to have been converted since the effect of such assumed conversion would have been to increase earnings per share.  Year 2000 and Information Technology Systems        The Company is in the process of evaluating its information technology systems to determine the potential impact of the Year 2000. The Year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits (rather than four) to define the applicable year. Any programs that have time-sensitive software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000, which could result in miscalculations or                                           28  system failures. As a result, before the end of 1999, computer hardware and software may need to be upgraded with new hardware and software which can distinguish 21st century dates from 20th century dates.        Since 1996, the Company has been evaluating its Year 2000 readiness. Its program to address its Year 2000 readiness consists of (i) the preparation of an inventory of all computer related hardware and software, all non-computer related hardware that may have embedded technology and all third parties that are material to the Company's business operations, (ii) the identification of a senior officer at each of the Company's operating subsidiaries and significant investments to be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Year 2000 program and reporting on compliance therewith to the Company's senior management, (iii) the identification of mission critical aspects of the Company's business, and assessment of the Year 2000 readiness of such mission critical systems and components, (iv) the development of a plan to upgrade, repair or replace systems as required for Year 2000 compliance, (v) the development of a plan to test the readiness of all critical systems, (vi) making inquiry of material third parties as to the state of their Year 2000 compliance, and (vii) as appropriate, the development of a contingency plan for either non-compliant internal systems or non-compliant material third parties. Where appropriate, outside consultants have been engaged to advise the Company on its Year 2000 readiness. Substantially all of the Company's operations have completed the inventory and identification process and are in the process of upgrading and testing critical systems. The Company's primary focus during the balance of 1999 will be on continued testing of mission critical systems and software provider upgrades, as well as monitoring the readiness of material third parties.        In 1996, the Empire Group began to evaluate its information technology systems and their ability to support future business needs. This led to a decision to acquire new policy management and accounting systems. These systems provide enhanced functionality and improved processing for underwriting, claims, billing, collection, reinsurance, reporting and accounting and are designed to be Year 2000 compliant. The Empire Group anticipates that these new systems will be fully implemented in 1999 and that any non-compliant programs will become compliant during 1999. All but one of the manufacturing operation's material systems (involving the storage of historical information) have tested as being Year 2000 compliant. The Company is exploring alternative systems to maintain this information. Until an acceptable replacement for this system can be found, the Company can maintain these records in hard copy. The banking and lending operations have successfully completed testing of mission critical systems and testing of non-mission critical systems is currently underway. In addition, deposit customers have been sent letters to inform them about the Year 2000 issue and to educate them about the progress made in addressing this issue.        The Year 2000 issue may affect other entities with which the Company transacts business. The Company has made inquiry of third parties with whom it has material relationships as to the Year 2000 compliance of such third parties. Many of such parties have reported plans to be fully compliant by the end of 1999 and most have reported substantial progress at the end of 1998. However, at this time the Company cannot predict the effect of the Year 2000 on its material third parties or the impact any deficiency in the Year 2000 readiness of such parties could have on the Company.        Through December 31, 1998, expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the Year 2000 issue (excluding expenses related to the Empire Group's acquisition of new systems, which was not motivated by Year 2000 concerns) did not exceed $500,000. Based upon current information, the Company does not expect that the Year 2000 issue will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.  Cautionary Statement for Forward-Looking Information        Statements included in this Report may contain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of                                           29  1995. Such statements may relate, but are not limited, to projections of revenues, income or loss, capital expenditures, fluctuations in insurance reserves, plans for growth and future operations (including Year 2000 compatibility), competition and regulation as well as assumptions relating to the foregoing.

Future events and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by or underlying the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by any such statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed or identified from time to time in the Company's public filings, including general economic and market conditions, changes in foreign and domestic laws, regulations and taxes, changes in competition and pricing environments, regional or general changes in asset valuation, the occurrence of significant natural disasters, the inability to reinsure certain risks economically, the adequacy of loss reserves, prevailing interest rate levels, weather related conditions that may affect the Company's operations, the difficulty in identifying hardware and software that may not be Year 2000 compliant, the lack of success of third parties to adequately address the Year 2000 issue, vendor delays and technical difficulties affecting the Company's ability to upgrade or replace its hardware and/or software for Year 2000 compliance, and changes in the composition of the Company's assets and liabilities through acquisitions or divestitures. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which are applicable only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this Report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.                                            30  Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.        The following includes "forward-looking statements" that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.        The Company's market risk arises principally from interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio, its borrowing activities and the banking and lending activities of certain subsidiaries. The Company does not enter into material derivative financial instrument transactions.        The Company's investment portfolio is primarily classified as available for sale, and consequently, is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in shareholders' equity. Included in the Company's investment portfolio are fixed income securities, which comprised approximately 90% of the Company's total investment portfolio at December 31, 1998. These fixed income securities are primarily rated "investment grade" or are U.S. governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations, although limited investments in "non-rated" or rated less than investment grade securities have been made from time to time. The estimated weighted average remaining life of these fixed income securities was approximately 2.5 years at December 31, 1998. The Company's fixed income securities, like all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. At December 31, 1998, the Company's portfolio of trading securities was not material. The Company manages the investment portfolio of its insurance subsidiaries to preserve principal, maintain a high level of quality, comply with applicable insurance industry regulations and achieve an acceptable rate of return. In addition, the Company considers the duration of its insurance reserves in comparison with that of its investments.        The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its long-term fixed interest rate debt and the Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of its subsidiary trust holding solely subordinated debt securities of the Company. Generally, the fair market value of debt and preferred securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall, and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise.        The Company's banking and lending operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference between the amount of the interest-earning assets and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities that are prepaid/withdrawn, mature or reprice in specified periods. The principal objectives of the Company's banking and lending asset/liability management activities are to provide maximum levels of net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and to facilitate funding needs. The Company utilizes an interest rate sensitivity model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk that is present. The model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on the projected net interest margin over the ensuing twelve-month period. Derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, may be used to modify the Company's indicated net interest sensitivity to levels deemed to be appropriate based on risk management policies and the Company's current economic outlook. Counterparties to such agreements are major financial institutions, which the Company believes are able to fulfill their obligations; however, if they are not, the Company believes that any losses are unlikely to be material.        The following table provides information about the Company's financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For investment securities and debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates. For the variable rate notes receivable and variable rate borrowings, the weighted average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. For loans, securities and liabilities with contractual maturities, the table presents contractual principal cash flows adjusted for the Company's historical experience of loan prepayments and prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. For banking and lending's variable rate products, the weighted average variable rates are based upon the respective pricing index at the reporting date. For money market                                           31  deposits that have no contractual maturity, the table presents principal cash flows based on the Company's historical experience and management's judgment concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts by contractual maturity date.                                                   32                                                                        Expected Maturity Date                                                                     ----------------------                                        1999         2000         2001        2002        2003   Thereafter       Total    Fair Value                                        ----         ----         ----        ----        ----   ----------       -----    ----------                                                                          (Dollars in thousands)                  THE COMPANY, EXCLUDING                                                                                         BANKING AND LENDING:                                                                                         RATE SENSITIVE ASSETS:                                                                                        Available for Sale Fixed                                                                                        Income Securities:                                                                                            U.S. Government                    $783,303     $146,339      $9,306     $198,045     $12,784   $160,629    $1,310,406  $1,310,406     Weighted Average                                                                                               Interest Rate                      5.08%        5.91%       7.17%        6.38%       5.86%      6.22%      Other Fixed Maturities:                                                                                         Rated Investment Grade             $7,555       $3,808     $15,020       $2,832     $18,112    $46,063       $93,390     $93,390       Weighted Average                                                                                               Interest Rate                    6.84%        8.03%       9.35%       12.15%       7.29%      7.99%        Rated Less Than                                                                                                 Investment Grade/Not                                                                                          Rated                           $20,440      $25,727     $18,040      $33,598     $10,248    $11,575      $119,628    $119,628       Weighted Average                                                                                               Interest Rate                    9.26%        1.84%       2.04%        5.12%       6.80%      8.05%     Held to Maturity Fixed                                                                                          Income Securities:                                                                                            U.S. Government                        $774           $-          $-       $5,230          $-     $2,148        $8,152      $8,481    Weighted Average                                                                                            Interest Rate                       6.75%            -
