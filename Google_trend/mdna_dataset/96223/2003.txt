Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results         ------------------------------------------------------------------------         of Operations.         --------------       The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the Company's consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and results of operations. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this Report.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Parent Company Liquidity       Leucadia National Corporation (the "Parent") is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock of its direct subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents and other investments. The Parent continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing operations and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value. Accordingly, while the Parent does not have any material arrangement, commitment or understanding with respect thereto (except as disclosed in this Report), further acquisitions, divestitures, investments and changes in capital structure are possible. Its principal sources of funds are its available cash resources, bank borrowings, public and private capital market transactions, repayment of subsidiary advances, funds distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management and other fees, and borrowings and dividends from its regulated and non-regulated subsidiaries. It has no substantial recurring cash requirements other than payment of interest and principal on its debt, tax payments and corporate overhead expenses.       As of December 31, 2002, the Company's readily available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding those amounts held by its regulated subsidiaries, totaled $680,000,000. This amount is comprised of cash and short-term bonds and notes of the United States Government and its agencies of $375,600,000 (55%), the equity investment in WMIG of $121,100,000 (18%) (which can be sold privately or otherwise in compliance with the securities laws and is subject to a registration rights agreement), and other publicly traded debt and equity securities aggregating $183,300,000 (27%). Additional sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2002 include $170,100,000 of cash and marketable securities primarily collateralizing letters of credit.                                        18        During 2002, the Internal Revenue Service completed the audit of the Company's consolidated federal income tax returns for the years 1996 through 1999, without any material tax payment required from the Company. As a result of this favorable resolution of various federal income tax contingencies, the income tax provision for 2002 reflects a benefit from the reversal of tax reserves aggregating approximately $120,000,000.       In December 2002, the Company completed a private placement of approximately $150,000,000 of equity securities, based on a common share price of $35.25, to mutual fund clients of Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC, including the funds comprising the Franklin Mutual Series Funds. The Company issued 2,907,599 common shares and newly authorized Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, that were converted into 1,347,720 common shares in March 2003. The securities sold in the private placement represent 7.1% of the Company's outstanding common shares at March 25, 2003.       In December 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of 44% of the outstanding common stock of WilTel, for an aggregate purchase price, excluding expenses, of $330,000,000. The WilTel stock was acquired by the Company under the chapter 11 restructuring plan of WCG pursuant to a claims purchase agreement with The Williams Companies, Inc. and an investment agreement with WCG. In October 2002, in a private transaction, the Company purchased 1,700,000 shares of WilTel common stock, on a when issued basis, for $20,400,000. Together, these transactions resulted in the Company acquiring 47.4% of the outstanding common stock of WilTel.       The Company entered into a stockholders agreement with WilTel pursuant to which the Company designated four members of WilTel's newly constituted nine member board of directors. As long as the Company maintains an ownership interest in WilTel of at least 20%, WilTel agreed to use its best efforts to cause WilTel's board to nominate four Leucadia nominees in the future. In addition, the Company agreed to certain restrictions on its ability to increase its ownership in WilTel above 49% during the first two years after its acquisition, and certain other restrictions on its ability to increase its ownership during the first five years after its acquisition. While the stockholders agreement and WilTel's charter restrict the transferability of WilTel's securities, the Company does have the ability to sell an amount of WilTel shares equal to 15% of the total outstanding WilTel shares. The Company has no current intention to sell its WilTel stock, and although it has a registration rights agreement with respect to its interest in WilTel, the Company does not consider this investment to be liquid.       WilTel's current focus is to retain its existing business by providing a high quality of service, to obtain new business if it can be done on a profitable basis, to reduce its operating expenses to the greatest extent possible, and to conserve liquidity. At December 31, 2002, WilTel had $291,300,000 of cash and cash equivalents to meet its cash requirements, and believes that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its needs through 2004. WilTel has $375,000,000 of senior debt outstanding under its credit facility, of which approximately $157,000,000 matures during 2005. Unless WilTel is able to generate significant cash flows from operations through revenue growth, expense reductions or some combination of both, it is likely that new capital will have to be raised to meet its maturing debt obligations in 2005.       In December 2002, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase certain debt and equity securities of WebLink, for an aggregate purchase price of $19,000,000. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company acquired outstanding secured notes of WebLink with a principal amount of $36,500,000 and, upon receipt of approval from the FCC, will acquire approximately 80% of the outstanding common stock of WebLink.                                         19        During the second quarter of 2002, the Company sold its interest in Fidei, its foreign real estate subsidiary, to an unrelated third party for total proceeds of 70,400,000 Euros ($66,200,000), and recorded an increase to shareholders' equity of $12,100,000. Although the Euro denominated sale proceeds were not converted into US dollars immediately upon receipt, the Company did enter into a participating currency derivative, which expired in September 2002. Upon expiration, net of the premium paid to purchase the contract, the Company received $67,900,000 in exchange for 70,000,000 Euros and recognized a foreign exchange gain of $2,000,000. In connection with the sale, the Company classified its foreign real estate operations as discontinued operations.       In November 2002, the Company sold its 40% equity interest in certain thoroughbred racetrack businesses for net proceeds of approximately $28,000,000, and recorded a pre-tax gain of $14,300,000. As part of this transaction, the Company has an approximately 15% profits interest in a joint venture formed with the buyer of the businesses to pursue the potential development and management of gaming ventures in Maryland, including slot machines and video lottery terminals (if authorized by state law). The Company has no funding obligations for this joint venture. The Company is unable to currently determine the value, if any, of this profits interest.       The Parent maintains the principal borrowings for the Company and its non-banking subsidiaries and has provided working capital to certain of its subsidiaries. These borrowings have primarily been made from banks through the Company's credit agreement facility and through public financings. In March 2003, the Company entered into a new $110,000,000 unsecured bank credit facility that matures in three years and bears interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate or the prime rate.       As of March 25, 2003, the Company is authorized to repurchase an additional 4,490,000 common shares. Such purchases may be made from time to time in the open market, through block trades or otherwise. Depending on market conditions and other factors, such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice.       At December 31, 2002, a maximum of $10,200,000 was available to the Parent as dividends from its regulated subsidiaries without regulatory approval. There are no restrictions on distributions from non-regulated subsidiaries. The Parent also receives tax sharing payments from subsidiaries included in its consolidated income tax return, including certain regulated subsidiaries. Payments from regulated subsidiaries for dividends and tax sharing payments totaled $7,100,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002.       Based on discussions with commercial and investment bankers, the Company believes that it has the ability to raise additional funds under acceptable conditions for use in its existing businesses or for appropriate investment opportunities. Standard & Poor's and Duff & Phelps Inc. have rated the Company's senior debt obligations as investment grade since 1993, while Moody's Investors Services, Inc. rates the Company's senior debt obligations below investment grade. Ratings issued by bond rating agencies are subject to change at any time.  Consolidated Liquidity       In 2002, net cash was provided by operating activities, principally as a result of a reduction to the Company's investment in the trading portfolio. In 2001 and 2000, net cash was used for operations, reflecting lower investment income on corporate investments as a result of the special dividend payment of $811,900,000 in 1999, payment of the Parent's interest and overhead expenses and a reduction of payables related to the trading portfolio.                                         20        The Company's consolidated banking and lending operations had outstanding loans (net of unearned finance charges) of $373,600,000 and $521,200,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. At December 31, 2002, 55% were loans to individuals generally collateralized by automobiles; 38% were loans to consumers, substantially all of which were collateralized by real or personal property; 4% were loans to small businesses; and 3% were unsecured loans. The banking and lending segment is no longer making consumer loans and is in the process of liquidating its remaining portfolio. These loans were primarily funded by deposits generated by the Company's deposit-taking facilities and by brokers. The Company intends to use the cash flows generated from its loan portfolios to retire these deposits as they mature, which the Company expects will be substantially complete by the end of 2005. The Company's customer banking deposits totaled $392,900,000 and $476,500,000 as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.       As previously stated, AIB stopped originating new sub-prime automobile loans in September 2001, and both AIB and AIF ceased originating all other consumer loans in January 2003. The FDIC and OCC have supported these actions taken with respect to the sub-prime portfolio. However, effective February 2003, AIB entered into a formal agreement with the OCC, agreeing to develop a written strategic plan subject to prior OCC approval for the continued operations of AIB, to continue to maintain certain risk-weighted capital levels, to obtain prior approval before paying any dividends, to provide certain monthly reports and to comply with certain other criteria. AIB will also be unable to accept brokered deposits during the period the agreement remains in effect. In the event AIB fails to comply with the agreement, the OCC would have the authority to assert formal charges and seek other statutory remedies and AIB may also be subject to civil monetary penalties. AIB is complying with the agreement and, given that it has ceased all lending activities, the agreement is not expected to have a significant impact on its operations. However, no assurance can be given that other regulatory actions will not be taken.       The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have or have had tax loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations on the use of the tax loss carryforwards, the Company's certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from accumulating five percent or more of the common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning five percent or more of the common shares from acquiring additional common shares. The restrictions will remain in effect until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2005, (b) the repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any comparable successor provision) and (c) the beginning of a taxable year of the Company to which certain tax benefits may no longer be carried forward.       As shown below, at December 31, 2002, the Company's contractual cash obligations totaled $807,472,000. The Company's debt instruments require maintenance of minimum Tangible Net Worth, limit distributions to shareholders and limit Indebtedness, as defined in the agreements. In addition, the debt instruments contain limitations on investments, liens, contingent obligations and certain other matters. The Company is in compliance with all of these restrictions, and the Company has the ability to incur additional indebtedness or make distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions.                                                                                        Payments Due by Period (in thousands)                                                              -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                             Less than 1 Contractual Cash Obligations                                 Total             Year       1-3 Years     4-5 Years    After 5 Years - ----------------------------                                 -----          -----------   ---------     ---------    -------------             Customer Banking Deposits                                   $392,904        $283,613      $ 89,959        $ 19,332        $   -- Long-Term Debt                                               233,073           3,647        27,124          39,815         162,487 Operating Leases, net of Sublease Income                      83,295           4,946         7,770           6,829          63,750 Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust                      98,200            --            --              --            98,200                                                             --------        --------      --------        --------        -------- Total Contractual Cash Obligations                          $807,472        $292,206      $124,853        $ 65,976        $324,437                                                             ========        ========      ========        ========        ========                                            21      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       At December 31, 2002, the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees aggregating $265,500,000. The Company's guarantee of 10% of Berkadia's financing incurred in connection with the Berkadia Loan represents $217,500,000 of that total, $65,000,000 of which expired in connection with payments of principal on the Berkadia Loan in the first quarter of 2003. To the extent that future principal payments are received under the Berkadia Loan prior to maturity, such amounts will be used to paydown the Berkadia financing and the remaining $152,500,000 guarantee will expire proportionally at such times. The Berkadia Loan matures in August 2006.       Prior to the sale of CDS, the Company had agreed to provide project improvement bonds primarily for the benefit of the City of San Marcos for the San Elijo Hills project, which are required prior to the commencement of any project development. These bonds provide funds primarily to the City in the event that CDS is unable or unwilling to complete certain infrastructure improvements in the San Elijo Hills project. CDS is responsible for paying all third party fees related to obtaining the bonds. Should the City or others draw on the bonds for any reason, CDS and one of its subsidiaries would be obligated to reimburse the Company for the amount drawn. At December 31, 2002, the amount of outstanding bonds was $30,000,000, of which $25,400,000 expires in less than one year. The Company's remaining guarantee at December 31, 2002 is an $18,000,000 indemnification in connection with the financing of a real estate property.  Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates       The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.       The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision that is charged to expense. As of December 31, 2002, the Company's allowance for loan losses was $31,800,000 or 8.5% of the related outstanding loan receivable balance of $373,600,000. The allowance for loan losses is an amount that the Company believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in its portfolio based on the Company's evaluations of the collectibility of loans and prior loan loss experience. Factors considered by the Company include actual experience, current economic trends, aging of the loan portfolio and collateral value. During periods of economic weakness, delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses generally increase. These periods may also be accompanied by decreased demand and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding loans, which weakens collateral coverage and increases the amount of a loss in the event of default. In addition, incentives offered by the automobile industry on new cars affect the supply of used cars and the value the Company may realize upon sale of repossessed automobiles. The allowance is based on judgments and assumptions and the actual loss experience may be different.       The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred taxes to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. If the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment would increase income in such period. Similarly, if the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred taxes in the future, an adjustment would be charged to income in such period. The Company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities related to potential exposure.                                         22        The Company accounts for its investment in Berkadia under the equity method of accounting. Although the Company has no cash investment in Berkadia, the Company has a contingent liability resulting from its guarantee of 10% of the third party financing provided to Berkadia. The total amount of the Company's guarantee is $152,500,000 as of March 7, 2003. Since the Company does not expect that Berkadia will suffer losses resulting in the Company having to fund its guarantee obligation, no reserve has been recorded.       As of December 31, 2002, the carrying amount of the Company's investment in the mining properties of MK Gold was approximately $59,300,000. The recoverability of this asset is entirely dependent upon the success of MK Gold's mining project at the Las Cruces copper deposit in the Pyrite Belt of Spain. Mining will be subject to obtaining required permits, obtaining both debt and equity financing for the project, engineering and construction. The market price of copper has been depressed over the past couple of years, reflecting generally weak global economic conditions. The amount of financing that can be obtained for the project and its related cost will be significantly affected by the assessment of potential lenders of the current and expected future market price of copper. In addition, the actual price of copper, the operating cost of the mine and the capital cost to bring the mine into production will affect the recoverability of this asset. Based on the current status of the project and MK Gold's estimate of future financing costs and future cash flows, the Company believes the asset is recoverable.  Banking and Lending       Finance revenues, which reflect the level and mix of consumer instalment loans, decreased in 2002 as compared to 2001 due to fewer average loans outstanding. Average loans outstanding were $440,800,000, $545,000,000 and $423,000,000 for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This decline was primarily due to the Company's decision in September 2001 to stop originating subprime automobile loans. Although finance revenues decreased in 2002 as compared to 2001, pre-tax results increased primarily due to a $13,700,000 reduction in interest expense, due to reduced customer banking deposits and lower interest rates thereon, a net change of $10,000,000 in the accounting for the market values of interest rate swaps (discussed below), a decline in the provision for loan losses of $7,100,000, and lower salaries expense and operating costs resulting from the segment's restructuring efforts. These changes were partially offset by higher interest paid on interest rate swaps of $4,100,000.       In 2002, the banking and lending segment's provision for loan losses decreased as compared to the prior year primarily due to the decline in loans outstanding, although as a percent of outstanding loans it increased due to increased loss experience, particularly in the subprime automobile portfolio. The Company believes this loss experience reflects the difficulties experienced by subprime borrowers in the current economy. At December 31, 2002, the allowance for loan losses for the Company's entire loan portfolio was $31,800,000 or 8.5% of the net outstanding loans, compared to $35,700,000 or 6.8% of net outstanding loans at December 31, 2001.       The Company's remaining consumer lending programs have primarily consisted of marine, recreational vehicle, motorcycle and elective surgery loans. Due to current economic conditions, portfolio performance and the relatively small size of these loan portfolios and target markets, in January 2003 the Company stopped originating all consumer loans. The Company is considering its alternatives for its banking and lending operations, which could include selling or liquidating some or all of its loan portfolios, and outsourcing certain functions.                                         23        Although finance revenues increased in 2001 as compared to 2000, pre-tax results declined primarily due to a larger provision for loan losses, changes in market values of interest rate swaps, higher interest paid on interest rate swaps, charges recorded in connection with the Company's decision to stop originating new subprime automobile loans and to consolidate all operations in Salt Lake City, and higher interest expense due to the increased customer banking deposits through September of 2001. In 2001, the banking and lending segment's provision for loan losses increased $13,000,000 as compared to the prior year. This increase primarily reflected higher net charge-offs, for which the Company believes a weaker economy and increased bankruptcies were contributing factors, and an increase in the rates used by the Company to establish the allowance for loan losses in recognition of its increased loss experience. Pre-tax results for the banking and lending segment for 2001 also included $7,100,000 of charges related to consolidating all operations in Salt Lake City.       Pre-tax results for the banking and lending segment include income (expense) of $3,500,000 and ($6,500,000) for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, resulting from mark-to-market changes on its interest rate swaps. The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rate changes on its customer banking deposits. Although the Company believes that these derivative financial instruments serve as economic hedges, they do not meet certain effectiveness criteria under SFAS 133 and, therefore, are not accounted for as hedges.  Manufacturing       Manufacturing revenues for the plastics division declined approximately 5% in 2002 as compared to 2001 primarily due to reductions in the consumer products market of $3,800,000, partially offset by increases in the construction market of $1,200,000. The reductions in the consumer products market resulted from the loss of a customer for the Asian market and for its consumer dust wipe products, and reduced demand for one of the Company's healthcare products. Gross profit was largely unchanged for 2002 as compared to 2001, reflecting cost reduction initiatives that reduced labor costs, improved material utilization and reduced non-resin raw material costs.       For the year ended December 31, 2002, the division recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1,250,000 to write down the book value of certain production lines that the division does not expect will be utilized over the next several years. These lines were initially purchased to provide additional capacity to produce a specific product for a specific customer; however, the customer discontinued the product in 2001 and the Company no longer believes that the cost of these lines are currently recoverable from other business. When the division's customer discontinued the product and terminated their contract in 2001, they were required to pay the division a termination payment of $3,500,000, which was recognized as other income in 2001. The division did not record an impairment charge in 2001 since its expected production volume for these lines would have resulted in future cash flows that did not support an impairment charge at that time.       Manufacturing revenues, gross profit and pre-tax results for the plastics division declined in 2001 as compared to 2000. Of the $11,400,000 decline in manufacturing revenues in 2001, the most significant reduction was in the consumer products market, which declined by $7,300,000. This decline was primarily due to a customer for the Asian market no longer using one of the Company's products and a lower than anticipated demand for consumer dust wipe products. In addition, increased competition in the agriculture, home furnishing and packaging markets and customer inventory reductions in the construction and certain industrial markets also contributed to the reduction in sales in 2001. Gross profit for 2001 declined primarily due to the decline in sales and higher fixed costs related to the Belgium manufacturing facility. The decline in pre-tax income in 2001 was partially offset by the contract termination gain referred to above.                                         24   Domestic Real Estate       Revenues from domestic real estate declined in 2002 as compared to 2001 as a result of lower gains from property sales of $16,400,000, and less rent income of $7,300,000 largely due to the sale of one of the Company's shopping centers in 2001 and two shopping centers during 2002, partially offset by increased revenues from the Company's Hawaiian hotel, which the Company began operating in the third quarter of 2001. The decline in pre-tax income also reflects greater operating costs, principally related to the Hawaiian hotel and a $1,300,000 write-down of a mortgage receivable.       During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company sold one of its real estate subsidiaries, CDS, to HomeFed for a purchase price of $25,000,000, consisting of $1,000,000 in cash and 24,742,268 shares of HomeFed's common stock, which represents approximately 30.3% of the outstanding HomeFed stock. CDS's principal asset is the master-planned community located in San Diego County, California known as San Elijo Hills, for which HomeFed has served as the development manager since 1998. The deferred gain on this sale of approximately $12,100,000 at December 31, 2002, will be recognized into income as the San Elijo Hills project is developed and sold. The Company is accounting for its investment in HomeFed under the equity method of accounting. Income recognized representing its share of HomeFed's earnings in 2002 was not material. Prior to the sale to HomeFed, the Company recognized pre-tax gains of $7,800,000 from sales of residential sites at San Elijo Hills during 2002.       The reduction in revenues and pre-tax income from domestic real estate in 2001 as compared to the prior year was principally due to the foreclosure gains recorded in 2000 and lower gains from property sales, net of costs. During 2001, the Company sold 691 residential sites and a school site resulting in pre-tax gains of $18,100,000 at San Elijo Hills.  Other       Investment and other income declined in 2002 as compared to 2001 principally due to reductions in gains from domestic property sales and rent income as discussed above, a reduction of $20,600,000 in investment income resulting from a decline in interest rates and a lower amount of invested assets, a decline of $9,200,000 in revenues from the Company's gas operations principally due to lower production and prices, and the gain recognized in 2001 of $6,300,000 from the sale of the Company's investment in two inactive insurance companies. The decreases were partially offset by a $14,300,000 gain from the sale of certain thoroughbred racetrack businesses and increased revenues from the Company's Hawaiian hotel of $8,200,000.       Investment and other income declined in 2001 as compared to 2000 in part from non-recurring income recognized in 2000 totaling $25,900,000, primarily consisting of foreclosure gains from certain domestic real estate properties of $10,700,000, a prepayment penalty related to certain promissory notes of $7,500,000 and a gain from the sale of a corporate owned aircraft of $7,700,000. In addition, investment and other income declined in 2001 due to decreased gains from sales of various domestic real estate properties of $8,500,000 and a reduction in revenues related to MK Gold of $10,100,000. Such decreases were partially offset by the 2001 gain from the sale of the Company's investment in two inactive insurance companies referred to above and increased revenues from the Company's oil and gas operations of $6,200,000.       Net securities gains (losses) for 2002 include a provision of $37,100,000 to write down the Company's investments in certain available for sale securities and its equity investment in a non-public fund. The write down of the available for sale securities resulted from a decline in market value determined to be other than temporary. Net securities gains (losses) for 2000 include pre-tax security gains related to the Company's investments in Fidelity National Financial, Inc. ($90,900,000) and Jordan Telecommunication Products, Inc. ($24,800,000).                                         25        For 2002, the Company recognized $91,400,000 of pre-tax income from its equity investments in associated companies as compared to $24,600,000 of pre-tax losses for 2001. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to income from the Company's equity investment in Berkadia of $65,600,000 as compared to a loss from this investment of $70,400,000 in 2001, and $24,100,000 of income from the Company's equity investment in Olympus, an investment the Company made in December 2001. These increases were partially offset by a $11,900,000 decline in income from its investment in JPOF II, from which the Company recorded $15,200,000 of income in 2002, and a loss of $13,400,000 from the Company's equity investment in WilTel, representing the Company's share of WilTel's losses under the equity method of accounting.       For 2002, the Company's equity in the income of Berkadia consisted of pre-tax income of $59,000,000 related to the amortization of the discount on the Berkadia Loan and $6,600,000 from its share of the net interest spread on the Berkadia Loan. For 2001, the Company's equity in the loss of Berkadia consisted of a pre-tax loss of $94,400,000 for its share of FINOVA's losses under the equity method of accounting, $20,100,000 of pre-tax income related to the amortization of the discount on the Berkadia Loan and $3,900,000 of pre-tax income from its share of the net interest spread on the Berkadia Loan. As more fully described in Note 3 to the Company's consolidated financial statements, Berkadia's initial investment in the FINOVA stock and the Berkadia Loan are determined based upon the relative fair values of the securities received in exchange for the funds transferred to FINOVA. The fair value assigned to the FINOVA stock was based upon the trading price of FINOVA's common stock on the day the FINOVA stock was received, was far in excess of FINOVA's net worth and was inconsistent with the Company's view that the FINOVA common stock has a very limited value. Subsequent to acquisition, and principally as a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Berkadia recorded its share of FINOVA's losses in an amount that reduced Berkadia's investment in FINOVA's common stock to zero in 2001.       The book value of the Company's equity investment in Berkadia was negative $72,100,000 and negative $129,000,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The negative carrying amount principally results from Berkadia's distribution of loan fees received and the Company's recognition in 2001 of its share of FINOVA's losses under the equity method of accounting. This negative carrying amount is being amortized into income over the term of the Berkadia Loan, and effectively represents an unamortized discount on the Berkadia Loan.       Since its acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company has recorded its share of WilTel's losses under the equity method of accounting. As a result of its emergence from bankruptcy proceedings and its continued restructuring of its operations, WilTel has reduced its headcount, operating costs and interest expense. However, despite these cost reductions, the Company believes that WilTel will continue to report losses from continuing operations for the foreseeable future. Even if WilTel is able to generate breakeven cash flow from operations, substantial depreciation charges will still result in losses from continuing operations over the next several years. The Company will record its 47.4% share of these losses in its statements of operations, and the recognition of these losses could reduce the carrying amount of its investment in WilTel to zero. The Company will not record any further losses in WilTel if and when its investment is reduced to zero, unless the Company has guaranteed any of WilTel's obligations, or otherwise has committed or intends to commit to provide further financial support. The Company has not provided any such guarantees or commitments.       For 2001, the Company recognized $24,600,000 of pre-tax losses from its equity investments in associated companies as compared to $29,300,000 of pre-tax income for 2000. The loss in 2001 was primarily due to a loss of $70,400,000, representing the Company's share of the loss recorded by Berkadia, as described above. The Company's loss related to Berkadia was partially offset by income from other equity investments, the most significant of which related to JPOF II. The Company recognized income from its investment in JPOF II of $27,100,000 and $17,300,000 in 2001 and 2000, respectively.                                         26        The decline in interest expense for 2002 as compared to 2001 primarily reflects lower interest expense at the banking and lending segment due to reduced customer banking deposits and lower interest rates thereon.       Salaries expense in 2001 primarily reflects decreased expenses related to lower bonus expense.       Selling, general and other expenses increased in 2001 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher provisions for loan losses and charges recorded in connection with consolidating the banking and lending operations referred to above, partially offset by lower expenses related to MK Gold.       Income taxes for 2002 reflect the reversal of tax reserves aggregating $120,000,000, as a result of the favorable resolution of certain federal income tax contingencies discussed above. Income taxes for 2001 reflect a benefit of $36,200,000 for the favorable resolution of federal and state income tax contingencies, and in 2000, the Company's effective income tax rate did not vary materially from the expected statutory federal rate.  Property and Casualty Insurance--Discontinued Operation         In December 2001, upon approval by the Company's Board of Directors to commence an orderly liquidation of the Empire Group, the Company classified as discontinued operations the property and casualty insurance operations of the Empire Group. The Empire Group had historically engaged in commercial and personal lines of property and casualty insurance, principally in the New York metropolitan area. The Empire Group only accepts new business that it is obligated to accept by contract or New York insurance law; it does not engage in any other business activities except for its claims runoff operations. The voluntary liquidation is expected to be substantially complete by 2005. In December 2001, the Company wrote down its investment in the Empire Group to its estimated net realizable value based on expected operating results and cash flows during the liquidation period, which indicated that the Company is unlikely to realize any value once the liquidation is complete. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $31,100,000 after-tax charge (net of taxes of $16,800,000) as a loss on disposal of discontinued operations to fully write-off its investment. While this estimated net realizable value represents management's best estimate, the amount the Company will ultimately realize could be, but is not expected to be, greater. The Company has no obligation to contribute additional capital to the Empire Group.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards         In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS 146"), which is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. SFAS 146 addresses issues regarding the recognition, measurement and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities, including restructuring activities. SFAS 146 requires a liability be recognized at fair value for costs associated with exit or disposal activities only when the liability is incurred as opposed to at the time the Company commits to an exit plan as permitted under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN 45"), which requires a guarantor for certain guarantees to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. In addition, FIN 45 modified the disclosure requirements for such guarantees effective for interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002; the Company has adopted these disclosure requirements. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), which addresses consolidation of variable interest entities, which are entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without                                          27   additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. FIN 46 applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. FIN 46 may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated. The Company is reviewing the impact of the implementation of SFAS 146, the initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45, and the implementation of FIN 46.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. - -------   ----------------------------------------------------------       The following includes "forward-looking statements" that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.       The Company's market risk arises principally from interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio, its borrowing activities and the banking and lending activities of certain subsidiaries.       The Company's investment portfolio is primarily classified as available for sale, and consequently, is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in shareholders' equity. Included in the Company's investment portfolio are fixed income securities, which comprised approximately 69% of the Company's total investment portfolio at December 31, 2002. These fixed income securities are primarily rated "investment grade" or are U.S. governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations. The estimated weighted average remaining life of these fixed income securities was approximately 4.6 years at December 31, 2002. The Company's fixed income securities, like all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. The Company's investment portfolio also includes its investment in WMIG, carried at its aggregate market value of $121,100,000. This investment is approximately 19% of the Company's total investment portfolio, and its value is subject to change if the market value of the WMIG stock rises or falls. At December 31, 2001, fixed income securities comprised approximately 68% of the Company's total investment portfolio and had an estimated weighted average remaining life of 2.0 years. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company's portfolio of trading securities was not material.       The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its long-term fixed interest rate debt and the Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of its subsidiary trust holding solely subordinated debt securities of the Company. Generally, the fair market value of debt and preferred securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall, and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise.       The Company's banking and lending operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference between the amount of the interest-earning assets and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities that are prepaid/withdrawn, mature or reprice in specified periods. The principal objectives of the Company's banking and lending asset/liability management activities are to provide maximum levels of net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and to facilitate funding needs. The Company utilizes an interest rate sensitivity model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk that is present. The model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on the projected net interest margin over the ensuing twelve-month period. Derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, may be used to modify the Company's indicated net interest sensitivity to levels deemed to be appropriate based on risk management policies and the Company's current economic outlook. Counterparties to such agreements are major financial institutions, which the Company believes are able to fulfill their obligations; however, if they are not, the Company believes that any losses are unlikely to be material.                                         29        The following table provides information about the Company's financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are primarily sensitive to changes in interest rates. For investment securities and debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates. For the variable rate notes receivable and variable rate borrowings, the weighted average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. For loans, securities and liabilities with contractual maturities, the table presents contractual principal cash flows adjusted for the Company's historical experience and prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. For banking and lending's variable rate products, the weighted average variable rates are based upon the respective pricing index at the reporting date. For money market deposits that have no contractual maturity, the table presents principal cash flows based on the Company's historical experience and management's judgment concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts by contractual maturity date.       For additional information, see Notes 5, 9 and 19 to Consolidated Financial Statements.                                             30
