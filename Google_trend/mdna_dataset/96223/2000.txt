Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and - ------   Results of Operations.          ---------------------------------------------------------------          The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the Company's consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and results of operations. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this Report.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Parent Company Liquidity          Leucadia National Corporation (the "Parent") is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock of its several direct subsidiaries, cash and other liquid investments. The Parent continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing operations and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value. Accordingly, while the Parent does not have any material arrangement, commitment or understanding with respect thereto (except as disclosed in this Report), further acquisitions, divestitures, investments and changes in capital structure are possible. Its principal sources of funds are its available cash resources, bank borrowings, public financings, repayment of subsidiary advances, funds distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management and other fees, and borrowings and dividends from its regulated and non-regulated subsidiaries. It has no substantial recurring cash requirements other than payment of interest and principal on its debt, tax payments and corporate overhead expenses. As of December 31, 1999, the Company's readily available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding those amounts held by its regulated subsidiaries, totaled $390,900,000. Additional sources of liquidity as of December 31, 1999 include $110,600,000 of marketable securities collateralizing letters of credit and $125,600,000 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by Fidei. In addition, the book value of the principal amount of promissory notes received from Conseco, Inc. upon the 1997 sale of the Colonial Penn Life Group was $250,000,000 at December 31, 1999.          During 1999, the Company paid the Dividend of $13.58 per Common Share totaling $811,925,000. Pursuant to a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, any gain realized on the Dividend will be treated as capital gain income for non-corporate shareholders.          Payment of the Dividend required the Company to make an offer to purchase all of its 8-1/4% Notes and its 7-7/8% Notes at a purchase price of 101% of principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Pursuant to such offers, in 1999, the Company repurchased $80,899,000 principal amount of the 8-1/4% Notes and $113,324,000 principal amount of the 7-7/8% Notes for $198,000,000, including accrued interest. Funds received from repayment of $150,000,000 of the Conseco Notes were used for a portion of this repurchase.          Except for the Euro denominated debt of Fidei, which is non-recourse to the Company, the Parent maintains the principal borrowings for the Company and its non-banking subsidiaries and has provided working capital to certain of its subsidiaries. These borrowings have primarily been made from banks through various credit agreement facilities and through public financings.          During 1999, the Company repurchased 5,182,958 Common Shares for an aggregate cost of $125,481,000. From January 1, 2000 through March 13, 2000, the Company repurchased 1,505,000 Common Shares for an aggregate cost of $32,095,000. As of March 13, 2000, the Company is authorized to repurchase an additional 4,495,000 Common Shares. Such purchases may be made from time to time                                          21  in the open market, through block trades or otherwise. Depending on market conditions and other factors, such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice.          In February 1999, PepsiCo, Inc. exercised its option to purchase the Company's equity interest in PIB, its joint venture with PepsiCo, for $39,190,000, including interest. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $29,545,000 in connection with the purchase.          In March 1999, the Company sold all of its interest in Caja to Assicurazioni Generali Group, an Italian insurance company, for $126,000,000 in cash and a $40,000,000 collateralized note maturing April 2001 from its Argentine partner. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $120,800,000 on this sale.          In July 1999, the Company sold its discontinued life insurance subsidiaries, Charter and Intramerica, to Allstate Life Insurance Company for statutory surplus, as adjusted, at the date of sale ($39,560,000), plus $3,575,000. Income in 1999 from these operations, net of taxes, was $24,201,000, of which $15,582,000 resulted from the sale, including the recognition of deferred gains from prior reinsurance transactions.          In September 1999, the Company lent to MK Gold $35,800,000 and entered into a purchase agreement to increase its equity interest to 72.5%. In October 1999, the stock purchase was consummated for approximately $15,800,000 and the loan was reduced by such amount. During 1999, MK Gold acquired Cobre Las Cruces, S.A., a Spanish company that holds the exploration and mining rights to the Las Cruces copper deposit in Spain for total cash consideration of $42,000,000.          The Company has replaced its two corporate owned aircraft it has used for ten years with two newer models of used aircraft. During 1999, the Company paid $43,900,000 of generally available corporate funds to acquire these aircraft, net of $8,500,000 received upon the sale of one of its older aircraft. The Company expects to receive approximately $8,000,000 for its remaining aircraft.          At December 31, 1999, a maximum of $31,900,000 was available to the Parent as dividends from its regulated subsidiaries without regulatory approval. Additional amounts may be available to the Parent in the form of loans or cash advances from regulated subsidiaries, although no amounts were outstanding at December 31, 1999 or borrowed to date in 2000. There are no restrictions on distributions from non-regulated subsidiaries. The Parent also receives tax sharing payments from subsidiaries included in its consolidated income tax return, including certain regulated subsidiaries. Because of the tax loss carryforwards available to the Parent and certain subsidiaries, together with current interest deductions and corporate expenses, the amount paid by the Parent for income taxes has been substantially less than tax sharing payments received from its subsidiaries. Payments from regulated subsidiaries for dividends, tax sharing payments and other services totaled $17,100,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999.          Based on discussions with commercial and investment bankers, the Company believes that it has the ability to raise additional funds under acceptable conditions for use in its existing businesses or for appropriate investment opportunities. Since 1993, the Company's senior debt obligations have been rated as investment grade by S&P and Duff & Phelps Inc. Ratings issued by bond rating agencies are subject to change at any time.  Consolidated Liquidity          In 1999, net cash was provided by operations. In 1998, net cash was used for operations, principally to purchase investments classified as trading and for the payment of income taxes, partially offset by the repayment of the Company's bridge financing to PIB.          The investment portfolio of the Company's insurance subsidiaries principally consists of fixed maturity investments; the balance of their portfolio consists largely of preferred securities. Of the fixed maturity                                          22  securities, the majority consists of those rated "investment grade" or U.S. governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations, although limited investments in "non-rated" or rated less than investment grade securities have been made from time to time.          During 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Tranex, a subprime automobile lender, for $128,000,000. The Company's banking and lending subsidiary purchased Tranex's subprime automobile portfolio for $67,900,000 and certain other assets for $4,000,000. Another subsidiary of the Company acquired $44,200,000 of residual interests and excess servicing assets of related securitized trusts and $12,000,000 of certain other assets.          The Company provides collateralized automobile loans to individuals with poor credit histories. The Company's investment in automobile loans was $277,100,000 and $140,400,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Investments in auto loans increased in 1999 due to the purchase of Tranex's subprime automobile portfolio and due to increased new loan originations. The Company has expanded into new locations and is offering new programs. The Company believes its new loan volume has benefited from a decline in competition due to the failure of certain competitors and a reduction in capital available for securitizations.          As of December 31, 1999, the principal amount of Fidei's Euro denominated outstanding debt, all of which is non-recourse to the Company, was $214,600,000 (213,200,000 Euros). Inasmuch as Fidei's Euro denominated assets will be sold over time and such assets are presently funded with Fidei's Euro denominated debt, the Company has determined not to acquire a currency hedge for Fidei's Euro denominated debt. During 1999, Fidei paid the Company $41,400,000, thereby reducing the Company's net investment in Fidei to $38,129,000 at December 31, 1999.          In January 2000, the Company committed to invest up to $100,000,000 in the equity of a limited liability company ("LLC"). The LLC is managed and controlled by a third party investment manager and will invest in high yield securities. The Company may redeem its interest in the LLC annually beginning on Decmeber 31, 2001, or otherwise in certain specified circumstances. The Company will account for this investment on the equity method.          The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. The amount and availability of tax loss carryforwards are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations on the use of these carryforwards, the Company's certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from accumulating at least five percent of the Common Shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning at least five percent of the Common Shares from acquiring additional Common Shares.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Property and Casualty Insurance          The Company's most significant operation is its insurance business, where it is a provider of property and casualty insurance primarily in the New York metropolitan area. For the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company's insurance segment contributed 26% of total revenues from continuing operations and, at December 31, 1999, constituted 26% of total assets.          Net earned premium revenues of the Empire Group were $145,200,000, $228,600,000 and $275,000,000 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. While earned premiums declined in all lines of business, the most significant reductions during 1999 were in assigned risk automobile                                          23  ($24,100,000), voluntary private passenger automobile ($26,900,000) and commercial package policies ($11,600,000). As a result of poor operating results, the Empire Group is no longer entering into new assigned risk contracts. Effective January 1, 2000, all policy renewal obligations have been assigned to another insurance company. However, the Empire Group remains liable for the claim settlement costs for assigned risk claims that occurred during the policy term. The Empire Group believes it has provided adequate reserves for such liabilities, including loss adjustment expenses. The decline in voluntary private passenger automobile resulted from tighter underwriting standards, increased competition and the Empire Group's decision to no longer accept new policies from those agents who historically have had poor underwriting results. The Empire Group's termination of certain unprofitable agents has also adversely affected premium volume in other lines of business.          In 1998, the decrease in earned premium revenues was primarily due to a decline in the number of assigned risk automobile pool contracts acquired due to competition and the depopulation of the assigned risk automobile pools ($24,600,000) and a reduction in certain lines, principally voluntary commercial automobile ($8,500,000), private passenger automobile ($6,000,000), commercial package policies ($4,300,000) and workers' compensation ($3,700,000), due to tighter underwriting standards, reunderwriting and increased competition.          The Empire Group's combined ratios as determined under GAAP and SAP were as follows:                                          Year Ended December 31,                                         -----------------------                                  1999            1998            1997                                  ----            ----            ----        GAAP                      138.4%          129.3%          118.5%       SAP                       143.3%          134.0%          117.8%          The Empire Group's combined ratios increased in 1999 and 1998 primarily due to the reduction in premium volume at a rate greater than the reduction in net underwriting and other costs. In addition, the reduction in servicing fees negatively affected the expense ratios. Expense ratios were also adversely affected by increased expenditures related to the installation of new information systems, providing Internet access to agents and severance costs. Included in the Empire Group's results for 1999, 1998 and 1997 were $17,000,000, $42,000,000 and $27,000,000, respectively, for reserve strengthening related to losses from prior accident years.          During 1999, the Empire Group experienced unfavorable development due to an increase in severity of 1998 accident year losses in the assigned risk automobile and voluntary private passenger automobile lines, and 1996 accident year losses in certain classes of the commercial automobile line. As a result, the Empire Group increased its reserves by $7,500,000 for assigned risk automobile, $5,000,000 for voluntary private passenger automobile and $4,500,000 for commercial automobile lines. As previously discussed, the Empire Group no longer accepts new policies from certain agents identified as having had poor underwriting results in the voluntary private passenger automobile line of business and, effective January 1, 2000, the Empire Group no longer participates in the assigned risk business. Additionally, the Empire Group no longer offers insurance in those classes of the commercial automobile line that contributed to the unfavorable development.          During 1998, the Empire Group reviewed the adequacy of the reserves carried for its open claims' files, focusing on workers' compensation, commercial auto and other commercial liability lines of business. As part of the review, substantially all open workers' compensation claim files were reviewed for every accident year up to and including 1998. Additionally, during 1998, the Empire Group reorganized the commercial auto claims department. As part of this realignment, more complex claims files were reviewed by the most experienced claims examiners and assumptions regarding average claims severity and probable ultimate losses were revised. Accordingly, reserves were strengthened by                                          24  $13,000,000 for workers' compensation, $14,000,000 for commercial automobile and $14,000,000 for other commercial liability lines of business.          The 1997 reserve strengthening included $11,000,000 for commercial package lines of business and $7,000,000 for voluntary commercial automobile lines of business. These increases resulted from a review of open claim files and the continued unfavorable development of prior accident years losses, particularly the 1992 through 1994 accident years.          As a consequence of its reserve increases, the Empire Group has reduced premiums and pre-tax profits to recognize reinsurance premiums due for 1995 and prior years under retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements. Such amounts totaled $4,569,000, $1,976,000, and $5,479,000 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The Empire Group has not entered into retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements after 1995.          For the lines of business discussed above, as well as all other property and casualty lines of business, the Company employs a variety of standard actuarial ultimate loss projection techniques, statistical analyses and case-basis evaluations to estimate its liability for unpaid losses. The actuarial projections include an extrapolation of both losses paid and incurred by business line and accident year and implicitly consider the impact of inflation and claims settlement patterns upon ultimate claim costs based upon historical patterns. These estimates are performed quarterly and consider any changes in trends and actual loss experience. Any resulting change in the estimate of the liability for unpaid losses, including those discussed above, is reflected in current year earnings during the quarter the change in estimate is identified.          The reserving process relies on the basic assumption that past experience is an appropriate basis for predicting future events. The probable effects of current developments, trends and other relevant matters are also considered. Since the establishment of loss reserves is affected by many factors, some of which are outside the Company's control or are affected by future conditions, reserving for property and casualty claims is a complex and uncertain process requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments. As additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, the Company's estimates and judgments may be revised. While the effect of any such changes in estimates could be material to future results of operations, the Company does not expect such changes to have a material effect on its liquidity or financial condition.          In management's judgment, information currently available has been appropriately considered in estimating the Company's loss reserves. The Company will continue to evaluate the adequacy of its loss reserves on a quarterly basis, incorporating any future changes in trends and actual loss experience, and record adjustments to its loss reserves as appropriate.  Banking and Lending          Finance revenues and operating profits reflect the level and mix of consumer instalment loans. For 1999, although finance revenues increased due to greater average loans outstanding, operating profit declined primarily due to an increase in the provision for loan losses for the larger volume of loans outstanding. In addition, 1998 results reflected the pre-tax gain of $6,500,000 from the sale of substantially all of the Company's executive and professional loan portfolio, as well as a decline in automobile loan losses. Average loans outstanding for 1999 were $238,600,000 as compared to $148,700,000 for 1998. This increase was primarily due to the purchase of a subprime automobile portfolio in December 1998, the Tranex acquisition in 1999 and increased new loan originations.                                          25  Manufacturing          Since December 1997, the Company's manufacturing operations have consisted of its plastics division. In 1999, revenues of the plastics division reached a record level of $64,000,000, an increase of 13% over 1998. In addition, despite rising raw material prices, the gross profit increased 16% to $24,900,000. In 1998, the gross profit for the plastics division increased by 14% to $21,400,000. This increase was primarily due to greater sales in most of the division's product lines and lower raw material costs. The decline in manufacturing revenues in 1998 compared to 1997 was due to the sale of certain divisions and the discontinuance of certain non-performing product lines in 1997 and prior years.  Other          Investment and other income in 1999 included the gains on sale of Caja ($120,800,000), The Sperry and Hutchinson Company, Inc. ($18,700,000) and PIB ($29,545,000), and the gain on sale of an equity interest in an associated company ($8,700,000). Investment and other income also increased in 1999 due to increased rent income and gains from sales of real estate properties, of which $49,800,000 related to Fidei. During 1999, Fidei sold 62 real estate properties; 88 properties remain at December 31, 1999, all of which are currently being marketed for sale. Such increases were partially offset by a reduction in investment income resulting primarily from payment of the Dividend and debt repurchases described above, a reduction in investments held by the Empire Group and the gain in 1998 on the sale of the executive and professional loan portfolio. In 1998, investment and other income increased by $16,300,000 primarily due to increased interest income ($63,700,000), the sale of the Company's executive and professional loan portfolio referred to above, ($6,500,000) and increased income from real estate activities ($8,800,000), partially offset by reduced gains from sales of real estate and other assets ($40,700,000) and reduced income relating to the service business ($19,100,000).          During 1998, due to declines in values that were deemed other than temporary, the Company recorded a pre-tax writedown of $75,000,000 related to its investments in Russian and Polish debt and equity securities. Such writedowns are reflected in the caption "Net securities gains (losses)." At December 31, 1999, the remaining book value of the Company's investments in these securities was $10,000,000.          Equity in income (losses) of associated companies declined in 1999 and improved in 1998, primarily due to income of $30,800,000 from an investment partnership that was liquidated in 1999. In addition, in 1998, equity in income (losses) of associated companies improved as compared to 1997 due to a reduction of $48,400,000 in the Company's equity losses related to PIB.          Interest expense primarily reflects the level of external borrowings outstanding throughout the periods, which increased primarily due to Fidei's outstanding debt, partially offset by the Company's debt repurchases described above.          The increase in selling, general and other expenses in 1999 principally relates to expenses incurred by Fidei, higher provisions for loan losses, expenses incurred in connection with the Dividend and the recognition in 1998 of net curtailment gains. The decrease in selling, general and other expenses in 1998 as compared to 1997 principally reflects decreased expenses of the manufacturing segment principally as a result of the sale of certain divisions in 1997, decreased pension expense due to the recognition of net curtailment gains of $6,500,000 in 1998, a 1997 charge for estimated costs to settle litigation relating to a lending program that has been liquidated and lower provisions for loan losses.          Income taxes for 1999 reflect a benefit of $40,100,000 from the utilization of capital loss carryforwards, of which $33,300,000 was previously included in the valuation allowance. Income taxes for 1999 also reflect a benefit of $3,400,000 for the favorable resolution of certain federal income tax                                          26  contingencies. Income taxes for 1998 reflect a benefit of $39,000,000 for a change in the Company's estimated 1997 federal tax liability and the favorable resolution of certain contingencies. The 1997 income tax benefit was greater than the expected normal corporate tax rate primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain contingencies.          The number of shares used to calculate basic earnings (loss) per share was 59,338,000, 63,409,000 and 62,205,000 for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings (loss) per share was 59,352,000, 63,510,000 and 62,205,000 for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. - -------   ----------------------------------------------------------          The following includes "forward-looking statements" that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.          The Company's market risk arises principally from interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio, its borrowing activities and the banking and lending activities of certain subsidiaries. The Company does not enter into material derivative financial instrument transactions.          The Company's investment portfolio is primarily classified as available for sale, and consequently, is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in shareholders' equity. Included in the Company's investment portfolio are fixed income securities, which comprised approximately 77% of the Company's total investment portfolio at December 31, 1999. These fixed income securities are primarily rated "investment grade" or are U.S. governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations, although limited investments in "non-rated" or rated less than investment grade securities have been made from time to time. The estimated weighted average remaining life of these fixed income securities was approximately 3.5 years at December 31, 1999. The Company's fixed income securities, like all fixed income instruments, are                                          27  subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. At December 31, 1998, fixed income securities comprised approximately 90% of the Company's total investment portfolio and had an estimated weighted average remaining life of 2.5 years. During 1999, the Company's fixed income investments declined at the Empire Group and to fund the Dividend. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company's portfolio of trading securities was not material. The Company manages the investment portfolio of its insurance subsidiaries to preserve principal, maintain a high level of quality, comply with applicable insurance industry regulations and achieve an acceptable rate of return. In addition, the Company considers the duration of its insurance reserves in comparison with that of its investments.          The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its long-term fixed interest rate debt and the Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of its subsidiary trust holding solely subordinated debt securities of the Company. Generally, the fair market value of debt and preferred securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall, and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise.          The Company's banking and lending operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference between the amount of the interest-earning assets and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities that are prepaid/withdrawn, mature or reprice in specified periods. The principal objectives of the Company's banking and lending asset/liability management activities are to provide maximum levels of net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and to facilitate funding needs. The Company utilizes an interest rate sensitivity model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk that is present. The model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on the projected net interest margin over the ensuing twelve-month period. Derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, may be used to modify the Company's indicated net interest sensitivity to levels deemed to be appropriate based on risk management policies and the Company's current economic outlook. Counterparties to such agreements are major financial institutions, which the Company believes are able to fulfill their obligations; however, if they are not, the Company believes that any losses are unlikely to be material.          The following table provides information about the Company's financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For investment securities and debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates. For the variable rate notes receivable and variable rate borrowings, the weighted average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. For loans, securities and liabilities with contractual maturities, the table presents contractual principal cash flows adjusted for the Company's historical experience of loan prepayments and prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. For banking and lending's variable rate products, the weighted average variable rates are based upon the respective pricing index at the reporting date. For money market deposits that have no contractual maturity, the table presents principal cash flows based on the Company's historical experience and management's judgment concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts by contractual maturity date.
