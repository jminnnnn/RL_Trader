Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and - ------   ---------------------------------------------------------------          Results of Operations.          ----------------------          The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the Company's consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and results of operations. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this Report.  Liquidity and Capital Resources                                       28    Parent Company Liquidity         Leucadia National Corporation (the "Parent") is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock of its direct subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents and other non-controlling investments in debt and equity securities. The Parent continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing operations and investments and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value. Accordingly, further acquisitions, divestitures, investments and changes in capital structure are possible. Its principal sources of funds are its available cash resources, liquid investments, bank borrowings, public and private capital market transactions, repayment of subsidiary advances, funds distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management and other fees, and borrowings and dividends from its subsidiaries.          In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the Company also considers investments classified as current assets and investments classified as non-current assets on the face of its consolidated balance sheet as being generally available to meet its liquidity needs. Securities classified as current and non-current investments are not as liquid as cash and cash equivalents, but they are generally easily convertible into cash within a short period of time. As of December 31, 2006, the sum of these amounts aggregated $2,657,000,000. However, since $422,600,000 of this amount is pledged as collateral pursuant to various agreements, represents investments in non-public securities or is held by subsidiaries that are party to agreements which restrict the Company's ability to use the funds for other purposes (including the Inmet shares), the Company does not consider those amounts to be available to meet the Parent's liquidity needs. The $2,234,400,000 that is available is comprised of cash and short-term bonds and notes of the U.S. Government and its agencies, U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises and other publicly traded debt and equity securities. The investment income realized from the Parent's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is used to meet the Parent company's short-term recurring cash requirements, which are principally the payment of interest on its debt and corporate overhead expenses.          The Parent's only long-term cash requirement is to make principal payments on its long-term debt ($923,200,000 principal outstanding as of December 31, 2006), of which $475,000,000 is due in 2013, $350,000,000 is due in 2014 and $98,200,000 is due in 2027. Historically, the Parent has used its available liquidity to make acquisitions of new businesses and other investments, but, except as disclosed in this Report, the timing of any future investments and the cost can not be predicted. Should the Company require additional liquidity for an investment or any other purpose, the Parent also has an unsecured bank credit facility of $100,000,000 that matures in 2011 and bears interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate or the prime rate. No amounts are currently outstanding under the bank credit facility. In addition, based on discussions with commercial and investment bankers, the Company believes that it has the ability to raise additional funds under acceptable conditions for use in its existing businesses or for appropriate investment opportunities. The Parent's senior debt obligations are rated two levels below investment grade by Moody's Investors Services and Standard & Poor's, and one level below investment grade by Fitch Ratings. Ratings issued by bond rating agencies are subject to change at any time.         The Company and Jefferies & Company, Inc. ("Jefferies") have entered into an agreement to expand and restructure the Company's equity investment in JPOF II, one of several entities managed by Jefferies that invests capital in Jefferies' high yield trading business. Pursuant to an executed agreement, the Company would increase its investment to $600,000,000 (requiring up to an additional estimated $500,000,000 in cash), Jefferies would increase its investment to the same level as the Company, and this new venture would provide for additional capital investments from passive investors of up to $800,000,000 in the aggregate over time. Jefferies will also receive additional securities in the new venture entitling it to 20% of the profits. Jefferies and the Company would each have the right to nominate two of a total of four directors to the new venture's board, and each would own 50% of the voting securities. The new venture will be a registered broker-dealer engaged in the secondary sales and trading of high yield securities and special situation securities formerly conducted by Jefferies, including bank debt, post-reorganization equity, equity, equity derivatives, credit default swaps and other financial instruments. It will commit capital to the market by making markets in high yield and distressed securities and will invest in and provide research coverage on these types of securities. Commencement of the investment is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and certain other matters.                                          29         The Company is currently considering raising approximately $500,000,000 in debt financing through a private placement of its senior notes. The senior notes are expected to have substantially similar terms to its existing series of 7% Senior Notes due 2013 other than the interest rate, call features and maturity date, which is currently expected to be ten years from issuance. The net proceeds from the senior notes financing, if completed, would be used in part to fund a portion of the additional investment described above, with the balance to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, acquisitions, or other investment opportunities. The decision to proceed with the private placement of new senior notes will be subject to market and other conditions and available pricing. The senior notes, if issued, have not and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.          In February 2006, Square 711, a 90% owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the sale of 8 acres of unimproved land in Washington, D.C. The Company received net cash proceeds of approximately $75,700,000, and recorded a pre-tax gain of $48,900,000.          In July 2006, the Company sold Symphony to RehabCare Group, Inc., for approximately $107,000,000. After satisfaction of Symphony's outstanding credit agreement by the buyer ($31,700,000 at date of sale) and certain sale related obligations, the Company realized net cash proceeds of $62,300,000 and recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of discontinued operations of $53,300,000.          In September 2006, the Company sold ATX to Broadview Networks Holdings, Inc. for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $85,700,000, and recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of discontinued operations of $41,600,000.          In the second quarter of 2006, the Company acquired a 30% limited liability company interest in Goober for aggregate consideration of $60,000,000, excluding expenses, and agreed to lend to Goober, on a secured basis, up to $126,000,000 (all of which was loaned at December 31, 2006) to finance new rig equipment purchases and construction costs and to repay existing debt. In January 2007, the loan facility was further amended to increase the interest rate on the facility to LIBOR plus 5%, and to provide Goober with an additional secured credit facility for up to $45,000,000 at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 10%. In addition, the Company increased its equity interest in Goober to 42% for an additional equity investment of $25,000,000. The additional funding was required primarily due to increased raw material and labor costs to construct the new rigs and working capital needs due to delays in rig construction. The Company's investment in Goober is classified as an investment in an associated company.          During 2006, the Company indirectly acquired a controlling voting interest in Premier for an aggregate purchase price of $90,800,000, excluding expenses. The Company owns approximately 46% of the common units of Premier and all of Premier's preferred units, which accrue an annual preferred return of 17%. The Company also acquired Premier's junior subordinated note due August 2012, with an outstanding balance at acquisition of $13,400,000, and has made an $8,100,000 12% loan to Premier that matures in May 2007. All of Premier's equity interests are pledged to secure repayment of the Premier Notes with an outstanding principal amount of $160,000,000. In addition, the Company agreed to provide up to $40,000,000 of construction financing to Premier's general contractor by purchasing the contractor's receivables from Premier if the receivables are more than ten days past due ($11,300,000 is outstanding at December 31, 2006). At acquisition, the Company consolidated Premier as a result of its controlling voting interest.         Premier owns the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Biloxi, located in Biloxi, Mississippi, which was severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina and which is currently being rebuilt. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, Premier purchased a comprehensive blanket insurance policy providing up to $181,100,000 in coverage for damage to real and personal property, including business interruption coverage. Premier has received payments from various insurance carriers aggregating $160,900,000 with respect to $168,200,000 face amount of coverage; the remaining $12,900,000 face amount of coverage has not been settled and is currently in litigation. All insurance settlements have been placed on deposit into restricted accounts under the control of the indenture trustee of the Premier Notes. Premier believes that the funds in the restricted accounts together with permitted equipment financing will be sufficient to rebuild the Hard Rock Biloxi similar to its condition immediately preceding Hurricane Katrina.                                         30          On September 19, 2006, Premier and its subsidiary filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Premier filed its petitions in order to seek the Court's assistance in gaining access to Hurricane Katrina-related insurance proceeds which had been denied to Premier by its pre-petition secured bondholders. Premier continues to operate its business as "debtors in possession" under the jurisdiction of the Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Court. The Company deconsolidated Premier effective with the filing of the voluntary petitions, and has classified its net investment in Premier as an investment in an associated company ($125,600,000 as of December 31, 2006, including all loans and equity interests). The Company has also committed to provide up to $180,000,000 to finance Premier's plan of reorganization, which would principally be used to pay-off the Premier Notes. Upon its emergence from bankruptcy proceedings, the Company expects that Premier will be accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary.         Hurricane Katrina completely destroyed the Hard Rock Biloxi's casino, which was a facility built on floating barges, and caused significant damage to the hotel and related structures. The threat of hurricanes remains a risk to the existing facilities and to the new casino, which will be constructed over water on concrete pilings that will greatly improve the structural integrity of the facility. In July 2006, Premier purchased a new insurance policy providing up to $149,300,000 in coverage for damage to real and personal property and up to the lesser of six months or $30,000,000 of business interruption and delayed opening coverage. The coverage is syndicated through several insurance carriers, each with an A.M. Best rating of A- (Excellent) or better. The policy provides coverage for the existing structures, as well as for the repair and rebuild of the hotel, low rise building and parking garage and the construction of the new casino.         Although the insurance policy is an "all risk" policy, weather catastrophe occurrence ("WCO"), which is defined to include damage caused by a named storm, is limited to $50,000,000 with a deductible equal to the greater of $7,000,000 or 5% of total insured values at risk. WCO coverage is subject to mandatory reinstatement of coverage for an additional pre-determined premium.          Premier's current insurance policy expires in July 2007; Premier expects it will purchase new insurance coverage that will be in effect for the balance of the 2007 hurricane season. Premiums for WCO policies have increased dramatically as a result of Hurricane Katrina, and the amount of coverage that can be purchased has also been reduced as insurance companies seek to reduce their exposure to such events. Premier cannot currently estimate how much insurance will be available to it at an acceptable premium.         The Company invested $408,000,000 in Fortescue's Pilbara iron ore and infrastructure project in Western Australia, including expenses. In exchange for its cash investment, the Company received 26,400,000 common shares of Fortescue, representing approximately 9.99% of the outstanding Fortescue common stock, and a 13 year, $100,000,000 note of FMG. Interest on the note is calculated as 4% of the revenue, net of government royalties, invoiced from the iron ore produced from the project's Cloud Break and Christmas Creek areas only. The note is unsecured and subordinate to the project's senior secured debt. Fortescue is a publicly traded company on the Australian Stock Exchange, and the shares acquired by the Company may be sold without restriction. At the date of acquisition, the Company's investment in Fortescue's common shares was recorded at its aggregate fair value, based on the closing price of Fortescue's common shares on that date. Subsequent to acquisition, the Company's investment in the Fortescue common shares are classified as a non-current available for sale investment and carried at market value as of each balance sheet date. At December 31, 2006, the market value of the Fortescue common shares was $276,300,000.          For accounting purposes, the Company bifurcated its remaining Fortescue investment into a 13 year zero-coupon note and a prepaid mining interest. The zero-coupon note was recorded at an estimated initial fair value of $21,600,000, representing the present value of the principal amount discounted at 12.5%. The prepaid mining interest of $184,300,000 has been classified with other non-current assets, and will be amortized to expense as the 4% of revenue is earned.          Over the past few years, the Company has invested in various limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are engaged in investing and/or securities transactions activities. These investments include Safe Harbor ($50,000,000 invested in 2006) and Wintergreen (a total of $50,000,000 invested during 2005 and 2006), each of which is classified as an investment in associated companies.                                         31            In January 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a 75% interest in the telecommunications business of Telco Group, Inc. ("Telco") for $120,000,000 in cash, subject to working capital adjustments. Consummation of the transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions including receipt of regulatory approvals, is expected to occur during the first half of 2007. Telco, which operates under the brand name STi Prepaid and variations thereof, is a provider of international prepaid phone cards, prepaid wireless and other telecommunications services in the U.S.          The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have substantial NOLs and other tax attributes. The amount and availability of the NOLs and other tax attributes are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations on the use of the NOLs, the Company's certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from acquiring ownership (including through attribution under the tax law) of five percent or more of the common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning five percent or more of the common shares from acquiring additional common shares. The restrictions will remain in effect until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2024, (b) the repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any comparable successor provision) or (c) the beginning of a taxable year of the Company to which certain tax benefits may no longer be carried forward. For more information about the NOLs and other tax attributes, see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.          As of February 15, 2007, the Company is authorized to repurchase 1,452,393 common shares. Such purchases may be made from time to time in the open market, through block trades or otherwise. Depending on market conditions and other factors, such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Except in connection with employees using common shares to pay the exercise price of employee stock options, the Company has not repurchased any common shares during the three year period ended December 31, 2006.  Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows          As discussed above, the Company relies on the Parent's available liquidity to meet its short-term and long-term needs, and to make acquisitions of new businesses and investments. Except as otherwise disclosed herein, the Company's operating businesses do not generally require material funds from the Parent to support their operating activities, and the Parent does not depend on positive cash flow from its operating segments to meet its liquidity needs. The components of the Company's operating businesses and investments change frequently as a result of acquisitions or divestitures, the timing of which is impossible to predict but which often have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows in any one period. Further, the timing and amounts of distributions from certain of the Company's investments in partnerships accounted for under the equity method are generally outside the control of the Company. As a result, reported cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities do not generally follow any particular pattern or trend, and reported results in the most recent period should not be expected to recur in any subsequent period.          Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $229,600,000 in 2006 as compared to the prior year, due principally to no 2006 cash flows from WilTel, which was sold in December 2005, reduced distributions of earnings from associated companies, reduced funds generated from activity in the trading portfolio, payment of incentive compensation and increased defined benefit pension plan contributions. In addition, funds provided by operating activities during 2006 reflect a $19,400,000 use of funds by Sangart, a development stage company which became a subsidiary in November 2005. During 2006, cash provided by operating activities reflect the collection of the balance of certain receivables from AT&T Inc. ($198,500,000). The AT&T receivables resulted from a termination agreement entered into between WilTel and its largest customer during 2005; however, these receivables were not included with the assets purchased by Level 3. WilTel's cash flow from operating activities for the 2005 period prior to its sale was $278,500,000. In 2006, distributions from associated companies principally include earnings distributed by EagleRock ($48,200,000) and JPOF II ($23,600,000). In 2005, distributions from associated companies principally resulted from JPOF II ($16,200,000) and the sale of Union Square, two entities in which the Company had non-controlling equity interests. In May 2005, these entities sold their respective interests in an office complex located on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.; the Company's share of the net proceeds was $73,200,000. Contributions to the defined benefit pension plans were $50,100,000 in 2006 as compared to $21,800,000 in 2005. The current status of the Company's frozen defined benefit pension plans is more fully discussed below.                                         32           Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $252,700,000 in 2005 as compared to 2004, due principally to increased distributions of earnings from associated companies, a decrease in the size of the Company's investment in its trading portfolio and increased cash flow from the Company's operating units, principally WilTel and the manufacturing businesses. The increased cash flow from the Company's manufacturing units reflects the 2005 acquisition of Idaho Timber, and increased revenues at Conwed Plastics resulting from an acquisition and growth in most of its markets. The increased distributions from associated companies principally resulted from the proceeds received from Union Square, which is discussed above. WilTel's cash flow from operating activities (which increased by $67,100,000 in 2005 as compared to 2004) did not increase the liquidity available to the Parent (as defined above), since WilTel's debt agreements prohibited the payment of dividends.          Net cash flows used for investing activities were $186,200,000 in 2006 and $16,700,000 in 2004; net cash flows provided by investing activities were $22,600,000 in 2005. As a result of the sale of WilTel, the Company's use of funds for property, equipment and leasehold improvements declined significantly in 2006; funds used for WilTel's acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements totaled $96,100,000 in 2005 and $73,200,000 in 2004. During 2006, funds provided by the disposal of real estate and other assets include the sales of Square 711 discussed above, and two associated companies. The Company received aggregate cash proceeds of $56,400,000 from the sale of its equity interest in and loan repayment by two associated companies and recorded a pre-tax gain totaling $27,500,000, which is reflected in investment and other income. During 2004, funds provided by the disposal of real estate and other assets include the sales of corporate aircraft ($38,800,000) and two Florida residential lot development projects ($56,700,000) that have been substantially completed. Pursuant to the indenture governing the Premier Notes, Premier was required to put insurance proceeds it collected into restricted accounts, which is the principal reason for the net change in restricted cash during 2006. Premier cash flow activity is reflected in the Company's 2006 consolidated statement of cash flows only during the period it was a consolidated subsidiary (April through September 2006).          During the 2006 period, proceeds from the disposal of discontinued operations net of expenses and cash sold principally reflect the sales of Symphony ($62,900,000) and ATX ($74,300,000), net of a payment that resolved WilTel's working capital adjustment ($27,000,000). During 2005, proceeds from the disposal of discontinued operations net of expenses and cash sold principally reflect the sales of WilTel ($357,100,000) and the Waikiki Beach hotel ($95,200,000). During 2006, acquisitions, net of cash acquired principally include Premier ($105,700,000); during 2005, acquisitions, net of cash acquired principally include ATX ($12,500,000), Idaho Timber ($133,500,000) and NSW, LLC U.S. ("NSW"), an acquisition by Conwed Plastics ($26,600,000). During 2004, net cash provided from principal collections on loan receivables and from the sale of substantially all of the Company's remaining consumer loan portfolio aggregated $199,000,000; as discussed below, banking and lending operations have been in run-off for the past few years. Investments in associated companies include Goober ($188,000,000), Safe Harbor ($50,000,000), Wintergreen ($30,000,000), CLC ($12,100,000) and Premier ($9,000,000) in 2006, Wintergreen ($20,000,000) in 2005 and Pershing Square, L.P. ("Pershing") ($50,000,000) in 2004.          Net cash used for financing activities was $5,200,000 in 2006 and $442,700,000 in 2005. During 2005, funds were used to retire customer banking deposits of the banking and lending operations as they became due and the remaining deposits were sold. Issuance of long-term debt during 2006 and 2005 principally relates to repurchase agreements, which are discussed below. The reduction of long-term debt during 2006 includes the repayment of debt of Square 711 ($32,000,000), which was sold, and the maturity of the Company's 7 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes ($21,700,000). The reduction of long-term debt during 2005 includes the repayment of $442,500,000 of debt of operations sold (WilTel and Waikiki Beach hotel) and the maturity of the Company's 8 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes ($19,100,000).          During 2004, net cash provided by financing activities was $220,500,000. Funds were used to retire customer banking deposits of the banking and lending operations as they became due. In 2004, the Company sold $100,000,000 principal amount of its 7% Senior Notes and $350,000,000 principal amount of its 3 3/4% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes. Proceeds received from the sale of all the Notes can be used by the Company for investing or general corporate purposes. Issuance of common shares for all periods presented principally reflects the exercise of employee stock options and, in 2004, the exercise of warrants to purchase common shares.                                          33           Debt due within one year includes $181,800,000 and $92,100,000 as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, relating to repurchase agreements of one of the Company's subsidiaries. These fixed rate repurchase agreements have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.3%, mature at various dates through June 2007 and are secured by non-current investments with a carrying value of $182,900,000 at December 31, 2006.          During 2001, a subsidiary of the Company borrowed $53,100,000 secured by certain of its corporate aircraft, of which $41,300,000 is currently outstanding. Capital leases of another subsidiary aggregating $9,400,000 consist of a sale-leaseback transaction related to other corporate aircraft. The Parent company has guaranteed these financings.          The Company's debt instruments require maintenance of minimum Tangible Net Worth, limit distributions to shareholders and limit Indebtedness and Funded Debt (as such terms are defined in the agreements). In addition, the debt instruments contain limitations on investments, liens, contingent obligations and certain other matters. The Company is in compliance with all of these restrictions, and the Company has the ability to incur additional indebtedness or make distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions. Certain of the debt instruments of subsidiaries of the Company require that collateral be provided to the lender; principally as a result of such requirements, the assets of subsidiaries which are subject to limitations on transfer of funds to the Company were approximately $247,500,000 at December 31, 2006.

As shown below, at December 31, 2006, the Company's contractual cash obligations totaled $1,756,719,000.

Estimated payments related to a currency swap agreement are based on the currency rate in effect at December 31, 2006. Amounts related to the Company's consolidated pension liability ($40,400,000) are included in the table primarily during the 1-3 year period; however, the exact timing of the cash payments is uncertain.                                         34           At December 31, 2006, the Company had recorded a liability of $40,400,000 on its consolidated balance sheet for its unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligations. This amount represents the difference between the present value of amounts owed to current and former employees (referred to as the projected benefit obligation) and the market value of plan assets set aside in segregated trust accounts. Since the benefits in these plans have been frozen, future changes to the benefit obligation are expected to principally result from benefit payments, differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience and interest rates.          During 2006, the Company contributed $50,100,000 to these plans, and expects to make substantial additional contributions to the segregated trust accounts in the future to reduce its plan liabilities and reduce administrative and insurance costs associated with the plans. The tax deductibility of these contributions is not a primary consideration, principally due to the availability of the Company's NOLs to otherwise reduce taxable income. The timing and amount of additional contributions are uncertain; however, the Company believes it will make substantial additional contributions over the next few years to reduce, but not to entirely eliminate, its defined pension benefit plan liability.          The Company maintained defined benefit pension plans covering certain operating units prior to 1999, and WilTel also maintained defined pension benefit plans that were not transferred in connection with the sale of WilTel. As of December 31, 2006, certain amounts for these plans are reflected separately in the table below (dollars in thousands):                                                                              The Company's         WilTel's                                                                             Plans              Plans                                                                             -----              -----       Projected benefit obligation                                               $54,876           $ 176,724 Funded status - balance sheet liability at December 31, 2006                 7,223              33,134 Deferred losses included in other comprehensive income                      19,053              24,294 Discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation             4.90%               5.70%            Calculations of pension expense and projected benefit obligations are prepared by actuaries based on assumptions provided by management. These assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis, including assumptions about discount rates, interest credit rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. For the Company's plans, a discount rate was selected to result in an estimated projected benefit obligation on a plan termination basis, using current rates for annuity settlements and lump sum payments weighted for the assumed elections of participants. For the WilTel plans, the timing of expected future benefit payments was used in conjunction with the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve to develop a discount rate that is representative of the high quality corporate bond market, adjusted for current rates which might be available for annuity settlements.          These discount rates will be used to determine pension expense in 2007. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.25% change in these discount rates would affect pension expense by $600,000 and the benefit obligation by $9,300,000.           The deferred losses in other comprehensive income primarily result from changes in actuarial assumptions, including changes in discount rates, changes in interest credit rates and differences between the actual and assumed return on plan assets. Deferred losses are amortized to expense if they exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year; such amount aggregated $20,200,000 at December 31, 2006 for all plans. A portion of these excess deferred losses will be amortized to expense during 2007, based on an amortization period of twelve years.          The assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets are based on the investment objectives of the specific plan, which are more fully discussed in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Differences between the actual and expected rates of return on plan assets have not been material.                                         35   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements          At December 31, 2006, the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees and letters of credit aggregating $61,600,000. Pursuant to an agreement that was entered into before the Company sold CDS Holding Corporation ("CDS") to HomeFed in 2002, the Company agreed to provide project improvement bonds for the San Elijo Hills project. These bonds, which are for the benefit of the City of San Marcos, California and other government agencies, are required prior to the commencement of any development at the project. CDS is responsible for paying all third party fees related to obtaining the bonds. Should the City or others draw on the bonds for any reason, CDS and one of its subsidiaries would be obligated to reimburse the Company for the amount drawn. At December 31, 2006, the amount of outstanding bonds was $18,300,000, $16,100,000 of which expires in 2007, $800,000 in 2008, $100,000 in 2009 and the remainder in 2010. Subsidiaries of the Company have outstanding letters of credit aggregating $12,700,000 at December 31, 2006, principally to secure various obligations. Substantially all of these letters of credit expire before 2009.          As discussed above, the Company has also guaranteed 30% of the amounts outstanding under CLC's $240,000,000 senior secured credit facility and CLC's (euro)69,000,000 senior secured bridge credit facility. At December 31, 2006, $74,200,000 was outstanding under the senior secured credit facility and (euro)21,000,000 was outstanding under the senior secured bridge credit facility; as a result, the Company's outstanding guaranty at that date was $22,300,000 and (euro)6,300,000 ($8,300,000 at exchange rates in effect on February 15, 2007), respectively.  Critical Accounting Estimates          The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions. The following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements, and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect, at a specific point in time, events whose ultimate outcome won't be known until a later date. Actual results could differ from these estimates.         Income Taxes - The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. If in the future the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax asset in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment would increase income in such period. Similarly, if in the future the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax asset, an adjustment would be charged to income in such period. The determination of the amount of the valuation allowance required is based, in significant part, upon the Company's projection of future taxable income at any point in time. The Company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities based on the Company's assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining its tax filing positions.          During 2005, the Company's projections of future taxable income enabled it to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the Company's net deferred tax asset; accordingly, $1,135,100,000 of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense. The Company's conclusion that a portion of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized is strongly influenced by its historical ability to generate significant amounts of taxable income. The Company's estimate of future taxable income considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, about its current operations and investments, includes an aggregation of individual projections for each material operation and investment, and includes all future years that the Company estimated it would have available net operating losses. The Company believes that its estimate of future taxable income is reasonable but inherently uncertain, and if its current or future operations and investments generate taxable income greater than the projected amounts, further adjustments to reduce the valuation allowance are possible. Conversely, if the Company realizes unforeseen material losses in the future, or its ability to generate future taxable income necessary to realize a portion of the deferred tax asset is materially reduced, additions to the valuation allowance could be recorded. At December 31, 2006, the balance of the deferred valuation allowance was approximately $911,800,000.                                          36          Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"), the Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. When testing for impairment, the Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group). The determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on management's estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value. If the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.          The Company did not recognize any impairment losses on long-lived assets during 2006; however, during 2005 an impairment loss of $42,400,000 was recorded to reduce the carrying amount of WilTel's former headquarters facility to its estimated fair value in connection with the sale of WilTel to Level 3 (classified with gain on disposal of discontinued operations). WilTel's former headquarters building, including the adjacent parking garage, was not included in the sale to Level 3 and has been retained by the Company. The Company concluded that the change in the manner in which the asset was being used, from a headquarters facility of an operating subsidiary to a property held for investment, was a change in circumstances which indicated that the carrying amount of the facility might not be recoverable.         Impairment of Securities - Investments with an impairment in value considered to be other than temporary are written down to estimated fair value. The write-downs are included in net securities gains in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis.          The Company's determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information; GAAP requires the exercise of judgment in making this assessment, rather than the application of fixed mathematical criteria. The Company considers a number of factors including, but not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, the reason for the decline in fair value, changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date, and other factors specific to the individual investment. The Company's assessment involves a high degree of judgment and accordingly, actual results may differ materially from the Company's estimates and judgments. The Company recorded impairment charges for securities of $12,900,000, $12,200,000 and $4,600,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.         Business Combinations - At acquisition, the Company allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their relative fair values. Significant judgments and estimates are often made to determine these allocated values, and may include the use of independent appraisals, consider market quotes for similar transactions, employ discounted cash flow techniques or consider other information the Company believes relevant. The finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete, and if final values are materially different from initially recorded amounts adjustments are recorded. Any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill which is not amortized to expense. Recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis, and between annual testing dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value.          Subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation, any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Once final, the Company is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price, even if subsequent events or circumstances prove the Company's original judgments and estimates to be incorrect. In addition, long-lived assets like property and equipment, amortizable intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss; however, under GAAP the methods, assumptions and results of an impairment review are not the same for all long-lived assets. The assumptions and judgments made by the Company when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future.          Purchase price allocations for all of the Company's recent acquisitions have been finalized. Adjustments to the initial purchase price allocations were not material.                                         37           Contingencies - The Company accrues for contingent losses when the contingent loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred and of contingent loss amounts normally require significant judgment by management, can be highly subjective and are subject to material change with the passage of time as more information becomes available. As of December 31, 2006, the Company's accrual for contingent losses was not material.  Results of Operations  Manufacturing - Idaho Timber          Revenues and other income for Idaho Timber for the year ended December 31, 2006 and from the date of acquisition (May 2005) through December 31, 2005 were $345,700,000 and $239,000,000, respectively; gross profits were $30,000,000 and $22,000,000, respectively; salaries and incentive compensation expenses were $9,400,000 and $6,300,000, respectively; depreciation and amortization expenses were $4,900,000 and $4,200,000, respectively; and pre-tax income was $12,000,000 and $8,200,000, respectively.         Idaho Timber's revenues weakened during 2006, reflecting lower average selling prices and reduced shipment volume. This decline was principally due to weakening demand resulting from reductions in housing starts and the abundant supply of lumber in the marketplace. In October 2006, the trade dispute between the U.S. and Canada over Canadian lumber imports was resolved and a new Softwood Lumber Agreement became effective that restricts and imposes a tax on Canadian lumber imports. Prior to the effective date of that agreement, imports from Canada increased, which added to the oversupply in the market.          While raw material costs, the largest component of cost of sales (approximately 84% of cost of sales), declined during 2006 due to the continued decline in market conditions and the diminished uncertainty concerning the impact of the Softwood Lumber Agreement, this reduction lagged behind the reduction in selling prices. The difference between Idaho Timber's selling price and raw material cost per thousand board feet (spread) is closely monitored, and the rate of change in pricing and cost is typically not the same. During 2006, spreads compressed negatively impacting gross profit and pre-tax results. With the continued oversupply in the market, Idaho Timber intends to continue to focus on developing new higher margin products, diversifying its supply chain, improving cost control and solidifying customer and supplier relationships, in an effort to maximize gross margins and pre-tax results.  Manufacturing - Conwed Plastics          Pre-tax income for Conwed Plastics was $17,900,000, $14,200,000 and $7,900,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Its manufacturing revenues were $106,300,000, $93,300,000 and $64,100,000, and gross profits were $34,400,000, $28,900,000 and $19,000,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Revenues increased by 14% in 2006, 46% in 2005 and 20% in 2004, each as compared to the prior year.         The increase in revenues in 2006 reflects $5,400,000 of increased revenues from the acquisitions of NSW in February 2005 and Polynet in May 2006, which increased the segment's product offerings and customer base. In addition, 2006 revenues reflect increases in the erosion control, carpet cushion and turf reinforcement markets, partially reduced by a decline in the consumer products market due to lower demand for certain products. These changes result from a variety of factors including the impact of price increases implemented in 2005, increased road construction and using a new distributor for certain products. While the carpet cushion market continued to benefit from the previously strong housing market through the first half of 2006, it experienced a reduction in sales volume during the second half of the year resulting from a slowdown in housing starts.         The increase in revenues in 2005 as compared to 2004 reflects NSW's revenues since acquisition of $17,500,000, and increases in most of the segment's markets. Sales increases resulted from a variety of factors including the strong housing market, new products developed late in 2004, and the impact of price increases implemented during the second half of 2004 and in the first and fourth quarters of 2005.          Raw material costs increased by approximately 4% in 2006 as compared to 2005, and 19% in 2005 as compared to 2004; however, the segment was able to increase selling prices in most markets, which, along with increased sales and production volumes, resulted in greater gross margins in each period as compared to the immediately preceding period. The primary raw material in Conwed Plastics' products is a polypropylene resin, which is a byproduct of the oil refining process, whose price tends to fluctuate with the price of oil. There is relatively little direct labor or other raw material costs in the products. In addition to managing resin purchases, Conwed Plastics also has initiatives to reduce and/or reuse scrap, thereby increasing raw material utilization.                                         38          In addition, gross margin and pre-tax results for 2006 reflect $1,100,000 of greater amortization expense on intangible assets resulting from acquisitions and depreciation expense. Pre-tax results for 2006 also reflect $1,900,000 of higher salaries and incentive compensation expense than 2005, due principally to greater pre-tax profits and increased headcount.          In 2005, gross margins and pre-tax results reflect $1,300,000 of greater amortization expense on intangible assets resulting from acquisitions as compared to 2004. In addition, pre-tax results for 2005 include higher salaries, incentive compensation expense and sales commissions as compared to 2004, primarily related to NSW.  Domestic Real Estate          Pre-tax income for the domestic real estate segment was $44,000,000, $4,100,000 and $20,700,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Pre-tax results for the domestic real estate segment are largely dependent upon the performance of the segment's operating properties, the current status of the Company's real estate development projects and non-recurring gains or losses recognized when real estate assets are sold. As a result, pre-tax income for this segment for any particular year is not predictable and does not follow any consistent pattern.          Pre-tax income for 2006 principally reflects the sale by Square 711, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $48,900,000, and the sale of other land parcels in Utah for a pre-tax gain of $11,200,000. In addition, the Company recognized pre-tax profit related to its 95-lot development project in South Walton County, Florida of $3,600,000 and $6,600,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Such amounts principally result from the completion of certain required improvements to land previously sold. Pre-tax results for 2006 reflect $8,100,000 of incentive compensation accruals related to the Company's real estate development project in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.          In 2004, the Company sold 92 lots of its 95-lot development project in South Walton County, Florida for aggregate sales proceeds of approximately $50,000,000, recognized pre-tax profits of $15,800,000 and deferred recognition of pre-tax profits of $10,200,000. In addition, revenues during 2004 reflect the sale of certain unimproved land for cash proceeds of $8,800,000, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $7,600,000. Pre-tax results for 2004 also reflect due diligence expenses for a real estate development project that the Company decided not to develop.  Medical Product Development         Pre-tax losses (net of minority interest) for Sangart for the year ended December 31, 2006 and from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2005 (Sangart was acquired in November 2005) were $21,100,000 and $1,400,000, respectively. Sangart's losses for 2006 and for the period from acquisition through December 31, 2005 reflect research and development costs of $16,500,000 and $600,000, respectively, and salaries and incentive compensation expenses of $6,400,000 and $1,000,000, respectively.         As more fully discussed above, Sangart is a development stage company that does not have any revenues from product sales. Since 2002, it has been developing its current product candidate, Hemospan, and is currently conducting clinical trials in the U.S. (a Phase II trial) and Europe (two Phase III trials). It does not expect to complete its clinical trials until 2008, and if they are successful it will then seek approval with the appropriate regulatory authorities to market its product. Until such time, if ever, that Sangart obtains regulatory approval for Hemospan, the Company will report losses from this segment. U.S. or foreign regulatory agencies could also require Sangart to perform more clinical trials, which could be both expensive and time consuming. The Company is unable to predict with certainty when, if ever, it will report operating profits for this segment.         When the Company increases its investment in Sangart, which it expects to do in March 2007, the additional investment will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method, the price paid is allocated to Sangart's individual assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values; in Sangart's case, substantially all of the fair value of assets acquired is initially allocated to research and development. However, since GAAP does not permit the recognition of research and development as an asset under the purchase method, any amounts initially allocated to research and development are immediately expensed. These amounts are expected to be material.                                         39   Banking and Lending          As stated previously, the Company's banking and lending operations have been in run-off, and during 2005 the Company's banking and lending subsidiary filed a formal plan with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to liquidate its operations, sold its remaining customer deposits and surrendered its national bank charter. Pre-tax results for banking and lending operations of $1,800,000, $1,400,000 and $22,000,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, have been classified with other operations. During 2004, the Company sold its subprime automobile and collateralized consumer loan portfolios representing approximately 97% of its total outstanding loans (net of unearned finance charges) and certain loan portfolios that had been substantially written-off for aggregate pre-tax gains of $16,300,000, which is reflected in investment and other income.  Corporate and Other Operations          Investment and other income increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to greater interest income of $61,600,000, reflecting a larger amount of invested assets and higher interest rates, a $27,500,000 gain from the sales of two associated companies and $7,400,000 from the recovery of bankruptcy claims. Investment and other income in 2005 includes a gain of $10,500,000 on the sale of 70% of the Company's interest in CLC to Inmet.          Investment and other income increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to the CLC gain, greater investment income of $24,200,000 reflecting a larger amount of invested assets and higher interest rates, and increased sales at the wineries of $5,000,000. Investment and other income in 2004 reflects a pre-tax gain of $11,300,000 from the sale of two of the Company's older corporate aircraft. Available corporate cash is generally invested on a short-term basis until such time as investment opportunities require an expenditure of funds.          Net securities gains for Corporate and Other Operations aggregated $117,200,000, $208,800,000 and $136,100,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company's net securities gains largely reflect realized gains from the sale of publicly traded debt and equity securities that had been classified as Corporate available for sale securities. Included in net securities gains for 2006 is a gain of $37,400,000 from the sale of Level 3 common stock. Included in net securities gains for 2005 is a gain of $146,000,000 from the sale of 375,000 shares of WMIG common stock. Net securities gains for 2006, 2005 and 2004 include provisions of $12,900,000, $12,200,000 and $4,600,000, respectively, to write down the Company's investments in certain available for sale securities. The write-down of the securities resulted from a decline in market value determined to be other than temporary.          The Company's decision to sell securities and realize security gains or losses is generally based on its evaluation of an individual security's value at the time and the prospect for changes in its value in the future. The decision could also be influenced by the status of the Company's tax attributes or liquidity needs; however, sales in recent years have not been influenced by these considerations. Therefore, the timing of realized security gains or losses is not predictable and does not follow any pattern from year to year.          The increase in interest expense during 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily reflects interest expense relating to Premier prior to its deconsolidation and the fixed rate repurchase agreements. The increase in interest expense during 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily reflects interest expense relating to $100,000,000 principal amount of 7% Senior Notes and $350,000,000 principal amount of 3 3/4% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes issued in April 2004.          Salaries and incentive compensation expense did not significantly change in 2006 as compared to 2005. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R in 2006, the Company recorded $15,200,000 for share-based compensation expense relating to grants made under the Company's senior executive warrant plan and the fixed stock option plan. Salaries and incentive compensation expense for 2006 also reflects decreased bonus expense. Salaries and incentive compensation expense increased by $31,300,000 in 2005 as compared to 2004, principally due to increased bonus expense.                                         40           The increase in selling, general and other expenses of $8,800,000 in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily reflects increased corporate aircraft expenses, higher professional fees and other costs, which largely relate to potential investments and projects and existing investments, and greater employee benefit costs including pension costs relating to WilTel's retained pension plan. In addition, 2005 reflects an impairment loss (described below) for the remaining book value of Olympus Re Holdings, Ltd. ("Olympus") of $3,700,000.          Selling, general and other expenses increased by $14,600,000 in 2005 as compared to 2004, primarily due to higher minority interest expense relating to MK Resources of $4,200,000 (the Company acquired the outstanding minority interest in August 2005), greater foreign exchange losses of $2,700,000, higher professional fees of $4,400,000 that principally relate to due diligence expenses for potential investments and investment management fees, an impairment loss for the remaining book value of Olympus of $3,700,000 and greater employee benefit expenses.          The Company's total comprehensive income in 2004 enabled it to realize certain acquired deferred tax assets which had been fully reserved for at the acquisition of WilTel. The resulting reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets ($22,300,000 in 2004) was applied to reduce the recorded amount of identifiable intangible assets to zero.          The income tax provision reflects the reversal of tax reserves aggregating $8,000,000 and $27,300,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively, as a result of the favorable resolution of various state and federal income tax contingencies. In addition, in 2004 the tax provision reflects a benefit to record a federal income tax carryback refund of $3,900,000.          As more fully discussed above, during 2005 the Company's revised projections of future taxable income enabled it to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the Company's net deferred tax asset; accordingly, $1,135,100,000 of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense. The Company adjusted the valuation allowance in 2005 since it believes it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize that portion of the net deferred tax asset.  Associated Companies          Equity in income (losses) of associated companies includes the following for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands):                                                         2006                    2005                    2004                                                     ----                    ----                    ----         Olympus                                         $     --              $ (120,100)             $    9,700 EagleRock                                           16,400               (28,900)                 29,400 HomeFed                                              2,900                 5,800                  10,000 JPOF II                                             26,200                23,600                  16,200 Union Square                                          --                  72,800                   1,300 Pershing                                              --                    --                    21,300 Safe Harbor                                         (7,600)                 --                     -- Wintergreen                                         11,000                   500                   -- Goober                                               2,000                  --                     -- CLC                                                  3,800                (1,600)                  -- Other                                                5,400                 3,500                   3,600                                                 ----------            ----------              ----------     Equity in income (losses) before      income taxes                                   60,100               (44,400)                 91,500 Income tax expense                                 (22,400)                 (700)                (15,000)                                                 ----------            ----------              ----------     Equity in income (losses),      net of taxes                               $   37,700            $  (45,100)             $   76,500                                                 ==========            ==========              ==========            The Company's equity in losses from Olympus for 2005 reflects its share of Olympus losses from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Effective January 1, 2006, Olympus received new capital which reduced the Company's equity interest to less than 4%; as a result, the Company no longer applies the equity method of accounting. The book value of the Company's investment in Olympus was written down to zero in 2005.                                         41            As described above, the Company owns approximately 30% of HomeFed, a California real estate development company, which it acquired in 2002. The Company's share of HomeFed's reported earnings fluctuates with the level of real estate sales activity at HomeFed's development projects.          The Company's share of JPOF II's earnings was distributed to the Company shortly after the end of each year.          EagleRock distributed $48,200,000 to the Company in 2006 and $3,700,000 in 2004.          Union Square, two entities in which the Company had non-controlling equity interests, sold their respective interests in an office complex located on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. during 2005. Including repayment of its mortgage loans at closing, the Company's share of the net proceeds was $73,200,000, and the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $72,300,000.          In January 2004, the Company invested $50,000,000 in Pershing, a limited partnership that is authorized to engage in a variety of investing activities. The Company redeemed its interest effective December 31, 2004; $71,300,000 was distributed to the Company in early 2005.  Discontinued Operations         Healthcare Services           As discussed above, in July 2006 the Company sold Symphony and classified its historical operating results as a discontinued operation. Pre-tax income of Symphony was $200,000, $3,300,000 and $5,100,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gain on disposal of discontinued operations for 2006 includes a pre-tax gain on the sale of Symphony of $53,300,000 ($33,500,000 after tax).         Telecommunications - ATX         As discussed above, in September 2006 the Company sold ATX and classified its historical operating results as a discontinued operation. Pre-tax losses of ATX were $1,200,000 and $1,900,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Gain on disposal of discontinued operations for 2006 includes a pre-tax gain on the sale of ATX of $41,600,000 ($26,100,000 after tax).         WilTel         The Company sold WilTel to Level 3 in December 2005, recognized a pre-tax gain on disposal of $243,800,000 ($243,800,000 after tax) and classified its historical operating results as a discontinued operation. The calculation of the gain on sale included: (1) the cash proceeds received from Level 3 of $460,300,000, which was net of estimated working capital adjustments of $25,500,000; (2) the fair value of the Level 3 common shares of $339,300,000, based on the $2.95 per share closing price of Level 3 common stock immediately prior to closing; (3) the amount of the AT&T cash payments that had not been previously accrued prior to closing ($175,900,000); (4) an impairment charge for WilTel's headquarters building of $42,400,000; and (5) the net book value of the net assets sold and estimated expenses and other costs related to the transaction. WilTel's pre-tax income (loss) from discontinued operations was $116,000,000 and $(56,600,000) for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.           Gain on disposal of discontinued operations during 2006 includes $2,400,000 of pre-tax gains ($1,500,000 after tax) principally for the resolution of certain sale-related contingencies and obligations and working capital adjustments related to WilTel.         Real Estate          In May 2005, the Company sold its 716-room Waikiki Beach hotel and related assets for an aggregate purchase price of $107,000,000, before closing costs and other required payments. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $56,600,000 ($56,600,000 after tax), which is reflected in gain on disposal of discontinued operations.                                         42           In 2004, the Company sold a commercial real estate property and classified it as a discontinued operation; a pre-tax loss of $600,000 was reflected as loss on disposal of discontinued operations. Pre-tax losses for this property were $6,600,000 in 2004.         Other         In 2006, the Company sold its gas properties and recorded a pre-tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations of $900,000. Income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2006 includes $2,900,000 of pre-tax losses related to these gas properties; amounts for the 2005 and 2004 periods were not material.         In 2006, the Company received $3,000,000 from a former insurance subsidiary which, for many years, has been undergoing liquidation proceedings controlled by state insurance regulators. The Company reflected the amount received as a gain on disposal of discontinued operations. For income tax purposes, the payment is treated as a non-taxable distribution paid by a subsidiary; as a result, no tax expense has been recorded.         In December 2005, the Company sold its interest in an Argentine shoe manufacturer that had been acquired earlier in the year. Although there was no material gain or loss on disposal, results of discontinued operations during 2005 include a pre-tax loss of $4,400,000.         In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company sold its geothermal power generation business for $14,800,000, net of closing costs, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $200,000. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded pre-tax losses from discontinued operations relating to this business of $1,500,000.         During 2004, the Company recorded $2,200,000 as gain on disposal of discontinued operations (net of minority interest), which represented the estimated fair value of warrants whose vesting criteria became satisfied. These warrants had been received during 2003 as part of the sales proceeds from the discontinued operations of WebLink Wireless, Inc. The gain was not reduced for any federal income tax expense due to WebLink's large net operating loss carryforwards.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards         In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"), which prescribes the accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in income tax positions. FIN 48 defines the criteria that must be met before any part of the benefit of a tax position can be recognized in the financial statements, provides guidance for the measurement of tax benefits recognized and guidance for classification and disclosure. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of adopting FIN 48 on its consolidated financial statements but does not expect it to be material; however, additional footnote disclosures will be required.         In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on its consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. - --------  -----------------------------------------------------------           The following includes "forward-looking statements" that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.           The Company's market risk arises principally from interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and its borrowing activities and equity price risk.           The Company's investment portfolio is primarily classified as available for sale, and consequently, is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in shareholders' equity. Included in the Company's available for sale investment portfolio are fixed income securities, which comprised approximately 57% of the Company's total investment portfolio at December 31, 2006. These fixed income securities are primarily rated "investment grade" or are U.S. governmental agency issued or U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises. The estimated weighted average remaining life of these fixed income securities was approximately 2.5 years at December 31, 2006. The Company's fixed income securities, like all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. At December 31, 2005, fixed income securities comprised approximately 69% of the Company's total investment portfolio and had an estimated weighted average remaining life of 1.2 years.           Also included in the Company's available for sale investment portfolio are equity securities, which are recorded on the balance sheet at an aggregate fair value of $736,700,000 (aggregate cost of $584,400,000), and which comprised approximately 31% of the Company's total investment portfolio at December 31, 2006. The majority of this amount consists of two publicly traded securities, the largest of which is the investment in Fortescue common shares, which is carried at fair value of $276,300,000. In addition, the Company's investment portfolio includes its investment in Inmet, which is carried at cost of $78,000,000 at December 31, 2006. Although the Company is restricted from selling the Inmet common shares, the investment is subject to price risk. The market value of this investment is $299,800,000 at December 31, 2006. As discussed more fully above in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the Company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis.         At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company's portfolio of trading securities was not material to the total investment portfolio.         The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its long-term fixed interest rate debt. Generally, the fair market value of debt securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall, and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise.           The following table provides information about the Company's financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are primarily sensitive to changes in interest rates. For investment securities and debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates.
