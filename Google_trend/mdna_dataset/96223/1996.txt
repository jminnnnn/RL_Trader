Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition      ------   -----------------------------------------------------------               and Results of Operations.               -------------------------            The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the      Company's consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital      resources and results of operations.  This analysis should be read in      conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related      notes which appear elsewhere in this Report.       LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES            Parent Company Liquidity.  Leucadia National Corporation (the           ------------------------      "Parent") is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the      stock of its several direct subsidiaries.  Additionally, the Parent      continuously evaluates its existing operations and investigates      possible acquisitions of new businesses and dispositions of businesses      in order to maximize its ultimate economic value to shareholders.       Accordingly, while the Parent does not have any material arrangement,      commitment or understanding with respect thereto (except as disclosed      in this Report), further acquisitions, divestitures, investments and      changes in capital structure are possible.  Its principal sources of      funds are its available cash resources, bank borrowings, public      financings, repayment of subsidiary advances, funds distributed from      its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management and other fees,      and borrowings and dividends from its regulated and non-regulated      subsidiaries.  It has no substantial recurring cash requirements other      than payment of interest and principal on its debt, tax payments and      corporate overhead expenses.            The Parent maintains the principal borrowings for the Company and      its non-banking subsidiaries and has provided working capital to      certain of its subsidiaries.  These borrowings have primarily been      made on an unsecured basis from banks through various credit agreement      facilities and term loans, and through public financings.  During the      year ended December 31, 1995, the Company used a portion of its      $150,000,000 bank credit agreement facilities in connection with the      MK Gold transaction and to meet daily cash requirements.  At December      31, 1995, there were no amounts outstanding under such bank credit      agreement facilities.  The Company's bank borrowings bear interest      based on the prime rate or LIBOR.  The Company is exposed to interest      rate risk related to its variable rate borrowings.  The Company has      entered into interest rate swap and interest rate option agreements to      reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate      debt.  Counterparties to these agreements are major financial      institutions, which the Company believes are able to fulfill their      obligations; however, if they are not, the Company believes that any      losses are unlikely to be material.            In June 1995, the Company sold $100,000,000 principal amount of      its newly authorized 8 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2005 in an      underwritten public offering.  A portion of the proceeds was used to      repay indebtedness outstanding under the Company's bank credit      agreement facilities incurred in connection with the MK Gold      transaction.  The remaining proceeds were added to working capital.            On September 13, 1995, Ian M. Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg,      Chairman of the Board and President of the Company, respectively, and      certain members of Mr. Cumming's family exercised previously granted      warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,188,000 Common Shares and sold      such shares in an underwritten public offering.  In connection with      such public offering, the Company granted the underwriters an over      allotment option, which was exercised, for 478,200 Common Shares.       Under the terms of the warrant agreement, the Company was required to      pay expenses of the sale, other than underwriting discounts.  As a      result of the exercise of the warrants and the exercise of the over      allotment option, the Company realized aggregate cash proceeds, net of      expenses, of $43,736,000.  For income tax purposes, the exercise of      the warrants results in the Company receiving a current income tax      deduction of $57,305,000.  For financial reporting purposes, the      benefit of such deduction ($20,057,000) was credited directly to      shareholders' equity.                                         23                At December 31, 1995, a maximum of approximately $60,200,000 was      available to the Parent as dividends from its regulated subsidiaries      without regulatory approval.  Additional amounts may be available to      the Parent in the form of loans or cash advances from regulated      subsidiaries, although no amounts were outstanding at December 31,      1995 or borrowed to date in 1996.  There are no restrictions on      distributions from the non-regulated subsidiaries; the Parent and its      non-regulated subsidiaries had aggregate cash and temporary      investments of approximately $164,400,000 at December 31, 1995.  The      Parent also receives tax sharing payments from subsidiaries included      in its consolidated income tax return, including certain regulated      subsidiaries.  Because of the tax loss carryforwards available to the      Parent and certain subsidiaries, together with current interest      deductions and corporate expenses, the amount paid by the Parent for      income taxes is substantially less than tax sharing payments received      from its subsidiaries.  In addition, the Parent receives payments from      the regulated and non-regulated entities for services provided by the      Parent.  Payments from regulated subsidiaries for dividends, tax      sharing payments and other services totaled approximately $64,900,000      during the year ended December 31, 1995.            Based on discussions with commercial and investment bankers, the      Company believes that it has the ability to raise additional funds      under acceptable conditions for use in its existing businesses or for      appropriate investment opportunities.  Since 1993, the Company's      senior debt obligations have been rated as "investment grade" by      Moody's, S&P and Duff & Phelps Inc.  Ratings issued by bond rating      agencies are subject to change at any time.            In March 1996, the Company retired at maturity its 6% Swiss Franc      Bond issue and underlying currency swap agreement, which had an      outstanding principal balance of $27,255,000.            Consolidated Liquidity.  During each of the three years in the           ----------------------      period ended December 31, 1995, the Company operated profitably and in      the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994, net cash was provided from      operations.  For the year ended December 31, 1993, in spite of      increased earnings, net cash was used for operations, principally as a      result of payments made in connection with a reinsurance transaction.            In June 1995, the Company purchased a 46.4% common stock interest      in MK Gold for an aggregate cash purchase price of $22,500,000.  In      addition, the Company purchased at par all of a lender's interest      under a $20,000,000 revolving credit facility with MK Gold, of which      $15,000,000 was outstanding.  This amount was repaid during the third      quarter of 1995.            During the second quarter of 1995, the Company purchased      2,365,200 common shares of RCP for approximately $11,130,000, which      increased its equity interest in RCP to 2,714,000 shares (7.1%).  RCP      is a real estate investment trust, the principal asset of which is a      $1.3 billion collateralized loan to the owners of the land and      buildings known as Rockefeller Center in New York City.  In March      1996, shareholders of RCP approved a merger transaction pursuant to      which shareholders will receive $8.00 per share.  If the merger is      consummated, the Company expects to report a pre-tax gain of      approximately $8,900,000 in 1996.            In July 1995, pursuant to the chapter 11 reorganization plan of      HFC, the Company acquired 41.2% of HFC's common stock for a net cash      investment of approximately $4,200,000.  As part of the reorganization      plan, the Company provided HFC with a $20,000,000 eight year secured      loan, which is convertible into additional shares of HFC common stock      after three years (subject to certain conditions) and which bears      interest at the rate of 12% per year.       The Company has entered into a letter of intent with PepsiCo, Inc. for the      formation of a joint venture (the "JV") that will be the exclusive bottler      and distributor of PepsiCo beverages in a large portion of eastern Russia,      Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. The Company has agreed to invest approximately      $79,000,000 in the JV, for which it will receive a 75% economic interest.                                         24              It is currently anticipated that the joint venture agreement will be      executed during the second quarter of 1996.            The Company's investments in Russia and Argentina are subject to      foreign exchange and other risks.  Investing in the emerging markets      of Russia is subject to political risk and uncertainty concerning the      government's ability to succeed in its program to convert to a market      economy, both of which are beyond the Company's control.  In      Argentina, the Company's investment is subject to the foreign currency      exchange risk of a devaluation of the Argentine peso against the      United States dollar, which the Argentine government has indicated is      not being considered, the volatility of the Argentine banking system,      the overall health of the Argentine economy and the usual competitive      factors experienced by insurance companies.            The source of the funds for the investments described above is      general corporate funds available to the Parent company.            Effective as of December 31, 1995, control of the WMAC Companies      was returned to the Company and such subsidiaries were consolidated.       As a result, the Company recorded a gain of $41,030,000, representing      the difference between the carrying amount of the Company's investment      prior to consolidation and the net assets of such subsidiaries.            The investment portfolios of the Company's insurance subsidiaries      are principally fixed maturity investments rated "investment grade" or      U.S. governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations, although      limited investments in "non rated" or rated less than "investment      grade" securities have been made from time to time.  The investment      strategy of the insurance subsidiaries has been to maintain a high      quality portfolio of publicly traded, fixed income securities with a      relatively short duration.  Principally as a result of decreases in      market interest rates during 1995, the unrealized loss on investments      at the end of 1994 of approximately $41,309,000 (net of taxes) became      an unrealized gain of approximately $30,086,000 (net of taxes) as of      December 31, 1995.  While this has resulted in an increase in      shareholders' equity, it had no effect on results of operations or      cash flows.            As a result of significant losses from natural disasters suffered      by the property and casualty insurance industry in recent years, the      Company has seen a notable decrease in the availability of reinsurance      at reasonable rates, particularly at low levels of deductibility.  The      Company's insurance subsidiaries also suffered certain of such losses,      although catastrophe reinsurance programs substantially reduced the      economic losses in 1994.  As a result of increased reinsurance rates,      in 1995 the Company raised its retention of lower level losses from      $11,000,000 to $15,000,000.  The Company has benefited from a modest      decline in reinsurance rates for its 1996 catastrophe reinsurance      program and has not adjusted its retention of lower level losses.            In December 1995, the Company entered into an agreement with the      California Department of Insurance to settle its Proposition 103      liability for $17,700,000.  The settlement did not exceed reserves      established in prior years.  The Company paid the settlement amount      during the first quarter of 1996.            The Company provides collateralized automobile loans to      individuals with poor credit histories.  In 1995, primarily as a      result of increased competition together with the Company's      unwillingness to lower its underwriting standards and interest rate      charges, the loan portfolio did not grow at the rate previously      experienced.  Additionally, loan losses have increased but remain less      than the 6.6% reserve maintained on this portfolio.  The Company      expects that the increased level of competition will continue, and,      together with the Company's unwillingness to lower rates, is likely to      result in a contraction in the size of this portfolio in the future.       The Company's investment in these loans was $134,668,000, $129,512,000      and $73,321,000 at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.                                         25                     The Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including Phlcorp      and its subsidiaries, have substantial loss carryforwards and other      tax attributes (as more fully discussed in the Notes to Consolidated      Financial Statements).  The amount and availability of tax loss      carryforwards are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and      uncertainties, including, with respect to Phlcorp and its      subsidiaries, tax sharing payments pursuant to a tax settlement      agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of      Justice.  In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in      ownership could impose limitations on the use of these carryforwards,      the Company's certificate of incorporation contains provisions which      generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from accumulating      at least five percent of the Common Shares and the ability of persons      or entities now owning at least five percent of the Common Shares from      acquiring additional Common Shares.  The Company has recognized as an      asset (net of reserves) certain of the benefits of such loss      carryforwards and other tax attributes.  However, the amount of the      asset recognized only reflects the minimum Phlcorp tax loss      carryforwards and is based, in part, on certain proposed regulations      affecting the use of Phlcorp's tax loss carryforwards.  As described      in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, significant      additional amounts may be available under certain circumstances.       Results of Operations      ---------------------            The Company's most significant operations are its insurance      businesses, where it is a specialty markets provider of property and      casualty and life insurance to its niche markets.  For the year ended      December 31, 1995, the Company's insurance segments contributed 78% of      total revenues and, at December 31, 1995, constituted 77% of total      assets.            Earned premium revenues and commissions of the property and      casualty insurance operations of the Empire Group were $326,100,000 in      1995, $299,200,000 in 1994 and $259,400,000 in 1993.  The increase in      1995 principally was attributable to growth in policies in force and      increased premium rates, while the increase in 1994 resulted from      increased policies in force.  The majority of the growth in each of      1995 and 1994 resulted from acquired blocks of assigned risk business      from other insurance companies.            Earned premium revenues of the Colonial Penn P&C Group were      approximately $490,500,000 in 1995, $447,200,000 in 1994 and      $452,600,000 in 1993.  The growth in earned premiums in 1995      principally resulted from acquired blocks of assigned risk automobile      business from other insurance companies and a modest increase in      earned premiums related to voluntary automobile policies.  Voluntary      automobile policies in force at December 31, 1995 were almost 1%      greater than the prior year end, and written premiums increased 5.7%      from 1994.  When the Colonial Penn P&C Group was acquired in 1991, the      Company substantially reduced its existing marketing programs, which      the Company believes were not justified by prior operating results,      and instituted new low cost direct marketing methods.  Prior to 1995,      this strategy resulted in declining polices in force and earned      premiums, as new business was not sufficient to offset the normal      attrition of existing business.  The Company believes that new      business generated in 1996 will continue to exceed lapsed business and      the rate of growth in policies in force will also increase, although      there can be no assurance that this will be achieved.  Earned premiums      in 1994 also reflect an increase, as compared to the prior year,      resulting from acquired blocks of automobile assigned risk business      from other insurance companies.                                         26                      The Company's property and casualty insurance operations combined      ratios as determined under GAAP and SAP were as follows:                Year Ended December 31,         GAAP      SAP               -----------------------         ----      ---                     1995                    103.5%   101.2%                     1994                     99.1%    98.8%                     1993                     96.9%    93.7%             The provision for insurance losses and policy benefits includes      catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, estimated at      approximately $4,600,000, $18,300,000 and $10,900,000 for the years      ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The 1994 losses      include approximately $11,700,000 related to the Northridge,      California earthquake.            The increase in the combined ratios is primarily attributable to      the Empire Group, which strengthened reserves in automobile and      workers compensation lines by approximately $34,470,000.  Actuarial      studies conducted during 1995 have identified revised loss development      patterns in automobile lines, which may indicate greater ultimate loss      experience than previously expected.  The Empire Group also reopened      closed no-fault claims files during 1995 and made additional payments      on prior years' claims.  This, along with changes in claim handling      practices, have increased the difficultly of estimating ultimate losses,      and actual losses may be different than the studies indicated.       However, the Empire Group strengthened reserves to the levels      indicated in the actuarial studies.  The Empire Group will continue to      analyze loss development patterns on a quarterly basis and will      evaluate the adequacy of its loss reserves.            The combined ratios for the Colonial Penn P&C Group increased      slightly in 1995 as compared to 1994.  The 1995 combined ratios      reflect higher losses related to acquired blocks of automobile      assigned risk business that are partially offset by increased service      fee income.  In addition, the combined ratios in 1995 were favorably      affected by reduced catastrophe losses as compared to 1994.  The      combined ratios of the Colonial Penn P&C Group's core line of      business, voluntary auto, were essentially unchanged.   The Colonial      Penn P&C Group believes that its strong underwriting procedures,      emphasis on mature adult insureds, prior rate increases and claims      handling and settlement practices have enabled it to record combined      ratios that compare favorably with the industry.            In addition to higher catastrophe losses, the combined ratios for      1994 increased as compared to 1993 principally due to settlements in      1993 of Colonial Penn P&C Group prior years' claims at amounts less      than provided.            Premium revenue receipts on IOP products of the life insurance      subsidiaries (which are not reflected as revenues) were $50,202,000 in      1995, $108,080,000 in 1994 and $88,312,000 in 1993.  The principal IOP      product sold during the three year period ended December 31, 1995 was      a VA product marketed directly to consumers.  The Company believes the      decline in premium revenue receipts of the VA product is due to a      combination of factors, including the public's perception of potential      tax law changes, increased competition and the performance of the      fund manager.            Earned premium revenues of the life and health insurance      operations were $165,800,000 for 1995, $172,400,000 for 1994 and      $181,800,000 for 1993.  The decline in earned premium revenues reflect      the run-off of the agent sold Medicare supplement business, which the      Company ceased marketing at December 31, 1992 due to inadequate      profitability.                                           27                Earned premiums revenues for the Company's Graded Benefit Life      business were $117,700,000, $113,700,000 and $109,800,000 for the      years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The      growth in earned premiums reflects the Company's increased marketing      efforts with respect to this product, which have been conducted at      acquisition cost levels that result in adequate profitability.            Insurance losses, policy benefits and amortization of deferred      acquisition costs of the life and health insurance operations were      $133,200,000, $138,300,000 and $179,100,000 for the years ended      December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The decrease in 1995      reflects the run-off of the agent sold Medicare supplement business,      which had less favorable loss experience in 1995, reduced IOP      insurance in force and a $3,500,000 gain recognized from the      termination of a reinsurance agreement.  The decrease in 1995 was      partially offset by the growth of the Graded Benefit Life product.       The decrease in 1994 as compared to the prior year primarily reflects      the run-off of the agent sold Medicare supplement business and certain      non-recurring transactions in 1993 which are described below.            In 1993, due to expectations of decreased or inadequate future      profitability of its Single Premium Whole Life ("SPWL") products, the      Company reinsured its SPWL business and recorded a net pre-tax gain of      approximately $16,700,000.  Such net pre-tax gain consists of the      premium received on the transaction of $19,500,000, which is reflected      as a credit in the caption "Provision for insurance losses and policy      benefits," and net security gains on investments sold in connection      with the transaction of $24,100,000, reduced by the write-off of      deferred policy acquisition costs of $26,900,000.            During 1993, the Company reinvested proceeds from sales of      certain securities at the lower prevailing interest rates.  Since      these reinvestment rates were, in certain instances, lower than had      previously been expected on certain fixed rate annuity policies, the      Company recorded an additional provision for insurance losses of      $6,800,000.            Manufacturing revenues decreased in 1995 principally due to      reduced demand from customers of the bathroom vanities division and a      factory fire at the fibers division, offset in part by increased sales      at the plastics division.  The decrease in manufacturing gross profit      in 1995 principally reflects the decrease in manufacturing sales,      increased raw material costs at most divisions and the fire at the      fibers division.  Although manufacturing revenues increased in 1994 as      compared to 1993, gross profit declined significantly, principally at      the bathroom vanities division, which experienced manufacturing      inefficiencies, pricing pressures and recorded provisions for obsolete      inventory in 1994.            As a result of the factory fire at the fibers division and      historical operating losses, in the fourth quarter of 1995 the Company      decided to close the factory and recorded a loss of approximately      $6,200,000 for shutdown expenses.  In addition, during the third      quarter of 1995, the Company sold a division that manufactured office      furnishing systems and recognized a loss of $1,100,000.  Such losses      are reflected in the caption "Selling, general and other expenses."            Finance revenues reflect the level of consumer instalment loans,      which have increased during 1995 and 1994 as discussed above.  The      operating profit applicable to this segment did not change      significantly in 1995 as compared to 1994, principally due to      increased interest expense on customer banking deposits and greater      losses on automobile loans.            Investment and other income increased in 1995 principally due to      the return of the WMAC Companies, which resulted in a gain of      $41,030,000 as discussed above.  Interest and dividend income      increased in 1995 reflecting higher investment yields and increased      funds available for investment.  Investment and other income reflects      increased fee income in 1995 related to acquired blocks of automobile      assigned risk business.                                        28                Investment and other income in 1994 includes $8,458,000 related      to the disposition of El Salvador government bonds and $14,490,000      related to the sale of the Company's remaining shares in Bolivian      Power Company.  Investment and other income in 1993 includes a      $12,981,000 gain from the sale of a portion of the investment in      Bolivian Power Company.            Net securities gains (losses) were $20,027,000, ($12,004,000) and      $51,923,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,      respectively.  Realized security losses during 1994 principally      reflected the Company's strategy to further shorten the duration of      its investment portfolio during a time of rising interest rates.       Security gains in 1993 were realized, in part, to effect the      reinsurance and transfer of the SPWL business described above.            Higher interest expense in each of 1995 and 1994 compared to the      prior year principally reflects the increased level of outstanding      debt.  Interest expense also reflects the increased level of deposits      at AIB and AIF and an increase in rates related to those deposits.       Generally, interest rates on deposits are lower than on other      available funds.  Interest expense on deposits was $12,034,000 in      1995, $8,304,000 in 1994 and $9,001,000 in 1993.            The increase in selling, general and other expenses in 1995      principally reflects the losses recorded by the manufacturing segment      as described above, operating expenses of real estate properties      acquired during 1994, expenses relating to certain investing      activities, including expenses related to exploring opportunities in      Russia, and increased provisions for bad debts at the banking and      lending segment.            During each of the last three years, statistical studies and      estimates of service costs indicated that the recorded liability for      unredeemed trading stamps was in excess of the amount that ultimately      would be required to redeem trading stamps outstanding.  As a result,      selling, general and other expenses applicable to the trading stamp      operations include credits of $9,400,000, $11,700,000 and $11,900,000      for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively,      reflecting adjustments made to the liability for unredeemed trading      stamps.  The Company's most recent analysis of the liability for      unredeemed trading stamps has not identified any remaining excess as      of December 31, 1995.            The provision for income taxes for 1995 is below the expected      normal corporate income tax rate principally due to the gain related      to the return of the WMAC Companies, which is not taxable, and the      favorable resolution of certain contingencies.  The provision for      income taxes for 1994 and 1993 is below the expected normal corporate      income tax rate principally because of a reduction in the valuation      allowance applicable to the deferred tax asset due to the resolution      of certain contingencies.  In addition, the provision for income taxes      for 1993 was reduced by approximately $4,215,000 as a result of      changes in federal income tax rates.            The number of shares used to calculate primary earnings per share      was 59,271,000, 58,202,000 and 58,539,000 for 1995, 1994 and 1993,      respectively.  The number of shares used to calculate fully diluted      earnings per share was 62,807,000, 61,715,000 and 61,486,000 for 1995,      1994 and 1993, respectively.  The increase in the number of shares      utilized in calculating per share amounts in 1995 principally relates      to the exercise of previously granted warrants to the Company's      Chairman and President, the selling of such shares in an underwritten      public offering and the exercise by the underwriters of the over      allotment option, all as discussed above.                                          29          Item 8.
