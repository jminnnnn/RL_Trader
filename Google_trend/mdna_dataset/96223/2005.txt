Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results          of Operations. - ------   -----------------------------------------------------------------------         The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the Company's consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and results of operations. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this Report.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Parent Company Liquidity         Leucadia National Corporation (the "Parent") is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock of its direct subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents and other non-controlling investments in debt and equity securities. The Parent continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing operations and investments and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value. Accordingly, while the Parent does not have any material arrangement, commitment or understanding with respect thereto (except as disclosed in this Report), further acquisitions, divestitures, investments and changes in capital structure are possible. Its principal sources of funds are its available cash resources, liquid investments, bank borrowings, public and private capital market transactions, repayment of subsidiary advances, funds distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management and other fees, and borrowings and dividends from its regulated and non-regulated subsidiaries.         As of December 31, 2004, the Parent's readily available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding amounts held by its regulated subsidiary and non-regulated subsidiaries that are parties to agreements which restrict the payment of dividends, totaled $1,756,600,000. This amount is comprised of cash and short-term bonds and notes of the United States Government and its agencies of $1,087,800,000 (61.9%), the equity investment in WMIG of $242,300,000 (13.8%) (which can be sold privately or otherwise in compliance with the securities laws and have the benefit of a registration rights agreement), and other publicly traded debt and equity securities aggregating $426,500,000 (24.3%). The investment income realized from these investments is used to meet the Parent company's short-term recurring cash requirements, which are principally the payment of interest on its debt and corporate overhead expenses.                                         34          The Parent's only long-term cash requirement is to make principal payments on its long-term debt ($964,000,000 outstanding as of December 31, 2004), of which $40,800,000 is due before 2013, $475,000,000 is due in 2013, $350,000,000 is due in 2014 and $98,200,000 is due in 2027. Historically, the Parent has used its available liquidity to make acquisitions of new businesses and other investments, but the timing of any future investments and the cost can not be predicted. Should the Company require additional liquidity for an investment or any other purpose, the Parent also has an unsecured bank credit facility of $110,000,000 that matures in 2007 and bears interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate or the prime rate. No amounts are currently outstanding under the bank credit facility. In addition, based on discussions with commercial and investment bankers, the Company believes that it has the ability to raise additional funds under acceptable conditions for use in its existing businesses or for appropriate investment opportunities. During 2004, Moody's Investors Services and Standard & Poor's each downgraded the Parent's debt obligations, and in early 2005, the Parent was also downgraded by Fitch Ratings. The Parent's senior debt obligations are rated two levels below investment grade by Moody's Investors Services and Standard & Poor's, and one level below investment grade by Fitch Ratings. Ratings issued by bond rating agencies are subject to change at any time.         In April 2004, the Parent sold $100,000,000 principal amount of its 7% Senior Notes due 2013 in a private placement transaction at 102.191% of the principal amount. The net cash proceeds from the sale of the notes are being used for general corporate purposes. The Parent completed a registered exchange offer pursuant to which each holder of the privately placed senior notes exchanged those notes for publicly registered notes.         Also in April 2004, the Parent sold $350,000,000 principal amount of its 3 3/4% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 in a private placement transaction. The notes are convertible into the Parent's common shares at $45.93 per share at any time before their maturity, subject to certain restrictions contained in the notes, at a conversion rate of 21.7707 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of notes, subject to adjustment (an aggregate of 7,619,745 shares). The net cash proceeds from the sale of the notes are being used for general corporate purposes. The Parent has a currently effective shelf registration statement in respect of the notes and the common shares issuable upon conversion of the notes.         In January 2004, the Company exercised an option to sell two of its older corporate aircraft for total proceeds of $38,800,000. The option was received in connection with the purchase of two new corporate aircraft during 2003. The Company completed the sales in July 2004, and reported a pre-tax gain of $11,300,000.         In 2004, the Company invested $75,000,000 in INTL, a limited liability company that is invested in a master fund which primarily invests in emerging markets debt and equity securities. INTL and the master fund are managed and controlled by an investment manager who has full discretion over investment and operating decisions. Under GAAP, INTL is considered a variable interest entity and the Company is the primary beneficiary; as a result, the Company accounts for its investment in INTL as a consolidated subsidiary. INTL plans to sell additional membership interests in the future, which if accomplished could result in the Company no longer accounting for INTL as a consolidated subsidiary. The creditors of INTL have recourse only to the assets of INTL and do not have recourse to any other assets of the Company. The Company can generally withdraw its capital account interest upon 90 days notice, subject to the manager's ability to liquidate security positions in an orderly manner. At December 31, 2004, all of INTL's assets were classified as investments and its liabilities were not material.         WilTel became a member of the Company's consolidated federal income tax return as of November 6, 2003. WilTel joined the Company's tax return with significant NOLs, substantially all of which are only available to reduce the federal taxable income of WilTel and its subsidiaries, and has substantial other tax attributes and generates substantial deductions (primarily depreciation deductions), some of which are also available to offset the federal taxable income of the Company and its other subsidiaries. Although the amount of these deductions that can be used to offset the federal taxable income of other members of the Company's consolidated tax group is dependent upon a number of factors, including the future taxable income of WilTel and its subsidiaries, the Company does not expect it will have material federal income tax liabilities for the foreseeable future. For more information about WilTel's NOLs and tax attributes, see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.                                         35          The amount and availability of the Company's NOLs and other tax attributes are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations on the use of the NOLs, the Company's certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from accumulating five percent or more of the common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning five percent or more of the common shares from acquiring additional common shares. The restrictions will remain in effect until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2024, (b) the repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any comparable successor provision) or (c) the beginning of a taxable year of the Company to which certain tax benefits may no longer be carried forward.         As of March 4, 2005, the Company is authorized to repurchase 3,733,148 common shares. Such purchases may be made from time to time in the open market, through block trades or otherwise. Depending on market conditions and other factors, such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Except in connection with employees using common shares to pay the exercise price of employee stock options, the Company has not repurchased any common shares during the three year period ended December 31, 2004.         At December 31, 2004, no amounts were available to the Parent as dividends from its regulated subsidiary without regulatory approval. Cash and investments aggregating $241,000,000 are held by non-regulated subsidiaries that are parties to agreements which restrict the payment of dividends. For more information concerning the long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Consolidated Liquidity         In 2004, net cash was provided by operating activities, principally as a result of distributions from associated companies, the pre-funding by SBC of certain of WilTel's capital expenditures, the refund of excess federal income tax payments and an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments. In 2003, net cash was used for operating activities, principally due to corporate overhead expenses, reduced investment income, an increase in the investment in the trading portfolio and a $10,000,000 contribution to the Company's defined benefit pension plan. In 2002, net cash was provided by operating activities, principally as a result of a reduction to the Company's investment in the trading portfolio.         At December 31, 2004, WilTel had aggregate cash and investments of $239,700,000 available for use in its operating, investing and financing activities. Substantially all of WilTel's assets have been pledged to secure its outstanding long-term debt, principally to secure its obligations under its credit agreement ($359,400,000 outstanding as of December 31, 2004) and its mortgage debt ($60,300,000 outstanding at December 31, 2004).          In conjunction with a pricing agreement for certain voice services, in January 2004, SBC paid WilTel $25,000,000 for pre-funding of certain capital expenditures. The amount is reflected as a liability on the December 31, 2004 consolidated balance sheet. During 2004, WilTel expended all of these funds for the equipment specified in the pricing agreement. The agreement required that WilTel return the funds to SBC if, prior to January 31, 2005, WilTel and SBC entered into an agreement for voice transport pricing through December 31, 2006. Since such an agreement was not entered into, during the first quarter of 2005 WilTel will recognize the full amount as other income.         In September 2004, WilTel refinanced its existing $375,000,000 credit agreement debt by entering into an amended credit agreement consisting of a $240,000,000 first lien term loan facility, a $120,000,000 second lien term loan facility and a $25,000,000 revolving credit facility (which it can no longer draw upon, as discussed below). WilTel also used $90,000,000 of its cash and investments to repay in full one of the two mortgage notes that was secured by its headquarters building ($54,600,000 including accrued interest), reduce the amount outstanding under its credit agreement ($15,000,000), reduce the amount outstanding under the other note that is secured by its headquarters building ($13,300,000) and pay expenses. The amended credit agreement has not been guaranteed by the Company and is not secured by any of the Company's assets other than the assets of WilTel.                                         36          The first lien term loan facility requires quarterly principal payments of approximately $632,000 commencing December 31, 2004 through June 30, 2009, and quarterly principal payments of $57,000,000 thereafter until final maturity on June 30, 2010. The second lien term loan facility matures on December 31, 2010. However, if WilTel does not refinance its obligations under its outstanding mortgage debt prior to October 1, 2009, then the first lien term loan facility will mature on October 1, 2009, and if such mortgage debt is not refinanced by January 1, 2010, then the second lien term loan facility will mature on January 1, 2010. Loans under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate based upon either the prime rate or LIBOR, at WilTel's option, plus a specified margin for each loan. WilTel's obligations under its amended credit agreement are secured by substantially all of its assets other than those assets securing its headquarters building, for which the amended credit agreement lenders have a second priority lien, and its aircraft capital leases.         Pursuant to the terms of WilTel's amended credit agreement, SBC's announcement to migrate its IP-based and long distance services to the AT&T network is considered an event which could reasonably be expected to have a "material adverse effect" as defined in the facility, and as a result WilTel can no longer access its $25,000,000 revolving credit facility. WilTel does not anticipate needing the $25,000,000 revolving credit facility to meet its present requirements. The announcement does not have any impact on the $360,000,000 of term loans under WilTel's credit agreement. However, the credit agreement provides for an event of default if there is any amendment, supplement, modification or termination of any WilTel contract or agreement that has had or could reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on WilTel (as defined in the credit agreement). As mentioned above, WilTel is currently engaged in negotiations with SBC with respect to a transition pricing agreement and other matters which, if successfully concluded, may or may not be deemed an event of default under the WilTel credit agreement. WilTel intends to enter into discussions with its lenders before entering into any new definitive agreement with SBC.         WilTel's mortgage debt (which is non-recourse to the Company), has an interest rate of 7% and requires annual principal payments escalating from approximately $700,000 in 2005 to approximately $1,000,000 in 2009; a final payment of approximately $56,000,000 is due at maturity in April 2010.         The WilTel amended credit agreement contains covenants which require WilTel to meet certain operating targets, which it currently meets, and restrictions which limit WilTel's ability to incur additional indebtedness, spend funds on capital expenditures and make certain investments. The agreement also prohibits WilTel from paying dividends to the Company. The Company currently expects that WilTel will be able to meet the operating targets required by its credit agreement through 2006; however, compliance with the operating targets thereafter is uncertain because of SBC's announced intention to migrate its traffic to AT&T's network.         While WilTel has no material contractual commitments for capital expenditures, it may spend significant amounts each year, principally for network expansion, maintenance and product upgrades. In addition, WilTel may also incur additional capital expenditures upon the acquisition of new customers or when providing new products to existing customers. WilTel uses its available cash resources and operating profits to fund its capital expenditure needs. During 2004, WilTel spent approximately $73,200,000 for capital expenditures, including amounts that were pre-funded by SBC and that will be retained by WilTel.         WilTel is a party to various legal actions and claims, and has reserved $21,500,000 for the satisfaction of all litigation. Certain of these actions relate to the rights of way licensed to WilTel in connection with the installation of its fiber-optic cable and seek damages from WilTel for failure to obtain all necessary landowner consents. Additional right of way claims may be asserted against WilTel. The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of all claims, legal actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect upon WilTel's results of operations, although unfavorable outcomes could significantly impact WilTel's liquidity. During 2004, WilTel settled litigation for a cash payment of $5,000,000; the $18,500,000 excess of the reserved amount over the amount paid was recognized as other income.         As mentioned above, in February 2005 the Company's manufacturing division acquired the assets of NSW for approximately $28,000,000, thereby increasing its mix of products and customer base. The funds for the acquisition were provided from the Company's readily available cash resources.                                         37          The Company's consolidated banking and lending operations had outstanding loans (net of unearned finance charges) of $4,300,000 and $205,500,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These loans were primarily funded by deposits generated by the Company's deposit-taking facilities and by brokers, which totaled $24,600,000 and $145,500,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The cash flows generated from the collections on and sales of its loan portfolios have been used to retire these deposits as they matured. During 2004, the Company sold its subprime automobile and collateralized consumer loan portfolios for aggregate cash proceeds of $149,000,000, and sold certain loan portfolios that had been substantially written-off for aggregate cash proceeds of $8,100,000. The banking and lending segment is no longer making loans.         Operating activities at the banking and lending segment are currently concentrated on maximizing returns on its investment portfolio, collecting and servicing its remaining loan portfolios and discharging deposit liabilities as they come due. In 2004, AIB submitted an application to the state of Utah to convert AIB's current national charter to a Utah state commercial bank charter. However, in January 2005 the state of Utah notified AIB that it was suspending the application to convert AIB's charter until such time as AIB has the operational structure in place that is necessary to begin loan originations. AIB does not intend to make these changes. Since AIB's application to convert the charter was not approved, and since the OCC is requiring AIB to begin the regulatory process to surrender its national charter, AIB will file a plan with the OCC that will ultimately result in the surrender of its national bank charter. No assurance can be given that the OCC will approve AIB's plan of voluntary liquidation or that it will not take other adverse regulatory action.         The Company's debt instruments require maintenance of minimum Tangible Net Worth, limit distributions to shareholders and limit Indebtedness and Funded Debt (as such terms are defined in the agreements). In addition, the debt instruments contain limitations on investments, liens, contingent obligations and certain other matters. The Company is in compliance with all of these restrictions, and the Company has the ability to incur additional indebtedness or make distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions. Certain of the debt instruments of subsidiaries of the Company also contain restrictions which require the maintenance of financial covenants, impose restrictions on the ability to pay dividends to the Company and/or provide collateral to the lender. For more information, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.                                         38            As shown below, at December 31, 2004, the Company's contractual cash obligations totaled $3,030,611,000.

Estimated payments related to a currency swap agreement are based on the currency rate in effect at December 31, 2004. Material contractual obligations that are not included in the table above are the Company's deferred revenue obligations ($213,800,000) and the consolidated pension liability ($83,900,000). Deferred revenue obligations do not require the expenditure of material incremental cash; however, they do require WilTel to maintain its network for the benefit of itself and the other contracting party. Except for expected funding of $21,700,000 in 2005, the pension liability is excluded from the table because the timing of cash payments, if any, cannot be predicted.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements         At December 31, 2004, the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees and letters of credit aggregating $73,300,000. Pursuant to an agreement that was entered into before the Company sold CDS Holding Corporation ("CDS") to HomeFed in 2002, the Company agreed to provide project improvement bonds for the San Elijo Hills project. These bonds, which are for the benefit of the City of San Marcos, California and other government agencies, are required prior to the commencement of any development at the project. CDS is responsible for paying all third party fees related to obtaining the bonds. Should the City or others draw on the bonds for any reason, CDS and one of its subsidiaries would be obligated to reimburse the Company for the amount drawn. At December 31, 2004, the amount of outstanding bonds was $28,200,000, $27,700,000 of which expires in 2005, $400,000 in 2006 and the remainder in 2009. Subsidiaries of the Company have outstanding letters of credit aggregating $25,100,000 at December 31, 2004, principally to secure various obligations. All of these letters of credit expire during 2005. The Company's remaining guarantee at December 31, 2004 is a $20,000,000 indemnification given to a lender to a certain real estate property. The amount borrowed under this real estate financing is reflected as long-term debt in the Company's consolidated balance sheet.                                         39    Critical Accounting Estimates         The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions. The following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements, and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect, at a specific point in time, events whose ultimate outcome won't be known until a later date. Actual results could differ from these estimates.         Income Taxes - The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred taxes to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Historically, if the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment would increase income in such period. Similarly, if the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred taxes in the future, an adjustment would be charged to income in such period. The Company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities based on the Company's assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining its tax filing positions.         Subsequent to the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of WilTel, WilTel became a member of the Company's consolidated tax return. As discussed above, WilTel has significant tax attributes, some of which are available to offset the future taxable income of other members of the Company's consolidated federal income tax return. The Company established a valuation allowance that fully reserved for all of WilTel's net deferred tax assets, reduced by an amount equal to the Company's current and deferred federal income tax liabilities as of the date of acquisition (see allocation of the purchase price in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Except as discussed in results of operations below, before the Company can recognize a net deferred tax asset, it will need to demonstrate that on a pro forma combined basis with WilTel it will have had positive cumulative pre-tax income over a period of years. At that time, any decrease to the valuation allowance will be based significantly upon the Company's assumptions and projections of its future income, which are inherently uncertain.         During each of the last three years, the Company has adjusted its reserve for contingent tax liabilities and reduced income tax expense upon the conclusion of audits by various taxing jurisdictions or upon the expiration of the statute of limitations for the examination of the Company's tax returns. The adjustments have been material, reflecting the inherent difficulty of accurately estimating and accruing for the ultimate resolution of tax contingencies. The Company expects that adjustments to the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes and contingent tax liabilities could be made in the future and, if such adjustments are made, they could be material.         Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"), the Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether a long-lived asset (or asset group) is recoverable is based on management's estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset as compared to its carrying value. If the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, the carrying amount of the asset is considered to be not recoverable. The amount of the impairment recognized would be determined by estimating the fair value for the asset (or asset group) and recording a provision for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value.                                          40           As of December 31, 2004, the carrying amount of the Company's investment in the mineral rights and mining properties of MK Resources was approximately $85,400,000. The recoverability of this asset is entirely dependent upon the success of MK Resource's mining project at the Las Cruces copper deposit in the Pyrite Belt of Spain. Mining will be subject to obtaining required permits, obtaining both debt and equity financing for the project, engineering and construction. In addition, the actual price of copper, the operating cost of the mine and the capital cost (in U.S. dollars) to build the project and bring the mine into production will affect the recoverability of this asset. The Las Cruces project has been granted government subsidies of 47.5 million euros ($62,900,000); however, the grants require MK Resources to make certain capital expenditures by March 27, 2005, a deadline that it will not be able to meet principally because of delays in obtaining permits. Las Cruces has filed a request to further extend the deadline, but has been informed that the government will not act on the extension request prior to the current expiration.         To date, the Company has been the sole source of funding for the Las Cruces project. The amount of equity capital and third party financing that can be obtained for the project and its related cost will be significantly affected by the assessment of potential investors and lenders of the current and expected future market price of copper, as well as current market conditions for this type of investment. During 2004, MK Resources was unsuccessful in raising equity capital for the project, due to unfavorable market conditions at the time. MK Resources continues to explore financing possibilities. Based on the current status of the project, MK Resource's estimate of future cash flows and its assessment of financing possibilities, the Company believes the carrying amount of its investment is recoverable. However, if the Company is unable to obtain the permits required to begin construction of the mine and commence mining activities, is unable to obtain financing for the project or the capital cost of the project changes significantly, it is likely that this investment will be impaired.         At December 31, 2004, the carrying amount of the Company's investment in its manufacturing facility located in Belgium was approximately $17,900,000. The Belgium facility, which became operational in the third quarter of 2001, has not yet achieved the level of revenues and profitability originally expected by the Company, primarily due to the segment's loss of a major multi-national customer and insufficient demand from other customers. During 2004, a new general manager was hired at the facility to develop and implement marketing and sales initiatives directed at generating revenue growth. Operating results at the facility improved during 2004 as sales grew significantly compared to 2003 and the business achieved positive cash flow. However, new customer acquisitions must continue in order for the facility to reach profitability. Based on the current business plan, which includes estimates of revenue growth, the Company believes that its investment in the Belgium facility is recoverable. However, if the estimated revenue growth is not achieved, the carrying amount of the facility is likely to be impaired.         As discussed above, on January 31, 2005, SBC announced that it would buy AT&T Corp., and announced its intention to migrate the services provided by Network to the AT&T network. Since SBC is WilTel's and Network's largest customer, accounting for 70% of Network's 2004 revenues, the Company concluded that the SBC announcement is an event which requires the Company to assess the carrying value of WilTel's long-lived assets for impairment, principally property and equipment. Since the event which gave rise to the impairment review occurred on January 31, 2005, and is not reflective of a condition that existed as of December 31, 2004, the assessment of impairment will be performed as part of the preparation of the Company's financial statements for the first quarter of 2005, and does not effect the carrying amount of the Company's assets as of December 31, 2004. The carrying value of WilTel's property and equipment is approximately $1,054,700,000 at December 31, 2004.         The Company will have to make numerous assumptions and estimates about the future to prepare its impairment analysis. The process of estimating future cash flows is subjective and inherently inaccurate because precise information about the future is not available, and in this case is exacerbated by the volatility that the telecommunications industry has experienced over the past few years. The economics of WilTel's future relationship with SBC, including its term, is also uncertain, which will be one of the most significant variables in the analysis. WilTel is currently engaged in negotiations with SBC concerning this and other pricing matters. WilTel will also have to make assumptions concerning its ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers, reduce expenses and participate in potential consolidation opportunities as part of the analysis. The Company is not currently able to determine whether the carrying amounts of WilTel's long-lived assets are impaired.                                         41           Acquisition of WilTel - In connection with accounting for the acquisition of WilTel, significant judgments and estimates were made to determine the fair values of certain liabilities, including liabilities for net unfavorable long-term commitments and deferred revenue, many of which required the Company to make assumptions about the future. To determine the fair value of deferred revenue, the Company had to assess transactions having limited activity in the current telecommunications market environment. The Company considered market indicators related to pricing, pricing for comparable transactions, as well as the legal obligation of WilTel to provide future services. The Company also assumed WilTel would continue to perform its contractual obligations through the term of its contracts. Revenue is recognized on these contracts as services are performed, typically on a straight-line basis over the remaining length of the contract. In the future, if WilTel settles these obligations or they are otherwise terminated prior to completion of the performance obligation, the Company would likely recognize a gain equal to the carrying amount of the obligation. At December 31, 2004, the amount reflected in the consolidated balance sheet for deferred revenue was $213,800,000.         The Company evaluated the fair value of long-term commitments that were either above or below the current market rates for similar transactions, and the fair value of telecommunications capacity commitments that are not required based on WilTel's current operating plans. These commitments primarily consist of real estate leases and international capacity contracts. In order to determine the fair values of these agreements, the Company made significant assumptions concerning future market prices, future capacity utilization, the ability to enter into subleasing arrangements and that the commitments will not be terminated prior to their expiration dates. The accrued liability is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the commitments. Results of operations in the future would be impacted by any subsequent adjustment to this liability, which could result from negotiating a termination or reduction of its contractual obligation with contract counter-parties or sublease activity that is different from the Company's original assumptions. At December 31, 2004, the amount reflected in the consolidated balance sheet for unfavorable long-term commitments was $44,900,000.         Telecommunications Revenue Recognition - Capacity, transmission, video services and other telecommunications services revenues are recognized monthly as the services are provided or revenues are earned. If at the time services are rendered, collection is not reasonably assured either due to credit risk, the potential for billing disputes or other reasons, revenue is not recognized until such contingencies are resolved.         WilTel estimates the amount of services which should not be recognized as revenue at the time the service is rendered based on its collection experience for each type of service. Certain of WilTel's customers represent such a high credit risk due to their difficult financial position that revenue is not recognized until cash is received. In addition, WilTel knows from past experience that a certain percentage of its billings will be disputed and uses that experience to estimate the amount of expected disputes and defers recognition of revenue at the time the service is provided. Revenues that have not been recognized at the time service is provided are subsequently recognized as revenue when the amounts are collected.           Accruals for Access Costs - WilTel's access costs primarily include variable charges paid to vendors to originate and/or terminate switched voice traffic, which are based on actual usage at negotiated or regulated contract rates, and fixed charges for leased lines for dedicated facilities. At the end of each reporting period, WilTel's estimated accrual for incurred but not yet billed costs is based on internal usage reports. The accrual is subsequently reconciled to actual invoices as they are received, which is a process that can take several months to complete. This process includes an invoice validation procedure that normally identifies errors and inaccuracies in rate and/or volume components of the invoices resulting in numerous invoice disputes. It is WilTel's policy to adjust the accrual for the probable amount it believes will ultimately be paid on disputed invoices, a determination which requires significant estimation and judgment. Due to the number of different negotiated and regulated rates, constantly changing traffic patterns, uncertainty in the ultimate resolution of disputes, the period of time required to complete the reconciliation and delays in invoicing by access vendors, changes in these estimates should be expected.                                         42           Contingencies - The Company accrues for contingent losses when the contingent loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2004, the Company's consolidated balance sheet includes litigation reserves of $21,500,000, all of which relate to WilTel litigation. Estimating the ultimate outcome of litigation matters is inherently uncertain, in particular because the ultimate outcome will rest on events and decisions of others that may not be within the power of the Company to control. The Company does not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or liquidity. However, if the amounts ultimately paid at the resolution of a litigation matter are significantly different than the Company's recorded reserve amount, the difference could be material to the Company's consolidated results of operations and, with respect to WilTel, settlement amounts are likely to be material to its liquidity.   Results of Operations  Telecommunications         The following table reconciles WilTel's segment profit from operations to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2004 and for the period from November 6, 2003 (when WilTel became a consolidated subsidiary) through December 31, 2003. Prior to November 6, 2003, the Company accounted for its 47.4% share of WilTel's results under the equity method of accounting. Audited financial statements of WilTel for the period from January 1, 2003 to November 5, 2003 are filed as financial statement schedules to this Report. For WilTel's segments, segment profit from operations is the primary performance measure of segment operating results and profitability. WilTel defines segment profit from operations as income before income taxes, interest expense, investment income, depreciation and amortization expense and other non-operating income and expense.

(2)  If items in these categories can not be directly attributed to a particular      WilTel segment, they are allocated to each segment based upon a formula      that considers each segment's revenues, property and equipment and      headcount.         Network's revenues include services provided to SBC of $1,032,800,000 and $141,700,000 for the 2004 and 2003 periods, respectively, representing approximately 70% and 66%, respectively, of Network's operating revenues. Network's revenues from SBC have continued to grow throughout 2003 and 2004, principally related to voice products, for which SBC and WilTel have agreed to use a fixed price through April 1, 2005. The growth in voice revenue resulted from, in part, SBC's continued growth in long distance services in various states, including California, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois and Wisconsin. Revenues attributable to other RBOCs were approximately 6% and 5% of Network's operating revenues for the 2004 and 2003 periods, respectively. Revenues and gross margins for non-SBC related business continue to reflect the excess telecommunications capacity in the marketplace, which has resulted in lower prices for WilTel and others in the industry, and created a very competitive environment for acquiring new business. In 2004, WilTel's Network segment began to sell into the enterprise business market, although revenues have not been material to date.                                         43          As discussed above, SBC's announcement to migrate its business from Network to the AT&T network is expected to have a significant impact on WilTel's future revenues and profitability. SBC indicated that it expects to close its acquisition of AT&T in the first half of 2006. WilTel expects it will take anywhere from two to three years from now for SBC to migrate all of its traffic off of WilTel's network, and anticipates that it will continue to provide some level of service to SBC into 2007. WilTel expects it will evaluate and implement cost reduction strategies, investigate sales of assets and minimize capital expenditure outlays to help offset the loss of SBC's business. However, given the current economic condition of the telecommunications industry as a whole, where telecommunications capacity far exceeds actual demand and the marketplace is characterized by fierce price competition, and the limited growth of non-SBC business over the past few years, WilTel does not believe it will be able to fully replace the revenues and profits generated by the SBC agreements in the near future, if ever.         Network's cost of sales has increased in line with revenue growth throughout 2003 and 2004, and is comprised of variable charges paid to access vendors to originate and/or terminate switched voice traffic, and fixed charges for leased facilities and local off-net costs. The price Network pays for these services has been declining, generally in line with declines experienced by Network in its pricing of its own services to customers. Network's gross margin percentage has been adversely affected by a larger mix of voice transport business, principally resulting from SBC's growth, which has a lower gross margin as compared to some of Network's other products and services. In addition, Network cost of sales in 2004 includes a charge of $3,500,000 for international voice access costs, for which no revenue was recognized. WilTel entered into a commitment for these access costs in order to provide services for a specific customer; however, the customer defaulted under its contract, and WilTel accrued the remaining amount of the commitment, but does not expect to be able to recover from its customer.         Network's salaries were $121,000,000 and $16,300,000 for the 2004 and 2003 periods, respectively, and selling, general and other expenses were $155,500,000 and $24,000,000 for the 2004 and 2003 periods, respectively. Selling, general and other expenses in 2004 include a reduction of $4,100,000 to the provision for doubtful accounts, principally due to the collection of previously reserved accounts receivable which had been in dispute. The provision for doubtful accounts also includes a charge of $2,700,000 to fully reserve for another customer's accounts receivable which is not expected to be collected. Selling, general and other expenses in 2004 include $5,000,000 for estimated repair costs for WilTel's headquarters building. The need for repair work arose after the building was damaged in a severe storm. While insurance recovery is deemed probable for some repairs to the building, the accrual relates to repairs for which insurance recovery is not assured, as they are necessitated by underlying design flaws in the building. WilTel will seek to obtain reimbursement from the responsible parties; however, no recovery has been accrued. Network's salaries expense and selling, general and other expenses for 2004 reflect lower headcount, higher costs of performance-based compensation, greater personnel retention costs and greater vendor contract maintenance costs for the network.         Vyvx operating revenues were $120,500,000 and $20,600,000 for the 2004 and 2003 periods, respectively. Revenues in 2004 were slightly lower due in part to fewer hockey game broadcasts due to the National Hockey League labor dispute and customers switching to lower cost Vyvx products. Although the lower priced products result in less revenue, the costs to provide these products and related selling, general and other expenses is also lower, which results in increased segment profits. Approximately 62% of Vyvx's 2004 operating revenue was derived from its top 10 customers. Fox and its parent company, The News Corporation Limited, through their various news, sports and entertainment businesses, accounted for approximately 18% of Vyvx's 2004 revenues and TimeWarner, Inc. accounted for 16% of Vyvx's 2004 revenues. These percentages were not significantly different during the 2003 period. Approximately 65% of Vyvx's 2004 revenues are from the sale of fiber optic and satellite video transport services and the remaining 35% of revenues are from the sale of advertising distribution services.                                         44          Vyvx cost of sales reflects the level of revenue and is comprised primarily of amounts billed by Network to Vyvx for transporting content over the WilTel network, costs paid to other providers for local access and other off-net services, transponder expenses and freight and overnight delivery costs. The Company's consolidated statement of operations includes Vyvx salaries expense of $18,600,000 and $3,000,000, respectively, and selling, general and other expenses of $15,900,000 and $3,700,000, respectively, for the 2004 and 2003 periods.         For 2004, WilTel's other non-operating income includes income of $18,500,000 related to the settlement of litigation for less than amounts reserved, income of $6,000,000 related to the sale of an equity security which had a zero book value, gains of $3,500,000 related to cash and securities received in excess of the book value of secured claims in customers' bankruptcies, and income of $2,300,000 related to the reversal of excess reserves for long-term commitments.  Healthcare Services         Pre-tax income (loss) of the healthcare services segment was $5,100,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $(2,300,000) for the four month period from acquisition through December 31, 2003. For the 2004 and 2003 periods, healthcare services revenues were $257,300,000 and $71,000,000, respectively, and cost of sales, which primarily consist of salaries and employee benefits, were $216,300,000 and $61,300,000, respectively.         Since its acquisition in September 2003, Symphony has been focused on profitably growing its business and, because of the nature of its business, attracting and hiring skilled professionals to provide its services. The ability of Symphony to continue to grow its business depends heavily upon its ability to attract, develop and retain qualified therapists. There is a current shortage of qualified therapists industry-wide, and Symphony has open positions to provide service to new customers, provide additional service offerings for existing customers and through normal employee turnover. The tight labor market causes Symphony and others in its industry to hire, at times, independent contractors to perform required services, which may increase costs and reduce margins, and can also result in lost revenue opportunities.         During 2004, Symphony performed an evaluation of its customer base, in order to identify those customers and markets where Symphony can deliver the highest level of service and that should be the focus of customer retention efforts, as well as identifying those customers that should be terminated. In addition, Symphony has restructured its corporate management and field operations organization, resulting in a more efficient organization with reduced costs. Symphony is also seeking to grow its profitable businesses, which includes expanding its service offerings to existing customers. Symphony may look for strategic acquisitions to increase its customer base and pool of professional service providers; however, no assurance can be given that it will be successful in those efforts.                                         45          Legislative caps on Part B Medicare therapy, which negatively impacted Symphony's revenues in 2003, have been removed for 2004 and 2005, and the fee schedule for such services has also been increased by 1.5%. As a result, Symphony's average quarterly 2004 revenues for these therapy services increased by approximately 44% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2003, comparing only those locations that were operating during all periods. Symphony also added new customers during 2004; however, certain low margin and non-profitable accounts were cancelled, resulting in a slight decrease in total locations serviced. During 2004, one customer accounted for approximately 16% of Symphony's revenues. Symphony's margins for 2004 also reflect higher hourly wages and benefits paid to attract and retain its therapists, and increased costs to hire independent contractors as a result of hiring needs for both full-time and part-time professionals. In order to maintain and improve margins in the challenging labor market in which Symphony operates, Symphony is focused on obtaining sufficient pricing for new and renewal business, as well as cost effective employee retention programs. Pre-tax results for 2004 also reflect approximately $3,300,000 from the collection of receivables in excess of their carrying amounts, a decrease in estimated liabilities for employee health insurance costs and other third party claims of approximately $1,700,000, and a gain of $1,000,000 from the sale of certain property. In addition, pre-tax results for 2004 reflect approximately $3,900,000 of costs, principally severance for Symphony's former chief executive officer and others due to reorganizing and consolidating certain field operations and closing offices.         The moratorium on legislative caps for Part B Medicare therapy is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2005. While there is some congressional support for an extension of the moratorium, there is also concern regarding the cost of an extension. Symphony is unable to predict what the ultimate outcome will be; however, any re-introduction of the legislative caps or other methodology that reduces fees for Part B Medicare therapy could significantly reduce Symphony's revenues.  Manufacturing         Pre-tax income for the manufacturing segment was $7,900,000, $4,400,000 and $3,100,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Manufacturing revenues were $64,100,000, $53,300,000 and $50,700,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Revenues increased by 20% in 2004 and by 5% in 2003, while they declined by 5% in 2002 as compared to the prior year.         Manufacturing revenues in 2004 increased in substantially all of the division's markets. The Company believes that these increases result from a variety of factors including an improved economy, new product development and the acquisition in the first quarter of 2004 of customer receivables and inventory of a competitor that was exiting certain markets. Although raw material costs increased significantly in 2004, the division increased selling prices in most markets, that along with increased sales and production volumes enabled it to maintain its gross profit margins. The primary raw material in the division's products is a polypropylene resin, which is a byproduct of the oil refining process, whose price tends to increase and decrease with the price of oil. There is relatively little direct labor or other raw material costs in the division's products. In addition to managing resin purchases, the division also has initiatives to reduce and/or reuse scrap thereby increasing raw material utilization.         As a result, the division's gross profit and gross profit margins increased in 2004 as compared to 2003. Pre-tax results for 2004 also reflect greater salaries expense, due to higher bonuses attributable to the division's improved performance. During 2005, the division will seek to gain additional cost efficiencies resulting from its acquisition of NSW, principally in administration and overhead expense and raw material purchasing. In addition, the division will look to make other strategic acquisitions of smaller entities that serve the same markets as NSW, primarily those that supply package netting and filtration products.         The increase in manufacturing revenues in 2003 primarily resulted from increases in the construction and consumer products markets of $6,200,000, although revenues in the carpet padding and agricultural markets declined. However, gross profit declined, as the increase in the price of resin more than offset the revenue increase. Pre-tax results improved due to lower salaries and selling, general and other expenses principally as a result of workforce reductions and other cost reduction programs, cash received from government grants and a gain from the sale of a line of business. In addition, the impairment charge that is discussed below reduced pre-tax results in 2002.         For the year ended December 31, 2002, the division recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1,250,000 to write down the book value of certain production lines that the division did not expect would be utilized over the next several years. These lines were initially purchased to provide additional capacity to produce a specific product for a specific customer; however, the customer discontinued the product in 2001 and the Company determined that the cost of these lines were no longer recoverable from other business.                                         46   Banking and Lending         As stated previously, the current activities of the banking and lending segment are concentrated on collecting and servicing its remaining loan portfolio, maximizing returns on its investment portfolio and discharging deposit liabilities as they come due. As a result, revenues and expenses for this segment included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations are reflective of the continuing decrease in the size of the loan portfolio. In addition, as described earlier in this Report, during 2004, the Company sold its subprime automobile and collateralized consumer loan portfolios representing approximately 97% of its total outstanding loans (net of unearned finance charges) and certain loan portfolios that had been substantially written-off for aggregate pre-tax gains of $16,300,000, which is reflected in investment and other income. Pre-tax income for the banking and lending segment was $22,000,000, $8,400,000 and $1,900,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.         Finance revenues, which reflect both the level and mix of consumer instalment loans, decreased in each of the last two years as compared to the prior period, as average loans outstanding were $57,100,000, $283,000,000 and $440,800,000 during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Although finance revenues decreased in 2004 as compared to 2003, pre-tax results increased due to gains from the loan portfolios sales, a decline in the provision for loan losses of $24,700,000, reductions in interest expense of $6,000,000 principally resulting from reduced customer banking deposits, less interest paid on interest rate swaps and lower salaries expense and operating costs resulting from the segment's restructuring efforts. All of these changes reflect the ongoing reduction in the amount of loan assets under management, including as a result of the loan portfolios sales.         Although finance revenues decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002 for the reasons described above, pre-tax results increased primarily due to a $9,300,000 reduction in interest expense, due to reduced customer banking deposits and lower interest rates thereon, a decline in the provision for loan losses of $19,600,000, less interest paid on interest rate swaps and lower salaries expense and operating costs resulting from the segment's restructuring efforts. The reduction in the provision for bad debts resulted from the decrease in the size of the consumer loan portfolios. However, the Company increased its allowance during the third quarter of 2003 by $4,000,000 as a result of an increase in delinquency, which shortly followed the outsourcing of loan collection activities.         Pre-tax results for the banking and lending segment include income of $3,100,000 and $3,500,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, resulting from mark-to-market changes on its interest rate swaps. The Company used interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rate changes on its customer banking deposits; all of the segment's interest rate swaps matured in 2003. Although the Company believes that these derivative financial instruments served as economic hedges, they did not meet certain effectiveness criteria under SFAS 133 and, therefore, were not accounted for as hedges.                                         47   Domestic Real Estate         Pre-tax income for the domestic real estate segment was $20,700,000, $18,100,000 and $16,300,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Pre-tax results for the domestic real estate segment are largely dependent upon the performance of the segment's operating properties, the current status of the Company's real estate development projects and non-recurring gains or losses recognized when real estate assets are sold. As a result, the results of operations for this segment in the aggregate for any particular year are not predictable and do not follow any consistent pattern.         Revenues and pre-tax results for this segment increased in 2004 as compared to 2003, primarily due to the sale of 92 lots at the Company's 95-lot development project in South Walton County, Florida for aggregate sales proceeds of approximately $50,000,000 for which the Company recognized pre-tax profits of $15,800,000, net of minority interest. The Company will be required under the sale agreements to make significant improvements to the property, including infrastructure and certain amenities, which it expects to complete in 2005. The Company estimates it will recognize additional pre-tax profit of $10,200,000 related to this project. In addition, revenues during 2004 reflect the sale of certain unimproved land for cash proceeds of $8,800,000, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $7,600,000. Revenues during 2004 also reflect decreased gains from property sales at the Company's other residential and commercial project in the Florida panhandle as the lots have largely been sold, and less amortization of deferred gains from sales of real estate in prior years. Pre-tax results for 2004 also reflect due diligence expenses for a real estate development project that the Company decided not to develop.         Revenues and pre-tax results from domestic real estate increased in 2003 as compared to 2002, primarily as a result of improved operating performance at the Company's Hawaiian hotel. Gains recognized from sales of real estate during 2003 declined by $8,300,000, principally due to the gains on sale of real estate of CDS prior to its sale in 2002. During 2003, the Company also recognized $11,100,000 of deferred gains from sales of real estate in prior years.         During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company sold one of its real estate subsidiaries, CDS, to HomeFed for a purchase price of $25,000,000, consisting of $1,000,000 in cash and 2,474,226 shares of HomeFed's common stock, which represented approximately 30% of the outstanding HomeFed stock. CDS's principal asset is the master-planned community located in San Diego County, California known as San Elijo Hills, for which HomeFed has served as the development manager since 1998. Prior to the sale to HomeFed, the Company recognized pre-tax gains of $7,800,000 from sales of residential sites at San Elijo Hills during 2002.  Corporate and Other Operations         Investment and other income increased in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the pre-tax gain from the sale of two of the Company's older corporate aircraft, discussed above, greater dividend and interest income of $12,400,000 and miscellaneous other income. Available corporate cash is generally invested on a short-term basis until such time as investment opportunities require an expenditure of funds. Investment and other income for 2003 included $5,300,000 of income related to a refund of foreign taxes not based on income.                                         48          Investment and other income declined in 2003 as compared to 2002, principally as a result of a non-recurring gain of $14,300,000 recognized in 2002 from the sale of the Company's thoroughbred racetrack business. Corporate investment income also declined as a result of lower interest rates in 2003 and foreign exchange gains recorded in 2002. During 2003, income related to accounting for the market values of Corporate's derivative financial instruments increased by $5,600,000, and the Company also recorded $5,300,000 of income related to a refund of foreign taxes not based on income. In addition, revenues from the Company's gas operations increased in 2003 principally due to increased production and prices.         Net securities gains (losses) for Corporate and Other Operations aggregated $136,100,000, $10,600,000 and $(31,300,000) for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2004, substantially all of the Company's net securities gains reflect realized gains from the sale of publicly traded debt and equity securities that had been classified as Corporate available for sale securities. Net securities gains (losses) for 2004, 2003 and 2002 include provisions of $4,600,000, $6,500,000 and $37,100,000, respectively, to write down the Company's investments in certain available for sale securities and an investment in a non-public security in 2003 and an equity investment in a non-public fund in 2002. The write down of the securities resulted from a decline in market value determined to be other than temporary.         The Company's decision to sell securities and realize security gains or losses is generally based on its evaluation of an individual security's value at the time and the prospect for changes in its value in the future. The decision can also be influenced by the status of the Company's tax attributes but in recent years has not been influenced by liquidity needs. Therefore, the timing of realized security gains or losses is not predictable and does not follow any pattern from year to year.         The increase in interest expense during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily reflects interest expense relating to the $375,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 7% Senior Notes issued during 2003 and 2004, the issuance of $350,000,000 principal amount of its 3 3/4% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes in 2004 and dividends accrued on its trust issued preferred securities, which commencing July 1, 2003 are classified as interest expense (shown as minority interest in prior periods) as a result of the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150. The increase in interest expense during 2003 as compared to 2002 principally results from the issuance of $275,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 7% Senior Notes that were issued in 2003 and dividends accrued on its trust issued preferred securities.         The increase in selling, general and other expenses of $19,700,000 in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily reflects greater professional and other fees of $8,500,000, which largely relate to due diligence expenses for potential investments, greater professional fees for existing investments and fees relating to the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and $3,600,000 of expenses related to the proposed public offering of MK Resources' equity that did not go forward due to unfavorable market conditions. In addition, the increase reflects greater employee benefit expenses, higher insurance costs and greater amortization of debt issuance costs related to the 7% Senior Notes and 3 3/4% Convertible Notes.           Selling, general and other expenses also include additions to cost of goods sold of the winery operations of $3,900,000, $4,300,000 and $2,100,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The winery operations, which account for inventory under the LIFO method of accounting, recorded adjustments to cost of goods sold based upon the results of its annual harvest. The additional expenses recorded in each of the last three years were due primarily to a lower yield than had been previously estimated.         The income tax provision reflects the reversal of tax reserves aggregating $27,300,000, $24,400,000 and $120,000,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, as a result of the favorable resolution of various state and federal income tax contingencies. In addition, in 2004 the tax provision reflects a benefit to record a federal income tax carryback refund of $3,900,000.                                         49          In 2003, the Company established a valuation allowance that fully reserved for all of WilTel's net deferred tax assets, reduced by an amount equal to the Company's current and deferred federal income tax liabilities as of the date of acquisition. The Company needs the valuation allowance because, on a pro forma combined basis, the Company is not able to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that it will be able to realize the deferred tax asset. Subsequent to the acquisition of WilTel, any benefit realized from WilTel's deferred tax asset reduces the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset; however, that reduction is first applied to reduce the carrying amount of the acquired non-current intangible assets of WilTel rather than reduce the income tax provision of any component of total comprehensive income.         As a result, the various components of comprehensive income include an aggregate federal income tax provision of $22,300,000 in 2004 and $22,500,000 in 2003 (for the period subsequent to the acquisition of WilTel), even though no federal income tax for those periods was due. During 2004, the effect of recording this tax provision and the resulting reduction to the valuation allowance was to reduce the carrying amount of the acquired non-current intangible assets to zero. Income tax expense for 2003 also includes the Company's actual income tax expense for the period prior to the acquisition of WilTel.         Now that the non-current intangible assets have been reduced to zero, the Company does not expect it will reflect a net federal income tax expense or benefit for total comprehensive income in the aggregate until such time as the Company is able to reduce its valuation allowance and recognize a net deferred tax asset. Each component of other comprehensive income may reflect either a federal income tax provision or benefit in future periods, depending upon the relative amounts of each component; however, in the aggregate for all components the Company does not expect to report any net federal income tax expense or benefit for the foreseeable future.

The Company's income from this investment is expected to be limited to its share of the annual management fee received from FINOVA while such fee remains in effect, which is $4,000,000. The Company has received total net cash proceeds of $91,200,000 from this investment since 2001, including the commitment and financing fees, management fees and interest payments related to its share of the Berkadia loan.         The Company's investment in Olympus was made in December 2001, when Olympus commenced its operations as a newly formed Bermuda reinsurance company primarily engaged in the property excess, marine and aviation reinsurance business. The decline in the Company's share of its earnings in 2004 as compared to 2003 reflects the impact of property damage claims caused by severe hurricanes. The Company's share of its earnings increased in 2003 as compared to the prior year, reflecting the growth in Olympus' premium revenues during its second year of operation. As a result of redemptions of other investors' equity interests in the first half of 2004, the Company's percentage interest in Olympus increased from approximately 16% to 19%.                                         50          The equity in income (losses) of EagleRock results from both realized and changes in unrealized gains (losses) in its portfolio. In 2004, $3,700,000 was distributed by the partnership to the Company.         In January 2004, the Company invested $50,000,000 in Pershing Square, L.P. ("Pershing"), a limited partnership that is authorized to engage in a variety of investing activities. The Company redeemed its interest as of December 31, 2004, and the total amount due from Pershing of $71,300,000 (which was paid during the first quarter of 2005) is included in trade, notes and other receivables, net in the Company's consolidated balance sheet.         As more fully described above, the Company acquired its investment in HomeFed in the fourth quarter of 2002. During 2004, HomeFed reported lower earnings from sales of real estate as compared to the prior year principally at the San Elijo Hills project.         As discussed above, WilTel became a consolidated subsidiary in November 2003 and the Company ceased applying the equity method of accounting at that time. For 2003, the Company's share of WilTel's results of operations included income from the recognition of non-operating settlement gains related to the termination of various agreements that released WilTel from previously accrued obligations, recoveries of previously written off receivables and a gain on the sale of a subsidiary. The Company's share of these gains was approximately $31,200,000. The Company did not record a deferred tax benefit for its share of WilTel's losses while applying the equity method as its ability to use the capital loss to reduce the tax due on capital gains in the future is uncertain.  Discontinued Operations         Wireless Messaging         In December 2002, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase certain debt and equity securities of WebLink Wireless, Inc. ("WebLink"), for an aggregate purchase price of $19,000,000. WebLink operated in the wireless messaging industry, providing wireless data services and traditional paging services. In the fourth quarter of 2003, WebLink sold substantially all of its operating assets to Metrocall, Inc. for 500,000 shares of common stock of Metrocall, Inc's parent, Metrocall Holdings, Inc. ("Metrocall"), an immediately exercisable warrant to purchase 25,000 shares of common stock of Metrocall at $40 per share, and a warrant to purchase up to 100,000 additional shares of Metrocall common stock at $40 per share, subject to certain vesting criteria. Based upon the market price of the Metrocall stock received and the fair value of the warrants received as of the date of sale, the Company reported a pre-tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations of $11,500,000. The vesting criteria for the remaining warrants were satisfied during 2004, and the Company recorded $2,200,000 as gain on disposal of discontinued operations (net of minority interest), which represented the estimated fair value of the warrants. Due to WebLink's large net operating loss carryforwards, these gains were not reduced for any federal income tax expense.         During the fourth quarter of 2004, WebLink exercised all of its warrants and subsequently tendered all of its Metrocall shares as part of a merger agreement between Metrocall and Arch Wireless, Inc. WebLink received cash of $19,900,000 and 675,607 common shares of the new parent company (USA Mobility, Inc., which had a fair market value of $25,000,000 when received), resulting in a pre-tax gain of $15,800,000 that is included in net securities gains of continuing operations. The Company's investment in the shares of USA Mobility at December 31, 2004 are classified as a non-current investment.         In return for the Company's $19,000,000 investment in WebLink, the Company has received cash and securities aggregating $48,400,000, based on the market price of USA Mobility as of December 31, 2004. Such amount has been reduced for the minority interest and liabilities of WebLink which remain to be paid.                                         51          Foreign Real Estate         In 2002, the Company sold its interest in Fidei to an unrelated third party for total proceeds of 70,400,000 Euros ($66,200,000), which resulted in an after tax gain on the sale reflected in results of operations of $4,500,000 (net of income tax expense of $2,400,000) for the year ended December 31, 2002, and an increase to shareholders' equity of $12,100,000 as of December 31, 2002. The Euro denominated sale proceeds were not converted into U.S. dollars immediately upon receipt. The Company entered into a participating currency derivative, which expired later in 2002. Upon expiration, net of the premium paid to purchase the contract, the Company received $67,900,000 in exchange for 70,000,000 Euros and recognized a foreign exchange gain of $2,000,000, which is included in investment and other income for the year ended December 31, 2002.         Domestic Real Estate         In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company sold a commercial real estate property and classified it as a discontinued operation. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $7,100,000 to reduce the carrying amount of this property to its estimated fair value. The Company recorded an additional pre-tax loss from the sale of $600,000, principally relating to mortgage prepayment penalties incurred upon satisfaction of the property's mortgage at closing. Operating results for this property were not material in prior years.         Other Operations         In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company sold its geothermal power generation business for $14,800,000, net of closing costs, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $200,000. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded pre-tax losses from discontinued operations relating to this business of $1,500,000, $2,300,000 and $2,800,000, respectively.   Recently Issued Accounting Standards         In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151, "Inventory Costs--An Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4" ("SFAS 151"), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. SFAS 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43 to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Among other provisions, SFAS 151 requires that items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of "so abnormal" as stated in ARB No. 43. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 151 on its consolidated financial statements.                                         52          In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), which replaces SFAS 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees". SFAS 123R requires that the cost of all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. That cost will be recognized as an expense over the vesting period of the award. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. In addition, the Company will be required to determine fair value in accordance with SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R is effective for reporting periods beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005, with early adoption encouraged, and requires the application of a transition methodology for stock options that have not vested as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 123R on its consolidated financial statements.         In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets--An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29" ("SFAS 153"), which is effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. SFAS 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB Opinion No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions," and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. The adoption of SFAS 153 will not have any material effect on the consolidated financial statements; however, SFAS 153 could impact the accounting for future transactions, if any, within its scope.

The factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by any of these statements or which may materially and adversely affect the Company's actual results include, but are not limited to, those discussed or identified from time to time in the Company's public filings, including:         A worsening of general economic and market conditions or increases in        prevailing interest rate levels, which may result in reduced sales of our        products and services, lower valuations for our associated companies and        investments or a negative impact on the credit quality of our assets;                                         53          Changes in foreign and domestic laws, regulations and taxes, which may        result in higher costs and lower revenue for our businesses, including as        a result of unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, currency        fluctuations, changes in governmental policies, expropriation,        nationalization, confiscation of assets and changes in legislation        relating to non-U.S. ownership;         Increased competition and changes in pricing environments, which may        result in decreasing revenues and/or margins, increased raw materials        costs for our plastics business, loss of market share or significant        price erosion;         Continued instability and uncertainty in the telecommunications industry,        associated with increased competition, aggressive pricing and        overcapacity;         Dependence on key personnel, in particular, our Chairman and President,        the loss of whom would severely affect our ability to develop and        implement our business strategy;         Inability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, which would        make it difficult to conduct the businesses of certain of our        subsidiaries, including WilTel and Symphony;         Adverse legal and regulatory developments that may affect particular        businesses, such as regulatory developments in the telecommunications and        healthcare industries, or in the environmental area, which could affect        the Company's real estate development activities and telecommunications        business, as well as the Company's other operations;         WilTel's ability to replace the revenues generated by SBC, which if lost        as a result of SBC's proposed acquisition of AT&T will have a significant        adverse impact on WilTel's results of operations;         WilTel's ability to acquire or maintain rights of way necessary for the        operation of its network, which could require WilTel to find alternate        routes or increase WilTel's costs to provide services to its customers;         WilTel's dependence on a small number of suppliers and high-volume        customers, the loss of any of which could adversely affect WilTel's        ability to generate operating profits and positive cash flows;         Changes in telecommunications laws and regulations, which could adversely        affect WilTel and its customers through, for example, higher costs,        increased competition and a loss of revenue;         Adverse regulatory developments impacting Medicare, which could        materially reduce Symphony's revenues;         Weather related conditions and significant natural disasters, including        hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes and hailstorms, which may        impact our wineries, real estate holdings and reinsurance operations;         The inability to insure or reinsure certain risks economically, or the        ability to collect on insurance or reinsurance policies, which could        result in the Company having to self-insure business risks;                                         54          Changes in U.S. real estate markets and real estate collateral values,        including the residential market in Southern California and the        commercial market in Washington D.C., which are sensitive to mortgage        interest rate levels, and the vacation market in Hawaii;         Adverse economic, political or environmental developments in Spain, which        could delay or preclude the issuance of permits necessary to develop the        Company's copper mineral rights or which could result in increased costs        of bringing the project to completion and increased costs in financing        the development of the project;         The inability to obtain necessary financing for the Las Cruces copper        mining project, which could delay or prevent completion of the project;         Decreases in world wide copper prices or weakening of the U.S. dollar        against the euro, which could adversely affect the commercial viability        of the Company's mineral rights in Spain;         WilTel's ability to adapt to technological developments or continued or        increased pricing competition in the telecommunications industry, which        could adversely affect WilTel's ability to generate operating profits and        positive cash flows;         WilTel's inability to generate operating profits and positive cash flows,        which could result in a default under WilTel's credit agreement, pursuant        to which substantially all of its assets are pledged;         Current and future legal and administrative claims and proceedings        against WilTel, which may result in increased costs and diversion of        management's attention;         Regional or general increases in the cost of living, particularly in the        regions in which the Company has operations or sells its products or        services, which may result in lower sales of such products and service;        and         Risks associated with future acquisitions and investments, including        changes in the composition of the Company's assets and liabilities        through such acquisitions, diversion of management's attention from        normal daily operations of the business and insufficient revenues to        offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions.          This list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward-looking statements is illustrative, but is not intended to be exhaustive. Therefore, all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which are applicable only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this Report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.                                         55           Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.        -------   ----------------------------------------------------------         The following includes "forward-looking statements" that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.         The Company's market risk arises principally from interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio, its borrowing activities and the banking and lending activities of certain subsidiaries.         The Company's investment portfolio is primarily classified as available for sale, and consequently, is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in shareholders' equity. Included in the Company's available for sale investment portfolio are fixed income securities, which comprised approximately 69% of the Company's total investment portfolio at December 31, 2004. These fixed income securities are primarily rated "investment grade" or are U.S. governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations. The estimated weighted average remaining life of these fixed income securities was approximately 1.1 years at December 31, 2004. The Company's fixed income securities, like all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. The Company's investment portfolio also includes its investment in WMIG, carried at its aggregate market value of $242,300,000. This investment is approximately 13% of the Company's total investment portfolio, and its value is subject to change if the market value of the WMIG stock rises or falls. At December 31, 2003, fixed income securities comprised approximately 70% of the Company's total investment portfolio and had an estimated weighted average remaining life of 2.0 years. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company's portfolio of trading securities was not material.         The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its long-term fixed interest rate debt. Generally, the fair market value of debt securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall, and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise.           As previously discussed in this Report, the Company's banking and lending operations stopped originating all loans in 2003, and in 2004, sold the vast majority of its outstanding loans. Cash generated from the collections on and sales of its loan portfolios were used to retire customer deposits as they matured. The Company's banking and lending operations currently are not accepting new consumer or brokered deposits. The Company's banking and lending operations are subject to risk primarily resulting from interest rate fluctuations in its investment portfolio, which is classified as available for sale, repurchase agreements and customer deposits. The investment portfolio primarily consists of investments in mortgage-backed securities for which the underlying assets are adjustable rate mortgages with a weighted average repricing of approximately seven months. The Company's banking and lending operations employ leverage to enhance the investment returns; these fixed rate borrowings, comprised by the repurchase agreements, have an average term as of December 31, 2004 of approximately fifteen days. The principal objectives of the Company's banking and lending asset/liability management activities are to provide maximum levels of net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk. The Company utilizes an interest rate sensitivity model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk that is present. The model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on the projected net interest margin over the ensuing twelve-month period.           The following table provides information about the Company's financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are primarily sensitive to changes in interest rates. For investment securities and debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates. For the variable rate notes receivable and variable rate borrowings, the weighted average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. For loans, securities and liabilities with contractual maturities, the table presents contractual principal cash flows adjusted for the Company's historical experience and prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. For banking and lending's variable rate products, the weighted average variable rates are based upon the rates at the reporting date. For money market deposits that have no contractual maturity, the table presents principal cash flows based on management's judgment. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts by contractual maturity date.                                         56           For additional information, see Notes 6, 11 and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
