Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition - ------   and Results of Operations.          -----------------------------------------------------------       The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the Company's consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and results of operations. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this Report.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Parent Company Liquidity       Leucadia National Corporation (the "Parent") is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock of its direct subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents and other investments. The Parent continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing operations and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value. Accordingly, while the Parent does not have any material arrangement, commitment or understanding with respect thereto (except as disclosed in this Report), further acquisitions, divestitures, investments and changes in capital structure are possible. Its principal sources of funds are its available cash resources, bank borrowings, public and private capital market transactions, repayment of subsidiary advances, funds distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management and other fees, and borrowings and dividends from its regulated and non-regulated subsidiaries. It has no substantial recurring cash requirements other than payment of interest and principal on its debt, tax payments and corporate overhead expenses.       As of December 31, 2001, the Company's readily available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding those amounts held by its regulated subsidiaries, totaled $805,000,000. This amount is comprised of cash and short-term bonds and notes of the United States Government and its agencies of $495,800,000 (62%), the equity investment in WMIG of $130,500,000 (16%) described below, and other publicly traded debt and equity securities aggregating $178,700,000 (22%). Additional sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2001 include $163,800,000 of cash and marketable securities collateralizing letters of credit and $102,600,000 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by Fidei.       Except for the Euro denominated debt of Fidei, which is non-recourse to the Company, the Parent maintains the principal borrowings for the Company and its non-banking subsidiaries and has provided working capital to certain of its subsidiaries. These borrowings have primarily been made from banks through the Company's credit agreement facility and through public financings. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company did not use its $152,500,000 unsecured bank credit facility. This facility bears interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate or the prime rate and matures in June 2003.       During 2001, the Company borrowed $53,100,000 secured by its corporate aircraft. This debt bears interest based on a floating rate, requires monthly payments of principal and interest and matures in ten years. The Company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement for this financing, which fixed the interest rate at approximately 5.7%.       The Company is financing the renovation of its Hawaiian hotel and has obtained loan commitments totaling $25,000,000. At December 31, 2001, the amount outstanding under this borrowing was $18,900,000. The borrowing matures in seven years and is collateralized by the hotel.       As of February 22, 2002, the Company is authorized to repurchase an additional 4,494,000 Common Shares. Such purchases may be made from time to time in the open market, through block trades or                                         16   otherwise. Depending on market conditions and other factors, such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice.       At December 31, 2001, a maximum of $8,100,000 was available to the Parent as dividends from its regulated subsidiaries without regulatory approval. Additional amounts may be available to the Parent in the form of loans or cash advances from regulated subsidiaries, although no amounts were outstanding at December 31, 2001 or borrowed to date in 2002. There are no restrictions on distributions from non-regulated subsidiaries. The Parent also receives tax sharing payments from subsidiaries included in its consolidated income tax return, including certain regulated subsidiaries. Payments from regulated subsidiaries for dividends, tax sharing payments and other services totaled $9,400,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001.       In August 2001, Berkadia LLC, an entity jointly owned by the Company and Berkshire lent $5,600,000,000 on a senior secured basis to FINOVA Capital Corporation, the principal operating subsidiary of FINOVA, to facilitate a chapter 11 restructuring of the outstanding debt of FINOVA and its principal subsidiaries. Berkadia also received 61,020,581 newly issued shares of common stock of FINOVA (the "FNV Shares"), representing 50% of the stock of FINOVA outstanding on a fully diluted basis. Berkadia financed the Berkadia Loan with bank financing that is guaranteed, 90% by Berkshire and 10% by the Company (with the Company's guarantee being secondarily guaranteed by Berkshire), and that is also secured by Berkadia's pledge of the $5,600,000,000 five year senior secured promissory note from FINOVA Capital to Berkadia issued pursuant to the Berkadia Loan. The financing provided to Berkadia matures on the same date as the Berkadia Loan; principal payments prior to maturity are required only to the extent principal payments are received on the Berkadia Loan. In 2001, Berkadia was paid $120,000,000 in fees in connection with the Berkadia Loan, of which the Company received its $60,000,000 share in 2001. All income related to the Berkadia Loan, after payment of financing costs, will be shared 90% to Berkshire and 10% to the Company. As a result of principal payments made by FINOVA in 2001 and 2002, the balance due under the Berkadia Loan and the balance payable to Berkadia's lenders is $3,900,000,000 as of February 22, 2002. During 2001, the Company also entered into a ten-year management agreement with FINOVA, for which it will receive an $8,000,000 annual fee, the first of which was paid when the agreement was signed. Under the agreement governing Berkadia, the Company and Berkshire have agreed to equally share the management fees.       In May 2001, the Company invested $75,000,000 in a new issue of restricted convertible preference shares of WMIG, which was subsequently converted into 375,000 common shares that represent approximately 4% of WMIG. At December 31, 2001, the investment is carried at its aggregate market value of $130,500,000 in the Company's consolidated balance sheet.       In December 2001, the Company invested $127,500,000 for an approximate 25% common stock interest in Olympus. The Company cannot redeem its interest in Olympus prior to December 31, 2003. Beginning at that date, the Company has the right to request a redemption annually; however, the granting of any such request will be at the discretion of Olympus' Board of Directors based on the company's need for capital and be subject to Bermuda insurance laws and regulations. The Company will account for this investment under the equity method of accounting.       In December 2001, the Company invested $50,000,000 in a limited partnership that will invest primarily in securities and other obligations of highly leveraged, distressed and out of favor companies. The Company may redeem up to 50% of its investment annually beginning in June 2003 and up to 100% of its investment in December 2004, or otherwise in certain specified circumstances. The Company will account for this investment under the equity method of accounting.       Based on discussions with commercial and investment bankers, the Company believes that it has the ability to raise additional funds under acceptable conditions for use in its existing businesses or for                                        17   appropriate investment opportunities. Standard & Poor's and Duff & Phelps Inc. have rated the Company's senior debt obligations as investment grade since 1993, while Moody's Investors Services, Inc. rates the Company's senior debt obligations below investment grade. Ratings issued by bond rating agencies are subject to change at any time.  Consolidated Liquidity       In 2001 and 2000, net cash was used for operations, reflecting lower investment income on corporate investments as a result of the Dividend payment in 1999, payment of the Parent's interest and overhead expenses and a reduction of payables related to the trading portfolio. The Company's continuing business segments generated cash from operating activities, except for certain of the Company's real estate operations that required a net use of cash to fund operating expenses and working capital.         The Company historically provided collateralized automobile loans to individuals with poor credit histories. The Company's investment in automobile loans was $379,800,000 and $410,300,000 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Deposits generated by the Company's deposit-taking facilities and by brokers primarily fund these loans. Deposits raised in 2001 totaled $175,200,000 and had an average maturity of 12 months and a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%.       In the past, the Company has at times funded the construction and/or expansion of its manufacturing facilities with industrial revenue bonds. At December 31, 2001, the Company has $9,800,000 principal amount outstanding for such financing. The Company used $18,300,000 of its available cash resources to construct the plastics division's Belgium facility, which was completed in 2001.         During 2001, Fidei's debt declined by $83,400,000 (94,600,000 Euros) due to the maturity and early extinguishment of certain debt. The pre-tax gain on this early extinguishment was not material. As of December 31, 2001, the principal amount of Fidei's remaining Euro denominated outstanding debt, all of which is non-recourse to the Company, was $91,000,000 (103,200,000 Euros). Inasmuch as Fidei's Euro denominated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximate its Euro denominated debt, the Company does not believe there is currently a need to acquire a currency hedge for Fidei's debt.       As shown below, at December 31, 2001, the Company's contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments totaled $937,100,000 and $619,000,000, respectively. The Company's debt instruments require maintenance of minimum Tangible Net Worth, limit distributions to shareholders and limit Indebtedness, as defined in the agreements. In addition, the debt instruments contain limitations on investments, liens, contingent obligations and certain other matters. The Company is in compliance with all of these restrictions, and the Company has the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness or make substantial distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions.

The $100,000,000 commitment expiration in the      less than one year period results from actual principal payments received      under the Berkadia Loan that were used to reduce the balance due under      Berkadia's financing. To the extent that future principal payments are      received under the Berkadia Loan prior to maturity, such amounts will be      used to paydown the Berkadia financing and the remaining $390,000,000      guarantee will expire at an earlier date than reflected above.       The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have or have had tax loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations on the use of the tax loss carryforwards, the Company's certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from accumulating at least five percent of the Common Shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning at least five percent of the Common Shares from acquiring additional Common Shares.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates       The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.         The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision that is charged to expense. As of December 31, 2001, the Company's allowance for loan losses was $35,700,000 or 6.8% of the related outstanding loan receivable balance of $521,200,000. The allowance for loan losses is an amount that the Company believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in its portfolio of existing loans based on the Company's evaluations of the collectibility of loans and prior loan loss experience. Factors considered by the Company include actual experience, current economic trends, aging of the loan portfolio and collateral value. During periods of economic weakness, delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses generally increase. These periods may also be accompanied by decreased demand and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding loans, which weakens collateral coverage and increases the amount of a loss in the event of default. In addition, incentives offered by the automobile industry on new                                         19   cars affect the supply of used cars and the value the Company may realize upon sale of repossessed automobiles. The allowance is based on judgments and assumptions and the ultimate loss may differ.       The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred taxes to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. If the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment would increase income in such period. Similarly, if the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred taxes in the future, an adjustment would be charged to income in such period. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") is in the process of concluding its audit of the Company's consolidated federal income tax returns for the years 1996 through 1999. The IRS has issued Notices of Proposed Adjustments that, if sustained, would result in approximately $80,000,000 of tax, plus interest. The Company is contesting these proposed adjustments. The Company believes that it is adequately reserved for this exposure.       The Company accounts for its investment in Berkadia under the equity method of accounting. Although the Company has no cash investment in Berkadia, the Company has a contingent liability resulting from its guarantee of 10% of the third party financing provided to Berkadia. The total amount of the Company's guarantee is $390,000,000 as of February 22, 2002. While the Company does not expect that Berkadia will suffer losses resulting in the Company having to fund its guarantee obligation, actual results could differ.       As of December 31, 2001, the carrying amount of the Company's investment in the mining properties of MK Gold was approximately $51,100,000. The recoverability of this asset is entirely dependent upon the success of MK Gold's mining project at the Las Cruces copper deposit in the Pyrite Belt of Spain. Mining will be subject to obtaining required permits (currently underway), obtaining both debt and equity financing for the project, engineering and construction. Recently, the market price of copper has been depressed, reflecting generally weak global economic conditions. The amount of financing which can be obtained for the project and its related cost will be significantly affected by the assessment of potential lenders of the current and expected future market price of copper. In addition, the actual price of copper and the operating cost of the mine will affect the recoverability of this asset. Based on the current status of the project and MK Gold's estimate of future financing costs and future cash flows, the Company believes the asset is recoverable. Actual results could differ.  Banking and Lending       Finance revenues, which reflect the level and mix of consumer instalment loans, increased in each of the last two years due to greater average loans outstanding. Average loans outstanding were $545,000,000, $423,000,000 and $238,600,000 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Although finance revenues increased in 2001 as compared to 2000, pre-tax results declined primarily due to a larger provision for loan losses, changes in market values of interest rate swaps, higher interest paid on interest rate swaps, charges recorded in connection with the Company's decision to stop originating new subprime automobile loans and to consolidate all operations in Salt Lake City, and higher interest expense due to the increased customer banking deposits through September of 2001.       In 2001, the banking and lending segment's provision for loan losses increased $13,000,000 as compared to the prior year. This increase primarily reflects higher net charge-offs, for which the Company believes a weaker economy and increased bankruptcies were contributing factors, and an increase in the rates used by the Company to establish the allowance for loan losses in recognition of its increased loss experience. In an effort to reduce losses, the Company exited certain states and automobile dealer relationships with historically higher loan losses, but losses continued to increase throughout 2001. This loss experience, combined with the increasingly difficult competitive environment, resulted in the Company's decision in September 2001 to stop originating any new subprime automobile loans. The                                         20   Company will continue to service the remaining automobile portfolio as well as originate other products, although it is anticipated that new loan originations will be substantially less than originations previously generated in the subprime automobile portfolio. The Company will also seek to acquire loan portfolios that meet its credit criteria if these portfolios can be purchased on attractive terms.       Pre-tax results for the banking and lending segment for 2001 also reflect $6,500,000 of charges primarily resulting from a mark-to-market loss on its interest rate swaps. The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rate changes on its customer banking deposits. Although the Company believes that these derivative financial instruments serve as economic hedges, they do not meet certain effectiveness criteria under SFAS 133, and therefore are not accounted for as hedges.       In an effort to increase operating efficiencies, the Company has filed an application with the OCC to merge AIB and AIF. Although the Company anticipates that the merger will be approved during the first quarter of 2002, no assurance can be given that it will be approved. As a result of its decision to stop originating new subprime automobile loans and this planned merger, the Company has been consolidating all operations in Salt Lake City. Pre-tax results for the banking and lending segment include $7,100,000 of charges related to this consolidation, primarily resulting from the closing of AIB's Indianapolis office.       The increase in finance revenues in 2000 as compared to 1999 was primarily due to the 1999 acquisition of the operations of a subprime lender and increased new loan originations. Pre-tax results declined in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily due to an increase in the provision for loan losses, higher interest expense due to increased customer banking deposits and higher interest rates thereon, and higher salaries expense as a result of the 1999 acquisition. The higher loan losses were principally caused by the poor performance of the subprime automobile portfolio acquired in 1999, for which the actual collection experience was less than expected, a larger amount of loans outstanding, including the 1999 purchased portfolio, that were reaching the age of peak losses, generally twelve to eighteen months after origination, the increased loan originations and a weaker economy.  Foreign Real Estate       Fidei's revenues and pre-tax income declined in 2001 as compared to 2000 principally due to decreased rent income (due to a smaller base of remaining real estate properties) and decreased gains from sales of real estate properties. During 2001, Fidei sold 26 real estate properties, resulting in pre-tax gains of $8,200,000; 27 properties remain at December 31, 2001. The Company expects to complete the sale of Fidei's real estate holdings during 2002. Pre-tax results for 2001 also reflected lower interest expense as a result of the maturity and early extinguishment of certain debt, lower depreciation expense due to the reduction in real estate properties and lower selling, general and other expenses, which were partially offset by a charge of $4,600,000 related to value added taxes assessed for a sold property.       Fidei's revenues declined in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily due to decreased rent income from the smaller base of remaining real estate properties and decreased gains from sales of real estate properties, partially offset by increased investment income. During 2000, Fidei sold 38 real estate properties resulting in pre-tax gains of $27,100,000. Pre-tax results for 2000 also reflected lower depreciation expense due to the reduction in real estate properties and lower selling, general and other expenses.  Domestic Real Estate       The reduction in revenues and pre-tax income from domestic real estate in 2001 as compared to the prior year was principally due to the foreclosure gains recorded in 2000 and less gains from property sales, net of costs. During 2001, the Company sold 696 residential sites and a school site resulting in pre-tax gains of $18,100,000 at its largest domestic real estate investment, a master-planned community project located in San Diego County.                                        21        The increase in revenues and pre-tax income relating to domestic real estate in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily resulted from greater net gains from sales of various properties and $10,700,000 of gains recorded upon the foreclosure of certain shopping centers. During 2000, the first residential lot sales occurred at the Company's project located in San Diego County; 528 residential sites were sold resulting in pre-tax gains of $25,500,000.  Manufacturing       Manufacturing revenues, gross profit and pre-tax results for the plastics division declined in 2001 as compared to 2000. Of the $11,400,000 decline in manufacturing revenues in 2001, the most significant reductions were in the consumer products market, which declined by $7,300,000. This decline was primarily due to a customer for the Asian market no longer using one of the Company's products and a lower than anticipated demand for consumer dust wipe products. In addition, increased competition in the agriculture, home furnishing and packaging markets and customer inventory reductions in the construction and certain industrial markets also contributed to the reduction in sales in 2001. Gross profit for 2001 declined primarily due to the aforementioned reduction in sales and higher fixed costs related to the Belgium manufacturing facility. The decline in pre-tax income in 2001 was partially offset by a $3,500,000 gain resulting from a contract termination payment received from a customer. For 2000, manufacturing revenues for the plastics division modestly increased to $65,000,000 as compared to $64,000,000 for 1999. Gross profit and pre-tax income for the plastics division declined slightly in 2000 primarily due to higher raw material costs.  Other       Investment and other income declined in 2001 as compared to 2000 in part from income recognized in 2000 totaling $25,900,000, consisting of foreclosure gains from certain domestic real estate properties, a prepayment penalty related to certain promissory notes and a gain from the sale of a corporate owned aircraft. In addition, investment and other income declined in 2001 due to decreased gains from sales of real estate properties and rental income related to Fidei ($26,000,000), decreased gains from sales of various domestic real estate properties ($8,500,000) and a reduction in revenues related to MK Gold ($10,100,000). Such decreases were partially offset by a gain of $6,300,000 from the sale of the Company's investment in two inactive insurance companies and increased revenues from the Company's oil and gas operations ($6,200,000).       Investment and other income declined in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily due to gains recognized in 1999 from the sale of Caja de Ahorro y Seguro S.A. ($120,800,000), The Sperry & Hutchinson Company, Inc. ($18,700,000), its Russian joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc. ($29,500,000), and an equity interest in an associated company ($8,700,000). Investment and other income also decreased in 2000 due to a reduction in investment income ($11,500,000), resulting primarily from the payment of the Dividend and debt repurchases in 1999 and decreased rent income and gains from sales of real estate properties related to Fidei ($18,500,000). This decrease was partially offset by increased net gains from sales and foreclosures of various domestic real estate properties ($50,800,000), a prepayment penalty related to certain promissory notes ($7,500,000) and revenues relating to MK Gold ($12,300,000), which the Company began consolidating in the fourth quarter of 1999.       Net securities gains (losses) for 2000 include pre-tax security gains related to the Company's investments in Fidelity National Financial, Inc. ($90,900,000) and Jordan Telecommunication Products, Inc. ($24,800,000).       For 2001, the Company recognized $24,600,000 of losses from its equity investments in associated companies as compared to $29,300,000 of income for 2000. The loss in 2001 was primarily due to a loss                                         22   of $70,400,000, representing the Company's share of the loss recorded by Berkadia. The Company's share of Berkadia's loss consists of the following (in thousands):            Net interest spread on the Berkadia loan - 10% of total                                    $  3,900    Amortization of Berkadia Loan discount related to cash fees - 50% of total                    7,800    Amortization of Berkadia Loan discount related to FINOVA stock - 50% of total                12,300    Share of FINOVA loss under equity method - 50% of total                                     (94,400)                                                                                               --------     Equity in loss of associated companies - Berkadia                                          $(70,400)                                                                                               ========           As more fully described in Note 4 to the Company's consolidated financial statements, Berkadia's initial investment in the FNV Shares and the Berkadia Loan are determined based upon the relative fair values of the securities received in exchange for the funds transferred to FINOVA. The fair value assigned to the FNV Shares is based upon the trading price of FINOVA's common stock on the day the FNV Shares were received, was far in excess of FINOVA's net worth and is inconsistent with the Company's view that the FINOVA common stock has a very limited value. Subsequent to acquisition, and principally as a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Berkadia recorded its share of FINOVA's losses in an amount that reduced Berkadia's investment in FINOVA's common stock to zero.         At December 31, 2001, the book value of the Company's equity investment in Berkadia was negative $129,000,000. The negative carrying amount was due to Berkadia's distribution of the Berkadia Loan fees and its recognition of its share of FINOVA's losses under the equity method of accounting ($94,400,000). This loss recognized by Berkadia is a non-cash loss that will be reversed over the term of the Berkadia Loan. As a result of the application of these accounting rules, the negative carrying amount of the Company's investment in Berkadia effectively represents an unamortized discount on the Berkadia Loan, which will be amortized to income over the term of the loan.       The Company's loss related to Berkadia was partially offset by income from other equity investments, the most significant of which related to JPOF II. The Company recognized income from its investment in JPOF II of $27,100,000 and $17,300,000 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Equity in income (losses) of associated companies increased in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily due to income related to JPOF II.       The increase in interest expense for 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily reflects increased customer banking deposits and higher interest rates thereon, partially offset by a reduction in interest expense related to debt repurchases in 1999.       Salaries expense in 2001 primarily reflects decreased expenses related to lower bonus expense. Salaries expense in 2000 reflects an increase in employees, primarily at the banking and lending segment.       Selling, general and other expenses increased in 2001 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher provisions for loan losses and charges recorded in connection with consolidating the banking and lending operations, and the value added taxes assessed on Fidei, all as described above, partially offset by lower expenses related to MK Gold. The increase in selling, general and other expenses in 2000 as compared to 1999 principally reflects higher provisions for loan losses at the banking and lending segment, and expenses related to MK Gold.       Income taxes for 2001 reflect a benefit of $36,200,000 for the favorable resolution of income tax contingencies. Income taxes for 1999 reflect a benefit of $40,100,000 from the utilization of capital loss carryforwards, of which $33,300,000 was previously included in the valuation allowance. Income taxes for                                        23  1999 also reflect a benefit of $3,400,000 for the favorable resolution of certain federal income tax contingencies.   Property and Casualty Insurance--Discontinued Operation       In December 2001, upon approval by the Company's Board of Directors to commence an orderly liquidation of the Empire Group, the Company classified as discontinued operations the property and casualty insurance operations of the Empire Group. The Empire Group had historically engaged in commercial and personal lines of property and casualty insurance, principally in the New York metropolitan area. The Empire Group will only accept new business that it is obligated to accept by contract or New York insurance law; it will not engage in any other business activities except for its claims runoff operations. The voluntary liquidation is expected to be substantially complete by 2005. The Company has written down its investment in the Empire Group to its estimated net realizable value based on expected operating results and cash flows during the liquidation period, which indicate that the Company is unlikely to realize any value once the liquidation is complete. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $47,900,000 pre-tax charge as loss on disposal of discontinued operations to fully write-off its investment. While this estimated net realizable value represents management's best estimate, the amount the Company will ultimately realize could be, but is not expected to be, greater. The Company has no obligation to contribute additional capital to the Empire Group.       Excluding the loss on disposal, the Empire Group recorded pre-tax losses from operations of $63,600,000, $60,200,000 and $24,000,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Empire Group's net earned premiums were $64,100,000, $108,500,000 and $145,200,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively; these decreases resulted from the Empire Group's efforts to exit unprofitable lines of business and to terminate its relationships with unprofitable agents. The losses recorded by the Empire Group were significantly impacted by the recognition of adverse reserve development recorded during each of the last three years as described below.       During 2001, the Empire Group recorded adverse loss reserve development of $63,900,000. In addition, during 2001, the Empire Group expensed $9,100,000 of deferred policy acquisition costs, as their recoverability from premiums and related investment income was no longer anticipated.       During 2001, the Empire Group increased its reserve estimates for its commercial package policies lines of business, primarily due to increases in severity of liability claims for accident years 1998 and prior. The Empire Group has exposure for third party liability claims in many of its lines of insurance. During 2001, there were several settlements and court decisions on third party liability cases for amounts that are greater than the industry's or the Empire Group's historical experience for similar claims, which had formed the basis for the Empire Group's estimated loss reserves. While many of these decisions are being appealed, these results may signal a change in the judicial environment in the Empire Group's marketplace. Accordingly, the Empire Group has increased its loss reserve estimate by $23,000,000 due to an estimated increase in severity for these exposures.       Reserve increases in 2001 also resulted from unfavorable development principally in automobile lines of business for the 1998 through 2000 accident years, primarily relating to personal injury protection coverage ("PIP") and in its workers' compensation lines of insurance. The Empire Group believes that the increased loss estimates for PIP are consistent with recent trends in the industry, and has increased loss reserves for all automobile lines by $10,900,000 for 2001. In addition, the Empire Group also increased its reserve for loss adjustment expenses by $23,300,000 as a result of the increases to its loss reserves and an increase in future overhead costs which will be allocated to settle claims currently incurred.                                         24         During the period between 1984 and 1995, the Empire Group entered into certain retrospectively rated reinsurance contracts covering substantially all lines of business, except workers' compensation. Under these contracts, the Empire Group paid the reinsurer provisional premiums that are subject to adjustment based on subsequent loss development.  Ceded premiums accrued under these contracts reduce both net written and earned premiums during the period the retrospective reinsurance premiums are accrued. If additional unfavorable loss development emerges in future periods, the Empire Group may be required to accrue additional retrospective reinsurance premiums. As a consequence of its reserve increases, the Empire Group reduced premiums and pre-tax profits in 2001 by $8,000,000 to recognize reinsurance premiums due for 1995 and prior years under retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements.       During 2000, the Empire Group recorded adverse loss reserve development of $53,000,000, principally in the 1996 through 1999 accident years. This development was attributable to an increase in the severity of PIP claims and an increase in the frequency of liability claims in the private passenger automobile line ($9,200,000), an increase in the frequency of liability claims in the commercial automobile line ($6,200,000), an increase in the frequency and severity of PIP claims in the assigned risk automobile line ($4,800,000) and an increase in the severity of certain liability claims in the commercial package policies lines of business ($15,000,000). The increases in severity and frequency of claims in automobile lines of business, particularly with respect to PIP claims, are consistent with emerging industry trends in the New York City marketplace. In addition, the Empire Group increased its estimate for loss adjustment expenses by $11,000,000 as a result of the decision to outsource a significant amount of claim handling functions in 2000. Claim files for workers' compensation, automobile no-fault and automobile and other liability claims were outsourced at a cost greater than the reserves previously recorded to handle the claims internally. The Empire Group has also increased its reserve estimate for claims handled internally.       During 1999, the Empire Group recorded adverse loss reserve development of $18,300,000, principally due to an increase in severity of 1998 accident year losses in the assigned risk automobile and voluntary private passenger automobile lines, and 1996 accident year losses in certain classes of the commercial automobile line. As a result, the Empire Group increased its reserves by $7,500,000 for assigned risk automobile, $5,000,000 for voluntary private passenger automobile and $4,500,000 for commercial automobile lines.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards       In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141"), which is effective for all business combinations after June 30, 2001, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS 141 requires that companies use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination. SFAS 142 addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside a business combination and the recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to acquisition. SFAS 143 requires recognition of the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long-lived assets when a legal obligation to incur such costs arises as a result of the acquisition, construction, development and/or the normal operation of a long-lived asset. Upon recognition of the liability, a corresponding asset is recorded and depreciated over the remaining life of the long-lived asset. SFAS 144 requires that one accounting model be used for the long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions and resolves implementation issues. The Company has                                         25  reviewed the impact of the implementation of SFAS 142, 143 and 144, and does not expect them to have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. - -------   ----------------------------------------------------------       The following includes "forward-looking statements" that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.       The Company's market risk arises principally from interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio, its borrowing activities and the banking and lending activities of certain subsidiaries.                                         26         The Company's investment portfolio is primarily classified as available for sale, and consequently, is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in shareholders' equity. Included in the Company's investment portfolio are fixed income securities, which comprised approximately 68% of the Company's total investment portfolio at December 31, 2001. These fixed income securities are primarily rated "investment grade" or are U.S. governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations. The estimated weighted average remaining life of these fixed income securities was approximately 2.0 years at December 31, 2001. The Company's fixed income securities, like all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. The Company's investment portfolio also includes its investment in WMIG, carried at its aggregate market value of $130,500,000. This investment is approximately 16% of the Company's total investment portfolio, and its value is subject to change if the market value of the WMIG stock rises or falls. At December 31, 2000, fixed income securities comprised approximately 80% of the Company's total investment portfolio and had an estimated weighted average remaining life of 3.4 years. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company's portfolio of trading securities was not material.       The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its long-term fixed interest rate debt and the Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of its subsidiary trust holding solely subordinated debt securities of the Company. Generally, the fair market value of debt and preferred securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall, and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise.       The Company's banking and lending operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference between the amount of the interest-earning assets and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities that are prepaid/withdrawn, mature or reprice in specified periods. The principal objectives of the Company's banking and lending asset/liability management activities are to provide maximum levels of net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and to facilitate funding needs. The Company utilizes an interest rate sensitivity model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk that is present. The model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on the projected net interest margin over the ensuing twelve-month period. Derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, may be used to modify the Company's indicated net interest sensitivity to levels deemed to be appropriate based on risk management policies and the Company's current economic outlook. Counterparties to such agreements are major financial institutions, which the Company believes are able to fulfill their obligations; however, if they are not, the Company believes that any losses are unlikely to be material.       The following table provides information about the Company's financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are primarily sensitive to changes in interest rates. For investment securities and debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates. For the variable rate notes receivable and variable rate borrowings, the weighted average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. For loans, securities and liabilities with contractual maturities, the table presents contractual principal cash flows adjusted for the Company's historical experience of loan prepayments and prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. For banking and lending's variable rate products, the weighted average variable rates are based upon the respective pricing index at the reporting date. For money market deposits that have no contractual maturity, the table presents principal cash flows based on the Company's historical experience and management's judgment concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors.
