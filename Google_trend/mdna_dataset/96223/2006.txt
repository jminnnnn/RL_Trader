Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results          of Operations. - ------   ----------------------------------------------------------------------         The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the Company's consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and results of operations. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this Report.                                         29     Liquidity and Capital Resources  Parent Company Liquidity         Leucadia National Corporation (the "Parent") is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock of its direct subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents and other non-controlling investments in debt and equity securities. The Parent continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing operations and investments and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value. Accordingly, while the Parent does not have any material arrangement, commitment or understanding with respect thereto (except as disclosed in this Report), further acquisitions, divestitures, investments and changes in capital structure are possible. Its principal sources of funds are its available cash resources, liquid investments, bank borrowings, public and private capital market transactions, repayment of subsidiary advances, funds distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management and other fees, and borrowings and dividends from its subsidiaries.         As of December 31, 2005, the Parent's readily available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding amounts held by subsidiaries that are parties to agreements which restrict the payment of dividends, totaled $2,370,500,000. This amount is comprised of cash and short-term bonds and notes of the United States Government and its agencies of $1,198,700,000 (50.6%), U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises of $261,300,000 (11.0%), the equity investment in Level 3 of $330,100,000 (13.9%), and other publicly traded debt and equity securities aggregating $580,400,000 (24.5%). This amount does not include common shares the Company owns in Inmet, which are subject to resale restrictions as discussed below. Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into with Level 3, Level 3 has filed a registration statement covering the Level 3 shares and is required to keep the registration statement effective for the shorter of two years (or a longer period as set forth in the agreement), or until the distribution of the shares is completed. The Level 3 common stock is subject to a transfer restriction that limits the number of shares the Company can sell (with certain exceptions) on any given day until May 22, 2006; thereafter there is no restriction. The investment income realized from the Parent's readily available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is used to meet the Parent company's short-term recurring cash requirements, which are principally the payment of interest on its debt and corporate overhead expenses.         The Parent's only long-term cash requirement is to make principal payments on its long-term debt ($944,900,000 outstanding as of December 31, 2005), of which $21,700,000 is due in 2006, $475,000,000 is due in 2013, $350,000,000 is due in 2014 and $98,200,000 is due in 2027. Historically, the Parent has used its available liquidity to make acquisitions of new businesses and other investments, but the timing of any future investments and the cost can not be predicted. Should the Company require additional liquidity for an investment or any other purpose, the Parent also has an unsecured bank credit facility of $110,000,000 that matures in 2007 and bears interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate or the prime rate. No amounts are currently outstanding under the bank credit facility. In addition, based on discussions with commercial and investment bankers, the Company believes that it has the ability to raise additional funds under acceptable conditions for use in its existing businesses or for appropriate investment opportunities. The Parent's senior debt obligations are rated two levels below investment grade by Moody's Investors Services and Standard & Poor's, and one level below investment grade by Fitch Ratings. Ratings issued by bond rating agencies are subject to change at any time.         In December 2005, the Company sold WilTel to Level 3 for aggregate cash consideration of $460,300,000 (net of estimated working capital adjustments), and 115,000,000 newly issued shares of Level 3 common stock. In connection with the sale, the Company retained certain assets and liabilities of WilTel that were not purchased by Level 3. The retained assets include (i) WilTel's headquarters building located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, (ii) cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100,000,000, (iii) corporate aircraft and related capital lease obligations, and (iv) marketable securities. In addition, the Company retained all of WilTel's right to receive certain cash payments from SBC totaling $236,000,000, of which $37,500,000 was received prior to closing, and the balance is due to be received during 2006. Prior to the closing, WilTel repaid its long-term debt obligations using its funds, together with $220,000,000 of funds advanced by the Company. The retained liabilities also include WilTel's defined benefit pension plan and supplemental retirement plan obligation and certain other employee related liabilities. The Company has reclassified WilTel's balance sheet amounts in prior years to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations.                                         30           In the aggregate, the Company received value of $833,500,000 from the sale of WilTel, including the consideration paid by Level 3 and the net book value of the retained assets and liabilities, but reduced by the funds advanced to WilTel in 2005. In addition, the agreement with Level 3 requires that all parties make the appropriate filings to treat the purchase of WilTel as a purchase of assets for federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. As a result, WilTel's NOLs, as well as any tax losses generated by the sale, remained with the Company. For more information about the Company's NOLs and tax attributes, see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.         In June 2005, the Company's 8 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes, which had an outstanding principal amount of $19,100,000, matured. The Company repaid these notes and the related accrued interest with available cash resources.         In February 2005, the plastics manufacturing segment acquired the assets of NSW for approximately $26,600,000, including working capital adjustments. In April 2005, the Company acquired ATX upon the effectiveness of its bankruptcy plan for approximately $56,300,000, including expenses, of which $25,300,000 was spent in 2005 and the balance was spent during 2003 and 2004. In May 2005, the Company acquired Idaho Timber for total cash consideration of $133,600,000, including working capital adjustments and expenses. The plastics manufacturing segment also acquired certain assets of a competitor in October 2005 for approximately $4,300,000. Each of these acquisitions is reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. In the aggregate, the purchase price allocation for these acquisitions resulted in the recognition of amortizable intangible assets of $78,400,000 and goodwill of $14,000,000, which is not subject to amortization. For more information concerning these acquisitions, see Notes 3 and 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The funds for these acquisitions were provided from the Company's available cash resources.         In May 2005, the Company sold its 716-room Waikiki Beach hotel and related assets for an aggregate purchase price of $107,000,000 (before closing costs and other required payments). After satisfaction of mortgage indebtedness on the hotel of $22,100,000 at closing, the Company received net cash proceeds of approximately $73,000,000.         Union Square, two entities in which the Company had non-controlling equity interests, sold their respective interests in an office complex located on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. in May 2005. Including repayment of its mortgage loans at closing, the Company's share of the net proceeds was $73,200,000.         In August 2005, the Company consummated the merger with MK, its then 72.1% owned subsidiary, whereby the Company acquired the remaining outstanding MK common shares. The acquisition cost consisted of approximately 216,000 of the Company's common shares (valued at $8,300,000), and estimated cash amounts ($4,500,000 has been accrued) that will be paid to former MK stockholders who perfected appraisal rights.         Immediately following the merger, the Company sold to Inmet, a Canadian-based global mining company, a 70% interest in CLC, a Spanish company that holds the exploration and mineral rights to the Las Cruces copper deposit in the Pyrite Belt of Spain. Inmet acquired the interest in CLC in exchange for 5,600,000 newly issued Inmet common shares, representing approximately 11.7% of the outstanding Inmet common shares immediately following completion of the transaction.         CLC has entered into an agreement with third party lenders for project financing consisting of a ten year senior secured credit facility of up to $240,000,000 and a senior secured bridge credit facility of up to (euro)69,000,000 to finance subsidies and value-added tax. The Company and Inmet have guaranteed 30% and 70%, respectively, of the obligations outstanding under both facilities until completion of the project as defined under the project financing. At December 31, 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the facilities. The Company and Inmet have also committed to provide financing to CLC which is estimated to be $159,000,000, of which the Company's share will be 30% ($14,300,000 of which has been loaned as of December 31, 2005).         The Inmet shares have the benefit of a registration rights agreement; however, the shares may not be sold until the earlier of August 2009 or the date on which the Company is no longer obligated under the guarantee of CLC's credit facilities. At acquisition, the fair value of the Inmet common stock ($78,000,000) was determined to be approximately 90% of the then current trading price as a result of these transferability restrictions. The Inmet shares will be carried at the initially recorded value (unless there is an other than temporary impairment) until one year prior to the termination of the transfer restrictions. At December 31, 2005, the market value of the Inmet shares is approximately $142,100,000.                                         31          In the fourth quarter of 2005, Square 711, a 90% owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an agreement to sell its interest in 8 acres of unimproved land in Washington, D.C. for aggregate cash consideration of $121,900,000; the sale closed in February 2006. The land was acquired by the Company in September 2003 for cash consideration of $53,800,000. After satisfaction of mortgage indebtedness on the property of $32,000,000 and other closing payments, the Company received net cash proceeds of approximately $75,700,000, and expects to record a pre-tax gain of approximately $48,900,000.         The amount and availability of the Company's NOLs and other tax attributes are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations on the use of the NOLs, the Company's certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from acquiring ownership (including through attribution under the tax law) of five percent or more of the common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning five percent or more of the common shares from acquiring additional common shares. The restrictions will remain in effect until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2024, (b) the repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any comparable successor provision) or (c) the beginning of a taxable year of the Company to which certain tax benefits may no longer be carried forward.         As of February 23, 2006, the Company is authorized to repurchase 3,729,477 common shares. Such purchases may be made from time to time in the open market, through block trades or otherwise. Depending on market conditions and other factors, such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Except in connection with employees using common shares to pay the exercise price of employee stock options, the Company has not repurchased any common shares during the three year period ended December 31, 2005.  Consolidated Liquidity         In 2005, net cash was provided by operating activities as a result of the collection of a receivable related to a former partnership interest, distributions from associated companies and a decrease in the Company's investment in the trading portfolio. In 2004, net cash was provided by operating activities, principally as a result of distributions from associated companies, the pre-funding by SBC of certain of WilTel's capital expenditures, the refund of excess federal income tax payments and an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments. In 2003, net cash was used for operating activities, principally due to corporate overhead expenses, reduced investment income, an increase in the investment in the trading portfolio and a $10,000,000 contribution to the Company's defined benefit pension plan.         Symphony has a $50,000,000 revolving credit facility, of which $27,100,000 and $37,700,000 was outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This financing, which is secured by all of Symphony's assets (with an aggregate book value of $55,500,000) but otherwise is non-recourse to the Company, matures in 2006 and bears interest based on LIBOR plus 3%. At December 31, 2005, the interest rate on this facility was 7.39%.         Debt due within one year includes $92,100,000 and $21,000,000 as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively, relating to repurchase agreements of one of the Company's subsidiaries. These fixed rate repurchase agreements have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.95%, mature at various dates through April 2006 and are secured by investments with a carrying value of $95,100,000.         During 2001, a subsidiary of the Company borrowed $53,100,000 secured by certain of its corporate aircraft, of which $43,400,000 is currently outstanding. Capital leases of another subsidiary aggregating $9,900,000 consist of a sale-leaseback transaction related to other corporate aircraft. The Parent company has guaranteed these financings.         The Company's debt instruments require maintenance of minimum Tangible Net Worth, limit distributions to shareholders and limit Indebtedness and Funded Debt (as such terms are defined in the agreements). In addition, the debt instruments contain limitations on investments, liens, contingent obligations and certain other matters. The Company is in compliance with all of these restrictions, and the Company has the ability to incur additional indebtedness or make distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions. Certain of the debt instruments of subsidiaries of the Company also contain restrictions which require the maintenance of financial covenants, impose restrictions on the ability of such subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Company and/or provide collateral to the lender. Principally as a result of such restrictions, the assets of subsidiaries which are subject to limitations on transfer of funds to the Company were approximately $289,700,000 at December 31, 2005. For more information, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.                                         32          As shown below, at December 31, 2005, the Company's contractual cash obligations totaled $1,836,612,000.

Estimated payments related to a currency swap agreement are based on the currency rate in effect at December 31, 2005. Except for expected funding of $29,100,000 in 2006, the Company's consolidated pension liability is excluded from the table because the timing of cash payments is uncertain.         At December 31, 2005, the Company had recorded a liability of $102,800,000 on its consolidated balance sheet for its unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligations. This amount represents the difference between the present value of amounts owed to current and former employees (referred to as the projected benefit obligation), and the market value of plan assets set aside in segregated trust accounts. Since the benefits in these plans have been frozen, future changes to the benefit obligation are expected to principally result from benefit payments, differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience and interest costs.         In recent years, the Company's determination to make contributions to the pension trust accounts in excess of minimum required amounts was influenced by the tax deductibility of the contribution, a consideration that is no longer important because of the Company's NOLs. The Company is currently analyzing the administrative and insurance costs associated with these plans and will make substantial contributions to the segregated trust accounts to reduce its plan liabilities. The timing and amount of additional contributions are uncertain; however, the Company believes it will make substantial additional contributions over the next few years to reduce, but not to entirely eliminate, its defined pension benefit plan liability.         The Company maintained defined benefit pension plans covering certain operating units prior to 1999, and WilTel also maintained defined pension benefit plans that were not transferred in connection with the sale of WilTel. As of December 31, 2005, certain amounts for these plans are reflected separately in the table below (dollars in thousands):                                         33                                                                                The Company's         WilTel's                                                                             Plans              Plans                                                                             -----              -----       Projected benefit obligation                                               $58,123           $186,054 Funded status - balance sheet liability at December 31, 2005                14,647             88,149 Deferred losses included in other comprehensive income                      21,828             40,739 Discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation             4.87%              5.40%             Calculations of pension expense and projected benefit obligations are prepared by actuaries based on assumptions provided by management. These assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis, including assumptions about discount rates, interest credit rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. For the Company's plans, a discount rate was selected to result in an estimated projected benefit obligation on a plan termination basis, using current rates for annuity settlements and lump sum payments weighted for the assumed elections of participants. For the WilTel plans, the timing of expected future benefit payments was used in conjunction with the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve to develop a discount rate that is representative of the high quality corporate bond market, adjusted for current rates which might be available for annuity settlements.         These discount rates will be used to determine pension expense in 2006. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.25% change in these discount rates would affect pension expense by $2,000,000 and the benefit obligation by $10,000,000.           The deferred losses in other comprehensive income primarily result from changes in actuarial assumptions, including changes in discount rates, changes in interest credit rates and differences between the actual and assumed return on plan assets. Deferred losses are amortized to expense if they exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year; such amount aggregated $36,700,000 at December 31, 2005 for all plans. A portion of these excess deferred losses will be amortized to expense during 2006, based on an amortization period of twelve years.         The assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets are based on the investment objectives of the specific plan, which are more fully discussed in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Differences between the actual and expected rates of return on plan assets have not been material.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements         At December 31, 2005, the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees and letters of credit aggregating $85,100,000. Pursuant to an agreement that was entered into before the Company sold CDS Holding Corporation ("CDS") to HomeFed in 2002, the Company agreed to provide project improvement bonds for the San Elijo Hills project. These bonds, which are for the benefit of the City of San Marcos, California and other government agencies, are required prior to the commencement of any development at the project. CDS is responsible for paying all third party fees related to obtaining the bonds. Should the City or others draw on the bonds for any reason, CDS and one of its subsidiaries would be obligated to reimburse the Company for the amount drawn. At December 31, 2005, the amount of outstanding bonds was $29,500,000, $800,000 of which expires in 2006, $27,300,000 in 2007 and the remainder in 2009. Subsidiaries of the Company have outstanding letters of credit aggregating $23,600,000 at December 31, 2005, principally to secure various obligations. Substantially all of these letters of credit expire before 2009. The Company's remaining guarantee at December 31, 2005 is a $32,000,000 indemnification given to a lender to a certain real estate property. The property was sold in early 2006 and the Company was released from its indemnification obligation.         As discussed above, the Company has also guaranteed certain amounts under CLC's credit facilities; however, no amounts were borrowed by CLC at December 31, 2005.                                        34   Critical Accounting Estimates         The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions. The following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements, and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect, at a specific point in time, events whose ultimate outcome won't be known until a later date. Actual results could differ from these estimates.         Income Taxes - The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. If the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment would increase income in such period. Similarly, if the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment would be charged to income in such period. The determination of the amount of the valuation allowance required is based, in significant part, upon the Company's projection of future taxable income at any point in time. The Company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities based on the Company's assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining its tax filing positions.         During 2005, as a result of the consummation of certain transactions and ongoing operating profits, the Company prepared updated projections of future taxable income. The Company's revised projections of future taxable income enabled it to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the Company's net deferred tax asset; accordingly, $1,135,100,000 of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense.         The Company's conclusion that a portion of the deferred tax asset was more likely than not to be realizable was strongly influenced by its historical ability to generate significant amounts of taxable income. The Company's estimate of future taxable income considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, about its current operations and investments, included an aggregation of individual projections for each material operation and investment, and included all future years that the Company estimated it would have available NOLs. Over the projection period, the Company assumed that its readily available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would provide returns generally equivalent to the returns expected to be provided by the Company's existing operations and investments, except for certain amounts assumed to be invested on a short-term basis to meet the Company's liquidity needs. The Company believes that its estimate of future taxable income is reasonable but inherently uncertain, and if its current or future operations and investments generate taxable income greater than the projected amounts, further adjustments to reduce the valuation allowance are possible. Conversely, if the Company realizes unforeseen material losses in the future, or its ability to generate future taxable income necessary to realize a portion of the deferred tax asset is materially reduced, additions to the valuation allowance could be recorded. At December 31, 2005, the balance of the deferred valuation allowance was $804,800,000.         The Company is required to record the adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance under GAAP. While the adjustment significantly increases the Company's net worth, there is no current cash benefit to the Company. The adjustment will also result in the recording of material federal income tax expense in the future, even though no material cash expenditure for federal income taxes is expected. Further, while the adjustment results from the projection of taxable income over a long period of time, under GAAP the expected future tax savings are not discounted. As a result, this adjustment increases the Company's net worth attributable to tax savings before the Company has generated the taxable income necessary to realize those tax savings; when the tax savings are actually realized over time, net worth will be reduced by the recording of a deferred tax provision. Reflecting tax savings before the tax is actually saved results in the Company's balance sheet being less conservative than the Company would want it to be. However, this accounting policy is mandated by GAAP.                                         35          Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"), the Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. When testing for impairment, the Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group). The determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on management's estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value. If the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.         As discussed above, WilTel's former headquarters building, including the adjacent parking garage, was not included in the sale to Level 3 and has been retained by the Company. The Company concluded that the change in the manner in which the asset was being used, from a headquarters facility of an operating subsidiary to a property held for investment, was a change in circumstances which indicated that the carrying amount of the facility might not be recoverable. On the closing date of the sale to Level 3, the carrying amount of the facility was $96,500,000; based on the assumptions discussed below the Company concluded that the carrying amount was not recoverable, and an impairment loss of $42,400,000 was recorded reducing the gain on disposal of discontinued operations. At December 31, 2005, the new cost basis and carrying amount of the facility is $54,100,000.         The facility is a fifteen story, 740,000 square foot office building located in downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma for which construction was substantially completed in 2001, with a total of approximately 640,000 rentable square feet. Approximately 260,000 square feet of the rentable space is leased to Level 3 under short-term leases that expire at the end of 2007, subject to Level 3 renewal options. Level 3 also has the right to vacate approximately 44,000 square feet every six months commencing July 1, 2006. Approximately 23,500 square feet are leased to another tenant also under a short-term lease that is subject to renewal options. The building is considered to be Class A office space, and the Company believes that the best value for the building would be obtained by selling the building to an owner/occupant. The facility is being marketed for sale at a gross selling price of $80,000,000, including furniture, fixtures and equipment.         The Company utilized a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of the facility. In order to estimate the amount which could ultimately be realized upon the sale of the facility, the Company had a market analysis prepared of sales and leasing activity for the downtown Tulsa market. The analysis identified the range of historical selling prices for properties of comparable quality, including the age, size and occupancy rates of the properties sold, properties currently available for sale or lease, current market occupancy rates and recent leasing rates. Since the facility is being marketed to an owner/occupant, the cash flow estimates reflect that it may take from two to five years before a buyer is identified and the facility can be sold. The cash flow estimates assume that Level 3 will only fulfill its minimum rental commitment; the Company did not assume that space which is currently vacant will be leased, which results in negative operating cash flow prior to sale. The Company's cash flow estimates reflect a range of possible outcomes since the timing of the sale and the ultimate price that the Company will realize for the facility is uncertain.         The Company does not believe that there is any set of reasonable assumptions it could have made resulting in a conclusion that the facility was not impaired. However, since the amount of the impairment recorded is greatly impacted by the estimated range of selling prices and the timing of the sale, the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate disposition of the facility is uncertain. If the market for this type of property declines in the future or the Company lowers its estimate of the future cash flows for other reasons, further reductions to the carrying amount of the facility could be required.         Impairment of Securities - Investments with an impairment in value considered to be other than temporary are written down to estimated fair value. The writedowns are included in net securities gains in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis.         The Company's determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information; GAAP requires the exercise of judgment in making this assessment, rather than the application of fixed mathematical criteria. The Company considers a number of factors including, but not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, the reason for the decline in fair value, changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date, and other factors specific to the individual investment. The Company's assessment involves a high degree of judgment and accordingly, actual results may differ materially from the Company's estimates and judgments. The Company recorded impairment charges for securities of $12,200,000, $4,600,000 and $6,500,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.                                         36          Business Combinations - At acquisition, the Company allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their relative fair values. Significant judgments and estimates are often made to determine these allocated values, and may include the use of independent appraisals, consider market quotes for similar transactions, employ discounted cash flow techniques or consider other information the Company believes relevant. The finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete, and if final values are materially different from initially recorded amounts adjustments are recorded. Any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill which is not amortized to expense. Recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis, and between annual testing dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value.           Subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation, any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Once final, the Company is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price, even if subsequent events or circumstances prove the Company's original judgments and estimates to be incorrect. In addition, long-lived assets like property and equipment, amortizable intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss; however, under GAAP the methods, assumptions and results of an impairment review are not the same for all long-lived assets. The assumptions and judgments made by the Company when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future.         Purchase price allocations for all of the Company's recent acquisitions have been finalized. Adjustments to the initial purchase price allocations were not material.         Accruals for Access Costs - ATX's access costs primarily include variable charges paid to vendors to originate and/or terminate switched voice traffic, which are based on actual usage at negotiated or regulated contract rates. At the end of each reporting period, ATX's estimated accrual for incurred but not yet billed costs is based on internal usage reports. The accrual is subsequently reconciled to actual invoices as they are received, which is a process that can take several months to complete. This process includes an invoice validation procedure that normally identifies errors and inaccuracies in rate and/or volume components of the invoices resulting in numerous invoice disputes. It is ATX's policy to adjust the accrual for the probable amount it believes will ultimately be paid on disputed invoices, a determination which requires significant estimation and judgment. Due to the number of different negotiated and regulated rates, constantly changing traffic patterns, uncertainty in the ultimate resolution of disputes, the period of time required to complete the reconciliation and delays in invoicing by access vendors, these estimates may change.         Contingencies - The Company accrues for contingent losses when the contingent loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred and of contingent loss amounts normally require significant judgment by management, can be highly subjective and are subject to material change with the passage of time as more information becomes available. As of December 31, 2005, the Company's accrual for contingent losses was not material.  Results of Operations  Manufacturing - Idaho Timber         Revenues and other income for Idaho Timber from the date of acquisition (May 2005) through December 31, 2005 were $239,000,000; gross profit was $22,000,000, salaries and incentive compensation expenses were $6,300,000, depreciation and amortization expenses were $4,200,000, and pre-tax income was $8,200,000. Idaho Timber's revenues reflect an oversupply in its dimension lumber and home center board markets, resulting partially from increased foreign imports and an easing of transportation bottlenecks that existed in the past. The increased supply to the U.S. market has resulted in lower selling prices; however, Idaho Timber's shipment volume of 500 million board feet remained level with the comparable pre-acquisition period in the prior year. The steady demand was due in part to continued strong housing and home improvement markets during 2005.                                         37           Selling prices declined during 2005; however, reductions in raw material costs, the largest component of cost of sales (approximately 85% of cost of sales), generally lagged behind the reduction in selling prices. The difference between Idaho Timber's selling price and raw material cost per thousand board feet (spread) is closely monitored, and the rate of change in pricing and cost is typically not the same. During 2005, spread compressed from the very high level achieved in the prior year, negatively impacting gross profits and pre-tax results. With the current oversupply in the market, Idaho Timber intends to focus on developing new higher margin products, diversifying its supply chain, improving cost control and solidifying customer relationships, in an effort to maximize gross margins and pre-tax results.  Manufacturing - Plastics         Pre-tax income for the plastics manufacturing segment was $14,200,000, $7,900,000 and $4,400,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Its revenues were $93,300,000, $64,100,000 and $53,300,000, and gross profits were $28,900,000, $19,000,000 and $14,300,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revenues increased by 46% in 2005, 20% in 2004 and 5% in 2003, each as compared to the prior year.         The increase in revenues in 2005 reflects NSW's revenues since acquisition of $17,500,000, and increases in most of the segment's markets. Sales increases result from a variety of factors including the strong housing market, new products developed late in 2004, and the impact of price increases implemented during the second half of 2004 and in the first and fourth quarters of 2005.           Raw material costs increased by approximately 19% in 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004; however, the segment was able to increase selling prices in most markets, which along with increased sales and production volumes resulted in greater gross margins than in 2004. The primary raw material in the division's products is a polypropylene resin, which is a byproduct of the oil refining process, whose price tends to increase and decrease with the price of oil. There is relatively little direct labor or other raw material costs in the division's products. In addition to managing resin purchases, the division also has initiatives to reduce and/or reuse scrap thereby increasing raw material utilization. Gross margins also reflect $1,300,000 of greater amortization expense on intangible assets resulting from acquisitions.         Pre-tax results for 2005 include higher salaries, incentive compensation expense and sales commissions primarily related to NSW. During 2005, the division realized cost efficiencies resulting from its acquisition of NSW, principally in administration and overhead expense and raw material purchasing. In the future, the division will look to make other strategic acquisitions of smaller entities that serve the same markets as NSW, primarily those that supply package netting and filtration products. Pre-tax results for 2005 also reflect a charge of $200,000 resulting from the sale of certain assets related to a former product line of NSW.         Manufacturing revenues in 2004 increased in substantially all of the division's markets. The Company believes that these increases result from a variety of factors including an improved economy, new product development and the acquisition in the first quarter of 2004 of customer receivables and inventory of a competitor that was exiting certain markets. Although raw material costs increased significantly in 2004, this was more than offset by increased selling prices, sales and production volumes in most markets, resulting in increased gross profit and gross profit margins as compared to 2003. Pre-tax results for 2004 also reflect greater salaries expense, due to higher bonuses attributable to the division's improved performance, and include a gain of $300,000 resulting from the sale of certain assets related to a former product line.  Healthcare Services         Pre-tax income (loss) of the healthcare services segment was $3,300,000 and $5,100,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $(2,300,000) for the four month period from acquisition through December 31, 2003. For the 2005, 2004 and 2003 periods, healthcare services revenues were $239,000,000, $257,300,000 and $71,000,000, respectively, and cost of sales, which primarily consist of salaries and employee benefits, were $203,100,000, $216,300,000 and $61,300,000, respectively. For the 2005, 2004 and 2003 periods, pre-tax results reflect aggregate interest, depreciation and amortization expenses of $4,000,000, $2,800,000 and $700,000, respectively.                                         38          As described above, regulatory changes that went into effect on January 1, 2006 concerning Medicare reimbursement for therapy services are likely to have some negative impact on Symphony's future revenues and profitability, particularly in 2006. The Medicare Part A prospective payment system was changed to add new categories of services which effectively shifted the allocation of reimbursable services away from the services that Symphony provides. To the extent that Symphony's customer contracts are linked to these categories of services, revenues and gross margins will decline unless Symphony is successful in renegotiating its customer contracts to address this regulatory change. Although Symphony has successfully renegotiated many of its contracts with respect to this matter, Part A revenues for certain customers could decline. With respect to Medicare Part B therapy services, most of these services became subject to an annual limitation per beneficiary of $1,740 for physical therapy and speech-language pathology and $1,740 for occupational therapy services, subject to an exception process developed by CMS for services deemed medically appropriate. The CMS exception process is retroactive to January 1, 2006, and is to be fully implemented no later than March 13, 2006. Under the guidance CMS published, the majority of Symphony's patients will qualify for an automatic exception to the therapy cap limits. Those who do not qualify for the automatic exception are still eligible to obtain a manual exception, subject to CMS approval. While the exception process was under development, it created uncertainty among Symphony's staff and customers which limited Symphony's services to Part B patients. Symphony is currently training operating and clinical staff on the new exception process, so that services can be provided when medically necessary, and expects that once training is complete revenues for Medicare Part B therapy services will increase. However, Symphony does not expect that revenues for Part B Medicare therapy services will increase to the level that they would have been absent implementation of the caps.          Beginning in 2004, Symphony performed an evaluation of its customer base to identify those customers and markets where Symphony could deliver the highest level of service and that should be the focus of customer retention efforts, as well as identifying those customers that should be terminated. Symphony is also seeking to grow its profitable businesses, which includes expanding its service offerings to existing customers. The ability of Symphony to grow its business depends heavily upon its ability to attract, develop and retain qualified therapists. There is a current shortage of qualified therapists industry-wide, and Symphony has open positions to provide service to new customers, provide additional service offerings for existing customers and as a result of normal employee turnover. The tight labor market causes Symphony and others in its industry to, at times, hire independent contractors to perform required services, which may increase costs and reduce margins, and can also result in lost revenue opportunities if skilled independent contractors are not available at an acceptable cost.         The decrease in healthcare revenues in 2005 as compared to 2004 principally resulted from Symphony's termination of certain underperforming customers, customer attrition and the sale of Symphony's respiratory line of business in the second quarter of 2005. During the 2005, 2004 and 2003 periods, one customer accounted for approximately 14%, 16% and 14%, respectively, of Symphony's revenues.         Gross margins declined in 2005 as compared to 2004, which reflects the revenue changes discussed above, higher hourly wages and benefits paid to attract and retain therapists and greater amounts incurred for independent contractors, both due to a shortage of licensed therapists in the marketplace, partially offset by improved therapist efficiency and reduced field management costs. Pre-tax results for 2005 also reflect higher borrowing costs, greater professional fees for certain outsourced services and expenditures for hiring, training and automation, which Symphony hopes will help offset the increase in the costs of therapists, and higher depreciation expense. Pre-tax results also reflect aggregate gains of $800,000 from the sale of certain property and the respiratory line of business.         Excluding charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense, profits for the fourth quarter of 2005 were approximately $1,900,000 despite a 16% decline in revenues from the comparable period in the prior year and industry-wide labor cost increases. Symphony is beginning to realize the benefits of its efforts to invest in automation to improve efficiency and reduce expenses, and to enhance its service offerings and terminate unprofitable contracts.         Symphony's margins for 2004 reflect higher hourly wages and benefits paid to attract and retain its therapists, and increased costs to hire independent contractors as a result of hiring needs for both full-time and part-time professionals. Pre-tax results for 2004 also reflect approximately $3,300,000 from the collection of receivables in excess of their carrying amounts, a decrease in estimated liabilities for employee health insurance costs and other third party claims of approximately $1,700,000, and a gain of $1,000,000 from the sale of certain property. In addition, pre-tax results for 2004 reflect approximately $3,900,000 of costs, principally severance for Symphony's former chief executive officer and others due to reorganizing and consolidating certain field operations and closing offices.                                         39     Telecommunications - ATX         ATX has been consolidated by the Company since April 22, 2005, the effective date of its bankruptcy plan. From acquisition through December 31, 2005, ATX telecommunications revenues and other income were $111,400,000, telecommunications cost of sales were $69,600,000, salaries and incentive compensation expense was $17,700,000, depreciation and amortization expenses were $7,500,000, selling, general and other expenses were $18,400,000 and ATX had a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $1,900,000. ATX's cost of sales in 2005 reflects the migration of portions of its network to lower cost providers, the favorable resolution of an access cost dispute and a favorable rate change for unbundled local circuits; however, these cost reductions were offset by UNE-P and Entrance Facility rate increases from Verizon. ATX had a pre-tax loss from discontinued operations of $200,000 in 2005.         As discussed above, ATX's ability to provide quality services at competitive prices to its customers is significantly dependent upon its ability to use or purchase various components of an ILEC's network and infrastructure. However, ATX does own certain equipment and facilities that help mitigate its reliance upon ILECs and reduce its costs. The enactment of the Telecom Act enabled ATX to purchase ILEC services at favorable rates; however, certain subsequent regulatory action has resulted in more flexibility for the ILEC in determining what products and services it provides and the rates it can charge. In certain instances, regulatory action is shifting the determination of these rates from regulatory jurisdiction towards commercial negotiation between the parties, generally resulting in ILEC price increases. For some stand-alone product lines, in particular local telephone services, ATX does not expect it will be able to offer a competitive product because its charges from the ILEC have risen, resulting in a price increase for ATX's customers. ATX has been and continues to restructure its operations to meet the changing competitive and regulatory environment and increased cost of services; however, ATX's future profitability is uncertain.  Domestic Real Estate         Pre-tax income for the domestic real estate segment was $4,100,000, $20,700,000 and $18,100,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Pre-tax results for the domestic real estate segment are largely dependent upon the performance of the segment's operating properties, the current status of the Company's real estate development projects and non-recurring gains or losses recognized when real estate assets are sold. As a result, the results of operations for this segment in the aggregate for any particular year are not predictable and do not follow any consistent pattern.         In 2005, the Company sold its 716-room Waikiki Beach hotel and related assets for an aggregate purchase price of $107,000,000, before closing costs and other required payments. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $56,600,000, which is reflected in gain on disposal of discontinued operations. Historical operating results for the hotel have not been material.         In 2004, the Company sold 92 lots of its 95-lot development project in South Walton County, Florida for aggregate sales proceeds of approximately $50,000,000, recognized pre-tax profits of $15,800,000 and deferred recognition of pre-tax profits of $10,200,000. During 2005, the Company recognized $7,000,000 of the deferred profit related to this project, upon completion of certain required improvements to the property.         Revenues and pre-tax results for this segment increased in 2004 as compared to 2003, primarily due to the South Walton County project sale discussed above. In addition, revenues during 2004 reflect the sale of certain unimproved land for cash proceeds of $8,800,000, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $7,600,000. Revenues during 2004 also reflect decreased gains from property sales at the Company's other residential and commercial project in the Florida panhandle as the lots had largely been sold, and less amortization of deferred gains from sales of real estate in prior years. Pre-tax results for 2004 also reflect due diligence expenses for a real estate development project that the Company decided not to develop.         During 2003, the Company recognized $11,100,000 of deferred gains from sales of real estate in prior years.                                          40    Banking and Lending         As stated previously, the Company's banking and lending operations have been in run-off, and during 2005 the Company's banking and lending subsidiary filed a formal plan with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to liquidate its operations, sold its remaining customer deposits and surrendered its national bank charter. As a result, revenues and expenses included in the Company's 2005 consolidated statements of operations are not material and are not discussed below. Pre-tax results for banking and lending of $1,400,000, $22,000,000 and $8,400,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, have been classified with other operations.         During 2004, the Company sold its subprime automobile and collateralized consumer loan portfolios representing approximately 97% of its total outstanding loans (net of unearned finance charges) and certain loan portfolios that had been substantially written-off for aggregate pre-tax gains of $16,300,000, which is reflected in investment and other income. Finance revenues of $10,000,000 in 2004 and $55,100,000 in 2003 reflect this decreasing level of consumer instalment loans. Although finance revenues decreased in 2004 as compared to 2003, pre-tax results increased due to gains from the loan portfolios sales, a decline in the provision for loan losses of $24,700,000, reductions in interest expense of $6,000,000 principally resulting from reduced customer banking deposits, less interest paid on interest rate swaps and lower salaries expense and operating costs resulting from the segment's restructuring efforts. All of these changes reflected the ongoing reduction in the amount of loan assets under management, including as a result of the loan portfolios sales.         Pre-tax results for the banking and lending segment include income of $3,100,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, resulting from mark-to-market changes on interest rate swaps. The Company had used interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rate changes on its customer banking deposits; all of the interest rate swap agreements matured in 2003.  Corporate and Other Operations         Investment and other income increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to the $10,500,000 gain on the sale of 70% of the Company's interest in CLC to Inmet, greater investment income of $24,200,000 reflecting a larger amount of invested assets and higher interest rates, and increased sales at the wineries of $5,000,000. Available corporate cash is generally invested on a short-term basis until such time as investment opportunities require an expenditure of funds.         Investment and other income increased in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the pre-tax gain of $11,300,000 from the sale of two of the Company's older corporate aircraft, greater dividend and interest income of $12,400,000 and miscellaneous other income. Investment and other income for 2003 included $5,300,000 of income related to a refund of foreign taxes not based on income.         Net securities gains for Corporate and Other Operations aggregated $208,800,000, $136,100,000 and $10,600,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2005 and 2004, the Company's net securities gains largely reflect realized gains from the sale of publicly traded debt and equity securities that had been classified as Corporate available for sale securities. Included in net securities gains for the 2005 periods is a gain of $146,000,000 from the sale of 375,000 shares of WMIG common stock. Net securities gains for 2005, 2004 and 2003 include provisions of $12,200,000, $4,600,000 and $6,500,000, respectively, to write down the Company's investments in certain available for sale securities and an investment in a non-public security in 2003. The write down of the securities resulted from a decline in market value determined to be other than temporary.         The Company's decision to sell securities and realize security gains or losses is generally based on its evaluation of an individual security's value at the time and the prospect for changes in its value in the future. The decision could also be influenced by the status of the Company's tax attributes or liquidity needs; however, sales in recent years have not been influenced by these considerations. Therefore, the timing of realized security gains or losses is not predictable and does not follow any pattern from year to year.                                         41          The increase in interest expense during 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily reflects interest expense relating to $100,000,000 principal amount of 7% Senior Notes and $350,000,000 principal amount of 3 3/4% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes issued in April 2004. The increase in interest expense during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily reflects the issuance of the bonds in 2004, interest expense relating to $275,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7% Senior Notes issued during 2003, and dividends accrued on its trust issued preferred securities, which commencing July 1, 2003 are classified as interest expense (shown as minority interest in prior periods).         Salaries and incentive compensation expense increased by $31,300,000 in 2005 as compared to 2004, and by $2,400,000 in 2004 as compared to 2003, principally due to increased bonus expense.         Selling, general and other expenses increased by $14,600,000 in 2005 as compared to 2004, primarily due to higher minority interest expense relating to MK prior to its merger of $4,200,000, greater foreign exchange losses of $2,700,000, higher professional fees of $4,400,000 that principally relate to due diligence expenses for potential investments and investment management fees, an impairment loss for the remaining book value of the investment in Olympus of $3,700,000, greater employee benefit expenses and operating expenses of a subsidiary engaged in the development of a new medical product.         Selling, general and other expenses increased by $19,700,000 in 2004 as compared to 2003, primarily due to greater professional and other fees of $8,500,000, which largely relate to due diligence expenses for potential investments, greater professional fees for existing investments and fees relating to the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and $3,600,000 of expenses related to the proposed public offering of MK's equity that did not go forward due to unfavorable market conditions. In addition, the increase reflects greater employee benefit expenses, higher insurance costs and greater amortization of debt issuance costs related to the 7% Senior Notes and 3 3/4% Convertible Notes.         As more fully discussed above, during 2005 the Company's revised projections of future taxable income enabled it to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the Company's net deferred tax asset; accordingly, $1,135,100,000 of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense.         The income tax provision reflects the reversal of tax reserves aggregating $27,300,000 and $24,400,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, as a result of the favorable resolution of various state and federal income tax contingencies. In addition, in 2004 the tax provision reflects a benefit to record a federal income tax carryback refund of $3,900,000.         In 2003, the Company established a valuation allowance that fully reserved for all of WilTel's net deferred tax assets, reduced by an amount equal to the Company's current and deferred federal income tax liabilities as of the date of acquisition. The valuation allowance was required because, on a pro forma combined basis, the Company was not able to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that it would be able to realize the deferred tax asset. Subsequent to the acquisition of WilTel, during 2004 and 2003 any benefit realized from WilTel's deferred tax asset reduced the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset; however, that reduction was first applied to reduce the carrying amount of the acquired non-current intangible assets of WilTel rather than to reduce the income tax provision of any component of total comprehensive income.         As a result, the various components of comprehensive income include an aggregate federal income tax provision of $22,300,000 in 2004 and $22,500,000 in 2003 (for the period subsequent to the acquisition of WilTel), even though no federal income tax for those periods was due. During 2004, the effect of recording this tax provision and the resulting reduction to the valuation allowance was to reduce the carrying amount of the acquired non-current intangible assets to zero. Income tax expense for 2003 also includes the Company's actual income tax expense for the period prior to the acquisition of WilTel.                                         42   Associated Companies         Equity in income (losses) of associated companies includes the following for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (in thousands):                                                          2005                    2004                   2003                                                     ----                    ----                   ----         Olympus                                         $ (120,100)             $    9,700              $   40,400 EagleRock                                          (28,900)                 29,400                  49,900 HomeFed                                              5,800                  10,000                  16,200 JPOF II                                             23,600                  16,200                  14,800 Union Square                                        72,800                   1,300                     100 Pershing Square, L.P.                                 --                    21,300                     -- Berkadia                                              --                       800                  79,200 WilTel                                                --                       --                  (52,100) Other                                                2,400                   2,800                  (1,500)                                                 ----------              ----------              ----------     Equity in income (losses) before        income taxes                                (44,400)                 91,500                 147,000 Income tax expense                                    (700)                (15,000)                (70,100)                                                 ----------              ----------              ----------     Equity in income (losses), net of taxes     $  (45,100)             $   76,500              $   76,900                                                 ==========              ==========              ==========          The Company's equity in losses from Olympus for 2005 reflects its share of Olympus' estimated losses from hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Effective January 1, 2006, Olympus received new capital which reduced the Company's equity interest to less than 4%. As a result, the Company will not apply the equity method of accounting for this investment in the future. At December 31, 2005, the book value of the Company's investment in Olympus had been written down to zero.         As described above, the Company owns approximately 30% of HomeFed, a California real estate development company, which it acquired in 2002. The Company's share of HomeFed's reported earnings fluctuates with the level of real estate sales activity at HomeFed's development projects.         The Company's share of JPOF II's earnings was distributed to the Company shortly after the end of each year.         The equity in income (losses) of EagleRock results from both realized and changes in unrealized gains (losses) in its portfolio. The partnership distributed $16,600,000 to the Company in 2006 and $3,700,000 in 2004.         Union Square, two entities in which the Company had non-controlling equity interests, sold their respective interests in an office complex located on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. during 2005. Including repayment of its mortgage loans at closing, the Company's share of the net proceeds was $73,200,000, and the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $72,300,000.         In January 2004, the Company invested $50,000,000 in Pershing Square, L.P. ("Pershing"), a limited partnership that is authorized to engage in a variety of investing activities. The Company redeemed its interest effective December 31, 2004; $71,300,000 was distributed to the Company in early 2005.         Since the Berkadia loan was fully repaid during the first quarter of 2004, the Company will no longer have any income related to the Berkadia loan in the future. The Company's income from this investment is expected to be limited to its share ($4,000,000) of the annual management fee received from FINOVA while such fee remains in effect. The Company does not believe that its share of the FINOVA common stock will ever result in any cash value, and is reflected at a zero book value. The Company has received total net cash proceeds of $95,200,000 from this investment since 2001, including the commitment and financing fees, management fees and interest payments related to its share of the Berkadia loan.         The table above includes amounts related to WilTel prior to consolidation in November 2003 when it was accounted for under the equity method of accounting.                                         43   Discontinued Operations         WilTel         As discussed above, the Company sold WilTel to Level 3 in December 2005 and recognized a pre-tax gain on disposal of $243,800,000. The calculation of the gain on sale included: (1) the cash proceeds received from Level 3 of $460,300,000, which is net of estimated working capital adjustments of $25,500,000; (2) the fair value of the Level 3 common shares of $339,300,000, based on the $2.95 per share closing price of Level 3 common stock immediately prior to closing; (3) the amount of the SBC cash payments that had not been previously accrued prior to closing ($175,900,000); (4) an impairment charge for WilTel's headquarters building of approximately $42,400,000; and (5) the net book value of the net assets sold and estimated expenses and other costs related to the transaction. The Company reclassified WilTel's consolidated historical results of operations prior to the sale to income (loss) from discontinued operations. WilTel's income (loss) from discontinued operations was $116,000,000, $(56,600,000) and $(15,300,000) for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.         Wireless Messaging         In December 2002, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase certain debt and equity securities of WebLink Wireless, Inc. ("WebLink"), for an aggregate purchase price of $19,000,000. WebLink operated in the wireless messaging industry, providing wireless data services and traditional paging services. In the fourth quarter of 2003, WebLink sold substantially all of its operating assets to Metrocall, Inc. for 500,000 shares of common stock of Metrocall, Inc.'s parent, Metrocall Holdings, Inc. ("Metrocall"), an immediately exercisable warrant to purchase 25,000 shares of common stock of Metrocall at $40 per share, and a warrant to purchase up to 100,000 additional shares of Metrocall common stock at $40 per share, subject to certain vesting criteria. Based upon the market price of the Metrocall stock received and the fair value of the warrants received as of the date of sale, the Company reported a pre-tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations of $11,500,000. The vesting criteria for the remaining warrants were satisfied during 2004, and the Company recorded $2,200,000 as gain on disposal of discontinued operations (net of minority interest), which represented the estimated fair value of the warrants. Due to WebLink's large net operating loss carryforwards, these gains were not reduced for any federal income tax expense.         During the fourth quarter of 2004, WebLink exercised all of its warrants and subsequently tendered all of its Metrocall shares as part of a merger agreement between Metrocall and Arch Wireless, Inc. WebLink received cash of $19,900,000 and 675,607 common shares of the new parent company (USA Mobility, Inc., which had a fair market value of $25,000,000 when received), resulting in a pre-tax gain of $15,800,000 that is included in net securities gains of continuing operations. The USA Mobility shares were sold during 2005.         In return for the Company's $19,000,000 investment in WebLink, the Company received aggregate cash proceeds of $48,900,000, net of minority interest and residual liabilities.         Domestic Real Estate         As discussed above, in 2005 the Company sold its 716-room Waikiki Beach hotel and related assets and recorded a pre-tax gain of $56,600,000, which is reflected in gain on disposal of discontinued operations.         In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company sold a commercial real estate property and classified it as a discontinued operation. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $7,100,000 to reduce the carrying amount of this property to its estimated fair value. The Company recorded an additional pre-tax loss of $600,000 when the sale closed, principally relating to mortgage prepayment penalties incurred upon satisfaction of the property's mortgage. Operating results for this property were not material in prior years.         Other Operations         In December 2005, the Company sold its interest in an Argentine shoe manufacturer that had been acquired earlier in the year. Although there was no material gain or loss on disposal, results of discontinued operations during 2005 include an operating loss of $4,400,000.                                         44          In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company sold its geothermal power generation business for $14,800,000, net of closing costs, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $200,000. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded pre-tax losses from discontinued operations relating to this business of $1,500,000 and $2,300,000, respectively.   Recently Issued Accounting Standards         In April 2005, the SEC amended the effective date of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), from the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005 to the beginning of the next fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005. SFAS 123R requires that the cost of all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. That cost will be recognized as an expense over the vesting period of the award. Pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. In addition, the Company will be required to determine fair value in accordance with SFAS 123R; the Company intends to use the modified prospective method. The Company does not expect that SFAS 123R will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements with respect to currently outstanding options.         In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections-a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3" ("SFAS 154"), which is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. SFAS 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles, and changes the accounting and reporting requirements for a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless doing so is impracticable. APB 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period in which the change occurred the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long-lived, nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 carries forward without change the guidance in APB 20 for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements, a change in accounting estimate and a change in reporting entity, as well as the provisions of SFAS 3 that govern reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements. The Company does not expect that SFAS 154 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. - --------  -----------------------------------------------------------            The following includes "forward-looking statements" that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.           The Company's market risk arises principally from interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and its borrowing activities.           The Company's investment portfolio is primarily classified as available for sale, and consequently, is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in shareholders' equity. Included in the Company's available for sale investment portfolio are fixed income securities, which comprised approximately 69% of the Company's total investment portfolio at December 31, 2005. These fixed income securities are primarily rated "investment grade" or are U.S. governmental agency issued or U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises. The estimated weighted average remaining life of these fixed income securities was approximately 1.2 years at December 31, 2005. The Company's fixed income securities, like all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. At December 31, 2004, fixed income securities comprised approximately 68% of the Company's total investment portfolio and had an estimated weighted average remaining life of 1.1 years. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company's portfolio of trading securities was not material.           The Company's investment portfolio also includes its investment in Level 3, carried at its aggregate market value of $330,100,000. This investment is approximately 14% of the Company's total investment portfolio, and its value is subject to change if the market value of the Level 3 stock rises or falls. The Company's investment portfolio also includes its investment in Inmet, which is carried at cost of $78,000,000 at December 31, 2005. Although the Company is restricted from selling the Inmet common shares, the investment is subject to price risk. The market value of this investment is $142,100,000 at December 31, 2005.           The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its long-term fixed interest rate debt. Generally, the fair market value of debt securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall, and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise.           The following table provides information about the Company's financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are primarily sensitive to changes in interest rates. For investment securities and debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates. For the variable rate borrowings, the weighted average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. For securities and liabilities with contractual maturities, the table presents contractual principal cash flows adjusted for the Company's historical experience and prepayments of mortgage-backed securities.
