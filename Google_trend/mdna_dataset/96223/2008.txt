Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results          of Operations. - ------   -----------------------------------------------------------------------          The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the Company's consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and results of operations. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this Report.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Parent Company Liquidity          Leucadia National Corporation (the "Parent") is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock of its direct subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents and other non-controlling investments in debt and equity securities. The Parent continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing operations and investments and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value. Accordingly, further acquisitions, divestitures, investments and changes in capital structure are possible. Its principal sources of funds are its available cash resources, liquid investments, bank borrowings, public and private capital market transactions, repayment of subsidiary advances, funds distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management and other fees, and borrowings and dividends from its subsidiaries.          In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the Company also considers investments classified as current assets and investments classified as non-current assets on the face of its consolidated balance sheet as being generally available to meet its liquidity needs. Securities classified as current and non-current investments are not as liquid as cash and cash equivalents, but they are generally easily convertible into cash within a short period of time. As of December 31, 2007, the sum of these amounts aggregated $4,216,700,000. However, since $447,900,000 of this amount is pledged as collateral pursuant to various agreements, represents investments in non-public securities or is held by subsidiaries that are party to agreements which restrict the Company's ability to use the funds for other purposes (including the Inmet shares), the Company does not consider those amounts to be available to meet the Parent's liquidity needs. The $3,768,800,000 that is available is comprised of cash and short-term bonds and notes of the U.S. Government and its agencies, U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises and other publicly traded debt and equity securities (including the investment in Fortescue common shares discussed below). The investment income realized from the Parent's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is used to meet the Parent company's short-term recurring cash requirements, which are principally the payment of interest on its debt and corporate overhead expenses.          The Parent's only long-term cash requirement is to make principal payments on its long-term debt ($1,923,200,000 principal outstanding as of December 31, 2007), of which $475,000,000 is due in 2013, $350,000,000 is due in 2014, $500,000,000 is due in 2015, $500,000,000 is due in 2017 and $98,200,000 is due in 2027. Historically, the Parent has used its available liquidity to make acquisitions of new businesses and other investments, but, except as disclosed in this Report, the timing of any future investments and the cost can not be predicted. Should the Company require additional liquidity for an investment or any other purpose, the Parent also has an unsecured bank credit facility of $100,000,000 that matures in 2011 and bears interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate or the prime rate. No amounts are currently outstanding under the bank credit facility. In addition, based on discussions with commercial and investment bankers, the Company believes that it has the ability to raise additional funds under acceptable conditions for use in its existing businesses or for appropriate investment opportunities. The Parent's senior debt obligations are rated two levels below investment grade by Moody's Investors Services and one level below investment grade by Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings. Ratings issued by bond rating agencies are subject to change at any time.                                         29           In March 2007, STi Prepaid purchased 75% of the assets of Telco for an aggregate purchase price of $121,800,000 in cash, including expenses. The acquisition cost was principally allocated to components of working capital and to deferred tax assets, including a reduction to the Company's deferred tax valuation allowance of $98,600,000.         In March 2007, the Company invested an additional $48,500,000 in Sangart (increasing its ownership interest to approximately 87%) principally to fund Sangart's ongoing product development activities. The Company also received warrants for the right (but not the obligation) to invest up to an additional $48,500,000 on the same terms, which if fully invested would increase its ownership interest to approximately 91%. The Company expects to exercise the warrants in 2008.         In June 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of ResortQuest for $11,900,000, including expenses and working capital adjustments finalized subsequent to the closing date.         As discussed above, on August 10, 2007, Premier emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and once again became a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Premier was initially accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary when it was acquired during 2006; however, Premier was deconsolidated on September 19, 2006, when it filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under the bankruptcy code, before the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, Southern Division. Premier filed its petitions in order to seek the court's assistance in gaining access to Hurricane Katrina-related insurance proceeds which had been denied to Premier by its pre-petition secured bondholders. While in bankruptcy proceedings the Company's investment and loans to Premier were accounted for as an investment in an associated company ($125,600,000 as of December 31, 2006).         Premier's plan was funded in part with a $180,000,000 senior secured credit facility provided by a subsidiary of the Company. The credit facility matures on February 1, 2012, bears interest at 10 3/4%, is prepayable at any time without penalty, and contains other covenants, terms and conditions similar to those contained in the indenture governing the Premier Notes. Since the plan did not result in any change in ownership of the voting interests in Premier, the Company did not apply "fresh start" accounting and did not treat the reconsolidation of Premier as the acquisition of a business that, under the purchase method of accounting, requires the measurement of assets and liabilities at fair value. Accordingly, the Company reconsolidated the assets and liabilities of Premier upon its emergence from bankruptcy using its historical basis in Premier's assets and liabilities.         The plan provided for the payment in full of all of Premier's creditors, including payment of principal and accrued interest due to the holders of Premier's 10 3/4% senior secured notes at par (the "Premier Notes"). The holders of the Premier Notes argued that they were entitled to liquidated damages under the indenture governing the Premier Notes, and as such are entitled to more than the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest that was paid to them at emergence. Although the Company does not agree with the position taken by the Premier noteholders, in order to have the plan confirmed so that Premier could complete reconstruction of its property and open its business without further delay, the Company agreed to fund an escrow account to cover the Premier noteholders' claim for additional damages in the amount of $13,700,000, and a second escrow account for the trustee's reasonable legal fees and expenses in the amount of $1,000,000. Entitlement to the escrows is expected to be determined by the court during 2008. The Company believes it is probable that the court will approve payment of legal fees and expenses and has fully reserved for that contingency. However, the Company does not believe it is probable or remote that the court will find in favor of the Premier noteholders with respect to the additional damages escrow, and any potential loss can not be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued a loss for the additional damages contingency.         Hurricane Katrina completely destroyed the Hard Rock Biloxi's casino, which was a facility built on floating barges, and caused significant damage to the hotel and related structures. The new casino was constructed over water on concrete pilings that greatly improved the structural integrity of the facility; however, the threat of hurricanes remains a risk to the repaired and rebuilt facilities. Premier's current insurance policy was bound on April 20, 2007, and provides up to $263,700,000 in coverage for damage to real and personal property including up to $84,100,000 in business interruption coverage. The coverage is led by Underwriters at Lloyds and is comprised of a $20,000,000 primary layer and six excess layers. The coverage is syndicated through several insurance carriers, each with an A.M. Best Rating of A- (Excellent) or better. Although the insurance policy is an all risk policy, WCO, which is defined to include damage caused by a named storm, is limited to $130,000,000 with a deductible of $13,200,000. The WCO coverage is subject to mandatory reinstatement of limits for an additional pre-determined premium.                                          30           In March 2007, the Board of Directors increased the number of the Company's common shares that the Company is authorized to purchase. As a result, the Company is authorized to purchase up to 12,000,000 common shares. Such purchases may be made from time to time in the open market, through block trades or otherwise. Depending on market conditions and other factors, such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without notice. During the three year period ended December 31, 2007, the only common shares acquired by the Company were from employees in connection with the employees' exercise of stock options. As of February 14, 2008, the Company is authorized to repurchase 11,995,285 common shares.         In March 2007, the Company sold $500,000,000 principal amount of its newly authorized 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2017 in a private placement transaction. Net proceeds after payment of underwriting fees were $490,000,000. Pursuant to an exchange offer, these notes were subsequently exchanged for a new issue of debt securities registered under the Securities Act, with terms identical to those of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes (except for provisions relating to transfer restrictions and payment of additional interest).         In September 2007, the Company sold $500,000,000 principal amount of its newly authorized 8 1/8% Senior Notes due 2015 at an issue price of 98.307%. Net proceeds after payment of underwriting fees were $481,700,000.         In September 2007, the Company completed the issuance and sale of 5,500,000 of its common shares at a price of $45.50 per share. Net proceeds after payment of underwriting fees were $242,000,000.         During 2007, the Company increased its equity interest in Goober Drilling to 50% for additional payments aggregating $45,000,000. In addition, the senior secured credit facility was amended to increase the borrowing capacity to $138,500,000 and the interest rate to LIBOR plus 5%, the Company provided Goober Drilling with an additional secured credit facility of $45,000,000 at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 10%, and the Company provided another secured credit facility of $15,000,000 at an interest rate at the greater of 8% or LIBOR plus 2.6%. At December 31, 2007, the aggregate outstanding loan amount was $171,000,000 excluding interest. The additional funding was required due to increased raw material and labor costs to construct the new rigs and working capital needs due to delays in rig construction. The Company's investment in Goober Drilling is classified as an investment in an associated company.          In April 2007, the Company and Jefferies expanded and restructured the Company's equity investment in JPOF II, one of several entities managed by Jefferies that invested capital in Jefferies' high yield trading business. The Company committed to invest $600,000,000 in a newly formed entity, JHYH, Jefferies committed to invest the same amount as the Company, and passive investors may invest up to $800,000,000 in the aggregate over time. In April 2007, after regulatory approval for the new venture was received, the Company contributed $250,000,000 to JHYH along with its $100,000,000 investment in JPOF II; the timing of the Company's remaining $250,000,000 contribution is at the sole discretion of Jefferies. The Company's investment in JHYH is classified as an investment in an associated company.          The Company has invested an aggregate of $452,200,000 in Fortescue's Pilbara iron ore and infrastructure project in Western Australia ($44,200,000 in 2007 and $408,000,000 in 2006), including expenses. In exchange for its cash investment, the Company has received 277,986,000 common shares of Fortescue (split adjusted), representing approximately 9.9% of the outstanding Fortescue common stock, and a $100,000,000 note of FMG that matures in August 2019. Interest on the note is calculated as 4% of the revenue, net of government royalties, invoiced from the iron ore produced from the project's Cloud Break and Christmas Creek areas. The note is unsecured and subordinate to the project's senior secured debt. Fortescue is a publicly traded company on the Australian Stock Exchange, and the shares acquired by the Company may be sold without restriction on the Australian Stock Exchange or in accordance with applicable securities laws. The Company's investment in the Fortescue common shares is classified as a non-current available for sale investment and carried at market value as of each balance sheet date. At December 31, 2007, the market value of the Fortescue common shares was $1,824,700,000.                                          31           Over the past few years, the Company has invested in various limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are engaged in investing and/or securities transactions activities whose investment decisions are at the sole discretion of the entity's general partner or managing member. These investments include Pershing Square ($200,000,000 in 2007), Ambrose ($75,000,000 in 2007), Highland Opportunity ($74,000,000 in 2007), Shortplus ($25,000,000 in 2007) and Wintergreen (a total of $50,000,000 invested during 2006 and 2005), each of which is classified as an investment in associated companies.          As of February 25, 2008, the Company had acquired or had the right to acquire 25.6% of the outstanding voting securities of ACF, a company listed on the NYSE (Symbol: ACF), for aggregate cash consideration of $373,900,000 ($70,100,000 was invested as of December 31, 2007). ACF is an independent auto finance company that is in the business of purchasing and servicing automobile sales finance contracts, predominantly to consumers who are typically unable to obtain financing from other sources. ACF has historically funded its auto lending activities through the transfer of loans in securitization transactions. The Company also has the right to vote certain shares owned by another party; in total, the Company has acquired or has the right to acquire the ability to vote 26.5% of ACF's outstanding voting securities. In February 2008, with the acquisition of sufficient ACF shares that gave the Company the ability to exercise significant influence, the Company elected to account for its investment in ACF on a fair value basis pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115."          The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have substantial NOLs and other tax attributes. The amount and availability of the NOLs and other tax attributes are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations on the use of the NOLs, the Company's certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from acquiring ownership (including through attribution under the tax law) of five percent or more of the common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning five percent or more of the common shares from acquiring additional common shares. The restrictions will remain in effect until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2024, (b) the repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any comparable successor provision) or (c) the beginning of a taxable year of the Company to which certain tax benefits may no longer be carried forward. For more information about the NOLs and other tax attributes, see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows          As discussed above, the Company relies on the Parent's available liquidity to meet its short-term and long-term needs, and to make acquisitions of new businesses and investments. Except as otherwise disclosed herein, the Company's operating businesses do not generally require material funds from the Parent to support their operating activities, and the Parent does not depend on positive cash flow from its operating segments to meet its liquidity needs. The components of the Company's operating businesses and investments change frequently as a result of acquisitions or divestitures, the timing of which is impossible to predict but which often have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows in any one period. Further, the timing and amounts of distributions from certain of the Company's investments in partnerships accounted for under the equity method are generally outside the control of the Company. As a result, reported cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities do not generally follow any particular pattern or trend, and reported results in the most recent period should not be expected to recur in any subsequent period.         Net cash of $18,400,000 was used for operating activities during 2007 as compared to $91,500,000 of net cash provided by operating activities during 2006. The change reflects decreased collections of receivables and distributions of earnings from associated companies, increased income tax payments and greater corporate overhead expenses. The change in operating cash flows also reflects increased funds generated from activity in the trading portfolio, decreased payment of incentive compensation and decreased defined benefit pension plan contributions. During 2006, cash provided by operating activities reflects the collection of the balance of certain receivables from AT&T Inc. ($198,500,000). The AT&T receivables resulted from a termination agreement entered into between the Company's former telecommunications subsidiary, WilTel, and its largest customer during 2005. In 2007, distributions from associated companies principally include earnings distributed by JPOF II ($29,200,000) and EagleRock ($15,000,000). In 2006, distributions from associated companies principally include earnings distributed by JPOF II ($23,600,000) and EagleRock ($48,200,000). Contributions to the defined benefit pension plans were $50,100,000 in 2006; no material contributions were made in 2007.                                         32           Funds used for operating activities during 2007 include the results of companies acquired during 2007, STi Prepaid and ResortQuest, for the period they were owned by the Company, and the results of Premier following its reconsolidation in the third quarter of 2007. STi Prepaid's telecommunications operations generated funds from operating activities of $26,700,000 and the Company's property management and services segment generated funds of $3,700,000. While it was a consolidated subsidiary, Premier used funds of $38,500,000 in 2007 and $25,900,000 in 2006. Funds provided by the Company's manufacturing segments decreased to $25,300,000 in 2007 as compared to $45,300,000 in 2006, reflecting reduced profitability. Funds used by Sangart, a development stage company, increased to $24,800,000 during 2007 from $19,400,000 during 2006. Funds provided by operating activities for 2006 also include $9,100,000 of funds used by discontinued operations.          Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $229,600,000 in 2006 as compared to the prior year, due principally to no 2006 cash flows from WilTel, which was sold in December 2005, reduced distributions of earnings from associated companies, reduced funds generated from activity in the trading portfolio, payment of incentive compensation and increased defined benefit pension plan contributions. In addition, funds provided by operating activities during 2006 reflect a $19,400,000 use of funds by Sangart, a development stage company which became a subsidiary in November 2005. During 2006, cash provided by operating activities reflect the collection of the balance of certain receivables from AT&T discussed above. WilTel's cash flow from operating activities for the 2005 period prior to its sale was $278,500,000. In 2006, distributions from associated companies principally include earnings distributed by EagleRock ($48,200,000) and JPOF II ($23,600,000). In 2005, distributions from associated companies principally resulted from JPOF II ($16,200,000) and the sale of Union Square, two entities in which the Company had non-controlling equity interests. In May 2005, these entities sold their respective interests in an office complex located on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.; the Company's share of the net proceeds was $73,200,000. Contributions to the defined benefit pension plans were $50,100,000 in 2006 as compared to $21,800,000 in 2005. The current status of the Company's frozen defined benefit pension plans is more fully discussed below.          Net cash flows used for investing activities were $957,400,000 in 2007 and $186,200,000 in 2006; net cash flows provided by investing activities were $22,600,000 in 2005. During 2007, acquisitions, net of cash acquired principally include assets acquired by STi Prepaid ($85,400,000) and ResortQuest ($9,700,000) and cash acquired upon the reconsolidation of Premier ($17,300,000). During 2006, acquisitions, net of cash acquired principally include the acquisition of Premier ($105,700,000). During 2005, acquisitions, net of cash acquired principally include ATX Communications, Inc. ("ATX") ($12,500,000), Idaho Timber ($133,500,000) and NSW, LLC U.S. ("NSW"), an acquisition by Conwed Plastics ($26,600,000). During 2006, proceeds from the disposal of discontinued operations net of expenses and cash sold were $120,200,000, principally reflecting the sale of Symphony Healthcare Services, LLC ("Symphony") and ATX and the resolution of WilTel's working capital adjustment relating to the December 2005 sale of WilTel. During 2005, proceeds from the disposal of discontinued operations net of expenses and cash sold principally reflect the sales of WilTel ($357,100,000) and the Waikiki Beach hotel ($95,200,000). During 2007, funds provided by the disposal of real estate, property and equipment and other assets include the sale of WilTel's former headquarters building for $53,500,000. During 2006, funds provided by the disposal of real estate, property and equipment and other assets include the sale of 8 acres of unimproved land in Washington, D.C. by 711 Developer, LLC ("Square 711"), a 90% owned subsidiary of the Company, ($75,700,000) and the sale of two associated companies ($56,400,000). Investments in associated companies include JHYH ($250,000,000), Pershing Square ($200,000,000), Goober Drilling ($108,000,000), Ambrose ($75,000,000), Highland Opportunity ($74,000,000), Shortplus ($25,000,000), CLC ($53,500,000) and Premier ($160,500,000) in 2007, Goober Drilling ($188,000,000), Safe Harbor Domestic Partners L.P. ("Safe Harbor") ($50,000,000), Wintergreen ($30,000,000) and CLC ($12,100,000) in 2006, and Wintergreen ($20,000,000) in 2005. Capital distributions from associated companies principally include Goober Drilling ($33,200,000) and Safe Harbor ($25,000,000) in 2007.          As a result of the sale of WilTel, the Company's use of funds for property, equipment and leasehold improvements declined significantly in 2007 and 2006; funds used for WilTel's acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements totaled $96,100,000 in 2005. During 2007, the change in restricted cash principally results from the $56,500,000 escrow deposit made in connection with the Panama City real estate project. Pursuant to the indenture governing the Premier Notes, Premier was required to put insurance proceeds it collected into restricted accounts, which is the principal reason for the net change in restricted cash during 2006. Premier's cash flow activity is reflected in the Company's 2006 consolidated statement of cash flows only during the period it was a consolidated subsidiary (April through September 2006).                                         33           Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,145,500,000 in 2007 and net cash used for financing activities was $5,200,000 in 2006 and $442,700,000 in 2005. During 2007, issuance of debt, net of expenses, includes $500,000,000 principal amount of 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $500,000,000 principal amount of 8 1/8% Senior Notes. Issuance of debt during 2006 and 2005 principally relates to repurchase agreements, which are discussed below. During 2005, funds were used to retire customer banking deposits of the Company's former banking and lending operations (which have been run-off) as they became due and the remaining deposits were sold. The reduction of debt during 2007 principally relates to the repurchase agreements. The reduction of debt during 2006 includes the repayment of debt of Square 711 ($32,000,000), which was sold, and the maturity of the Company's 7 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes ($21,700,000). The reduction of debt during 2005 includes the repayment of $442,500,000 of debt of operations sold (WilTel and Waikiki Beach hotel) and the maturity of the Company's 8 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes ($19,100,000).         Issuance of common shares for 2007 principally reflects the issuance and sale of 5,500,000 of the Company's common shares as discussed above and the exercise of employee stock options. Issuance of common shares for 2006 and 2005 principally reflects the exercise of employee stock options.         Debt due within one year includes $125,000,000 and $181,800,000 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to repurchase agreements of one of the Company's subsidiaries. These fixed rate repurchase agreements have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.1%, mature in January 2008 and are secured by non-current investments with a carrying value of $129,100,000 at December 31, 2007.          During 2001, a subsidiary of the Company borrowed $53,100,000 secured by certain of its corporate aircraft, of which $39,200,000 is currently outstanding. Capital leases of another subsidiary aggregating $8,700,000 consist of a sale-leaseback transaction related to other corporate aircraft. The Parent company has guaranteed these financings.          The Company's senior note indentures contain covenants that restrict its ability to incur more Indebtedness or issue Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries if the Company fails to maintain a specified ratio of Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Tangible Net Worth, limit the ability of the Company and Material Subsidiaries to incur, in certain circumstances, Funded Debt or Liens, and contain other terms and restrictions all as defined in the senior note indentures. The Company's bank credit agreement also contains covenants and restrictions which are generally more restrictive than the senior note indentures; however, the Company has the ability to terminate the bank credit agreement if no amounts are outstanding. The Company is in compliance with all of these restrictions, and the Company has the ability to incur additional indebtedness or make distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions. Certain of the debt instruments of subsidiaries of the Company require that collateral be provided to the lender; principally as a result of such requirements, the assets of subsidiaries which are subject to limitations on transfer of funds to the Company were approximately $303,800,000 at December 31, 2007.

As shown below, at December 31, 2007, the Company's contractual cash obligations totaled $3,684,024,000.

Estimated payments related to a currency swap agreement are based on the currency rate in effect at December 31, 2007. Amounts related to the Company's consolidated pension liability ($22,400,000) are included in the table primarily during the 1-3 year period; however, the exact timing of the cash payments is uncertain. The above amounts do not include liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as the timing of payments, if any, is uncertain. Such amounts aggregated $13,300,000 at December 31, 2007; for more information, see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.          At December 31, 2007, the Company had recorded a liability of $22,400,000 on its consolidated balance sheet for its unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligations. This amount represents the difference between the present value of amounts owed to current and former employees (referred to as the projected benefit obligation) and the market value of plan assets set aside in segregated trust accounts. Since the benefits in these plans have been frozen, future changes to the benefit obligation are expected to principally result from benefit payments, differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience and interest rates.          Although the Company did not make any significant pension plan contributions during 2007, the Company does expect to make substantial contributions to the segregated trust accounts in the future to reduce its plan liabilities and reduce administrative and insurance costs associated with the plans. The tax deductibility of these contributions is not a primary consideration, principally due to the availability of the Company's NOLs to otherwise reduce taxable income. The timing and amount of additional contributions are uncertain; however, the Company believes it will make substantial contributions over the next few years to reduce, but not to entirely eliminate, its defined benefit pension plan liability.          The Company maintained defined benefit pension plans covering certain operating units prior to 1999, and WilTel also maintained defined pension benefit plans that were not transferred in connection with the sale of WilTel. As of December 31, 2007, certain amounts for these plans are reflected separately in the table below (dollars in thousands):                                                                            The Company's         WilTel's                                                                             Plans              Plans                                                                             -----              -----       Projected benefit obligation                                               $51,759           $ 168,541 Funded status - balance sheet liability at December 31, 2007                 4,556              17,803 Deferred losses included in other comprehensive income                      14,468               7,095 Discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation             5.20%               6.30%            Calculations of pension expense and projected benefit obligations are prepared by actuaries based on assumptions provided by management. These assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis, including assumptions about discount rates, interest credit rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. For the Company's plans, a discount rate was selected to result in an estimated projected benefit obligation on a plan termination basis, using current rates for annuity settlements and lump sum payments weighted for the assumed elections of participants. For the WilTel plans, the timing of expected future benefit payments was used in conjunction with the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve to develop a discount rate that is representative of the high quality corporate bond market, adjusted for current rates which might be available for annuity settlements.          These discount rates will be used to determine pension expense in 2008. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.25% change in these discount rates would affect pension expense by $600,000 and the benefit obligation by $7,800,000.                                          35            The deferred losses in other comprehensive income primarily result from changes in actuarial assumptions, including changes in discount rates, changes in interest credit rates and differences between the actual and assumed return on plan assets. Deferred losses are amortized to expense if they exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year; such amount aggregated $10,700,000 at December 31, 2007 for all plans. A portion of these excess deferred losses will be amortized to expense during 2008, based on an amortization period of twelve years.          The assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets are based on the investment objectives of the specific plan, which are more fully discussed in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Differences between the actual and expected rates of return on plan assets have not been material.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements          At December 31, 2007, the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees and letters of credit aggregating $76,000,000. Pursuant to an agreement that was entered into before the Company sold CDS Holding Corporation ("CDS") to HomeFed in 2002, the Company agreed to provide project improvement bonds for the San Elijo Hills project. These bonds, which are for the benefit of the City of San Marcos, California and other government agencies, are required prior to the commencement of any development at the project. CDS is responsible for paying all third party fees related to obtaining the bonds. Should the City or others draw on the bonds for any reason, CDS and one of its subsidiaries would be obligated to reimburse the Company for the amount drawn. At December 31, 2007, the amount of outstanding bonds was $12,100,000, which expires at various times through 2010. Subsidiaries of the Company have outstanding letters of credit aggregating $15,300,000 at December 31, 2007, principally to secure various obligations. Substantially all of these letters of credit expire before 2012.          As discussed above, the Company has also guaranteed 30% of the amounts outstanding under CLC's $240,000,000 senior secured credit facility and CLC's (euro)69,000,000 senior secured bridge credit facility. At December 31, 2007, $126,900,000 was outstanding under the senior secured credit facility and (euro)24,000,000 was outstanding under the senior secured bridge credit facility; as a result, the Company's outstanding guaranty at that date was $38,100,000 and (euro)7,200,000 ($10,500,000 at exchange rates in effect on February 14, 2008), respectively.  Critical Accounting Estimates          The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions. The following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements, and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect, at a specific point in time, events whose ultimate outcome won't be known until a later date. Actual results could differ from these estimates.         Income Taxes - The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. If in the future the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax asset in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment would increase income in such period or, if such determination were made in connection with an acquisition, an adjustment would be made in connection with the allocation of the purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities. If in the future the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax asset, an adjustment would be charged to income in such period. The determination of the amount of the valuation allowance required is based, in significant part, upon the Company's projection of future taxable income at any point in time. The Company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities based on the Company's assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining its tax filing positions.                                          36           During 2007 and 2005, the Company's revised projections of future taxable income enabled it to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the Company's net deferred tax asset; accordingly, $542,700,000 in 2007 and $1,135,100,000 in 2005 of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense. The Company's conclusion that a portion of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized is strongly influenced by its historical ability to generate significant amounts of taxable income and its projections of future taxable income, and also takes into consideration unrealized gains in its investment portfolio. The Company's estimate of future taxable income considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, about its current operations and investments, includes an aggregation of individual projections for each material operation and investment, estimates apportionment factors for state and local taxing jurisdictions and includes all future years that the Company estimated it would have available net operating losses. The Company believes that its estimate of future taxable income is reasonable but inherently uncertain, and if its current or future operations and investments generate taxable income greater than the projected amounts, further adjustments to reduce the valuation allowance are possible. Conversely, if the Company realizes unforeseen material losses in the future, or its ability to generate future taxable income necessary to realize a portion of the deferred tax asset is materially reduced, additions to the valuation allowance could be recorded. At December 31, 2007, the balance of the deferred tax valuation allowance was approximately $299,800,000.         Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", the Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. When testing for impairment, the Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group). The determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on management's estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value. If the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.          The Company did not recognize any impairment losses on long-lived assets during 2007 or 2006; however, during 2005 an impairment loss of $42,400,000 was recorded to reduce the carrying amount of WilTel's former headquarters facility to its estimated fair value in connection with the sale of WilTel to Level 3 (classified with gain on disposal of discontinued operations). WilTel's former headquarters building, including the adjacent parking garage, was not included in the sale to Level 3 and was retained by the Company. The Company concluded that the change in the manner in which the asset was being used, from a headquarters facility of an operating subsidiary to a property held for investment, was a change in circumstances which indicated that the carrying amount of the facility might not be recoverable. During 2007, the building was sold for net cash proceeds of $53,500,000, which resulted in a small gain.         Impairment of Securities - Investments with an impairment in value considered to be other than temporary are written down to estimated fair value. The write-downs are included in net securities gains in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis.          The Company's determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information; GAAP requires the exercise of judgment in making this assessment, rather than the application of fixed mathematical criteria. The Company considers a number of factors including, but not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, the reason for the decline in fair value, changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date, the ability and intent to hold investments to maturity, and other factors specific to the individual investment. The Company's assessment involves a high degree of judgment and accordingly, actual results may differ materially from the Company's estimates and judgments. The Company recorded impairment charges for securities of $36,800,000, $12,900,000 and $12,200,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.         Business Combinations - At acquisition, the Company allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their relative fair values. Significant judgments and estimates are often made to determine these allocated values, and may include the use of appraisals, consider market quotes for similar transactions, employ discounted cash flow techniques or consider other information the Company believes relevant. The finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete, and if                                         37  final values are materially different from initially recorded amounts adjustments are recorded. Any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill which is not amortized to expense. Recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis, and between annual testing dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value.          Subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation, any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Once final, the Company is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price, even if subsequent events or circumstances prove the Company's original judgments and estimates to be incorrect. In addition, long-lived assets like property and equipment, amortizable intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss; however, under GAAP the methods, assumptions and results of an impairment review are not the same for all long-lived assets. The assumptions and judgments made by the Company when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future.          Purchase price allocations for all of the Company's recent acquisitions have been finalized. Adjustments to the initial purchase price allocations were not material.          Use of Fair Value Estimates - Substantially all of the Company's investment portfolio is classified as either available for sale or as trading securities, both of which are carried at estimated fair value in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair values are principally based on publicly quoted market prices, which can rise or fall in reaction to a wide variety of factors or events, and as such are subject to market-related risks and uncertainties. The Company also invests in limited partnerships or limited liability companies which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These investees hold investments in publicly and non-publicly traded securities, and as such are also subject to market-related risks and uncertainties and the risks inherent in estimating the fair values of such securities. Since changes in the fair value of all of these investments are recognized in the Company's consolidated balance sheet, and with respect to trading securities or securities owned by equity method investees also in the Company's consolidated statement of operations, the Company is exposed to volatility in securities markets.          Contingencies - The Company accrues for contingent losses when the contingent loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred and of contingent loss amounts normally require significant judgment by management, can be highly subjective and are subject to material change with the passage of time as more information becomes available. As of December 31, 2007, the Company's accrual for contingent losses was not material.  Results of Operations  General         Substantially all of the Company's operating businesses sell products or services that are impacted by general economic conditions in the U.S. and to a lesser extent internationally. Poor general economic conditions can reduce the demand for products or services sold by the Company's operating subsidiaries and/or result in reduced pricing for products or services. Troubled industry sectors, like the residential real estate market, can have an adverse direct impact not only on the Company's real estate and property management and services segments, but also can have an adverse indirect impact on some of the Company's other operating segments, including manufacturing and gaming entertainment. The discussions below concerning revenue and profitability by segment consider current economic conditions and the impact such conditions have on each segment; however, should general economic conditions worsen and/or if the country experiences a recession, the Company believes that all of its businesses would be more adversely impacted than currently anticipated.         The Company does not have any operating businesses that are participants in the sub-prime real estate lending sector, though a tightening in consumer lending standards has and will have a direct or indirect negative impact on certain of the Company's operations. The Company's investment portfolio includes mortgage-backed securities of $319,500,000 at December 31, 2007; however, all of these securities are rated investment grade and issued by United States Government agencies or U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises. The Company has also invested in certain investment partnerships (classified as investments in associated companies) that invest in securities whose values are directly affected by the sub-prime lending crisis. The Company's exposure to changes in their values is limited to the net book value of its investment in such partnerships. At December 31, 2007, the aggregate book value of the Company's investments in such partnerships was approximately $140,000,000.                                         38  Manufacturing - Idaho Timber         Revenues and other income for Idaho Timber for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 and from the date of acquisition (May 2005) through December 31, 2005 were $292,200,000, $345,700,000 and $239,000,000, respectively; gross profits were $25,100,000, $30,000,000 and $22,000,000, respectively; salaries and incentive compensation expenses were $7,800,000, $9,400,000 and $6,300,000, respectively; depreciation and amortization expenses were $4,600,000, $4,900,000 and $4,200,000, respectively; and pre-tax income was $9,100,000, $12,000,000 and $8,200,000, respectively.         Idaho Timber's revenues for 2007 continued to reflect the weak demand resulting from reductions in housing starts and the abundant supply of high-grade lumber in the marketplace. Although shipment volume increased throughout much of 2007 as compared to the last quarter of 2006, the full year shipment volume in 2007 declined by 3.5% as compared to 2006. In addition, average selling prices for 2007 declined almost 12% as compared to 2006. Idaho Timber expects that the abundance of existing homes available for sale in the market will continue to negatively impact housing starts and Idaho Timber's revenues during 2008. Until housing starts begin to increase, dimension lumber shipping volume may remain flat or could decline further. Curtailment of production at primary sawmills due to their operating losses could reduce excess supply to some degree; however, spread (as discussed below) may not improve since demand and pricing for low-grade lumber may increase if supplies are reduced.         Idaho Timber's revenues weakened during 2006, reflecting lower average selling prices and reduced shipment volume. This decline was principally due to weakening demand resulting from reductions in housing starts and the abundant supply of lumber in the marketplace. In October 2006, the trade dispute between the U.S. and Canada over Canadian lumber imports was resolved and a new Softwood Lumber Agreement became effective that restricts and imposes a tax on Canadian lumber imports. Prior to the effective date of that agreement, imports from Canada increased, which added to the oversupply in the market.         Raw material costs, the largest component of cost of sales (approximately 82% of cost of sales), declined during 2007 as compared to 2006 principally due to the same market conditions that have negatively impacted revenues. However, raw material costs gradually increased throughout 2007, reflecting less availability of low-grade lumber due to increased shipments to Asia and Europe and lower Canadian lumber imports. The difference between Idaho Timber's selling price and raw material cost per thousand board feet (spread) is closely monitored, and the rate of change in pricing and cost is typically not the same. Spreads declined throughout 2007, and were lower by approximately 8% for the full year as compared to 2006. Idaho Timber intends to continue to focus on developing new higher margin products, diversifying its supply chain, improving cost control and solidifying customer and supplier relationships, in an effort to maximize gross margins and pre-tax results.  Manufacturing - Conwed Plastics          Pre-tax income for Conwed Plastics was $17,400,000, $17,900,000 and $14,200,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Its manufacturing revenues and other income were $105,400,000, $106,400,000 and $93,600,000, and gross profits were $31,300,000, $34,400,000 and $28,900,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Revenues were largely unchanged in 2007 as compared to 2006 and increased by 14% in 2006 as compared to 2005.         The slowdown in housing starts and a slow start in road construction due to weather conditions were principally responsible for the revenue decline in most of Conwed Plastics' markets during 2007. Markets that are impacted by the slowdown in the housing industry, which began in the second half of 2006, include the carpet cushion, building and construction, erosion control and turf reinforcement markets. In addition, increased competition in the erosion control market caused a decline in revenues during 2007. Revenues also declined due to the removal of netting as a component of a customer's bedding product. Conwed Plastics did realize increased revenues of $7,000,000 from its packaging market, principally due to acquisitions in May 2006, and in February, July and October of 2007. Conwed Plastics expects revenues to continue to be adversely impacted in those markets related to housing, which may offset continued growth in the packaging market.         The increase in revenues in 2006 as compared to 2005 reflects $5,400,000 of increased revenues from the acquisitions of NSW in February 2005 and Polynet in May 2006, which increased the segment's product offerings and customer base. In addition, 2006 revenues reflect increases in the erosion control, carpet cushion and turf reinforcement markets, partially reduced by a decline in the consumer products market due to lower demand for certain products. These changes resulted from a variety of factors including the impact of price increases implemented in 2005, increased road construction and using a new distributor for certain products. While the carpet cushion market continued to benefit from the previously strong housing market through the first half of 2006, it experienced a reduction in sales volume during the second half of the year resulting from a slowdown in housing starts.                                         39           Raw material costs increased by approximately 13% in 2007 as compared to 2006 and by approximately 4% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The primary raw material in Conwed Plastics' products is a polypropylene resin, which is a byproduct of the oil refining process, whose price tends to fluctuate with the price of oil. In addition to managing resin purchases, Conwed Plastics has improved its ability to reduce and/or reuse scrap and continues to seek further improvements in order to increase raw material utilization.         Gross margins declined in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily due to product mix, increased raw material costs and greater depreciation and amortization expense related to acquisitions and equipment upgrades. Gross margins increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 despite the increase in raw material costs, as the segment was able to increase selling prices in most markets, and increase sales and production volumes. Gross margin and pre-tax results for 2007 and 2006 reflect $800,000 and $1,100,000, respectively, of greater amortization expense on intangible assets resulting from acquisitions and depreciation expense.         Pre-tax results for 2007 reflects $2,200,000 of lower salaries and incentive compensation expense as compared to 2006 principally due to lower pre-tax profits and the conversion of certain European management employees from salaried employees to contract based professionals. Pre-tax results for 2006 reflect $1,900,000 of higher salaries and incentive compensation expense than 2005, principally due to greater pre-tax profits and increased headcount.  Telecommunications         The telecommunications business of STi Prepaid has been consolidated by the Company since March 2007. For the period from the asset acquisition through December 31, 2007, STi Prepaid's telecommunications revenues and other income were $363,200,000, telecommunications cost of sales were $309,000,000, salaries and incentive compensation expenses were $8,100,000, selling, general and other expenses were $27,000,000, and STi Prepaid had pre-tax income of $18,400,000.         Historically, STi Prepaid's revenue volumes have not declined during periods of generally poor economic conditions, as customers have found prepaid calling cards to be an attractive alternative to other, higher priced long distance services. However, STi Prepaid's revenues have declined, as business was lost to existing competitors and new entrants into the market, which have been offering low entry pricing to gain market share which STi Prepaid believes is not sustainable. In addition, during the period STi Prepaid was transitioning from being a private company to a subsidiary of the Company, it lost some distributors, which negatively impacted revenues. STi Prepaid has refocused its efforts at maintaining strong and frequent contact with its distributors, which was lacking at times during 2007, in an effort to rebuild those relationships and grow revenue.  Property Management and Services         The property management and services operations of ResortQuest have been consolidated by the Company since June 2007. For the period from its acquisition through December 31, 2007, property management and services revenues and other income were $81,500,000, direct operating expenses were $66,000,000, salaries and incentive compensation expenses were $4,000,000, depreciation and amortization expenses were $3,100,000, selling, general and other expenses were $14,900,000 and pre-tax losses were $6,500,000.         Although revenue trends since acquisition have been consistent with pre-acquisition periods, the vacation rental component of the property management business could be negatively impacted by poor economic conditions in the U.S., including the impact of higher fuel prices and less disposable income. Slowdowns might be more acutely felt in the fly to markets like ski areas, rather than drive to markets like Northwest Florida. Even if overall reservations do not decrease, the number of advance bookings could decline as consumers wait to decide closer to travel dates whether and where they will vacation. ResortQuest has initiated a number of promotions to entice repeat customers into booking their reservations well in advance of arrival. The real estate brokerage business has been and will continue to be negatively impacted by the depressed real estate market.                                          40   Gaming Entertainment         As more fully discussed above, Premier was accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary when acquired during 2006; however, while in bankruptcy proceedings from September 19, 2006 to emergence on August 10, 2007, Premier was accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Premier's casino and hotel operations opened to the public on June 30, 2007; prior to opening, Premier's activities principally consisted of rebuilding and repairing the hotel and casino facilities that were severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina and its bankruptcy proceedings.         For the period from emergence from bankruptcy (date of reconsolidation) through December 31, 2007, Premier's revenues and other income were $38,500,000 and its pre-tax losses were $9,300,000. Premier's results for this 2007 period include direct operating expenses of $37,800,000, interest expense of $500,000, salaries and incentive compensation expenses of $1,400,000, depreciation and amortization expenses of $6,300,000, and selling, general and other expenses of $1,800,000. For the period from date of acquisition (April 2006) through its filing for bankruptcy in September 2006, Premier's pre-tax losses were not material.         The Hard Rock Biloxi was the last gaming operation to open in Biloxi following Hurricane Katrina. The Hard Rock Biloxi is still in the early stages of establishing its customer database and instituting customer loyalty programs and has not yet achieved a market share of the local gaming market commensurate with the size of its facility and the gaming choices it offers. Although Premier expected it would take some time to build its business, its revenue growth since it opened has been slower than expected. Its competitors in the Mississippi Gulf Coast gaming market have been in operation longer than Premier and have more established gaming operations, marketing programs and customer databases.         The Company's share of Premier's net loss under the equity method of accounting from January 1, 2007 to the date of emergence from bankruptcy was $22,300,000 and not material during 2006.  Domestic Real Estate          Pre-tax income (loss) for the domestic real estate segment was $(8,200,000), $44,000,000 and $4,100,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Pre-tax results for the domestic real estate segment are largely dependent upon the performance of the segment's operating properties, the current status of the Company's real estate development projects and non-recurring gains or losses recognized when real estate assets are sold. As a result, pre-tax results for this segment for any particular year are not predictable and do not follow any consistent pattern.          The Company did not have any major real estate sales during 2007, resulting in significantly lower pre-tax profits than in 2006. During 2007, real estate revenues and other income include $3,900,000 of charges related to the accounting for the mark-to-market value of an interest rate derivative relating to the Myrtle Beach project's debt obligation. Pre-tax results for 2007 include $1,600,000 of incentive compensation accruals related to the Company's real estate development project in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. During 2006 pre-tax income includes the sale by Square 711, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $48,900,000, and the sale of other land parcels in Utah for a pre-tax gain of $11,200,000. In addition, the Company recognized pre-tax profit related to its 95-lot development project in South Walton County, Florida of $3,600,000 and $6,600,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Such amounts principally result from the completion of certain required improvements to land previously sold. Pre-tax results for 2006 reflect $8,100,000 of incentive compensation accruals related to the Company's real estate development project in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  Medical Product Development         Pre-tax losses (net of minority interest) for Sangart for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 and from the date of acquisition (November 2005) through December 31, 2005 were $31,500,000, $21,100,000 and $1,400,000, respectively. Sangart's losses for these periods reflect research and development costs of $22,100,000, $16,500,000 and $600,000, respectively, and salaries and incentive compensation expenses of $8,800,000, $6,400,000 and $1,000,000, respectively.                                          41          As more fully discussed above, Sangart is a development stage company that does not have any revenues from product sales. Since inception, it has been developing its current product candidate, Hemospan(R), and is currently conducting two Phase III clinical trials in Europe. It does not expect to complete those clinical trials until 2008, and if they are successful it will then seek approval with the appropriate regulatory authorities to market its product. Sangart also recently completed a smaller Phase II clinical trial in the U.S., data from which is still being compiled. Until such time, if ever, that Sangart obtains regulatory approval for Hemospan, the Company will report losses from this segment. U.S. or foreign regulatory agencies could also require Sangart to perform more clinical trials, which could be both expensive and time consuming. The Company expects to invest up to an additional $48,500,000 in 2008 upon its exercise of existing warrants which will continue to fund Sangart's research and development costs and which will be expensed by the Company over time. The Company is unable to predict with certainty when, if ever, it will report operating profits for this segment.         When the Company increases its investment in Sangart, the additional investment is accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method, the price paid is allocated to Sangart's individual assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values; in Sangart's case, a portion of the fair value of assets acquired was initially allocated to research and development. However, since under current GAAP the Company is not permitted to recognize research and development as an asset under the purchase method, any amounts initially allocated to research and development are immediately expensed. The Company expensed acquired research and development of $4,100,000 and $7,500,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which is included in the caption selling, general and other expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The increase in salaries and incentive compensation in 2007 as compared to 2006 was due to increased headcount in connection with the commencement of the Phase III trials, including the need to increase Hemospan production for the clinical trials.  Corporate and Other Operations          Investment and other income decreased in 2007 as compared to the same periods in 2006. Investment and other income during 2006 includes $34,700,000 related to the sales of two associated companies; investment and other income during 2007 includes the receipt of escrowed proceeds from one of those sales of $11,400,000 that had not been previously recognized. In addition, investment and other income for 2006 includes $7,400,000 from the recovery of bankruptcy claims. Interest income also declined by $22,400,000 in 2007 as compared to 2006 principally due to the sale of interest bearing securities to generate cash to purchase Fortescue's securities and interests in associated companies. For 2007, investment and other income includes $8,500,000 related to the termination of a joint development agreement with another party. The amount recorded in other income substantially reimbursed the Company for its prior expenditures, which were fully expensed as incurred. Investment and other income for 2007 also includes $4,200,000 of foreign exchange gains. Investment and other income includes income (charges) of $(1,900,000), $1,200,000 and $1,700,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to the accounting for mark-to-market values of Corporate derivatives.          Investment and other income increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to greater interest income of $54,400,000, reflecting a larger amount of invested assets and higher interest rates, $34,700,000 related to the sales of two associated companies and $7,400,000 from the recovery of bankruptcy claims. Investment and other income in 2005 includes a gain of $10,500,000 on the sale of 70% of the Company's interest in CLC to Inmet.          Net securities gains for Corporate and Other Operations aggregated $95,600,000, $117,200,000 and $208,800,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The Company's net securities gains largely reflect realized gains from the sale of publicly traded debt and equity securities that had been classified as Corporate available for sale securities and unrealized gains on trading securities. Included in net securities gains for 2007 is a gain of $37,800,000 from the sale of Eastman. Included in net securities gains for 2006 is a gain of $37,400,000 from the sale of Level 3 common stock. Included in net securities gains for 2005 is a gain of $146,000,000 from the sale of 375,000 shares of WMIG common stock. Net securities gains for 2007, 2006 and 2005 include provisions of $36,800,000, $12,900,000 and $12,200,000, respectively, to write down the Company's investments in certain available for sale securities and, in 2007, an investment in a non-public security.          The Company's decision to sell securities and realize security gains or losses is generally based on its evaluation of an individual security's value at the time and the prospect for changes in its value in the future. The decision could also be influenced by the status of the Company's tax attributes or liquidity needs; however, sales in recent years have not been influenced by these considerations. Therefore, the timing of realized security gains or losses is not predictable and does not follow any pattern from year to year.                                         42           The increase in interest expense during 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily reflects interest expense relating to the 7 1/8% Senior Notes issued in March 2007, the 8 1/8% Senior Notes issued in September 2007 and the fixed rate repurchase agreements. Interest expense during 2006 also include interest on $21,700,000 principal amount of 7 7/8% Subordinated Notes, which matured in the third quarter of 2006, and interest expense relating to Premier prior to its deconsolidation of $8,000,000. The increase in interest expense during 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily reflects interest expense relating to Premier prior to its deconsolidation and the fixed rate repurchase agreements.          Salaries and incentive compensation expense decreased by $4,900,000 in 2007 as compared to 2006, principally due to a reduction in incentive bonus expense and less share-based compensation expense. Salaries and incentive compensation expense did not significantly change in 2006 as compared to 2005. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R in 2006, the Company recorded share-based compensation expense relating to grants made under the Company's senior executive warrant plan and the fixed stock option plan of $11,200,000 in 2007 and $15,200,000 in 2006. The decrease in share-based compensation expense in 2007 largely related to grants made under the warrant plan in 2006 for which a portion vested upon issuance. This decrease was partially offset by increased expenses in 2007 relating to the stock option plan due to the accelerated vesting of stock options of an officer of the Company who resigned. Salaries and incentive compensation expense for 2006 also reflects lower bonus expense as compared to 2005.          The increase in selling, general and other expenses of $32,900,000 in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily reflects higher professional fees and other costs, which largely relate to analyses of potential and existing investments and projects, and increased legal fees, including those incurred in connection with litigation related to MK Resources. This litigation was settled during 2007, and selling, general and other expenses include a charge of $7,500,000 for that settlement. Selling, general and other expenses related to Energy Projects were $19,700,000, $8,300,000 and $1,600,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.          The increase in selling, general and other expenses of $8,800,000 in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily reflects increased corporate aircraft expenses, higher professional fees and other costs, which largely relate to potential investments and projects and existing investments, and greater employee benefit costs including pension costs relating to WilTel's retained pension plan. In addition, 2005 reflects an impairment loss (described below) for the remaining book value of Olympus Re Holdings, Ltd. ("Olympus") of $3,700,000.          As more fully discussed above, during 2007 and 2005 the Company's revised projections of future taxable income enabled it to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the Company's net deferred tax asset; accordingly, $542,700,000 in 2007 and $1,135,100,000 in 2005 of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense. The Company adjusted the valuation allowance since it believes it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize that portion of the net deferred tax asset. The income tax provision reflects the reversal of tax reserves aggregating $2,300,000 and $8,000,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, as a result of the favorable resolution of various state and federal income tax contingencies.  Associated Companies          Equity in income (losses) of associated companies includes the following for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (in thousands):                                          43                                                           2007                    2006                    2005                                                     ----                    ----                    ----         Pershing Square                                 $  (85,500)               $  --                  $    -- Shortplus                                           54,500                   --                       -- Highland Opportunity                               (17,600)                  --                       -- Wintergreen                                         14,000                  11,000                     500 EagleRock                                          (11,800)                 16,400                 (28,900) Goober Drilling                                     13,600                   2,000                     -- HomeFed                                              1,500                   2,900                   5,800 JPOF II                                              3,000                  26,200                  23,600 JHYH                                                 4,300                    --                       -- Ambrose                                             (1,100)                   --                       -- Union Square                                           --                     --                    72,800 Premier                                            (22,300)                   (300)                    -- Safe Harbor                                          1,800                  (7,600)                    -- CLC                                                  4,000                   3,800                  (1,600) Olympus                                               --                      --                  (120,100) Other                                               10,400                   5,700                   3,500                                                 ----------                --------               ---------     Equity in income (losses) before        income taxes                                (31,200)                 60,100                 (44,400) Income tax (expense) benefit                         9,300                 (22,400)                   (700)                                                 ----------                --------               ---------     Equity in income (losses),        net of taxes                             $  (21,900)               $ 37,700               $ (45,100)                                                 ==========                ========               =========          In June 2007, the Company acquired a 10% limited partnership interest in Pershing Square, a newly-formed private investment partnership whose investment decisions are at the sole discretion of Pershing Square's general partner. The stated objective of Pershing Square is to create capital appreciation by investing in Target Corporation. Losses recorded by Pershing Square principally result from a decline in the market value of Target Corporation's common stock.         Shortplus, Highland Opportunity, Wintergreen, EagleRock, Ambrose and Safe Harbor are investment partnerships or limited liability corporations whose investment decisions are at the sole discretions of their respective general partners or managing members. These entities invest in a variety of debt and equity securities.          The Company owns approximately 30% of HomeFed, a California real estate development company, which it acquired in 2002. The Company's share of HomeFed's reported earnings fluctuates with the level of real estate sales activity at HomeFed's development projects.          In April 2007, the Company and Jefferies expanded and restructured the Company's equity investment in JPOF II, and formed JHYH. The Company contributed $250,000,000 to JHYH along with its investment in JPOF II; the Company is committed to contribute an additional $250,000,000 the timing of which is at the sole discretion of Jefferies. The Company's share of JPOF II's earnings was distributed to the Company shortly after the end of each period.          Union Square, two entities in which the Company had non-controlling equity interests, sold their respective interests in an office complex located on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. during 2005. Including repayment of its mortgage loans at closing, the Company's share of the net proceeds was $73,200,000, and the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $72,300,000.                                          44           The Company accounted for Premier under the equity method of accounting while it was in bankruptcy (September 2006 to August 2007).          The Company's equity in losses from Olympus for 2005 reflects its share of Olympus losses from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Effective January 1, 2006, Olympus received new capital which reduced the Company's equity interest to less than 4%; as a result, the Company no longer applies the equity method of accounting. The book value of the Company's investment in Olympus was written down to zero in 2005.  Discontinued Operations         Healthcare Services          In July 2006, the Company sold Symphony for $107,000,000 and classified its historical operating results as a discontinued operation. After satisfaction of Symphony's outstanding credit agreement by the buyer ($31,700,000 at date of sale) and certain sale related obligations, the Company realized net cash proceeds of $62,300,000. Pre-tax income of Symphony was $200,000 and $3,300,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Gain on disposal of discontinued operations for 2006 includes a pre-tax gain on the sale of Symphony of $53,300,000 ($33,500,000 after tax).         Telecommunications - ATX         In September 2006, the Company sold ATX for $85,700,000 and classified its historical operating results as a discontinued operation. Pre-tax losses of ATX were $1,200,000 and $1,900,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Gain on disposal of discontinued operations for 2006 includes a pre-tax gain on the sale of ATX of $41,600,000 ($26,100,000 after tax).         WilTel         The Company sold WilTel to Level 3 in December 2005, recognized a pre-tax gain on disposal of $243,800,000 ($243,800,000 after tax) and classified its historical operating results as a discontinued operation. The calculation of the gain on sale included: (1) the cash proceeds received from Level 3 of $460,300,000, which was net of estimated working capital adjustments of $25,500,000; (2) the fair value of the Level 3 common shares of $339,300,000, based on the $2.95 per share closing price of Level 3 common stock immediately prior to closing; (3) the amount of the AT&T cash payments that had not been previously accrued prior to closing ($175,900,000); (4) an impairment charge for WilTel's headquarters building of $42,400,000; and (5) the net book value of the net assets sold and estimated expenses and other costs related to the transaction. WilTel's pre-tax income from discontinued operations was $116,000,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005.           Gain on disposal of discontinued operations for 2007 includes a pre-tax gain of $800,000 ($500,000 after tax) from the resolution of a sale-related contingency. Gain on disposal of discontinued operations during 2006 includes $2,400,000 of pre-tax gains ($1,500,000 after tax) principally for the resolution of certain sale-related contingencies and obligations and working capital adjustments.         Real Estate          In May 2005, the Company sold its 716-room Waikiki Beach hotel and related assets for an aggregate purchase price of $107,000,000, before closing costs and other required payments. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $56,600,000 ($56,600,000 after tax), which is reflected in gain on disposal of discontinued operations.                                         45          Other         Gain on disposal of discontinued operations for 2007 includes a pre-tax gain of $4,000,000 ($2,800,000 after tax) related to the collection of additional amounts from the sale of the Company's interest in an Argentine shoe manufacturer in 2005 that had not been previously recognized (collectibility was uncertain). Although there was no material gain or loss on disposal in 2005, results of discontinued operations during 2005 include a pre-tax loss of $4,400,000 related to this investment.         In 2006, the Company sold its gas properties and recorded a pre-tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations of $900,000. Income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2006 includes $2,900,000 of pre-tax losses related to these gas properties; amounts for 2005 were not material.         In 2006, the Company received $3,000,000 from a former insurance subsidiary which, for many years, had been undergoing liquidation proceedings controlled by state insurance regulators. The Company reflected the amount received as a gain on disposal of discontinued operations. For income tax purposes, the payment is treated as a non-taxable distribution paid by a subsidiary; as a result, no tax expense has been recorded.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards         In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB deferred for one year the effective date of SFAS 157 only with respect to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis, and removed certain leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS 157. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements; however, fair value measurements for new assets or liabilities, and fair value measurements for existing nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, may be materially different under SFAS 157.         In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" ("SFAS 159"), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company does not intend to apply the provisions of SFAS 159 to those items addressed by the standard and held as of January 1, 2008. However, for financial instruments and other items addressed by the standard acquired or entered into after January 1, 2008, the Company will make an assessment at such time as to whether to apply the provisions of SFAS 159.         In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141R, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141R") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements" ("SFAS 160"). SFAS 141R will change how business combinations are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. SFAS 160 will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 on its consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. - --------  -----------------------------------------------------------           The following includes "forward-looking statements" that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.           The Company's market risk arises principally from interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and its borrowing activities and equity price risk.           The Company's investment portfolio is primarily classified as available for sale, and consequently, is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in shareholders' equity. Included in the Company's available for sale investment portfolio are fixed income securities, which comprised approximately 35% of the Company's total investment portfolio at December 31, 2007. These fixed income securities are primarily rated "investment grade" or are U.S. governmental agency issued or U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises. The estimated weighted average remaining life of these fixed income securities was approximately 2.4 years at December 31, 2007. The Company's fixed income securities, like all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. At December 31, 2006, fixed income securities comprised approximately 57% of the Company's total investment portfolio and had an estimated weighted average remaining life of 2.5 years.           Also included in the Company's available for sale investment portfolio are equity securities, which are recorded on the balance sheet at an aggregate fair value of $2,198,500,000 (aggregate cost of $533,000,000), and which comprised approximately 58% of the Company's total investment portfolio at December 31, 2007. The majority of this amount consists of two publicly traded securities, the largest of which is the investment in Fortescue common shares, which is carried at fair value of $1,824,700,000. In addition, the Company's investment portfolio includes its investment in ACF, which is carried at fair value of $71,500,000 at December 31, 2007. The Company's investment portfolio also includes its investment in Inmet, which is carried at cost of $78,000,000 at December 31, 2007. Although the Company is currently restricted from selling the Inmet common shares, the investment is subject to price risk. The market value of this investment is $451,800,000 at December 31, 2007. As discussed more fully above in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the Company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis.         At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company's portfolio of trading securities was not material to the total investment portfolio.         The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its long-term fixed interest rate debt. Generally, the fair market value of debt securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall, and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise.           The following table provides information about the Company's financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are primarily sensitive to changes in interest rates. For investment securities and debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates. For the variable rate borrowings, the weighted average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. For securities and liabilities with contractual maturities, the table presents contractual principal cash flows adjusted for the Company's historical experience and prepayments of mortgage-backed securities.                                         47           For additional information, see Notes 6, 12 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
