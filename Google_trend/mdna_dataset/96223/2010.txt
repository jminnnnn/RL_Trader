Item 7 .   Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .    The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the Company’s consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and results of operations.  This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, related footnote disclosures and “Cautionary Statement for Forward-LookingInformation,” which appear elsewhere in this Report.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    General    The Company’s investment portfolio, equity and results of operations can be significantly impacted by the changes in market values of certain securities, particularly during times of increased volatility in security prices.  Changes in the market values of publicly traded available for sale securities are reflected in othercomprehensive income (loss) and equity.  However, changes in the market prices of investments for which the Company has elected the fair value option, declines in the fair values of equity securities that the Company deems to be other than temporary and declines in the fair values of debt securities related to credit losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and equity.  The Company also has non-controlling investments in entities that are engaged in investing and/orsecurities transactions activities that are accounted for on the equity method of accounting (classified as investments in associated companies), for which the Company records its share of the entities’ profits or losses in its consolidated statements of operations.  These entities typically invest in public securities, with changes in market values reflected in their earnings, which increases the Company’s exposure to volatility in the public securities markets.    The Company’s largest publicly traded available for sale equity securities with changes in market values reflected in other comprehensive income (loss) are Fortescue and Inmet.  During the year ended December 31, 2009, the market value of the Company’s investment in the common shares of Fortescue increased from $377,000,000to $1,108,000,000, and the market value of the Company’s investment in Inmet increased from $90,000,000 to $339,100,000.  The market values of the Company’s investments in ACF and Jefferies, for which the fair value option was elected, increased during the year with unrealized gains reflected in operations as a component of income related to associated companies.  During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recognized unrealized gains related to its investments in ACFand Jefferies of $376,500,000 and $469,800,000, respectively.  During 2009, the Company also recorded impairment losses for declines in value of securities deemed to be other than temporary in its consolidated statement of operations of $31,400,000, reflected as a component of net securities gains (losses).    Liquidity     Leucadia National Corporation (the “Parent”) is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock of its direct subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents and other non-controlling investments in debt and equity securities.  The Parent continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existingoperations and investments and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value.  Accordingly, further acquisitions, divestitures, investments and changes in capital structure are possible.  Its principal sources of funds are its available cash resources, liquid investments, public and private capital market transactions, repayment of subsidiary advances, funds distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management and other fees, andborrowings and dividends from its subsidiaries, as well as dispositions of existing businesses and investments.    In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the Company also considers investments classified as current assets and investments classified as non-current assets on the face of its consolidated balance sheet as being generally available to meet its liquidity needs.  Securities classified as current and non-current investmentsare not as liquid as cash and cash equivalents, but they are generally easily convertible into cash within a relatively short period of time.  As of December 31, 2009, the sum of these amounts aggregated $2,367,100,000.  However, since $484,500,000 of this amount is pledged as collateral pursuant to various agreements, represents investments in non-public securities or is held by subsidiaries that are party to agreements that restrict the Company’s ability to use the funds for otherpurposes, the Company does not consider those amounts to be available to meet the Parent’s liquidity needs.  The $1,882,600,000 that is available is comprised of cash and short-term bonds and notes of the U.S. Government and its agencies, U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises and other publicly traded debt and equity securities (including the Fortescue common shares of $1,108,000,000 and the Inmet common shares of $339,100,000).  The Parent’s available liquidity, and the investmentincome realized from the Parent’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is used to meet the Parent company’s short-term recurring cash requirements, which are principally the payment of interest on its debt and corporate overhead expenses.              45           The Parent’s only long-term cash requirement is to make principal payments on its long-term debt ($1,628,700,000 principal outstanding as of December 31, 2009), of which $439,400,000 is due in 2013, $97,600,000 is due in 2014, $500,000,000 is due in 2015, $500,000,000 is due in 2017 and $91,700,000 is due in 2027.  Historically,the Parent has used its available liquidity to make acquisitions of new businesses and other investments, but, except as disclosed in this Report, the timing of any future investments and the cost can not be predicted.    From time to time in the past, the Company has accessed public and private credit markets and raised capital in underwritten bond financings.  The funds raised have been used by the Company for general corporate purposes, including for its existing businesses and new investment opportunities.  However, given the recentilliquidity in the credit markets, if the Company were to try to raise funds through an underwritten bond offering it may be at a higher interest rate than in the past, or with terms that the Company may not find acceptable.  The Company has no current intention to seek additional bond financing, and will rely on its existing liquidity to fund corporate overhead expenses and corporate interest payments and, to fund new investing opportunities, it may also dispose of existing businesses and investments.  TheParent’s senior debt obligations are rated two levels below investment grade by Moody’s Investors Services and one level below investment grade by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings.  Ratings issued by bond rating agencies are subject to change at any time.    In February 2009, the Board of Directors authorized the Company, from time to time, to purchase its outstanding debt securities through cash purchases in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.  Such repurchases, if any, depend upon prevailing market conditions, the Company’s liquidityrequirements and other factors; such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without notice.  During 2009, the Company repurchased $35,600,000 principal amount of its 7% Senior Notes due 2013 and $6,500,000 principal amount of its 8.65% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2027.     During 2009, the Company issued 5,378,606 common shares upon the conversion of $123,529,000 principal amount of the Company’s 3¾% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014, pursuant to privately negotiated transactions to induce conversion.  The number of common shares issued was in accordance with the termsof the notes; however, the Company paid the former noteholders $26,000,000 to induce conversion.  The additional cash payments were recorded as selling, general and other expenses.    In the first quarter of 2009, the Company invested an additional $28,500,000 in Sangart upon the exercise of its remaining warrants, which increased its ownership interest to approximately 92%.  Exercising the warrants resulted in the acquisition of a portion of the noncontrolling interest; accordingly, a reduction to the noncontrollinginterest of $1,900,000 was recorded.  The additional investment along with Sangart’s existing cash resources is expected to provide Sangart with sufficient capital to fund activities into the third quarter of 2010.  Thereafter, significant additional funding will be needed for product development and clinical trial activities prior to regulatory approval and commercial launch; the source of such funding has not as yet been determined.    In April 2009, the Company’s real estate subsidiary, MB1, received several notices of default with respect to nonrecourse indebtedness ($100,500,000 at December 31, 2009) that is collateralized by its real estate project.  Although MB1’s bank loan matured in October 2009, it was not repaid since MB1 did not have sufficientfunds to do so and the Company is under no obligation and has no intention to contribute additional capital to MB1 to pay off the loan.  MB1 received an additional default notice for failure to repay the bank loan but its lenders have not commenced foreclosure proceedings.  The loan has been classified as a current liability as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.    In June 2009, the Company terminated its $100,000,000 bank credit facility; no amounts were outstanding under this facility.    In November 2009, the Company purchased the other 50% equity interest in Keen that it did not own plus a secured note payable to the other equity owner of Keen for aggregate cash consideration of $15,000,000.  When the Company acquired the controlling interest in Keen in November 2009 it became a consolidated subsidiary; priorto that time the investment in Keen was classified as an investment in an associated company.    In December 2009, Berkadia acquired the North American commercial mortgage origination and servicing business of Capmark.  The Company and Berkshire Hathaway each have a 50% equity interest in Berkadia, and each party contributed $217,200,000 of equity capital to fund the acquisition.  In addition, a subsidiary of BerkshireHathaway provided Berkadia with a five-year $1 billion secured credit facility, which was used to purchase outstanding mortgage loans and servicer advances from Capmark.  The credit facility may be used to fund mortgage loans and servicer advances, to purchase mortgage servicing rights and for working capital needs.  The Company has guaranteed Berkadia’s repayment of 50% of the credit facility when due ($580,500,000 was outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2009).    As of December 31, 2009, the Company had acquired approximately 25% of the outstanding common shares of ACF for aggregate cash consideration of $418,600,000.  The Company’s investment in ACF is classified as an investment in an associated company and carried at fair value, which was $639,800,000 at December 31, 2009 marketprices.  As of December 31, 2009, the Company had acquired approximately 29% of the outstanding common shares of Jefferies for cash and common shares of the Company aggregating $794,400,000.  The Company’s investment in Jefferies is classified as an investment in an associated company and carried at fair value, which was $1,152,900,000 at December 31, 2009 market prices.  The Company’s investment in ACF is subject to a standstill agreement which expires in March 2010and its investment in Jefferies is subject to a standstill agreement which expires in April 2010.          46              During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company received distributions totaling $11,300,000 and $44,900,000, respectively, from its subsidiary, Empire Insurance Company (“Empire”), which has been undergoing a voluntary liquidation since 2001.  The Company had classified Empire as a discontinued operationin 2001 and fully wrote-off its remaining book value based on its expected future cash flows at that time.  Although Empire no longer writes any insurance business, its orderly liquidation over the years has resulted in reductions to its estimated claim reserves that enabled Empire to pay the distributions, with the approval of the New York Insurance Department.  Since future distributions from Empire, if any, are subject to New York insurance law or the approval of the New York Insurance Department,income will only be recognized when received.    In February 2010, the Company sold 30,000,000 common shares of Fortescue for net cash proceeds of $121,500,000, which will result in the recognition of a net securities gain of $94,900,000 in the first quarter of 2010.    In March 2007, the Board of Directors increased the number of the Company’s common shares that the Company is authorized to purchase.  Such purchases may be made from time to time in the open market, through block trades or otherwise.  Depending on market conditions and other factors, such purchases may be commencedor suspended at any time without notice.  During the three year period ended December 31, 2009, the only common shares acquired by the Company were in connection with the exercise of stock options.  As of February 16, 2010, the Company is authorized to repurchase 11,992,829 common shares.    The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have substantial NOLs and other tax attributes.  The amount and availability of the NOLs and other tax attributes are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties.  In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitationson the use of the NOLs, the Company’s certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from acquiring ownership (including through attribution under the tax law) of five percent or more of the common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning five percent or more of the common shares from acquiring additional common shares.  The restrictions will remain in effect until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2024, (b) the repealof Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any comparable successor provision) or (c) the beginning of a taxable year of the Company to which certain tax benefits may no longer be carried forward.  For more information about the NOLs and other tax attributes, see Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows    As discussed above, the Company relies on the Parent’s available liquidity to meet its short-term and long-term needs, and to make acquisitions of new businesses and investments.  Except as otherwise disclosed herein, the Company’s operating businesses do not generally require material funds from the Parent to supporttheir operating activities, and the Parent does not depend on positive cash flow from its operating segments to meet its liquidity needs.  The components of the Company’s operating businesses and investments change frequently as a result of acquisitions or divestitures, the timing of which is impossible to predict but which often have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows in any one period.  Further, the timing and amounts of distributions fromcertain of the Company’s investments in partnerships accounted for under the equity method are generally outside the control of the Company.  As a result, reported cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities do not generally follow any particular pattern or trend, and reported results in the most recent period should not be expected to recur in any subsequent period.          47            Net cash of $133,400,000 was used for operating activities in 2009 as compared to $8,800,000 of net cash provided by operating activities in 2008.  The change in operating cash flows reflects decreased funds generated from activity in the trading portfolio and decreased distributions of earnings from associated companies.  STiPrepaid’s telecommunications operations generated funds from operating activities of $3,400,000 during 2009 as compared to $5,900,000 generated during 2008.  The funds used by the Company’s property management and services segment during 2009 were not material and were $7,800,000 during 2008, primarily reflecting reduced receivables; Premier generated funds of $21,900,000 and $13,300,000 during 2009 and 2008, respectively, primarily reflecting increased operating results; Keen used fundsof $5,400,000 during the period from acquisition through December 31, 2009; and the Company’s manufacturing segments generated funds from operating activities of $30,300,000 and $36,900,000 in 2009 and 2008, respectively, primarily reflecting decreased operating results.  Funds used by Sangart, a development stage company, decreased to $20,300,000 during 2009 from $35,000,000 during 2008.  In 2009, distributions from associated companies principally include earnings distributed by HFHShortPLUS Fund, L.P. (“Shortplus”) ($14,500,000), Keen ($8,400,000) and Garcadia ($11,100,000).  Funds provided by operating activities include $11,300,000 and $44,900,000 in 2009 and 2008, respectively, from funds distributed by Empire, a discontinued operation.  In 2008, distributions from associated companies principally include earnings distributed by Shortplus ($50,000,000), JHYH ($4,300,000), Jefferies ($5,500,000), Keen ($16,100,000) and Garcadia ($10,300,000).    Net cash of $8,800,000 was provided by operating activities in 2008 as compared to $18,400,000 of net cash used for operating activities in 2007.  The change reflects increased funds generated from the trading portfolio, increased distributions of earnings from associated companies and a use of funds for increased interest expensepayments.  Funds used for operating activities during 2008 include the results of companies acquired during 2007, STi Prepaid and ResortQuest, and the results of Premier following its reconsolidation in the third quarter of 2007.  STi Prepaid’s telecommunications operations generated funds from operating activities of $5,900,000 and $26,700,000 during the 2008 and 2007, respectively, the Company’s property management and services segment used funds of $7,800,000 in 2008 and generatedfunds from operating activities of $4,000,000 in 2007, Premier generated funds of $13,300,000 in 2008 and used funds of $30,100,000 in 2007 and the Company’s manufacturing segments generated funds of $36,900,000 and $30,400,000 in 2008 and 2007, respectively.  The decrease in funds generated by STi Prepaid principally reflects reduced operating profits and additional investments in net working capital of acquired businesses.  The reduction in Premier’s use of funds principallyreflects cash used in 2007 for bankruptcy and reconstruction related items.  The decrease in operating cash flows at the property management and services segment principally results from the net change in restricted cash at ResortQuest.  Funds used by Sangart increased to $35,000,000 during 2008 from $24,800,000 during 2007.  Funds provided by operating activities in 2008 also include $44,900,000 of funds distributed by Empire.  In 2007, distributions from associated companiesprincipally include earnings distributed by JPOF II ($29,200,000), EagleRock Capital Partners (QP), LP (“EagleRock”) ($15,000,000) and Garcadia ($6,700,000).    Net cash of $72,000,000 was provided by investing activities in 2009 as compared to net cash flows used for investing activities of $403,000,000 in 2008 and $957,400,000 in 2007.  During 2008, funds used for acquisitions of and capital expenditures for real estate investments principally relate to the Myrtle Beach project ($67,000,000),land used by certain Garcadia dealerships ($20,400,000) and the real estate development projects in Maine ($7,500,000).  During 2007, funds provided by the disposal of real estate, property and equipment and other assets include the sale of the former headquarters building of WilTel Communications Group, LLC (“WilTel”) for $53,500,000.  WilTel was sold in 2005 but the headquarters building was not included in the sale.  During 2008, acquisitions, net of cash acquiredprincipally include an acquisition by the wineries ($19,200,000) and various small acquisitions by STi Prepaid.  During 2007, acquisitions, net of cash acquired principally include assets acquired by STi Prepaid from Telco ($85,400,000) and ResortQuest ($9,700,000) and cash acquired upon the reconsolidation of Premier ($17,300,000).  During 2007, the change in restricted cash principally results from the $56,500,000 escrow deposit made in connection with the Panama City real estate project.          48            Investments in associated companies include CLC ($43,300,000), ACF ($13,300,000) and Berkadia ($217,200,000) in 2009, Jefferies ($396,100,000), ACF ($335,200,000), IFIS Limited (“IFIS”) ($83,900,000), CLC ($56,700,000) and Garcadia ($34,000,000) in 2008, JHYH ($250,000,000), Pershing Square ($200,000,000), Keen ($108,000,000),RCG Ambrose, L.P. (“Ambrose”) ($75,000,000), Highland Opportunity Fund, L.P. (“Highland Opportunity”) ($74,000,000), Shortplus ($25,000,000), CLC ($53,500,000) and Premier ($160,500,000) in 2007.  Capital distributions from associated companies include Keen ($28,300,000), Wintergreen Partners Fund, L.P. (“Wintergreen”) ($39,000,000), Shortplus  ($24,900,000) and Starboard Value Opportunity Partners, LP ($11,500,000) in 2009, Safe Harbor Domestic PartnersL.P. (“Safe Harbor”) ($19,300,000), Keen ($36,000,000), Highland Opportunity ($40,000,000), Ambrose ($72,900,000) and EagleRock ($12,500,000) in 2008 and Keen ($33,200,000) and Safe Harbor ($25,000,000) in 2007.    Net cash of $21,900,000 was used for financing activities in 2009 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $174,800,000 in 2008 and $1,145,500,000 in 2007.  Issuance of long-term debt for 2009 and 2008 primarily reflects the increase in repurchase agreements (discussed below) of $47,500,000 and $26,100,000,respectively, and $2,600,000 and $62,400,000, respectively, for MB1’s debt obligation.  During 2007, issuance of debt, net of expenses, includes $500,000,000 principal amount of 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $500,000,000 principal amount of 8 1/8% Senior Notes.  Reduction of debt for 2009 includes $29,600,000 for the buyback of $35,600,000 principal amount of the 7% Senior Notes and $5,800,000 for the buyback of $6,500,000 principal amount of the 8.65% Junior Subordinated Deferrable InterestDebentures.  Reduction of debt in 2008 includes the termination of a capital lease obligation upon the Company’s exercise of its right to purchase corporate aircraft secured by a capital lease ($8,200,000).  The reduction of debt during 2007 principally relates to the repurchase agreements.  Issuance of common shares for 2008 principally reflects cash consideration received on the sale of common shares to Jefferies.  Issuance of common shares for 2007 principallyreflects the issuance and sale of 5,500,000 of the Company’s common shares.  In addition, issuance of common shares reflects the exercise of employee stock options for all periods.    Debt due within one year includes $198,600,000 and $151,100,000 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, relating to repurchase agreements of one of the Company’s subsidiaries.  These fixed rate repurchase agreements have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 0.3%, mature in January 2010 and are securedby non-current investments with a carrying value of $210,400,000 at December 31, 2009.  Debt due within one year also includes $100,500,000 related to MB1’s debt obligation, discussed above.      During 2001, a subsidiary of the Company borrowed $53,100,000 secured by certain of its corporate aircraft, of which $35,000,000 is currently outstanding.  The Parent company has guaranteed this financing.     The Company’s senior note indentures contain covenants that restrict its ability to incur more Indebtedness or issue Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries unless, at the time of such incurrence or issuance, the Company meets a specified ratio of Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Tangible Net Worth, limit the ability of the Company andMaterial Subsidiaries to incur, in certain circumstances, Liens, limit the ability of Material Subsidiaries to incur Funded Debt in certain circumstances, and contain other terms and restrictions all as defined in the senior note indentures.  The Company has the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness or make distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions.  If the Company is unable to meet the specified ratio, the Company would not beable to issue additional Indebtedness or Preferred Stock, but the Company’s inability to meet the applicable ratio would not result in a default under its senior note indentures.  Certain of the debt instruments of subsidiaries of the Company require that collateral be provided to the lender; principally as a result of such requirements, the assets of subsidiaries which are subject to limitations on transfer of funds to the Company were approximately $328,600,000 at December 31, 2009.  Formore information, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.          49              As shown below, at December 31, 2009, the Company’s contractual cash obligations totaled $2,999,810,000.                Payments Due by Period (in thousands)         Contractual Cash Obligations      Total         Less than 1  Year           1-3 Years         4-5 Years         After 5 Years                                                       Debt, including current maturities     $  1,976,699        $  312,592        $  34,249        $  538,132        $  1,091,726      Estimated interest expense on debt        759,532           123,735           239,578           193,253           202,966      Estimated payments related to derivative                                                               financial instruments        2,613           2,082           531           –           –      Planned funding of pension and                                                               postretirement obligations        69,457           16,820           52,098           182           357      Operating leases, net of  sublease income        144,082           13,745           25,556           20,433           84,348      Asset purchase obligations        20,901           16,630           1,978           1,606           687      Other        26,526           1,767           3,009           3,000           18,750                                                                      Total Contractual Cash Obligations     $  2,999,810        $  487,371        $  356,999        $  756,606        $  1,398,834       The estimated interest expense on debt includes interest related to variable rate debt which the Company determined using rates in effect at December 31, 2009.  Estimated payments related to a currency swap agreement are based on the currency rate in effect at December 31, 2009.  Amounts related to the Company’sconsolidated pension liability ($68,200,000) are included in the table in the less than 1 year period ($16,500,000) and the remainder in the 1-3 year period; however, the exact timing of those cash payments is uncertain.  The above amounts do not include liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as the timing of payments, if any, is uncertain.  Such amounts aggregated $9,600,000 at December 31, 2009; for more information, see Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    The Company maintained defined benefit pension plans covering certain operating units prior to 1999, and WilTel also maintained defined benefit pension plans that were not transferred in connection with the sale of WilTel.  At December 31, 2009, the Company had recorded a liability of $68,200,000 on its consolidated balance sheetfor its unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligations.  This amount represents the difference between the present value of amounts owed to current and former employees (referred to as the projected benefit obligation) and the market value of plan assets set aside in segregated trust accounts.  Since the benefits in these plans have been frozen, future changes to the unfunded benefit obligation are expected to principally result from benefit payments, changes in the market value of plan assets,differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience and interest rates.    The Company is in the process of seeking approval from various government entities to terminate the Company’s (not WilTel’s) frozen defined benefit pension plan; the Company anticipates it will terminate this plan in the fourth quarter of 2010.  If terminated, the Company expects it will have to contribute an additional$10,500,000 to the plan.  The Company also expects to make substantial contributions to the segregated trust account for the WilTel defined benefit pension plan in the future to reduce its plan liabilities and reduce administrative and insurance costs associated with the plan.  The Company expects to contribute $6,000,000 to WilTel’s defined benefit pension plan in 2010.  The tax deductibility of these contributions is not a primary consideration, principally due to the availabilityof the Company’s NOLs to otherwise reduce taxable income.  Other than these aggregate $16,500,000 expected 2010 contributions, the timing and amount of additional contributions are uncertain.    As of December 31, 2009, certain amounts for these plans are reflected separately in the table below (dollars in thousands):          50                         The Company’s  Plan         WilTel’s  Plan                            Projected benefit obligation     $  51,157        $  184,689      Funded status – balance sheet liability at December 31, 2009        9,189           59,005      Deferred losses included in other comprehensive income (loss)        17,075           46,887      Discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation        4.35  %        6.00  %    Calculations of pension expense and projected benefit obligations are prepared by actuaries based on assumptions provided by management.  These assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis, including assumptions about discount rates, interest credit rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets.  For theCompany’s plan, a discount rate was selected to result in an estimated projected benefit obligation on a plan termination basis, using current rates for annuity settlements and lump sum payments weighted for the assumed elections of participants.  For the WilTel plan, the timing of expected future benefit payments was used in conjunction with the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve to develop a discount rate that is representative of the high quality corporate bond market.    These discount rates will be used to determine pension expense in 2010.  Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.25% change in these discount rates would affect aggregate pension expense by $500,000 and the aggregate benefit obligation by $8,000,000.    The deferred losses in other comprehensive income (loss) primarily result from differences between the actual and assumed return on plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions, including changes in discount rates and changes in interest credit rates.  Deferred losses are amortized to expense if they exceed 10% of the greaterof the projected benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year; such amount aggregated $27,800,000 at December 31, 2009 for all plans.  A portion of these excess deferred losses will be amortized to expense during 2010 based on an amortization period of twelve years.    The assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets are based on the investment objectives of the specific plan, which are more fully discussed in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Prior to 2008, differences between the actual and expected rates of return on plan assets have not been material.  During2008, the fair value of the WilTel plan assets declined significantly due to the decline in securities markets worldwide.  This decline is the reason for the significant increase in the balance sheet liability for the WilTel plan during 2008.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    At December 31, 2009, the Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees and letters of credit aggregating $387,500,000.  Pursuant to an agreement that was entered into before the Company sold CDS Holding Corporation ("CDS") to HomeFed in 2002, the Company agreed to provide project improvement bonds forthe San Elijo Hills project.  These bonds, which are for the benefit of the City of San Marcos, California and other government agencies, are required prior to the commencement of any development at the project.  CDS is responsible for paying all third party fees related to obtaining the bonds.  Should the City or others draw on the bonds for any reason, CDS and one of its subsidiaries would be obligated to reimburse the Company for the amount drawn.  At December 31, 2009,the amount of outstanding bonds was $5,000,000, almost all of which expires in 2010.  Subsidiaries of the Company have outstanding letters of credit aggregating $20,200,000 at December 31, 2009, principally to secure various obligations.  Substantially all of these letters of credit expire before 2012.          51            As discussed above, the Company has also guaranteed 30% of the amounts outstanding under CLC’s intercompany loan from Inmet.  At December 31, 2009, $240,100,000 was outstanding under the intercompany loan; accordingly, the Company’s outstanding guaranty at that date was $72,000,000.    As discussed above the Company has also guaranteed Berkadia’s repayment of 50% of the five-year credit facility issued by a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway.  At December 31, 2009, the amount outstanding under the facility was $580,500,000; accordingly, the Company’s outstanding guaranty at that date was $290,300,000.    Critical Accounting Estimates    The Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reportedamounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions.  The following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements, and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect, at a specific point in time, events whose ultimate outcomewon’t be known until a later date.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.    Income Taxes –  At December 31, 2009, the Company’s valuation allowance for its net deferred tax asset fully reserved for all of the potential future tax savings from federal NOLs and for a substantial portion of its state NOLs.  In accordance with GAAP, theCompany records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.  The amount of any valuation allowance recorded does not in any way adversely affect the Company’s ability to use its NOLs to offset taxable income in the future.  If in the future the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to realize its net deferred tax asset in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustmentto increase the net deferred tax asset would increase income in such period.  If in the future the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net recorded deferred tax asset, an adjustment to decrease the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in such period.  The Company is required to consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, and to weight the evidence when determining whether a valuation allowance is required.  Generally,greater weight is required to be placed on objectively verifiable evidence when making this assessment, in particular on recent historical operating results.    During the second half of 2008 the Company recorded significant unrealized losses on many of its largest investments, recognized other than temporary impairments for a number of other investments and reported reduced profitability from substantially all of its operating businesses, all of which contributed to the recognition of a pre-taxloss of $859,500,000 in the consolidated statement of operations and a pre-tax loss in other comprehensive income (loss) of $1,579,200,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008.  The worldwide economic downturn has adversely affected many of the Company’s operating businesses and investments, and the nature of the current economic difficulties make it impossible to reliably project how long the downturn will last. Additionally, the 2008 losses recognized by the Company resulted in a cumulativeloss in total comprehensive income (loss) during the three year period ending December 31, 2008.  In assessing the realizability of the net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2008, the Company concluded that its recent operating loss and the then current economic conditions worldwide be given more weight than its projections of future taxable income during the period that it has NOLs available (until 2030), and be given more weight than the Company’s long track record of generating taxable income.  Asa result, the Company concluded that a valuation allowance was required against substantially all of the net deferred tax asset, and increased its valuation allowance in 2008 by $1,672,100,000 with a corresponding charge to income tax expense.          52            Prior to 2008, the Company’s long track record of generating taxable income, its cumulative taxable income for the then recent prior periods and its projections of future taxable income were the most heavily weighted factors considered when determining how much of the net deferred tax asset was more likely than not to be realizable.  Asa result, during 2005 the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that it would have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the Company’s net deferred tax asset; accordingly, $1,135,100,000 of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense.  An additional $542,700,000 of the valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense in 2007.  The Company’s estimate of future taxable income considered allavailable evidence, both positive and negative, about its operating businesses and investments, included an aggregation of individual projections for each material operating business and investment, estimated apportionment factors for state and local taxing jurisdictions and included all future years that the Company estimated it would have available NOLs.    The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of its net deferred tax asset in future periods.  However, before the Company would reverse any portion of its valuation allowance in excess of taxes recorded on reported income, it will need positive evidence that it has historical positive cumulative taxable income overa period of time which is likely to continue in future periods.  At that time, any decrease to the valuation allowance would be based upon the Company’s projections of future taxable income, which are inherently uncertain.    The Company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities based on the Company’s assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining its tax filing positions.    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets -  The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management’s judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.  When testing for impairment,the Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group).  The determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on management’s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value.  If the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than theundiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.    One of the Company’s real estate subsidiaries (MB1) is the owner and developer of a mixed use real estate project located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  The project is comprised of a retail center with approximately 346,000 square feet of retail space, 41,000 square feet of office space and 195 residential apartmentrental units.  The retail center is approximately 90% leased and the office space is approximately 25% leased.  Certain of the apartment units are allocated for long-term rental (114 units) and are substantially leased; the remaining apartment units are marketed as vacation rentals.  The acquisition and construction costs were funded by capital contributed by the Company and nonrecourse indebtedness with a balance of $100,500,000 at December 31, 2009, that is collateralized by thereal estate.  If MB1 is unable to make debt service or principal payments on the loan the Company is under no obligation to make those payments.          53            Current economic conditions have adversely impacted the majority of the retail tenants at the retail center.  Over 20 retail tenants have requested reductions in rent payments, some of which have been granted; certain other tenants are not paying the full amount of rent due while their leases are being renegotiated.  Duringthe second quarter of 2009, MB1 was unable to make scheduled payments under its interest rate swap agreement and received several default notices under its bank loan.  These events constituted a change in circumstances that caused the Company to evaluate whether the carrying amount of MB1’s real estate asset was recoverable.  Based on the assumptions discussed below the Company concluded that the carrying amount was not recoverable; accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment chargeof $67,800,000, (classified as selling, general and other expenses) which reduced the carrying amount of MB1’s real estate to its fair value of $71,300,000 at June 30, 2009.    The Company prepared cash flow models and utilized a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of MB1’s real estate.  Although the retail center has a remaining useful life of 38 years, the Company prepared cash flow models assuming it would operate the retail center over periods of 7, 10 or 20 yearsand then sell the retail center at the end of those periods.  The most significant assumptions in the Company’s cash flow models were the discount rate (11%) and the capitalization rate used to estimate the selling price of the retail center (9%); these rates were selected based on published reports of market conditions for similar properties.  The Company assumed that requested reductions in rent would continue through 2012 before returning to pre-abatement levels.  Projectednet cash flow before debt service included assumptions for vacancies, rent renewal rates, expense increases and allowances for tenant improvements for new tenants.  The Company also prepared an additional model that assumed the bank lenders foreclose on their loan and take title to MB1’s real estate.  Although the Company would not receive any cash flow in the event the lenders foreclose on the mortgaged property, since the Company’s debt obligation of $100,500,000 is without recourseto the Company, the impairment loss would be limited to the excess, if any, of the book value of the real estate over the debt obligation.  The Company calculated the fair value of MB1’s real estate by probability-weighting the present values of the various possible outcomes.    The cash flow projections assume some recovery in the local and national economy over the next few years.  If economic conditions do not improve and the bank lenders do not foreclose, it is possible that MB1 will have to continue to provide rent reductions for its properties which could result in further impairment chargesto the carrying value of the real estate.  Although MB1’s bank loan matured in October 2009, it was not repaid since MB1 did not have sufficient funds and the Company is under no obligation and has no intention to provide the funds to MB1 to pay off the loan.  MB1 received an additional default notice for failure to repay the bank loan but its lenders have not commenced foreclosure proceedings.  If MB1’s bank lenders foreclose in the future, the Company would record again equal to the excess of the loan balance over the then book value of the real estate.  At December 31, 2009, the carrying value of MB1’s real estate was $69,400,000.    In addition to the MB1 impairment, during 2009 the Company recorded impairment losses on long-lived assets aggregating $6,200,000, classified as selling, general and other expenses.  Of this amount, $2,600,000 related to its manufacturing segment (primarily Idaho Timber) and $3,600,000 related to its real estate segment.  During2009, Idaho Timber discontinued remanufacturing of dimension lumber and experienced declining sales of certain specialty wood products at one of its plants, and as a result decided to close the plant.  Idaho Timber evaluated for impairment the plant’s long-lived assets, comprised of buildings, machinery and equipment, and customer relationships intangibles.  The carrying values of long-lived assets held and used and intangible assets were written down to their fair values, determinedusing the present value of expected future cash flows.  The Company wrote down certain real estate properties that are held for sale for which the fair values were primarily based on appraisals or prices for similar assets.  The Company also wrote down a real estate property that under GAAP is considered to be held and used, but which the Company has recently decided to sell.  The Company wrote down this real estate property to fair value primarily using market information for similarassets.          54              During 2008, the Company recorded impairment losses on long-lived assets aggregating $3,200,000, of which $800,000 related to its gaming entertainment segment, $1,300,000 related to its real estate segment and $1,100,000 related to its other operations segment.  There were no impairment losses recorded during 2007.    Current economic conditions have adversely affected most of the Company’s operations and investments.  A worsening of current economic conditions or a prolonged recession could cause a decline in estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the Company’s operations and investments.  If futureundiscounted cash flows are estimated to be less than the carrying amounts of the asset groups used to generate those cash flows in subsequent reporting periods, particularly for those with large investments in property and equipment (for example, manufacturing, gaming entertainment, land based oil and gas drilling operations, real estate and certain associated company investments), impairment charges would have to be recorded.    Impairment of Securities -  Declines in the fair values of equity securities considered to be other than temporary and declines in the fair values of debt securities related to credit losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.  The Company evaluatesits investments for impairment on a quarterly basis.    The Company’s determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information; GAAP requires the exercise of judgment in making this assessment, rather than the application of fixed mathematical criteria.  The various factors that the Company considersin making its determination are specific to each investment.  For publicly traded debt and equity securities, the Company considers a number of factors including, but not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, the reason for the decline in fair value, changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date, the ability and intent to hold investments to maturity, and other factorsspecific to the individual investment.  For investments in private equity funds and non-public securities, the Company bases its determination upon financial statements, net asset values and/or other information obtained from fund managers or investee companies.    The Company has a portfolio of non-agency mortgage-backed bond securitizations, which were acquired at significant discounts to face amounts and are accounted for as acquisitions of impaired loans.  The Company estimates the future cash flows for these securities to determine the accretable yield; increases in estimated cashflows are accounted for as a yield adjustment on a prospective basis but decreases in estimated cash flows below amortized cost due to credit losses are recognized as impairments in the consolidated statements of operations.  Contractual cash flows in excess of estimated cash flows are not part of the accretable yield.  The market for these securities is highly illiquid and they rarely trade.  On a regular basis, the Company re-estimates the future cash flows of these securitiesand records impairment charges if appropriate.  The fair values for these securities are primarily determined using an income valuation model to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows, which incorporates assumptions regarding potential future rates of delinquency, prepayments, defaults, collateral losses and interest rates.          55            The Company recorded the following impairment charges for securities in the consolidated statement of operations for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 (in thousands):               2009         2008         2007                                     Publicly traded securities     $  14,400        $  99,600        $  1,800      Non-public securities and private equity funds        2,200           29,700           35,000      Non-agency mortgage-backed bond securitizations        14,800           14,100            –         Totals     $  31,400        $  143,400        $  36,800       Impairment of Equity Method Investments –  The Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment when operating losses or other factors may indicate a decrease in value which is other than temporary.  For investments in investment partnerships that are accountedfor under the equity method, the Company obtains from the investment partnership financial statements, net asset values and other information on a quarterly basis and annual audited financial statements.  On a quarterly basis, the Company also makes inquiries and discusses with investment managers whether there were significant procedural, valuation, composition and other changes at the investee.  Since these investment partnerships record their underlying investments at fair value, afterapplication of the equity method the carrying value of the Company’s investment is equal to its share of the investees’ underlying net assets at their fair values.  Absent any unusual circumstances or restrictions concerning these investments, which would be separately evaluated, it is unlikely that any additional impairment charge would be required.    For equity method investments in operating businesses, the Company considers a variety of factors including economic conditions nationally and in their geographic areas of operation, adverse changes in the industry in which they operate, declines in business prospects, deterioration in earnings, increasing costs of operations and otherrelevant factors specific to the investee.  Whenever the Company believes conditions or events indicate that one of these investments might be materially impaired, the Company will obtain from such investee updated cash flow projections and impairment analyses of the investee assets.  The Company will use this information and, together with discussions with the investee’s management, evaluate if the book value of its investment exceeds its fair value, and if so and the situation is deemedother than temporary, record an impairment charge.    During the second quarter of 2009, the Company’s equity in losses of Garcadia included impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets aggregating $32,300,000. Garcadia’s automobile dealerships have been adversely impacted by general economic conditions, and the bankruptcy filings by two of the three largest U.S.automobile manufacturers was a change in circumstances that caused Garcadia to evaluate the recoverability of its goodwill and other intangible assets.  Garcadia prepared discounted cash flow projections for each of its dealerships and concluded that the carrying amount of its goodwill and other intangible assets was impaired.  Garcadia’s cash flow projections assume that new car sales at their foreign car dealerships remain flat with 2009 sale levels through 2011 and project growththereafter.  Cash flow projections at dealerships that sell domestic cars are projected to continue to decline through 2012 or 2013 with projected growth thereafter.  None of Garcadia’s automobile dealerships are currently expected to close as a result of the restructuring of the U.S. automobile manufacturers.  However, if new vehicle sales at Garcadia’s automobile dealerships are less than projected amounts or dealerships are closed, further impairment charges are likely.          56            During 2008, the Company’s equity in losses of IFIS includes impairment charges of $63,300,000.  IFIS is a private Argentine company that owns a variety of investments, and its largest investment is ownership of common shares of Cresud Sociedad Anonima Comercial, Inmobiliaria, Financiera y Agropecuaria (“Cresud”),an agricultural company primarily based in Argentina.  As a result of significant declines in quoted market prices for Cresud and other investments of IFIS, combined with declines in worldwide food commodity prices, the global mortgage and real estate crisis and political and financial conditions in Argentina, the Company determined that its investment in IFIS was impaired.  The fair value of the Company’s investment in IFIS was principally determined using quoted market prices of IFIS’sinvestments.  In January 2009, IFIS raised a significant amount of new equity in a rights offering in which the Company did not participate.  As a result, the Company’s ownership interest in IFIS was reduced to 8% and the Company no longer applies the equity method of accounting for this investment.  At December 31, 2009, the Company’s investment in IFIS was classified as a non-current investment.    Business Combinations -  At acquisition, the Company allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values.  Significant judgments and estimates are often made to determinethese values, and may include the use of appraisals, consider market quotes for similar transactions, employ discounted cash flow techniques or consider other information the Company believes to be relevant.  The finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete, and if final values are materially different from initially recorded amounts adjustments are recorded.  Any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair values of the netassets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill, which is not amortized to expense.  Recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis, and between annual testing dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value.  At December 31, 2009, the book value of goodwill was $9,300,000.  If the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquiredare greater than the purchase price, the excess is treated as a bargain purchase and recognized in income.    Subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation, any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.  Once final, the Company is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price, even ifsubsequent events or circumstances prove the Company’s original judgments and estimates to be incorrect.  In addition, long-lived assets recorded in a business combination like property and equipment, amortizable intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss.  The assumptions and judgments made by the Company when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many yearsinto the future.    During 2006, the Company acquired a 30% limited liability company interest in Keen for aggregate consideration of $60,000,000, excluding expenses, and agreed to lend to Keen, on a senior secured basis, up to $126,000,000 to finance new rig equipment purchases and construction costs and to repay existing debt.  During 2007, theCompany increased its equity interest to 50% for additional payments aggregating $45,000,000.  In addition, the credit facility was amended to increase the borrowing capacity to $138,500,000, and the Company provided Keen with two additional secured credit facilities aggregating $60,000,000.  When the Company increased its investment in Keen to 50%, the terms of the limited liability agreement were amended to provide that in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or termination of Keen, availablecash or assets would first be used to pay all of Keen’s debts (including loans made by the Company), then distributed to the Company as a liquidation preference until it had received a return of its equity investment ($105,000,000), before any payments were made to the other equity owner of Keen.          57            During 2009, the Company believes it became apparent to the other equity owner of Keen that Keen would not be able to make scheduled debt payments to the Company, and that the resulting payment default could result in a liquidation of Keen.  In that event, the Company’s liquidation preference over equity distributions wouldresult in very little, if any, distributions to the other equity owner of Keen.  In November 2009, the Company purchased the other 50% equity interest that it did not own plus a secured note payable to the other equity owner of Keen for aggregate cash consideration of $15,000,000.  The Company believes it was able to acquire the remaining 50% equity interest at this distressed price because of the expected payment default on Keen’s senior secured debt owed to the Company and the Company’s$105,000,000 preferred equity distribution in the event Keen was liquidated.    When the Company acquired the controlling interest in Keen in November 2009 it became a consolidated subsidiary; prior to that time the investment in Keen was classified as an investment in an associated company.  Under GAAP, upon consolidation the Company was required to record Keen’s assets and liabilities at fair value,and was required to adjust the carrying value of the Company’s equity investment immediately prior to the acquisition to fair value.  Due to the unique circumstances surrounding the Company’s 2009 acquisition described above, the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the amount paid by $49,300,000; the bargain purchase was recognized as a gain on the date of acquisition and included in investment and other income.  However, the fair value of the Company’s equityinterest immediately prior to the acquisition was less than its carrying value ($85,900,000); accordingly the Company included a charge of $36,500,000 in income (losses) related to associated companies to write down the pre-acquisition carrying value of its investment in Keen to fair value.    As of the date of acquisition, Keen’s assets principally consisted of cash and other current assets and property and equipment.  The Company engaged an independent valuation and appraisal firm to assist in its determination of the fair value of Keen’s property and equipment, identifiable intangible assets, if any,and corresponding equity value; the fair values of cash and working capital were $20,700,000, property and equipment were $221,200,000 and Keen’s other assets and liabilities were not material.  The methods used to determine the fair values included estimating Keen’s business enterprise value, utilizing both discounted cash flow and market comparable based approaches.  Property and equipment asset valuations included an analysis of depreciated replacement cost and current marketprices.  The Company considered several factors to determine the fair value of property and equipment, including local market conditions, recent market transactions, the size, age, condition, utility and character of the property, the estimated cost to acquire replacement property, an estimate of depreciation from use and functional obsolescence and the remaining expected useful life of the assets.  Excluding intercompany loans, Keen’s liabilities principally consisted of trade payableswhich were recorded at face value.    The most significant estimate made in recording the acquisition of Keen was the amount recorded for property and equipment, principally drilling rigs and related equipment.  During 2009, Keen’s revenue volume and profitability were adversely affected by the expiration of term contracts during a time of low gas prices,high levels of natural gas in storage and generally adverse economic conditions that have reduced the drilling activity of Keen’s customers.  If these trends continue and Keen’s revenues remain depressed, it is possible that the fair values of Keen’s property and equipment may decline, resulting in the recording of impairment charges in the future.    Use of Fair Value Estimates -  Under GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Further, a fair value hierarchy prioritizesinputs to valuation techniques into three broad levels.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), the next priority to inputs that don’t qualify as Level 1 inputs but are nonetheless observable, either directly or indirectly, for the particular asset or liability (Level 2), and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).          58              Over 90% of the Company’s investment portfolio is classified as available for sale securities, which are carried at estimated fair value in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.  The estimated fair values are principally based on publicly quoted market prices (Level 1 inputs), which can rise or fall in reactionto a wide variety of factors or events, and as such are subject to market-related risks and uncertainties.  The Company has a segregated portfolio of mortgage pass-through certificates issued by U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises (FHLMC or FNMA), which are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value of $358,200,000 at December 31, 2009.  Although the markets that these types of securities trade in are generally active, market prices are not always available for the identicalsecurity.  The fair value of these investments are based on observable market data including benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids and offers.  These estimates of fair value are considered to be Level 2 inputs, and the amounts realized from the disposition of these investments has not been materially different from their estimated fair values.    The fair values of the Company’s portfolio of non-agency mortgage-backed bond securitizations, which are primarily determined using an income valuation model to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows, are considered to be Level 3 inputs.    Contingencies  - The Company accrues for contingent losses when the contingent loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  Estimates of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred and of contingent loss amounts normally require significant judgmentby management, can be highly subjective and are subject to material change with the passage of time as more information becomes available.  Estimating the ultimate impact of litigation matters is inherently uncertain, in particular because the ultimate outcome will rest on events and decisions of others that may not be within the power of the Company to control.  The Company does not believe that any of its current litigation will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financialposition, results of operations or liquidity; however, if amounts paid at the resolution of litigation are in excess of recorded reserve amounts, the excess could be material to results of operations for that period.  As of December 31, 2009, the Company’s accrual for contingent losses was not material.    Results of Operations    Substantially all of the Company’s operating businesses sell products or services that are impacted by general economic conditions in the U.S. and to a lesser extent internationally.  Poor general economic conditions have reduced the demand for products or services sold by the Company’s operating subsidiaries and/orresulted in reduced pricing for products or services.  Troubled industry sectors, like the residential real estate market, have had an adverse direct impact not only on the Company’s real estate and property management and services segments, but have also had an adverse indirect impact on some of the Company’s other operating segments, including manufacturing and gaming entertainment.  The discussions below concerning revenue and profitability by segment consider current economicconditions and the impact such conditions have had and may continue to have on each segment; however, should general economic conditions worsen and/or if the country experiences a prolonged recession, the Company believes that all of its businesses would be adversely impacted.

The weak demand resulting from reductions in housing starts and the abundant supply of high-grade lumber in the marketplace also impacted Idaho Timber’s revenues for 2008.  Shipment volume in 2008 declined by 20% as compared to 2007; average selling prices did not significantly change in 2008 as compared to 2007.    Raw material costs, the largest component of cost of sales (approximately 77% of cost of sales), declined for 2009 as compared to 2008, principally due to the same market conditions that negatively impacted revenues.  Raw material cost per thousand board feet decreased approximately 9% in 2009 as compared to 2008.  Thedifference between Idaho Timber’s selling price and raw material cost per thousand board feet (spread) is closely monitored, and the rate of change in pricing and cost is not necessarily the same.  The difference between Idaho Timber’s selling price and raw material cost per thousand board feet for 2009 was lower than 2008.  Cost of sales during 2009 also includes charges of $1,400,000 to reduce the carrying value of certain timber deed contracts.  The reduced spreadcombined with low shipment volume resulted in negative gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2009.  If shipment volume remains depressed and cost of raw material remains high relative to selling price, Idaho Timber could experience negative gross profit in future quarters.    While raw material costs declined for 2008 as compared to 2007, principally due to the same market conditions that negatively impacted revenues, raw material cost per thousand board feet did not significantly change for 2008 as compared to 2007.  The spread for 2008 declined by 14% as compared to 2007.          61            Salaries and incentive compensation expense declined in 2009 as compared to 2008 and in 2008 as compared to 2007 principally due to a decrease in estimated incentive bonus expense.  Selling, general and other expenses for 2009 reflect impairment losses on long-lived assets related to one of Idaho Timber’s plants of $2,100,000.  During2009, Idaho Timber discontinued remanufacturing of dimension lumber and experienced declining sales of certain specialty wood products at that plant, and as a result has decided to close this plant.    Manufacturing – Conwed Plastics    A summary of results of operations for Conwed Plastics for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 is as follows (in thousands):               2009         2008         2007                                     Revenues and other income     $  82,094        $  106,004        $  105,418                                              Expenses:                                       Cost of sales        56,539           75,994           74,139      Salaries and incentive compensation        6,740           7,834           6,701      Depreciation and amortization        318           183           171      Selling, general and other expenses        6,919           8,008           7,043               70,516           92,019           88,054                                              Income before income taxes     $  11,578        $  13,985        $  17,364       Revenues declined in substantially all of Conwed Plastics’ markets in 2009 as compared to 2008.  Conwed Plastics’ revenues in 2009 were particularly adversely impacted in those markets related to the housing industry, which include the carpet cushion, building and construction, erosion control and turf reinforcementmarkets.  In addition, revenues from the erosion control, packaging and carpet cushion markets declined in 2009 as some business was lost to competitors.  Conwed Plastics expects revenues to continue to be adversely impacted in those markets related to housing, and also expects that the poor domestic and international economic conditions will continue to adversely affect its other markets.    While Conwed Plastics’ revenues from the packaging and filtration markets increased during 2008 largely due to acquisitions made in 2007, and in the European markets due to an acquisition in 2007, new customers and the impact of foreign exchange, its business continued to be adversely impacted in those markets related to the housingindustry.    The primary raw material in Conwed Plastics’ products is a polypropylene resin, which is a byproduct of the oil refining process, whose price tends to fluctuate with the price of oil.  Prices for polypropylene declined in 2009 as compared to 2008 improving gross margins; prices for polypropylene resin were higher in 2008than 2007.  The volatility of oil and natural gas prices along with current general economic conditions worldwide make it difficult to predict future raw material costs.  In addition to managing resin purchases, Conwed Plastics has improved its ability to reduce and/or reuse scrap and continues to seek further improvements in order to increase raw material utilization.    Gross margins improved in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to decreased raw material costs and lower labor costs due to headcount reductions.  Gross margins declined in 2008 as compared to 2007 principally due to product mix and raw material cost increases.          62            Pre-tax results for 2009 reflect a decline in salaries and incentive compensation expense principally due to a decrease in headcount and a related reduction in estimated incentive bonus expense, and a decline in selling, general and other expenses primarily due to lower professional and legal fees.  Selling, general and otherexpenses for 2009 also reflect impairment losses on long-lived assets of $400,000.  Pre-tax results for 2008 reflect $1,100,000 of higher salaries and incentive compensation expense as compared to 2007 principally due to an increase in estimated incentive bonus expense and greater headcount related to acquisitions.    Telecommunications    A summary of results of operations for STi Prepaid for the two years in the period ended December 31, 2009 and for the period from the date of acquisition (March 2007) through December 31, 2007 is as follows (in thousands):               2009         2008         2007                                     Revenues and other income     $  426,068        $  452,422        $  363,218                                              Expenses:                                       Cost of sales        363,885           392,469           309,045      Interest        49           81           140      Salaries and incentive compensation        12,150           10,649           8,143      Depreciation and amortization        4,090           1,416           491      Selling, general and other expenses        45,540           35,923           26,959               425,714           440,538           344,778                                              Income before income taxes     $  354        $  11,884        $  18,440       Prepaid calling card revenue, which increased from $342,600,000 in 2008 to $369,100,000 in 2009, includes $91,900,000 of revenues from acquisitions.  STi Prepaid believes that the decline in prepaid calling card revenues in 2009 (exclusive of the revenues from acquisitions) as compared to 2008 reflects poor economic conditionsin the markets that STi Prepaid operates, strong industry competition and the growth of wireless service providers and software applications that use voice over internet protocol for international long distance calls.  Gross margins did not significantly change in 2009 as compared to 2008.  Carrier wholesale service business, which has lower gross margins than the prepaid calling card business, decreased from $79,800,000 in 2008 to $51,700,000 in 2009 primarily due to reduced business froma large customer during the current year and the loss of a large customer in the second quarter of 2008.  Salaries and incentive compensation expense declined in 2009 (exclusive of amounts related to businesses acquired) principally due to a reduction in estimated incentive bonus expense.  Salaries and incentive compensation expense for 2009 includes $4,100,000 related to businesses acquired.  The increase in selling, general and other expenses for 2009 principally reflects $7,600,000related to businesses acquired and greater regulatory fees of $5,500,000.          63            Prepaid calling card revenue, which increased from $316,700,000 for the 2007 period to $342,600,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, includes $18,800,000 of revenues from acquisitions made by STi Prepaid during 2008.  While prepaid calling card revenues either declined or were largely flat throughout most of 2008 (exclusiveof the revenues from acquisitions), and declined compared to those for the fourth quarter of 2007, gross margins improved principally due to fewer launches of new prepaid calling cards with low introductory rates and a reduction in certain unprofitable prepaid calling card business.  Carrier wholesale service business increased from $29,700,000 for the 2007 period to $79,800,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008.  Pre-tax results for 2008 also reflect $2,900,000 of higher selling, generaland other expenses and $1,100,000 of higher salaries and incentive compensation expense from the acquisitions.    Keen    A summary of results of operations for Keen for the period from the date of acquisition (November 2009) through December 31, 2009 is as follows (in thousands).  As more fully discussed above, prior to the date of acquisition Keen was accounted for under the equity method of accounting.        Revenues and other income     $  60,459                      Expenses:               Interest        188      Salaries and incentive compensation        4,336      Depreciation and amortization        3,103      Selling, general and other expenses        6,094               13,721                      Income before income taxes     $  46,738       As more fully discussed above, other income includes a gain of $49,300,000 resulting from the bargain purchase.  Keen’s revenue volume and profitability are significantly affected by the actual and anticipated price of natural gas and levels of natural gas in storage.  The natural gas exploration and productionindustry is cyclical and the level of exploration and production activity has historically been very volatile.  During periods of lower levels of drilling activity, price competition for drilling services tends to increase which may result in reduced revenues and profitability; conversely, during periods of increased drilling activity drilling rigs are in demand often resulting in higher prices and contractual commitments from customers to obtain exclusive use of a particular rig for a longer term.  During2009, low natural gas prices, rising levels of natural gas storage and tight credit markets forced many of Keen’s customers to make significant reductions in their drilling programs, which adversely impacted Keen’s revenues and profitability.  Although there has been recent improvement in natural gas prices, Keen’s profitability will not significantly improve without increased natural gas demand to sustain the rise in natural gas prices.  Increased industrial demand for naturalgas, which is tied to achieving economic recovery, is required to significantly improve demand.  In the short term, a colder than average winter can also impact demand for natural gas.    Property Management and Services    A summary of results of operations for the property management and services segment for the two years in the period ended December 31, 2009 and for the period from the date of acquisition (June 2007) through December 31, 2007 is as follows (in thousands):          64                         2009         2008         2007                                     Revenues and other income     $  117,190        $  142,006        $  81,528                                              Expenses:                                       Direct operating expenses        92,421           113,768           65,992      Salaries and incentive compensation        4,630           5,639           3,996      Depreciation and amortization        3,611           4,592           3,145      Selling, general and other expenses        15,701           19,892           14,917               116,363           143,891           88,050                                              Income (loss) before income taxes     $  827        $  (1,885  )     $  (6,522  )    The decline in ResortQuest’s revenues and other income in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily reflects lower average daily rates (“ADR”) and the exiting of certain rental management locations.  ResortQuest’s ADR declined approximately 13% in 2009 as compared to 2008, principally due to discounts given inall markets due to competition and excess availability, fewer reservations for its ski locations, which typically have higher ADRs than beach locations and a decrease in ResortQuest’s rental management properties in certain locations that typically have higher ADRs.  ResortQuest’s occupancy percentage for 2009 was moderately lower as compared to 2008.  Subsequent to year-end, ResortQuest has continued to see a decline in advance reservations for its ski locations and many of itsbeach locations.  ResortQuest believes that the decline in advance reservations is largely due to the adverse economic conditions and with respect to its fly to markets, fewer scheduled flights at increased fares.    ResortQuest’s net real estate brokerage revenues were $4,000,000 in 2009 and $8,700,000 in 2008.  The 2008 revenue was principally recorded upon the completion of certain large development projects.  Its real estate brokerage services, which are concentrated in Northwest Florida and Delaware, tend to be cyclical,and experience the same volatility that residential real estate and new construction markets experience.  Since acquisition, its real estate brokerage business has been and will continue to be negatively impacted by the depressed real estate market.    While ResortQuest’s occupancy percentage for the year ended December 31, 2008 did not significantly change as compared to that for 2007 (inclusive of the pre-acquisition period), its occupancy percentage for the fourth quarter of 2008 declined as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.  In addition, ADRs for 2008, particularlythose for the fourth quarter, declined compared to those for the same periods in 2007.  The declines in occupancy and ADRs primarily reflect fewer reservations for its ski locations, an increase in available properties in certain beach locations, as well as rate discounts given on properties due to competition and excess availability.  Reservations did increase at beach and golf locations but not enough to offset the overall decline in occupancy percentage.    The decline in direct operating expenses in 2009 as compared to 2008 principally reflects workforce reductions and other related cost saving initiatives, and the exiting of certain rental management locations.  The reduction in selling, general and other expenses in 2009 primarily reflects lower advertising costs.    Gaming Entertainment          65            As more fully discussed above, Premier was accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary when acquired during 2006; however, while in bankruptcy proceedings from September 19, 2006 to emergence on August 10, 2007, Premier was accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  Upon emergence from bankruptcy, Premier was once againconsolidated by the Company.  Premier’s casino and hotel operations opened to the public on June 30, 2007; prior to opening, Premier’s activities principally consisted of rebuilding and repairing the hotel and casino facilities that were severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina, and its bankruptcy proceedings.    A summary of results of operations for Premier for the two years in the period ended December 31, 2009 and for the period from emergence from bankruptcy (date of reconsolidation) through December 31, 2007 is as follows (in thousands):               2009         2008         2007                                     Revenues and other income     $  103,583        $  119,090        $  38,463                                              Expenses:                                       Direct operating expenses        79,452           93,987           37,772      Interest        489           899           530      Salaries and incentive compensation        1,977           2,451           1,359      Depreciation and amortization        16,532           16,956           6,271      Selling, general and other expenses        2,754           3,822           1,811               101,204           118,115           47,743                                              Income (loss) before income taxes     $  2,379        $  975        $  (9,280  )    Premier’s gaming revenues for 2009 were largely unchanged as compared to 2008, while the local gaming market declined substantially.  Premier has established a strong customer database and customer loyalty programs resulting in growth in market share of the local gaming market.  Revenues from non-casino operationsdecreased in 2009 primarily due to Premier offering more of its hotel rooms complementary to its casino customers and lower ticket prices and fewer tickets sold for concerts.  Premier believes that current adverse economic conditions are likely to continue to have a negative impact on the local gaming market in 2010 and could encourage expansion of legalized gaming in nearby states as governments look for ways to generate revenues.  As a result, competition could escalate.  Manyof Premier’s competitors are larger and have greater marketing and financial resources.    Gaming revenues increased in each quarter of 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.  However, gaming revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 declined compared to the prior quarters of 2008 reflecting seasonality in the Gulf Coast gaming market and unfavorable economic conditions.  Premier’s revenuesfor 2008 were adversely impacted by multiple hurricanes that threatened the Mississippi Gulf Coast, one of which caused Premier’s closure over the Labor Day weekend, resulting in lost business.    Revenues and other income for 2008 include a $7,300,000 gain from the settlement and collection of Premier’s remaining insurance claim relating to Hurricane Katrina, and $5,600,000 resulting from capital contributions from the noncontrolling interest.  In prior periods, the Company recorded 100% of the losses after cumulativeloss allocations to the noncontrolling interest (classified as minority interest prior to January 1, 2009) had reduced the noncontrolling interest to zero.  Since the noncontrolling interest remained at zero after considering the capital contributions, the entire capital contribution was recorded as income, effectively reimbursing the Company for a portion of the noncontrolling interest losses that were not previously allocated to the noncontrolling interest.          66              The decrease in direct operating expenses in 2009 as compared to 2008 reflects reductions in workforce and other cost reductions implemented by Premier during the fourth quarter of 2008.  Selling, general and other expenses for 2008 include $1,100,000 of charges relating to Hurricane Gustav, primarily to write off damaged assets,for which there will not be any insurance recovery, and a charge of $800,000 to write down certain gaming assets that will not be used.    Domestic Real Estate    A summary of results of operations for the domestic real estate segment for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 is as follows (in thousands):               2009         2008         2007                                     Revenues and other income     $  30,637        $  15,091        $  13,436                                              Expenses:                                       Interest        2,322           4,408           –      Depreciation and amortization        8,408           7,607           3,816      Other operating expenses, including impairment                                          charges described below        91,205           17,771           17,896               101,935           29,786           21,712                                              Loss before income taxes     $  (71,298  )     $  (14,695  )     $  (8,276  )    Pre-tax results for the domestic real estate segment are largely dependent upon the performance of the segment’s operating properties, the current status of the Company’s real estate development projects and non-recurring gains or losses recognized when real estate assets are sold.  As a result, pre-tax results forthis segment for any particular period are not predictable and do not follow any consistent pattern.    Revenues and other income for 2009 and 2007 include real estate sales of $12,400,000 and $10,700,000, respectively; the Company did not have any major real estate sales during 2008.  Real estate revenues and other income for 2008 include income of $3,700,000 from the favorable settlement of a lawsuit.  Real estate revenuesand other income include $1,000,000, $(4,600,000) and $(3,900,000) for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, of income (charges) related to the accounting for the mark-to-market value of an interest rate derivative (which was terminated during the second quarter of 2009) relating to MB1’s debt obligation.    As discussed above, during the second quarter of 2009, the Company determined that the carrying amount of MB1’s mixed use real estate project located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina was not fully recoverable and recorded an impairment charge of $67,800,000, which is included in other operating expenses.  In addition, otheroperating expenses for 2009 include impairment charges aggregating $3,600,000 for certain other real estate properties and a charge of $1,400,000 representing the net book value of land and buildings that was contributed to a local municipality.  Other operating expenses for 2008 include an impairment charge of $1,300,000 for certain real estate properties held for sale.  Pre-tax results for 2007 include $1,600,000 of incentive compensation accruals related to the Myrtle Beach project.          67            Residential property sales volume, prices and new building starts have declined significantly in many U.S. markets, including markets in which the Company has real estate operations in various stages of development.  The slowdown in residential sales has been exacerbated by the turmoil in the mortgage lending and credit marketsduring the past two years, which has resulted in stricter lending standards and reduced liquidity for prospective home buyers.  The Company has deferred its development plans for certain of its real estate development projects, and is not actively soliciting bids for its fully developed projects.  The Company intends to wait for market conditions to improve before marketing certain of its projects for sale.    Medical Product Development    A summary of results of operations for Sangart for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 is as follows (in thousands):               2009         2008         2007                                     Revenues and other income     $  5,147        $  654        $  2,078                                              Expenses:                                       Salaries and incentive compensation        9,641           13,058           8,773      Depreciation and amortization        836           756           759      Selling, general and other expenses        18,488           23,426           29,094               28,965           37,240           38,626                                              Loss before income taxes     $  (23,818  )     $  (36,586  )     $  (36,548  )    Revenues and other income for 2009 include $5,000,000 of insurance proceeds received upon the death of Sangart’s former chief executive officer.  Sangart’s losses reflect research and development costs (which are included in selling, general and other expenses) of $3,500,000, $13,900,000 and $22,100,000 for theyears ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively (including acquired research and development of $2,100,000 and $4,100,000 for 2008 and 2007, respectively, which was expensed under prior GAAP).  Research and development costs declined in 2009 primarily due to the completion during 2008 of two Phase III clinical trials of MP4OX, Sangart’s current medical product candidate.  Selling, general and other expenses in 2009 also reflects $3,100,000 of charges related to share-basedawards previously granted to a former officer (such charges were included in salaries and compensation expense in prior periods during the course of his employment); $1,900,000 of charges for manufacturing facility design costs that Sangart does not expect to use; $1,600,000 of greater royalty expenses; $700,000 of increased professional fees; and $800,000 of lower severance costs.  The decrease in salaries and incentive compensation expense in 2009 as compared to 2008 principally reflects headcountreductions.  Salaries and incentive compensation expense for 2008 also included share-based compensation expense for the former officer during the course of his employment.    The increase in salaries and incentive compensation in 2008 as compared to 2007 was principally due to increased headcount in connection with the Phase III trials and development efforts, greater share-based compensation expense, and compensation costs for a newly hired officer.  Pre-tax results for 2008 also reflect $1,600,000of severance expense relating to a former officer and headcount reductions.          68            Sangart is a development stage company that does not have any revenues from product sales.  As more fully discussed above, Sangart has decided not to pursue marketing approval at this time to use MP4OX in orthopedic hip surgeries (the patient group tested in the Phase III clinical trials) but is currently conducting a PhaseII clinical study of MP4OX in trauma patients and plans to conduct additional clinical trials of MP4OX in other therapeutic areas that may better demonstrate its clinical benefit and strengthen the likelihood of regulatory approval.  Such studies will take several years to complete at substantial cost, and until they are successfully completed, if ever, Sangart will not be able to request marketing approval and generate revenues from MP4OX sales.  The Company is unable to predict when, ifever, it will report operating profits for this segment.    Other Operations    A summary of results of operations for other operations for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 is as follows (in thousands):               2009         2008         2007                                     Revenues and other income     $  53,341        $  53,465        $  53,564                                              Expenses:                                       Interest        31           81           28      Salaries and incentive compensation        8,314           10,957           9,721      Depreciation and amortization        5,577           5,309           6,280      Selling, general and other expenses        75,812           77,496           55,175               89,734           93,843           71,204                                              Loss before income taxes     $  (36,393  )     $  (40,378  )     $  (17,640  )    Revenues and other income for 2009 reflect $4,600,000 of greater revenues from a power production facility that burns waste biomass to produce electricity, which commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2008, and $3,900,000 less income from purchased delinquent credit card receivables.  Salaries and incentive compensationdeclined during 2009 primarily due to workforce and compensation reductions and lower estimated incentive bonus expense.  The change in selling, general and other expenses in 2009 as compared to 2008 reflects expenses (largely professional fees and other costs) related to the investigation and evaluation of energy projects ($23,500,000 and $30,800,000 for 2009 and 2008, respectively); greater operating expenses incurred by the power production facility of $7,200,000; charges at winery operations during2009 to reduce the carrying amount of wine inventory that is expected to be sold as bulk wine or used in lower value bottled wine products of $4,700,000; and a loss in 2008 from asset disposals and write-downs of $5,200,000.    Revenues and other income for 2008 reflect an increase of $7,500,000 in income from purchased delinquent credit card receivables as compared to 2007.  For 2007, revenues and other income include $8,500,000 related to the termination of a joint development agreement with another party.  This amount substantially reimbursedthe Company for its prior expenditures, which were fully expensed as incurred.  The increase in selling, general and other expenses in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily reflects expenses (largely professional fees and other costs) related to the investigation and evaluation of energy projects ($30,800,000 and $18,200,000 for 2008 and 2007, respectively); the loss in 2008 from asset disposals and write-downs of $5,200,000; and greater operating expenses incurred by the power production facility of $3,200,000.          69            Corporate    A summary of results of operations for corporate for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 is as follows (in thousands):               2009         2008         2007                                     Investment and other income (including net                              securities gains (losses))     $  97,774        $  (43,339  )     $  204,995                                              Expenses:                                       Interest        125,724           140,002           110,839      Salaries and incentive compensation        45,659           26,395           36,773      Depreciation and amortization        18,441           12,903           9,655      Selling, general and other expenses        76,610           79,385           75,606               266,434           258,685           232,873                                              Loss before income taxes     $  (168,660  )     $  (302,024  )     $  (27,878  )    Investment and other income increased $17,700,000 in 2009 as compared to 2008.  Of this amount, investment income declined $23,200,000 in 2009 principally due to lower interest rates on a lower amount of fixed income securities, while other income increased $40,900,000 in 2009.  Other income includes $66,100,000 and$40,500,000 for 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to Fortescue’s Pilbara iron ore and infrastructure project in Western Australia.  The Company is entitled to receive 4% of the revenue, net of government royalties, invoiced from certain areas of Fortescue’s project, which commenced production in May 2008.  Amounts are payable semi-annually within thirty days of June 30 th  and December 31 st  ofeach year subject to restricted payment provisions of Fortescue’s debt agreements; payments are currently being deferred by FMG pursuant to those agreements.  Depreciation and amortization expenses include prepaid mining interest amortization of $7,300,000 and $2,800,000 for 2009 and 2008, respectively, which is being amortized over time in proportion to the amount of ore produced.  Other income in 2009 also reflects a gain from a legal settlement of $10,500,000 and gains of $6,700,000on the repurchase of $35,600,000 principal amount of the Company’s 7% Senior Notes and $6,500,000 principal amount of the Company’s 8.65% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures.  In addition, investment and other income reflects income (charges) of $1,300,000, $(1,800,000) and $(1,900,000) for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to the accounting for mark-to-market values of Corporate derivatives.  Investment and other income in 2008includes $2,500,000 of foreign exchange gains.    Investment and other income decreased in 2008 as compared to 2007.  Investment income declined $41,000,000 in 2008 principally due to lower interest rates on a reduced amount of fixed income securities.  Other income, which increased $29,900,000 in 2008, includes $40,500,000 of income related to Fortescue’sPilbara iron ore and infrastructure project in Western Australia.  Investment and other income for 2007 includes the receipt of escrowed proceeds from the sale of an associated company in 2006 of $11,400,000 that had not been previously recognized.    Net securities gains (losses) for Corporate aggregated $(21,100,000), $(144,500,000) and $92,700,000 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Net securities gains (losses) are net of impairment charges of $31,400,000, $143,400,000 and $36,800,000 during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  TheCompany’s decision to sell securities and realize security gains or losses is generally based on its evaluation of an individual security’s value at the time and the prospect for changes in its value in the future.  The decision could also be influenced by the status of the Company’s tax attributes.  The timing of realized security gains or losses is not predictable and does not follow any pattern from year to year.          70            The decrease in interest expense during 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily reflects decreased interest expense related to the 3¾% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes, $128,900,000 of which were converted in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $123,500,000 of which were converted principally in the second quarter of 2009, decreasedinterest expense related to the repurchased 7% Senior Notes and decreased interest expense related to the fixed rate repurchase agreements.  The increase in interest expense during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily reflects interest expense relating to the 8 1/8% Senior Notes issued in September 2007 and the 7 1/8% Senior Notes issued in March 2007.  Interest expense for 2008 also reflects decreased interest expense related to the fixed rate repurchase agreements and the converted 3¾%Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes.    Salaries and incentive compensation expense increased in 2009 as compared to 2008 principally due to greater accrued incentive bonus expense related to the Company’s Senior Executive Annual Incentive Bonus Plan.  Bonus accruals under this plan are based on a percentage of pre-tax profits as defined in the plan.  Principallydue to reductions in incentive bonus expense and less share-based compensation expense, salaries and incentive compensation expense decreased by $10,400,000 in 2008 as compared to 2007.  The Company recorded share-based compensation expense relating to grants made under the Company’s senior executive warrant plan and the fixed stock option plan of $10,900,000 in 2009, $9,600,000 in 2008 and $10,800,000 in 2007.  Share-based compensation expense in 2007 reflected increased expenses relatingto the stock option plan due to the accelerated vesting of stock options of an officer of the Company who resigned.    The decrease in selling, general and other expenses in 2009 as compared to 2008 principally reflects lower legal and other professional fees of $7,100,000, lower corporate aircraft expense of $5,100,000, primarily resulting from less usage and lower fuel costs, and lower severance expense of $4,700,000.  Selling, general andother expenses for 2009 also reflect an increase as compared to 2008 of $12,100,000 for expenses incurred relating to the induced conversion of the Company’s 3¾% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes, as discussed above ($28,300,000 was expensed in 2009), and $2,600,000 of greater pension expense.    The increase in selling, general and other expenses in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily reflects $16,200,000 of expenses incurred relating to the induced conversion of $128,887,000 principal amount of the Company’s 3¾% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes during the fourth quarter of 2008 and $6,100,000 of severance expense.  Selling,general and other expenses for 2007 include a charge of $7,500,000 for the settlement of litigation related to MK Resources Company, greater legal fees, including those incurred in connection with that litigation, and higher professional fees.    As of December 31, 2009, the Company has a full valuation allowance against its net federal deferred tax asset, including its available NOLs.  As a result, the Company did not record any regular federal income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2009.  However, the Company has material unrealized security gainsreflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and in income related to associated companies.  If these gains were realized, the Company would be able to use its NOLs to fully offset the federal income taxes that would be due, but the Company would have to pay federal minimum taxes.  Although the payment of federal minimum taxes generates a minimum tax credit carryover, it would be fully reserved for in the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance.  Accordingly, for the yearended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded provisions for deferred federal minimum taxes payable of $22,700,000 and $11,600,000 in accumulated other comprehensive income and income related to associated companies, respectively.  In addition, income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes state and foreign income taxes.          71            As more fully discussed above, during 2008 the Company concluded that a valuation allowance was required against substantially all of the net deferred tax asset, and increased its valuation allowance by $1,672,100,000 with a corresponding charge to income tax expense.  During 2007 the Company’s revised projections of futuretaxable income enabled it to conclude that it was more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the Company’s net deferred tax asset; accordingly, $542,700,000 of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense.  The income tax provision reflects the reversal of tax reserves aggregating $2,000,000, $4,100,000 and $2,300,000 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as a result of theexpiration of the applicable statute of limitations and the favorable resolution of various state and federal income tax contingencies.

As discussed above, the Company’s equity in earnings of Berkadia include its share of a bargain purchase gain of $24,400,000.    As discussed above, during 2009, the Company’s equity in losses of Garcadia includes impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets aggregating $32,300,000.    As discussed above, during 2009, the Company’s equity in losses of Keen includes impairment charges of $36,500,000.  Keen became a consolidated subsidiary in November 2009.          72              The Company’s share of IFIS’s losses in 2008 includes an impairment charge of $63,300,000.  In January 2009, IFIS raised a significant amount of new equity in a rights offering in which the Company did not participate.  As a result, the Company’s ownership interest in IFIS was reduced to 8% and theCompany no longer applies the equity method of accounting for this investment.    In June 2007, the Company acquired a 10% limited partnership interest in Pershing Square, a newly-formed private investment partnership whose investment decisions are at the sole discretion of Pershing Square’s general partner.  The stated objective of Pershing Square is to create capital appreciation by investing in TargetCorporation.  Losses recorded by Pershing Square principally result from a decline in the market value of Target Corporation’s common stock.    Shortplus, Highland Opportunity, Wintergreen, EagleRock, Ambrose and Safe Harbor are investment partnerships or limited liability corporations whose investment decisions are at the sole discretions of their respective general partners or managing members.  These entities invest in a variety of debt and equity securities.  TheCompany has redeemed its interests in these entities.    The Company owns approximately 31.4% of HomeFed, a California real estate development company, which it acquired in 2002.  The Company’s share of HomeFed’s reported earnings fluctuates with the level of real estate sales activity at HomeFed’s development projects.    In April 2007, the Company and Jefferies expanded and restructured the Company’s equity investment in JPOF II, and formed JHYH.  The Company contributed $250,000,000 to JHYH along with its investment in JPOF II.  The Company’s share of JPOF II’s earnings was distributed to the Company shortly afterthe end of each period.    The Company accounted for Premier under the equity method of accounting while it was in bankruptcy (September 2006 to August 2007).    Discontinued Operations    WilTel    The Company sold WilTel in December 2005.  During 2009, the Company received 636,300 of its common shares in connection with the resolution of a lawsuit related to WilTel and recorded income from discontinued operations of $15,200,000 based on the market value of the common shares.  These shares were originally issuedin connection with the acquisition of WilTel in 2003, and had been held in a fund for certain claims made against WilTel prior to the Company’s ownership.  The resolution of the lawsuit found that the claimants were not entitled to the shares and they were returned to the Company.  Gain on disposal of discontinued operations for 2007 includes a pre-tax gain of $800,000 ($500,000 after tax) from the resolution of sale-related contingencies.    Empire    As discussed above, during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company received distributions totaling $11,300,000 and $44,900,000, respectively, from Empire, a subsidiary of the Company that had been classified as a discontinued operation in 2001 and fully written-off.  For income tax purposes, the payments are treatedas non-taxable distributions paid by a subsidiary.          73            Other    Gain on disposal of discontinued operations for 2007 includes a pre-tax gain of $4,000,000 ($2,800,000 after tax) related to the collection of additional amounts from the sale of the Company’s interest in an Argentine shoe manufacturer in 2005 that had not been previously recognized (collectibility was uncertain).    Losses of $1,100,000 in 2008 relate to an indemnification obligation to the purchaser of a former subsidiary.    Recently Issued Accounting Standards    In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance for the accounting for transfers of financial assets, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009, that eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity, establishes specific conditions that must be met fortransfers of portions of financial assets to be eligible for sale accounting, clarifies and amends the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale, changes the amount of recognized gain/loss on a transfer accounted for as a sale under certain circumstances, and requires enhanced disclosures.  The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.     In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009, that requires an enterprise to qualitatively determine whether the enterprise’s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (“VIE”), which would result in theenterprise being the primary beneficiary of the VIE.  This determination of the primary beneficiary is based upon the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  It also requires ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE andenhanced disclosures.  The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.            Item 7A .   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk .     The following includes “forward-looking statements” that involve risk and uncertainties.  Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.   The Company’s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and its borrowing activities and equity price risk.     The Company’s investment portfolio is primarily classified as available for sale, and consequently, is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in equity.  Included in the Company’s available for sale investment portfolio are fixed income securities, which comprised approximately 22% of the Company’stotal investment portfolio at December 31, 2009.  These fixed income securities are primarily rated “investment grade” or are U.S. governmental agency issued or U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises.  The estimated weighted average remaining life of these fixed income securities was approximately 2.7 years at December 31, 2009.  The Company’s fixed income securities, like all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if marketinterest rates increase.  At December 31, 2008, fixed income securities comprised approximately 47% of the Company’s total investment portfolio and had an estimated weighted average remaining life of 1.6 years.          74              Also included in the Company’s available for sale investment portfolio are equity securities, which are recorded on the balance sheet at an aggregate fair value of $1,557,100,000 (aggregate cost of $379,000,000) and which comprised approximately 70% of the Company’s total investment portfolio at December 31, 2009.  Themajority of this amount consists of two publicly traded securities; the investment in Fortescue common shares, which is carried at fair value of $1,108,000,000, and the investment in Inmet, which is carried at fair value of $339,100,000.  The Company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis.    The Company is also subject to price risk related to its investments in ACF and Jefferies, for which it has elected the fair value option.  At December 31, 2009, these investments are classified as investments in associated companies and carried at fair values of $639,800,000 and $1,152,900,000, respectively.    At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company’s portfolio of trading securities was not material to the total investment portfolio.    The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its long-term fixed interest rate debt.  Generally, the fair market value of debt securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall, and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise.     The following table provides information about the Company’s financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are primarily sensitive to changes in interest rates.  For investment securities and debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates.  For the variable rate borrowings, the weightedaverage interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date.  Included in variable interest rate borrowings is the MB1 debt whose fair value is the value of its collateral.  For securities and liabilities with contractual maturities, the table presents contractual principal cash flows adjusted for the Company’s historical experience and prepayments of mortgage-backed securities.       For additional information, see Notes 6, 13 and 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.             75                          Expected Maturity Date                      2010         2011         2012         2013         2014         Thereafter         Total         Fair Value             (Dollars in thousands)                                                                                  Rate Sensitive Assets:                                                                           Available for Sale Fixed Income Securities:                                                                           U.S. Government and agencies     $    80,419        $    25,791        $    -
