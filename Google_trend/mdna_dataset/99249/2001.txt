ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF         OPERATIONS.   General  Regency  Affiliates,  Inc.  (the  "Company")  is the  parent  company of several subsidiary  business  operations.  The Company is  committed  to develop  and/or monetize  these  business  operations  for the benefit of its  shareholders  and continues to commit both  financial and personnel  resources to an active merger and acquisition  program in order to enhance common  shareholders'  values.  The Company's  Shareholders' Equity at December 31, 2000 was $16,076,052 as compared to $13,636,050 on December 31, 1999, an increase of 17.9%.   Liquidity and Capital Resources.  The  investment in Security is estimated to provide the Company with  management fees of approximately  $100,000 per annum until 2003. In the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company's income from its equity investment in the Partnership was $4,712,615.  These funds,  however, are presently committed for the amortization of the  outstanding  principal  balance on Security's  real estate mortgage and, while  the  Company's  equity   investment  has  increased  to  $24,575,881  the partnership does not provide  liquidity to the Company in excess of the $100,000 annual management fee. The partnership  agreement  provides for the distribution of "Sale or Refinancing  Proceeds" in accordance with the partner's positive tax capital  account  balances.  At December 31, 1999,  Regency was the only partner with a positive tax capital  account  balance.  The Company has been  previously successful in obtaining  financing with respect to this partnership  interest to fund its acquisition program and cash flow deficits.  On March 15, 1998,  Rustic  Crafts  purchased a building of 126,000  square feet located  near the current  facility in Scranton,  Pennsylvania.  The purchase of this facility was funded by new borrowings  from PNC Bank in the form of a first mortgage  term loan in the  amount of  $960,000.  Rustic  Crafts  also  obtained financing of approximately  $923,000 from the PNC Bank to equip the facility and purchase new  equipment.  The move to the new facility was completed in 1999 and has significantly  increased the operating capacity and enabled Rustic Crafts to more  efficiently meet its current order backlog and increase its customer base. On the date of  acquisition  of the new  facility,  a tenant was renting  23,000 square  feet  of this  facility  at a base  rent of  $17,400  per  year  plus an allocable  share of the real  estate  taxes.  The tenant was removed in 2001 for failure to pay rent.  The Company is currently  negotiating  with the tenant for payment of back rent.  The Company has the space  listed for with an agent for a replacement.  The Company has had discussions  with several  companies  regarding the possible sale of its  interest  in NRDC.  To  facilitate  the  discussions  concerning  a possible sale, the NRDC zero coupon bonds (secured by the Aggregate  inventory), were retired in 1999 by the issuance of 121,000  shares of the Company's  common stock.  Following  the  termination  of the 1999 NRDC Plan of Merger with Cotton Valley Resources  Corporation,  the Company installed limited Aggregate crushing and marketing operations at the Groveland Mine in an informal joint venture with another  company.  Pending  the  outcome of current  discussions  regarding  the possible  sale of the  Company's  interest,  the Company is also  exploring  the possibility of establishing a permanent  infrastructure  during the year 2001 to commercialize the inventory of previously  quarried and stockpiled  Aggregate at the Groveland Mine in cooperation with an experienced Aggregate supply company.  On April 22, 1999, the Company  acquired 513,915 shares (35%) of the outstanding common stock of Glas-Aire for the issuance of a promissory  note of $650,000 due January 1, 2000, at an interest rate of 7.5% per annum, which note is guaranteed by Mr. William Ponsoldt,  Sr.,  President of the Company and $1,213,000 in cash. As of  September  23, 1999  Regency had  acquired  51.3% of the common  stock of Glas-Aire.  These  common  stock  acquisitions  were  effected  by  open  market purchases,  with  the  funding  provided  by an  affiliate  of  Statesman  on an unsecured  basis,  by direct  purchases  from  Glas-Aire,  and by a common stock exchange  agreement  between the Company and certain  shareholders of Glas-Aire. Under the common stock exchange  agreement,  the Company issued 1,188,000 shares of its restricted  common stock in exchange for 288,000  Glas-Aire common shares held by the shareholders.  The Company also sold 2,852,375 shares of its common stock to Glas-Aire for cash of  $1,967,960  and 86,000 shares of Glas-Aire  common stock.  The proceeds were used to repay the  funding  provided  by an  affiliate  of  Statesman  and other general corporate requirements.    The Company is continuing to explore  opportunities  to acquire  companies  with operations  that will provide  additional  liquidity  and cash flow. In February 2000,  the  Company  executed  Letters  of  Intent  to  acquire  55%  of  Knight Enterprises, Inc. a provider of various high speed digital access to major cable companies  throughout  Florida;  100% of Southwest  Mill and Lumber  Company,  a California  based  producer of picture  frame  molding  and frames;  and 100% of Valley  Wholesale  Supply Corp., a California based marketer of picture molding, framing  supplies and equipment.  Negotiations  with Knight  Enterprises,  Inc., Southwest Mill and Lumber Company,  and Valley  Wholesale Supply Corp. have been discontinued.  The Company  expects the Letters of Intent referred to above will be formally terminated  shortly.  The Company's ability to continue in existence is partly dependent upon its ability to attain  satisfactory levels of operating cash flows and it's ability to continue borrowing.  Results of Operations  In  September  1999,  the Company  acquired a 51%  interest in  Glas-Aire  which manufactures automotive accessories sold primarily to automotive  manufacturers. The  financial  statements  for 1999  include  the  results of  Glas-Aire  since September 1999, and the operations of Rustic Crafts acquired in 1997.   2000 Compared to 1999  Net sales increased  $6,507,542  over 1999, an 83% increase.  Net sales includes $10,929,775  of Glas-Aire  sales.  Sales of household  accessories  decreased by $485,286 due to general economic conditions  resulting in a decline in sales and a reduction in backlog orders from the previous period.  Rustic Crafts continues to  emphasized  higher  margin  sales in 2000 and to reduce its reliance on it's single large customer, who requires discounted prices.  Gross  margins  increased  $2,050,695  in 2000  over  1999,  which is  primarily attributable to the acquisition of Glas-Aire and it's inclusion in the companies financial  statements  for the entire year.  Gross  margins of home  accessories increased  $196,200 in 2000  reflecting  the  Company's  focus on higher  margin products.  Selling and administrative expenses increased $1,960,385 or 58% in 2000 compared to 1999 The increase is attributable to the inclusion in the companies financial statement of Glas-Aire  activities  for the entire year.  Expenses  increased at Rustic Crafts by $214,842 as a result of higher costs of selling and  marketing, including the compensation of key employees.  Income from equity investment in partnership increased $415,303 over 1999 due to the reduction of interest  expenses on the lower loan  principal  balance of the partnership,   partially  offset  by  increased   operating  and  administrative expenses.  Other income decreased $91,085 in 2000 as compared to 1999. Other income in 1999 includes  $114,960 of equity  earnings  related to the  Company's  ownership  in Glas-Aire  prior to  September  1999.  These  earnings  were offset by decreased interest income from declining invested cash balances.  Interest expense  decreased  $12,421 in 2000 from 1999 as a result of lower cost of funds.  Interest expense in 1998 included  significant costs and penalties in connection  with the  refinancing of the SIPI loan in June 1998. The elimination of the refinancing  costs was partially offset by additional loans for equipment and  facilities  at Rustic  Crafts and the higher  loan  balance of the KBC loan which refinanced the SIPI loan.  Income tax expense  increased  $190,984 due to income tax expense for Glas-Aire. The Company cannot use its net operating loss to offset the earnings of this 51% owned subsidiary.  Minority interest in the Statement of Operations increased $79,128 due primarily to the  inclusion of the results of operations of Glas-Aire for the full year of 2000.  Net income  decreased  $137,668 or 6% in 2000 over 1999. The decrease was due to the recognition of an extraordinary  gain in 1999.  Income before  extraordinary gain increased $192,197 or 9.8% in 2000 over 1999.    1999 Compared to 1998  Net sales increased  $4,045,232  over 1998, a 107% increase.  Net sales includes $3,930,541 of Glas-Aire sales. Sales of household accessories increased $158,039 due to increased  advertising  and marketing  efforts at Rustic  Crafts.  Rustic Crafts emphasized higher margin sales in 1999 in order to reduce its reliance on a single large customer who required discounted prices.  Gross margins  increased  $1,323,043  in 1999 over 1998, of which  $1,168,970 is attributable to the acquisition of Glas-Aire.  Gross margins of home accessories increased  $196,200 in 1999  reflecting  the  Company's  focus on higher  margin products and new, lower discount  customers.  Rustic Crafts reduced its reliance on its single  largest  customer  from 54% of its total  sales in 1998 to 39% in 1999.  General and administrative expenses increased $1,352,795 or 66% in 1999 compared to 1998. Administrative expenses of $773,943 are attributable to the acquisition of  Glas-Aire.  Expenses  increased at Rustic  Crafts due to increased  costs of selling and marketing  including the development and printing of new promotional materials.  Corporate  administrative  expenses increased due to higher salaries and bonuses as a result of higher  profits;  higher  consulting  fees and travel related expenses for continued  acquisition  efforts and the related  financing; and board compensation paid in accordance with the compensation  program adopted by the shareholders in August.  Income from equity investment in partnership increased $311,122 over 1998 due to the reduction of interest  expenses on the lower loan  principal  balance of the partnership,   partially  offset  by  increased   operating  and  administrative expenses.  Other income  increased  $49,740 in 1999 compared to 1998.  Other income in 1999 includes  $114,960 of equity  earnings  related to the  Company's  ownership  in Glas-Aire  prior to  September  1999.  These  earnings  were offset by decreased interest income from declining invested cash balances.  Gain on retirement of debt of $330,605 is due to the retirement of the NRDC zero coupon bonds by the issuance of 121,000  shares of the  Company's  Common Stock. Also,  a  significant  amount of the bonds were retired in  connection  with the agreement of the Company to discontinue claims against one of the holders of the bonds.  Interest expense decreased $128,349 in 1999 from 1998.  Interest expense in 1998 included  significant  costs and penalties in connection with the refinancing of the SIPI  loan in June  1998.  The  elimination  of the  refinancing  costs  was partially  offset by additional  loans for  equipment  and  facilities at Rustic Crafts and the higher  loan  balance of the KBC loan which  refinanced  the SIPI loan.  Income tax expense  increased  $136,726 due to income tax expense for Glas-Aire. The Company cannot use its net operating loss to offset the earnings of this 51% owned subsidiary.  Minority  interest  in  the  Statement  of  Operations  increased  $154,976  due primarily to the  inclusion  of the results of  operations  of  Glas-Aire  since September  1999,  and the  minority  interest  attributable  to the  gain on the retirement of the NRDC zero coupon bonds.  Net income rose $498,362 or 27.8% in 1999 over 1998.  The increase was generally due to the  increase in income  from equity in  partnership,  the  inclusion  of Glas-Aire in consolidated  results of operations  since September 1999, the gain on  retirement of debt and the reduction of interest  expense.  These  increases were offset by increases in corporate  administrative expenses related primarily to  higher  salaries  and  wages  and  costs  incurred  in  connection  with the acquisition program.    Year 2000 Issues.  The Company had not anticipated any material  difficulties  associated with Year 2000 issues and none  materialized.  The Company  made no material  expenditures associated  with Year 2000  issues  and had not  anticipated  that any  material amounts would be expended in its earlier reports.  Forward-Looking Statements.  Certain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including,  but not limited to, those  regarding  the  Company's  financial  position,  business strategy,  acquisition  strategy  and other  plans  and  objectives  for  future operations and any other  statements  that are not historical  facts  constitute "forward-looking  statements"  expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the Company and are subject to uncertainties  and factors  (including, but not limited to, those  specified  below) which are difficult to predict and, in many instances,  are beyond the control of the Company.  As a result,  actual results of the Company may differ materially from those results  contemplated by such forward-looking statements which include, but are not limited to:             (i)  The Company currently does not generate positive cash flow as the                current  activities of the Company do not, in and of  themselves,                generate  sufficient  cash flow to cover its corporate  operating                expenses and thus the Company  must rely on its cash  reserves to                fund  these  expenses.  The  Company's  ability  to  continue  in                existence  is  partly   dependent  upon  its  ability  to  attain                satisfactory levels of operating cash flows.            (ii) The Company  currently lacks the necessary infra structure at the                site of the Groveland Mine in order to permit the Company to make                more than casual sales of the Aggregate.            (iii)An unsecured  default in the Lease or sudden  catastrophe  to the                Security West Building  from  uninsured  acts of God or war could                have a materially adverse impact upon the Company's investment in                Security Land And  Development  Company  Limited  Partnership and                therefore its financial position and results of operations.            (iv) The failure of the Social  Security  Administration  to renew its                lease of the  Security  West  Buildings  upon its  expiration  on                October 31, 2003 could have an adverse  impact upon the Company's                investment  in  Security  Land And  Development  Company  Limited                Partnership.            (v)  The Company has significant tax loss and credit carryforwards and                no assurance  can be provided that the Internal  Revenue  Service                would not attempt to limit or disallow  altogether  the Company's                use,  retroactively and/or prospectively,  of such carryforwards,                due to ownership changes or any other reason. The disallowance of                the  utilization  of  the  Company's  net  operating  loss  would                severely impact the Company's  financial  position and results of                operations  due to the  significant  amounts  of  taxable  income                (generated by the Company's  investment in Security)  that has in                the past been, and is expected in the future to be, offset by the                Company's net operating loss carryforwards.            (vi) Both of the companies operating  subsidiaries  (Rustic Crafts and                Glas-Aire)  are dependent on a limited  number of customers for a                substantial portion of their respective revenues. The loss of one                or more of these customers could have a significant effect on the                Companies results of operations.    ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The Company is exposed to  financial  market  risks due  primarily to changes in interest  rates.  The Company  does not use  derivatives  to alter the  interest characteristics  of  its  debt  securities.  The  Company  has  no  holdings  of derivative or commodity  instruments  and does not transact  business in foreign currencies  except for payments of salaries  and  expenses to certain  employees located in foreign countries.  The fair value of the  Company's  cash and cash  equivalents  or related  income would not be  significantly  impacted  by changes in  interest  rates  since the investment  maturities  are  short.  Debt from draw downs on our lines of credit incurs interest at the Prime Lending Rate which would change from time to time.  It is not  possible to  anticipate  the level of interest  rates going  forward. Changes in interest rates have little impact as the majority of our debt is at a fixed interest rate.   ITEM 8.
