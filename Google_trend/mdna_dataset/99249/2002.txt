BUSINESS  Except  for  historical  information  contained herein, the following discussion contains  forward-looking  statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding future  events  and  our plans and expectations. Our actual results could differ materially  from  those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under "Factors  That  May Affect Future Results," and "Forward looking Statements", as well  as  those  discussed  elsewhere  in  this  Form  10-K.  GENERAL  DEVELOPMENT  OF  BUSINESS. - ----------------------------------  Regency  Affiliates,  Inc.,  formerly  TransContinental  Energy Corporation, was organized  as  a  Delaware  corporation  in  1980  to  be  the  successor  to Transcontinental  Oil  Corporation,  which  existed  since  1947.  After  a  restructuring  in  1992, the Company, on July 7, 1993, acquired an 80% interest  in  National  Resource  Development  Corporation  ("NRDC")  (the "NRDC Transaction")  by  the  issuance of 2,975,000 shares of the Company's $0.40 P.V. Common Stock, 208,850 shares of the Company's cumulative $100 Series C Preferred Stock  and  20%  of  the outstanding shares of Transcontinental Drilling Company ("Drilling"),  a  subsidiary  of  the  Company  to  the  Statesman  Group,  Inc. ("Statesman"), an international business corporation organized under the laws of the  Bahamas  (see  Item  12).  NRDC's  principal  asset  consists of previously quarried  and  stockpiled  rock  (Aggregate) inventory located at a mine site in Michigan.  The  Aggregate  inventory  was pledged to secure repayment of certain Zero Coupon Bonds which have been issued by NRDC having a face value at maturity of  $542,000  on  January  1, 2002. These Bonds were retired in 1999 through the issuance  of  common stock of the Company.   As part of the NRDC Transaction, we acquired 80% of the issued and outstanding stock of NRDC. The remainder (20%) is owned  by  Statesman.  On  November  18,  1994,  we acquired a limited partnership interest in Security Land  and  Development  Company  Limited  Partnership (the "Partnership") for an equity  investment  of $350,000. The Partnership owns an office building complex in  Woodlawn,  Maryland,  which  is  leased to the United States Social Security Administration.  On  March 17, 1997, Regency, through Rustic Crafts International, Inc., a wholly owned  subsidiary, acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Rustic Crafts,  Co.,  Inc.,  a manufacturer of wood and cast marble decorative electric fireplaces  and related accessories. Consideration for the acquisition consisted of cash of $1,100,000, assumption of certain liabilities, and 100,000 restricted shares  of  our  Common  Stock.  On  April  22, 1999, we acquired 513,915 shares of the common stock of Glas-Aire Industries  Group,  Ltd.  ("Glas-Aire")  in  exchange  for  a promissory note of $650,000  due January 1, 2000, at an interest rate of 7.5% per annum, which note was  guaranteed  by  Mr.  William  Ponsoldt,  Sr.,  President  of  Regency,  and                                         -3-  $1,213,000  in cash. Glas-Aire is a reporting company, and its shares are listed on  the  Nasdaq  small  cap  market  under  the symbol "GLAR" and on the Pacific Exchange "GLA". The cash was obtained from an affiliate of Statesman through the issuance  of an unsecured demand note at the interest rate of 7.5% per annum. We also purchased 3,000 shares of the common stock of Glas-Aire on the open market.  On August 2, 1999, we acquired 41,600 shares of the common stock of Glas-Aire on the  open  market  for  $119,619.  The  funds  were  provided by an affiliate of Statesman  on  an  unsecured  basis.  On  August  14,  1999, we sold 2,852,375 shares of our common stock to Glas-Aire for  cash  of  $1,967,960  and 86,000 shares of Glas-Aire common stock for total consideration  of  $2,281,900.  On  September 23, 1999, we closed a common stock exchange agreement with certain shareholders  of  Glas-Aire.  Under  the  agreement,  Regency,  in  a  private transaction,  issued  1,188,000  shares  of  its restricted common stock to such shareholders  in  exchange  for  288,000  Glas-Aire  common  shares  held by the shareholders.  On  October  1,  2001,  we announced that we had completed a transaction for the disposing  of  our interest in Glas-Aire.  Pursuant to an agreement entered into on  September  17,  2001  and amended on October 1, 2001, we exchanged 1,215,105 shares  of  common  stock  of  Glas-Aire,  representing approximately 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of Glas-Aire, for $2,500,000 plus 4,040,375 shares of  our  common stock, or approximately 23% of the issued and outstanding shares of  Regency.  As a result of the transaction, neither Regency nor Glas-Aire owns any  stock  of  the  other.  FINANCIAL  INFORMATION  ABOUT  INDUSTRY  SEGMENTS  AND  FOREIGN  AND  DOMESTIC - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ OPERATIONS. - -----------  Reference  is  made  to  the Regency's financial statements at page F-1 for this information.  NARRATIVE  DESCRIPTION  OF  BUSINESS. - ------------------------------------  NATIONAL  RESOURCE  DEVELOPMENT  CORPORATION  NRDC  had  as  its  principal  asset  approximately  70  million  short  tons of previously quarried and stockpiled rock ("Aggregate") located at the site of the Groveland  Mine  in  Dickinson County, Michigan. Aggregate is primarily sold for railroad  ballast,  road  construction,  construction  along  shorelines  and decorative  uses.  The  market for Aggregate stone is highly competitive and, as shipping  costs  are  high, the majority of sales, if any, are anticipated to be made  locally.  Other  companies  that  produce  rock and Aggregate products are located  in  the  same  region as the Groveland Mine. There are competitors have greater  financial  and  personnel  resources. As a consequence, there can be no assurance  that  acting alone, NRDC will be able to consummate sales of material amounts  of  its  Aggregate.  In  December  2001, the aggregate inventory was sold to Iron Mountain Resources, Inc., a 75% owned subsidiary of the company.  The purchase price was $18,200,000 and  is  payable,  with  interest  of  2.46%,  in  ninety-six  equal payments of                                         -4-  principal  and interest commencing December 2003.  The intercompany gain on this transaction  has  been  eliminated in the consolidation process resulting in the aggregate  inventory  being  carried  at  its  historical  cost  Our  Aggregate  is commingled with other aggregate not owned by NRDC and is rock that  was  separated  from  iron  ore  during  previous  mining  operations. The ownership  of  the  Aggregate  is  subject  to a Royalty Agreement between North American  Demolition  Company (International Aggregate Corporation's predecessor in  title)  and  M.A.  Hanna  Company dated December 22, 1989, as amended, which requires  the  payment  of certain royalties to M.A. Hanna Company upon sales of Aggregate.  SECURITY  LAND  AND  DEVELOPMENT  COMPANY  LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP  On  November  18,  1994,  we acquired a limited partnership interest in Security Land  And  Development  Company  Limited  Partnership (the "Partnership") for an equity investment of $350,000. We have no obligation to make any further capital contribution  to  the  Partnership.  The Partnership owns the 34.3-acre Security West  complex  at  1500  Woodlawn  Drive, Woodlawn, MD consisting of a two-story office  building  and  a connected six-story office tower occupied by the United States  Social  Security  Administration  Office of Disability and International Operations  under a nine-year lease expiring October 31, 2003 (the "Lease"). The buildings  have  a  net  rentable area of approximately 717,000 square feet. The construction of the Security West Buildings was completed in 1972 and the Social Security  Administration has occupied the building since 1972 under prior leases between  the  U.S.  Government  and  the  Partnership.  During  1994,  the  Partnership  completed  the  placement  of  a  $56,450,000 non-recourse  project  note, due November 15, 2003. The placement of the project note  was  undertaken by the issuance of 7.90% certificates of participation and was  underwritten  by Dillon Read & Co., Inc. The net proceeds received from the sale of the certificates were used to refinance existing debt of the Partnership related  to  the  project,  to finance certain alterations to the project by the Partnership,  to  fund  certain  reserves  and  to pay costs of the project note issue.  The  project note is a non-recourse obligation of the Partnership and is payable  solely  from  the  Lease payments from the U.S. Government. Such rental payments  under  the Lease are not subject to annual appropriation by the United States  Congress  and  accordingly,  the  obligations  to make such payments are unconditional general obligations of the Government backed by the full faith and credit  of the United States. The payments under the Lease consist of base rent, maintenance  rent,  additional  base  rent,  additional maintenance rent and the government  tax  reimbursement  amount.  The  base  rent,  maintenance  rent and additional  base  rent  are fixed amounts and are not subject to adjustment. The base  rent  and  the  additional base rent together constitute the finance rent, which  will  be  utilized  to  pay  principal  and interest on the project note, certain  real  estate  taxes  and  costs  of  insurance  and  other  reserves.  The  terms  of  the  Security  Land  And Development Company Limited Partnership Agreement  (as amended) and the project note (which note will be fully amortized over  the  term of the lease) call for us to be allocated 95% of the profits and losses  of  the  Partnership  until  October  31,  2003, and 50% thereafter. The investment  in  Security  Land  And  Development  Company  Limited  Partnership Agreement  is  estimated  to  provide  us  with management fees of approximately                                         -5-  $100,000  per annum until 2003. In the year ending December 31, 2001, the income from  our  equity  investment  in  the  Partnership was $5,418,197. These funds, however,  are  presently  committed  for  the  amortization  of  the outstanding principal  balance  on Security Land And Development Company Limited Partnership Agreement  real  estate  mortgage  and,  while  our  investment has increased to $2,984,078  the  partnership  does  not provide cash flow to us in excess of the $100,000  annual  management  fee.  The  partnership  agreement provides for the distribution  of "Sale or Refinancing Proceeds" in accordance with the partner's positive  tax  capital  account balances. At December 31, 2001, we were the only partner  with  a  positive  tax  capital  account  balance.  On  November 30, 2000, we invested $10,000 for a 5% Limited Partnership Interest in 1500 Woodlawn Limited Partnership, the General Partner of Security.  In 2001, we  earned  $188,268  from  this  investment.  RUSTIC  CRAFTS  INTERNATIONAL,  INC.  Rustic  Crafts  International,  Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Regency, is a manufacturer  of  decorative  wood and cast marble fireplaces, mantels, shelves, fireplace  accessories  and  other  home furnishings.  Rustic Crafts employed 26 people  at  December  31,  2001.  In  2001  and 2000 Rustic Crafts generated net sales of approximately $2,407,722 and  $3,313,827  respectively.  Rustic  Crafts  had  Net  (Loss)  Income  before Management  Fees  of $(510,064) and $150,571 respectively, over the same period. As of December 31, 2001, Rustic Crafts had approximately $264,000 of open orders compared  to  approximately  $225,000  in  2000.  Although  orders are generally subject to termination, we have historically experienced minimal cancellation of orders.  Rustic Crafts purchases the raw materials used in its manufacturing process from several suppliers. We believe that there is minimal risk from any termination of suppliers  and  that  there  are  several suppliers who are capable of supplying similar  quality  products  at  competitive  prices.  Rustic  Crafts  has  a  number  of  competitors for its products, and management considers  the  business  to  be  competitive.  GLAS-AIRE  INDUSTRIES  GROUP,  LTD.  Glas-Aire  Industries  Group, LTD. (Glas-Aire), a publicly traded Company, was a subsidiary  of  Regency.  Glas-Aire  designs,  develops,  manufactures and sells sunroof  deflectors,  hood  protectors  and  rear air deflectors for cars, light trucks  and vans. It uses plastics and thermoforming technology to produce these products.  Glas-Aire's  products  are used in the diverse and growing automotive components  market,  comprised  of  after-market  accessories,  dealer installed accessories, car care products and other products purchased by consumers for the purpose  of  improving  their  vehicles  (versus  those  purchased  for  routine maintenance).  Glas-Aire  participates  in  the  OEM  segment  of the appearance accessory  market,  providing products to the automotive manufacturers that then distribute  the  products  to consumers through their dealer networks. Glas-Aire employs  approximately  208  persons.                                         -6-  On  October  1,  2001,  we announced that we had completed a transaction for the disposing  of  our interest in Glas-Aire.  Pursuant to an agreement entered into on  September  17,  2001  and amended on October 1, 2001, we exchanged 1,215,105 shares  of  common  stock  of  Glas-Aire,  representing approximately 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of Glas-Aire, for $2,500,000 plus 4,040,375 shares of  our  common stock, or approximately 23% of the issued and outstanding shares of  Regency.  As a result of the transaction, neither Regency nor Glas-Aire owns any  stock  of  the  other  at  December  31,  2001  Glas-Aire  generated  net  sales  of $8,378,202 for the nine-month period ending September  30, 2001.  Income before income from equity investment and income tax expense  was  $449,040  over  the  same  period.  Glas-Aire had been included in Regency's  consolidated  financial  statements effective September 23, 1999 (the date  that  we  acquired 51.3% control of Glas-Aire) through September 30, 2001.  As  of December 31, 2001, Regency and its subsidiaries employed approximately 28 people.  REGTRANSCO,  INC.  RegTransco,  Inc. (RTI) has two classes of outstanding common stock, Class A and Class  B.  There  are  20,000  shares of Class common stocks outstanding, all of which  are  owned  by  Drilling  (an 80% owned subsidiary of Regency Affiliates, Inc.).  Five  thousand (5,000) shares of Class B common stock were issued to the Original  Investors  who financed the our Chapter XI filing in 1986 and 1987 and represented  20%  of the voting power of RTI's outstanding common stock. As part of  the  1992 Restructuring, the holders of the Class B stock returned their 20% interest  as a group to RTI. RTI's Class A and Class B common stock are equal to each  other  in  all  respects  except dividend preference. Holders of shares of Class  A  and  Class  B  common  stock are entitled to one vote per share in the election  of  directors.  This  entity  has  no  current  operations.  TRANSCONTINENTAL  DRILLING  COMPANY  ("DRILLING")  As  part  of the NRDC Transaction, Drilling issued sufficient shares to transfer 20%  of  the  issued  and outstanding stock of Drilling to Statesman. We own the remaining  80%.  This  entity  has  no  current  operations.  SPEED.COM,  INC.  Speed.com  is  a wholly owned subsidiary of Regency Affiliates, Inc.  Previously this  entity  was  involved  in  the  purchase of Glas Aire.  This entity has no current  operations.  IRON  MOUNTAIN  RESOURCES,  INC.  In  December  2001, the aggregate inventory was sold to Iron Mountain Resources, Inc., a 75% owned subsidiary of the company.  The purchase price was $18,200,000 and  is  payable,  with  interest  of  2.46%,  in  ninety-six  equal payments of principal  and interest commencing December 2003.  The intercompany gain on this                                         -7-  transaction  has  been  eliminated in the consolidation process resulting in the aggregate  inventory  being  carried  at  its  historical  cost.   ITEM  2.     PROPERTIES  The  Partnership  owns  the  Security  West  Building  at  1500  Woodlawn Drive, Woodlawn,  MD.  In  March 1998, Rustic Craft purchased a 117,000 square foot building located at 40  Poplar  Street  in  Scranton,  Pennsylvania.  The building was renovated and occupied  in  early  1999.  Approximately 14,000 square feet in this building is leased  to another tenant. The manufacturing operation uses approximately 75,000 square  feet  of the building.  This facility should satisfy Rustic Crafts needs for  the  foreseeable  future.  ITEM  3.     LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS  On February 7, 2002 a complaint naming Regency Affiliates, Inc. as Defendant was filed  in the District Court of Douglas County, Nebraska, case number 1012.  The Plaintiffs  are Larry J. Horbach, individually and L.J. Horbach & Associates and they  are demanding payment on a Regency Affiliates loan they purchased from Mid City  Bank.  The  plaintiffs  are  requesting payment of $82,512.57 plus accrued interest,  costs and attorney fees.  We are vigorously defending this litigation and  had  previously commenced litigation regarding the same subject in December 2001.  On  December  14,  2001  we  initiated  a proceeding in The Circuit Court of the Nineteenth  Judicial  Circuit  in  and  for  Martin County, Florida, case number 01-1087-CA against Larry J. Horbach, individually and L.J. Horbach & Associates. Larry  Horbach  was  a former interim CFO and Board member.  We claim that Larry Horbach,  without appropriate authority, borrowed $100,050 from Mid City Bank in the name of Regency.  We further claim that Horbach converted all or part of the proceeds  from  the  loan  for  his  benefit.  On  September 13, 2001, Glas Aire Industries LTD., Multicorp Holdings Inc., Glas Aire  Industries  Group  Ltd,  Craig  Grossman,  Todd  Garrett, Speed.Com, Inc., Regency  Affiliates,  Inc.,  William Ponsoldt, and Marc Baldinger were listed as defendants in a proceeding in the Supreme Court of British Columbia with Alex Y. W.  Ding  as  plaintiff.   The  case  number  is  S015104.  Mr. Ding, the former president  of  Glas-Aire,  has  asserted that the October 2001 Regency-Glas-Aire transaction is in breach of bank agreements, securities law and fiduciary duties owed  to  Glas-Aire  and  its  stockholders.  While the company has been served, plaintiff  has  not  proceeded  on  this action and has not filed a statement of claim  on  a  timely  basis.  Should  plaintiff  continue  with  the action, the defendants,  including  Regency,  would  vigorously  defend  this  litigation  ITEM  4.

ISSUANCE  OF  UNREGISTERED  SECURITIES.  Effective  June  3, 1997, we issued 466,667 shares of Common Stock at a value of $233,333  and  options  to  purchase  an additional 6.1 million shares of Common Stock  to  Statesman  Group,  Inc.  On  October  15,  2001,  Statesman  exercised  the option in full pursuant to an agreement  that  (1) provided for a purchase price at $.40 per share (par value) rather  than  the  formula  price  in  the  option,  which  would  have  yielded approximately  25%  less and (2) provided for collateral for the $2.44 million 5 year  note  issued by Statesman to Regency (in addition to the shares purchased) in  the  form  of the 20% stock interest owned by Statesman in National Resource Development  Corporation,  our  80%  owned  subsidiary.                                         -10-  We  consider these securities to have been offered and sold in a transaction not involving a public offering and, therefore, to be exempt from Registration under Section  4(2)  of  the  Securities  Act  of  1933  as  amended.

MANAGEMENT  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND              RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS.  FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS. - ----------------------------  CERTAIN  STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED  TO,  THOSE  REGARDING  OUR  FINANCIAL POSITION, BUSINESS STRATEGY, ACQUISITION  STRATEGY  AND  OTHER PLANS AND OBJECTIVES FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS AND ANY  OTHER  STATEMENTS THAT ARE NOT HISTORICAL FACTS CONSTITUTE "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS"  EXPECTATIONS  AND BELIEFS CONCERNING FUTURE EVENTS IMPACTING US AND ARE  SUBJECT  TO UNCERTAINTIES AND FACTORS (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE                                         -12-  SPECIFIED  BELOW)  WHICH  ARE  DIFFICULT  TO PREDICT AND, IN MANY INSTANCES, ARE BEYOND  OUR CONTROL.  AS A RESULT, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE  RESULTS CONTEMPLATED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WHICH INCLUDE BUT ARE  NOT  LIMITED  TO:       (i)  WE  CURRENTLY  DO  NOT  GENERATE  POSITIVE  CASH  FLOW  AS OUR CURRENT           ACTIVITIES DO NOT, IN AND OF THEMSELVES, GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW           TO COVER OUR CORPORATE OPERATING EXPENSES AND THUS WE MUST RELY ON OUR           CASH  RESERVES  TO  FUND  THESE  EXPENSES.  OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE IN           EXISTENCE  IS PARTLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTAIN SATISFACTORY           LEVELS  OF  OPERATING  CASH  FLOWS.       (ii)  WE  CURRENTLY  LACK  THE  NECESSARY INFRA STRUCTURE AT THE SITE OF THE           GROVELAND MINE IN ORDER TO PERMIT US TO MAKE MORE THAN CASUAL SALES OF           THE  AGGREGATE.     (iii)  AN  UNSECURED  DEFAULT  IN  THE  LEASE  OR SUDDEN CATASTROPHE  TO  THE           SECURITY  WEST BUILDING FROM UNINSURED ACTS OF GOD OR WAR COULD HAVE A           MATERIALLY  ADVERSE  IMPACT  UPON  OUR INVESTMENT IN SECURITY LAND AND           DEVELOPMENT  COMPANY  LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP AND THEREFORE ITS FINANCIAL           POSITION  AND  RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS.      (IV)  THE  FAILURE  OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION TO RENEW ITS LEASE           OF THE SECURITY WEST BUILDINGS UPON ITS EXPIRATION ON OCTOBER 31, 2003           COULD  HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT UPON OUR INVESTMENT IN SECURITY LAND AND           DEVELOPMENT  COMPANY  LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP.       (V)  WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT TAX LOSS AND CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS AND NO ASSURANCE           CAN BE PROVIDED THAT THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE WOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO           LIMIT  OR  DISALLOW  ALTOGETHER  OUR  USE,  RETROACTIVELY  AND/OR           PROSPECTIVELY,  OF SUCH CARRYFORWARDS, DUE TO OWNERSHIP CHANGES OR ANY           OTHER REASON. THE DISALLOWANCE OF THE UTILIZATION OF OUR NET OPERATING           LOSS  WOULD  SEVERELY  IMPACT  OUR  FINANCIAL  POSITION AND RESULTS OF           OPERATIONS DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF TAXABLE INCOME (GENERATED           BY  OUR  INVESTMENT  IN  SECURITY)  THAT  HAS IN THE PAST BEEN, AND IS           EXPECTED  IN  THE  FUTURE  TO BE, OFFSET BY THE OUR NET OPERATING LOSS           CARRYFORWARDS.   GENERAL  We are the parent of several subsidiary business operations. We are committed to develop  and/or  monetize  these  business  operations  for  the  benefit of our shareholders and continue to commit both financial and personnel resources to an active  merger  and acquisition program in order to enhance common shareholders' values.  Our  Shareholders'  Equity  at  December 31, 2001 was $19,878,174 as compared to $16,076,052  on  December  31,  2000,  an  increase  of  19.13%.                                         -13-  LIQUIDITY  AND  CAPITAL  RESOURCES.  The  investment  in  Security is estimated to provide us with management fees of approximately  $100,000  per  annum  until 2003. In the years ended December 31, 2001,  December  31,  2000,  December  31,  1999,  our  income  from  the equity investment  in  the  Partnership  was  $5,418,197,  $4,712,615,  and $4,261,212, respectively. These funds, however, are presently committed for the amortization of  the  outstanding  principal  balance on Security's real estate mortgage and, while  our  equity investment has increased to $29,984,078, the partnership does not provide liquidity to us in excess of the $100,000 annual management fee. The partnership  agreement  provides  for  the  distribution of "Sale or Refinancing Proceeds"  in  accordance  with  the  partner's  positive  tax  capital  account balances.  At  December  31,  2001, we were the only partner with a positive tax capital  account  balance.  We  have  been  previously  successful  in obtaining financing  with  respect  to  this  partnership interest to fund our acquisition program  and  cash  flow  deficits.  Following  the  termination  of  the 1999 NRDC Plan of Merger with Cotton Valley Resources  Corporation,  we  installed  limited Aggregate crushing and marketing operations  at  the  Groveland  Mine  in  an informal joint venture with another company.  Pending the outcome of current discussions regarding the possible sale of the our interest, we also continue to explore the possibility of establishing a permanent infrastructure to commercialize the inventory of previously quarried and  stockpiled Aggregate at the Groveland Mine. In December 2001, the aggregate inventory  was  sold to Iron Mountain Resources, Inc., a 75% owned subsidiary of the  company.  The  purchase price was $18,200,000 and is payable, with interest of  2.46%,  in  ninety-six  equal  payments of principal and interest commencing December 2003.  The intercompany gain on this transaction has been eliminated in the  consolidation process resulting in the aggregate inventory being carried at it's  historical  cost.  We sold 2,852,375 shares of our common stock to Glas-Aire for cash of $1,967,960 and 86,000 shares of Glas-Aire common stock. The proceeds were used to repay the funding  provided  by  an  affiliate  of  Statesman  and other general corporate requirements.  We  continue  to explore opportunities to acquire companies with operations that will  provide  additional  liquidity  and cash flow.  Our ability to continue in existence  is partly dependent upon our ability to attain satisfactory levels of operating  cash  flows  and  our  ability  to  continue  borrowing.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  2001 COMPARED TO 2000  Net  sales  decreased  $3,456,848  compared  to  2000, a 24% decrease. Net sales included  $8,378,202  of  Glas-Aire  sales  through September 30, 2001, when the investment  in  Glas Aire was disposed. Sales of household accessories decreased by  $903,028  due  to  general economic conditions, the effects of September 11, 2001, and a reduction in the purchases of a large retail customer. Rustic Crafts continues  to  emphasize higher margin sales in 2001, has begun diversifying its product  line,  and  has  reduced its reliance on its single large customer, who required  discounted  prices.                                         -14-  Gross  margins  decreased  $1,273,429  in  2001  over  2000,  which is primarily attributable  to the disposition of Glas-Aire and its inclusion in the company's financial  statements  through  only  September  30, 2001. Gross margins of home accessories  decreased  $437,441  in  2001  reflecting  the  softer  economic conditions,  and  a  reduced  reliance  on  its  single  largest  customer.  Selling  and  administrative  expenses  were  reduced by $18,467 or 3.4% in 2001 compared  to  2000.  Increases  in  professional  fees  were  offset  by similar reductions  attributable  closing  the  Omaha  office  and  removal of Glas-Aire activities  from  September  30,  2001.  Expenses  increased at Rustic Crafts by $57,132  as  a result of an increase in spending for Research and Development to diversify  into  other  product lines and higher costs of selling and marketing.  Income from equity investment in partnership increased $705,582 over 2000 due to the  reduction  of  interest expenses on the lower loan principal balance of the partnership.  Interest  expense  increased  by $94,197 in 2001 over 2000 as a result of higher loan  balances  at  Rustic  Crafts  and  of  Regency.  Income  tax  expense  decreased  $58,082  due  to  lower  income tax expense for Glas-Aire.  Regency  cannot use its net operating loss to offset the earnings of Glas  Aire.  Minority  interest  in  the  Statement  of  Operations  decreased  $118,045  due primarily  to  the  elimination  of  the  results  of  operations  of Glas-Aire.  Net income increased $1,518,428 or 70.5% in 2001 over 2000. The increase was due to  the  recognition  of a gain in 2001 resulting from the sale of Glas-Aire and increased  partnership earnings reduced by losses at Rustic Craft. Income before extraordinary  gain  increased  $192,197  or  9.8%  in  2000  over  1999.  2000  COMPARED  TO  1999  Net  sales  increased  $6,507,542  over 1999, an 83% increase. Net sales include $10,929,775  of  Glas-Aire  sales.  Sales  of household accessories decreased by $485,286  due to general economic conditions resulting in a decline in sales and a  reduction in backlog orders from the previous period. Rustic Crafts continues to  emphasized  higher  margin  sales in 2000 and to reduce its reliance on it's single  large  customer,  who  requires  discounted  prices.  Gross  margins  increased  $2,050,695  in  2000  over  1999,  which is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Glas-Aire and it's inclusion in the company's financial  statements  for  the  entire  year. Gross margins of home accessories increased  $196,200  in  2000  reflecting  the  Company's focus on higher margin products.  Selling and administrative expenses increased $1,960,385 or 58% in 2000 compared to 1999 The increase is attributable to the inclusion in the companies financial statement  of  Glas-Aire  activities  for the entire year. Expenses increased at Rustic  Crafts by $214,842 as a result of higher costs of selling and marketing, including  the  compensation  of  key  employees.                                         -15-  Income from equity investment in partnership increased $451,403 over 1999 due to the  reduction  of  interest expenses on the lower loan principal balance of the partnership,  partially  offset  by  increased  operating  and  administrative expenses.  Other income decreased $91,085 in 2000 as compared to 1999. Other income in 1999 includes  $114,960  of  equity  earnings  related  to the Company's ownership in Glas-Aire  prior  to  September  1999.  These  earnings were offset by decreased interest  income  from  declining  invested  cash  balances.  Interest  expense  decreased $12,421 in 2000 from 1999 as a result of lower cost of  funds.  Interest expense in 1998 included significant costs and penalties in connection  with  the refinancing of the SIPI loan in June 1998. The elimination of  the refinancing costs was partially offset by additional loans for equipment and  facilities  at  Rustic  Crafts  and the higher loan balance of the KBC loan which  refinanced  the  SIPI  loan.  Income  tax  expense increased $190,984 due to income tax expense for Glas-Aire. The Company cannot use its net operating loss to offset the earnings of this 51% owned  subsidiary.  Minority interest in the Statement of Operations increased $79,128 due primarily to  the inclusion of the results of operations of Glas-Aire for the full year of 2000.  Net  income  decreased $137,668 or 6% in 2000 over 1999. The decrease was due to the  recognition  of  an extraordinary gain in 1999. Income before extraordinary gain  increased  $192,937  or  9.8%  in  2000  over  1999.  ITEM  7A.     QUANTITATIVE  AND  QUALITATIVE  DISCLOSURES  ABOUT  MARKET  RISK  We  are  exposed  to financial market risks due primarily to changes in interest rates.  We  do  not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of our debt  securities. We have no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments and we  do  not  transact  business  in  foreign  currencies.  The  fair  value of our cash and cash equivalents or related income would not be significantly  impacted  by  changes  in  interest  rates  since  the investment maturities are short. Debt from drawdowns on our lines of credit incurs interest at  the  Prime  Lending  Rate,  which  would  change  from  time  to  time.  It  is  not  possible  to  anticipate the level of interest rates going forward. Changes in interest rates have little impact as the majority of our debt is at a fixed  interest  rate.  ITEM  8.
