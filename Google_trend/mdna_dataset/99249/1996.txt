ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.           The Company may, from time to time, issue forward looking statements, including, but not limited to the statements of future economic performance contained in Item 7 of this Report, or elsewhere herein.  Such forward looking statements, whether contained in this report on Form 10-K, or elsewhere, are subject to the following factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements:           (i)     The Company suffers from a severe lack of liquidity and its                  ability to remain a going concern is dependent upon the                  Company's ability to continue to raise working capital from                  its shareholders, or from the sale of its assets or securities                  or from the proceeds of outside financing.           (ii)    The Company lacks the necessary infrastructure at the site of                  the Groveland Mine, and the capital necessary to place such                  infrastructure in place, in order to permit the company to                  make more than casual sales of the Aggregate.           (iii)   The Company's lack of operations render the Company dependant                  upon the investment in Security Land And Development Company                  Limited Partnership for a material portion of its cash flow                  and for a material portion of its reportable income.           (iv)    The investment activities of the Company do not, in and of                  themselves, generate sufficient cash flow to permit the                  Company to continue as a going concern.           (v)     An unsecured default in the Lease or sudden catastrophe to the                  Security West Building from uninsured acts of God or war could                  have a materially adverse impact upon the Company's investment                  in Security Land And Development Company Limited Partnership.            Liquidity and Capital Resources.            In the last quarter of 1994, Regency Affiliates, Inc. commenced a private placement of its Cumulative Convertible $100 Series-E Preferred Stock and $0.40 p.v. Common Stock (the "Private Placement") in a transaction reported on  Form D, Notice of Sale of Securities Pursuant To Regulation D, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 23, 1994, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference thereto.  As of February 9, 1995, the most recent sale under the Private Placement, Regency Affiliates, Inc. had placed 57 Units ($570,000) of the $350,000 minimum, $800,000 maximum offering. The securities were offered in 80 Units, each consisting of 88.5 shares in Cumulative Convertible $100 Series-E Preferred Stock and 6,000 shares                                             15    16 of the Common Stock, to accredited investors as defined in Regulation D for a cost of $10,000 per unit.  The proceeds of the offering were used for to cover negative operating cash flows.  Because of the restatement of the acquisition cost of NRDC reported in the Company's report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 1994, management has determined to offer rescission to certain of the purchasers in the Private Placement.  Management believes there is no substantial likelihood that the offerees will exercise rescission because the restatement does not result from a change in the fair market value of the Aggregate.  However, should all of the offerees exercise the right of rescission, the Company would have inadequate cash resources to pay them in full.           The investment in Security Land And Development Company Limited Partnership should provide the Company with management fees of at least $100,000 per annum until 2003.  In the fiscal year ending December 31, 1995, the Company's income from its equity investment in the Partnership was $3,718,056.           Despite the cash flow from the Partnership and the working capital raised by the Private Placement, the Company continues to suffer from a relative lack of liquidity and capital resources.  Gary K. Nuttall, who was elected as the Company's President on February 1, 1996, is, in large part, focusing his efforts on obtaining a financing to be secured by the Company's investment in Security Land And Development Company Limited Partnership.  While preliminary negotiations have been favorable and the board of directors of a potential lender has given its approval to a loan to the Company, neither due diligence nor definitive loan agreements have been concluded, and there can be no assurance that the contemplated transaction will be consummated.           Regency Affiliates, Inc. is continuing to explore opportunities for the acquisition of companies with operations that will provide additional liquidity and cash flow.  The Company anticipates that such acquisitions would be financed by borrowings secured by the assets acquired and by the Company's investment in Security Land And Development Company Limited Partnership.  The Company is also continuing to explore transactions which would utilize the Company's uncommitted and remaining net operating losses.  There can be no assurances that any such acquisitions or transactions will come to fruition.           As part of the 1993 Transaction with NRDC, the Company received a working capital loan of $100,000 from Statesman Group, Inc., which loan matured on July 7, 1995 and carries a 10% interest obligation payable quarterly in arrears.  Statesman has agreed to extend the maturity of its loan beyond 1995, to a date yet to be determined.  During 1994, the Company paid Statesman $15,509.22 in interest and $97,464.32 in principal, bringing the loans current as of December 31, 1994.  As of December 31, 1995, the Company had a principal balance outstanding on notes payable to Statesman of $80,000.                                             16    17          Results of Operations.           The operations of Regency Affiliates, Inc. and its subsidiaries in 1995 were limited to casual sales of Aggregate (less than $3,000) and the Company's ongoing effort to secure acquisitions and/or business combinations to provide the Company with material operations and cash flow.           SFAS 121.           In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard (SFAS 121), "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of."  SFAS 121 requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  SFAS 121 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995.  The Company intends to adopt SFAS 121 in the first quarter of 1996. The Company does not believe its adoption will have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operation.    ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
