Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial              Condition and Results of Operations       Results of Operations       Year Ended 2000 Compared to Year Ended 1999       Net sales increased $55.6 million, or 8.9%, to a record      $677.5 million in 2000 from $621.9 million in 1999, despite      the elimination of $19.4 million in sales from disposed of      operations that were included in 1999 sales and a slowdown in      the automotive and building products markets in the fourth      quarter of 2000.  This increase primarily resulted from      including the net sales of Milcor (acquired July 17, 2000)      (the 2000 acquisition) from its acquisition date, and a full      year of net sales of Southeastern Heat Treating (acquired      April 1, 1999), Weather Guard (acquired July 1, 1999), Hi-      Temp (acquired August 1, 1999), Brazing Concepts (acquired      November 1, 1999) and Hughes (acquired December 1, 1999) (the      1999 acquisitions), together with sales growth at existing      operations.       Cost of sales increased $47.8 million, or 9.7%, to $541.7      million in 2000 from $493.9 million in 1999.  Cost of sales      as a percentage of net sales increased to 80.0% in 2000 from      79.4% in 1999 primarily due to  the impact of the slowdown in      the automotive and construction products markets in the      fourth quarter of 2000.       Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $3.4      million, or 4.7%, to $75.9 million in 2000 from $72.5 million      in 1999. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a      percentage of net sales decreased to 11.2% in 2000 from 11.7%      in 1999 primarily due to the elimination of expenses from      disposed of operations and decreases in performance based      compensation, partially offset by higher costs attributable      to the 1999 and 2000 acquisitions.       Interest expense increased $5.5 million from 1999 to 2000 due      to higher borrowings as a result of the acquisitions, current      year capital expenditures and due to a higher effective      interest rate in 2000 than in 1999.       As a result of the above, income before taxes decreased $1.1      million, or 2.6%, to $40.9 million in 2000 from $42.0 million      in 1999.       Income taxes approximated $16.6 million in 2000, based on a      40.5% effective rate.        Year Ended 1999 Compared to Year Ended 1998       Net sales increased $64.0 million, or 11.5%, to $621.9      million in 1999 from $557.9 million in 1998.  This increase      primarily resulted from including the net sales of      Southeastern Heat Treating (acquired April 1, 1999), Weather      Guard (acquired July 1, 1999), Hi-Temp (acquired August 1,      1999), Brazing Concepts (acquired November 1, 1999) and      Hughes (acquired December 1, 1999) (the 1999 acquisitions)      from their respective acquisition dates, and a full year of      net sales of Solar (acquired March 1, 1998), Appleton      (acquired April 1, 1998), USP (acquired June 1, 1998) and      Harbor (acquired October 1, 1998) (the 1998 acquisitions),      together with sales growth at existing operations.       Cost of sales increased $37.5 million, or 8.2%, to $493.9      million in 1999 from $456.4 million in 1998.  Cost of sales      as a percentage of net sales decreased to 79.4% in 1999 from      81.8% in 1998.  This improvement was due to the 1999 and 1998      acquisitions, which have historically generated higher      margins than the Company's existing operations, and due to      lower raw material costs at existing operations.                                      14       Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $15.5      million, or 27.1%, to $72.5 million in 1999 from $57.0 in      1998.  Selling, general and administrative expenses as a      percentage of net sales increased to 11.7% in 1999 from 10.2%      in 1998.  This increase was due to higher costs as a      percentage of net sales attributable to the 1999 and 1998      acquisitions, and due to performance based compensation      linked to the Company's sales and profitability.       Interest expense increased by $2.0 million from 1998 to 1999      primarily due to higher borrowings in 1999 as a result of the      Company's current year acquisitions and capital expenditures      and due to a higher effective interest rate in 1999 than in      1998.       As a result of the above, income before taxes increased $9.0      million, or 27.1%, to $42.0 million in 1999 from $33.1      million in 1998.       Income taxes approximated $17.0 million in 1999, based on a      40.5% effective rate compared with a 40.0% effective rate in      1998.        Liquidity and Capital Resources       During 2000, the Company's working capital increased by $19.5      million to $132.4 million at December 31, 2000 from $112.9      million at December 31, 1999 primarily from the inclusion of      inventories of the 2000 acquisition, and a decrease in      accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from      decreased purchases during the fourth quarter of 2000 in      response to the slowdown in the automotive and construction      products markets.  Long-term debt decreased to 55% of total      capitalization, despite increasing by $20.2 million to $255.5      million, at December 31, 2000.  Additionally, shareholders'      equity increased by 12.3% to $208.3 million.       The Company's principal capital requirements are to fund its      operations, including working capital requirements, the      purchase and funding of improvements to its property and      equipment, and to fund acquisitions.       The Company's primary sources of liquidity are from cash      provided by operating activities and the Company's revolving      credit facility.  Net cash provided by operations of $34.1      million resulted primarily from net income of $24.4 million,      depreciation and amortization of $21.2 million, the provision      for deferred income taxes of $5.3 million and a decrease in      accounts receivable of $5.7 million, offset by decreases in      accounts payable and accrued expenses of $16.6 million and      increases in other current assets of $2.8 million and other      assets of $2.6 million.       During 2000, the Company amended its revolving credit      agreement with its bank group to increase the capacity of its      revolver to $310 million.  Borrowings thereunder are secured      with its accounts receivable, inventories and property and      equipment.  At December 31, 2000, the Company had interest      rate swap agreements outstanding which effectively converted      $50 million of borrowings under the revolving credit      agreement to fixed rates ranging from 7.47% to 8.18%.  The      Company accounts for interest rate swap agreements on an      accrual basis.  Additional borrowings under the revolving      credit facility carry interest at LIBOR plus a fixed rate.      The weighted average interest rate of these borrowings was      8.70% at December 31, 2000.       Net cash provided by operations of $34.1 million, $7.8      million net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment      and the net proceeds from long-term debt of $19.2 million      were primarily used for the acquisition of Milcor, capital      expenditures and payment of cash dividends.                                     15        The Company believes that availability under its credit      facility, together with funds generated from operations, will      be more than sufficient to provide the Company with the      liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund its      anticipated working capital requirements, acquisitions and      capital expenditure commitments for the next twelve months.       The Company believes that environmental issues will not      require the expenditure of material amounts for environmental      compliance in the future.        Recent Accounting Pronouncement       In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board      issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133      Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities      (FAS No. 133) which requires recognition of the fair value      of derivatives in the statement of financial position, with      changes in the fair value recognized either in earnings or      as a component of other comprehensive income dependent upon      the hedging nature of the derivative.  Implementation of FAS      No. 133 is required for fiscal 2001.  FAS No. 133 will not      have a material impact on the Company's earnings or other      comprehensive income.                             Safe Harbor Statement       The Company wishes to take advantage of the Safe Harbor      provisions included in the Private Securities Litigation      Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act").  Statements by the Company,      other than historical information, constitute "forward      looking statements" within the meaning of the Act and may be      subject to a number of risk factors.  Factors that could      affect these statements include, but are not limited to, the      following:  the impact of changing steel prices on the      Company's results of operations; changing demand for the      company's products and services; the impact of the Year 2000      matter; and changes in interest or tax rates.                                      16                 Company Responsibility For Financial Statements        The accompanying consolidated financial statements of      Gibraltar Steel Corporation have been prepared by management,      which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.      The statements have been prepared in conformity with      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States      and include amounts based on management's best estimates and      judgments.  Financial information elsewhere in this Annual      Report is consistent with that in the consolidated financial      statements.       The Company has established and maintains a system of      internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance      that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records      reflect the authorized transactions of the Company.       The financial statements have been audited by      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants.  As part      of their audit of the Company's 2000 financial statements,      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP considered the Company's system of      internal control to the extent they deemed necessary to      determine the nature, timing and extent of their audit tests.       The Board of Directors pursues its responsibility for the      Company's financial reporting through its Audit Committee,      which is composed entirely of outside directors.  The      independent accountants have direct access to the Audit      Committee, with and without the presence of management      representatives, to discuss the results of their audit work      and their comments on the adequacy of internal accounting      controls and the quality of financial reporting.
