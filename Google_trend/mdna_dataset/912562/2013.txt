Company Overview    Gibraltar is a leadingmanufacturer and distributor of products for the building and industrial markets. Our products provide structural and architectural enhancements for residential homes, low-rise retail, other commercial and professional buildings, industrial plants,bridges and a wide variety of other structures. These products include ventilation products, mail storage solutions including mailboxes and package delivery products, rain dispersion products and accessories, bar grating, expanded metal, metal lathand expansion joints and structural bearings. We believe Gibraltar has strong brand recognition in these product categories which provides us with product leadership positions. We serve customers throughout North America, Europe, Asia, and Centraland South America including major home improvement retailers, distributors and contractors. As of December 31, 2012, we operated 44 facilities in 21 states, Canada, England and Germany, giving us a broad platform for just-in-time delivery andsupport to our customers. Our common stock is trading on the NASDAQ stock market under the ticker symbol ROCK.    Our customersprincipally serve the home improvement; new residential, low-rise commercial; bridge and highway construction and a variety of industrial markets. A majority of our products are sold through sales channels. Major customers include The Home Depot,other big box retailers, national building products wholesalers, industrial equipment manufacturers and contractors.    We believe that we haveestablished a reputation as an industry leader in quality, service and innovation and have achieved strong competitive positions in our markets. We attribute our standing in the market primarily to the following competitive strengths:   Leading market share.  We have a leading market position in many of the products and services we offer, and we estimate that a majority of our netsales for the year ended December 31, 2012 were derived from the sale of products in which we had one of the leading U.S. market shares. We believe we have leading market shares in six distinct product families.   Diversified product mix and manufacturing base . We manufacture an extensive variety of products that are sold through building materialwholesalers, buying groups, discount and major retail home centers, roofing distributors, residential, industrial, commercial, and transportation contractors and industrial manufacturers. We operate 34 manufacturing facilities and eight distributioncenters throughout the United States, Canada, England and Germany, giving us a base of operations to provide customer support, delivery, service and quality to a number of regional and national customers and providing us with manufacturing anddistribution efficiencies in North America, as well as a presence in the European market. Despite our global reach, our capital expenditures have remained low. During each of the last three years, our capital expenditures have averaged 1.5% or lessof net sales. The following table outlines many of our key products sold to both residential and non-residential end markets:               Product        End market        Residential end markets     Roof & foundation ventilation products   Mail storage (single and cluster)   Rain dispersion, flashing, soffits and trim, metallath        New build; repair and remodel  New build; repair and remodel   New build; repairand remodel           Non-residential end markets   Bar grating      Oil, gas and mining; industrial; wastewater and water treatment; leisure and sports parks     Expanded metal and perforated metal      Mining; steel mills; transportation; petro-chemical; architectural facades; security     Engineered public infrastructure products      Bridge construction; highway construction; airport runways       20     Provider of value-added products and services.  We increasingly focus on value-added products andservices, such as mail storage solutions, infrastructure products, and ventilation products, to improve our margins and profitability. We use complex and demanding production and treatment processes that require advanced production equipment,sophisticated technology and exacting quality control measures. We have also targeted our acquisition strategy on producers of value-added products, including, but not limited to, our recent acquisitions of The D.S. Brown Company (D.S.Brown), the largest U.S. manufacturer of specialty components for the transportation infrastructure industry, Pacific Award Metals, Inc. (Award Metals), a leading regional manufacturer of roof ventilation, roof trims, flashing andrain ware, drywall trims and specialty clips and connectors for concrete forms used in the new construction and repair and remodel markets. The Company also acquired the assets of four businesses in 2012:                  Metal grating products for the oil sands region of Western Canada;                  Function-critical components for public infrastructure construction and maintenance;                  Perforated metal products for industrial applications; and                  Sun protection products for new residential construction and home remodeling.   These acquisitions have increased our portfolio of value-added products. We also strive to develop and launch new products, expand our geographic marketcoverage and penetrate new end markets to strengthen our product leadership positions.    Strength in non-residential end markets . Since2007, we have sought to bolster our presence in non-residential end markets through both strategic acquisitions and organic growth, and we estimate that sales from these markets now account for approximately half of the net sales for the company.Our presence in this diverse end market, which serves industries such as oil & gas, mining, transportation and industrial, complements our residential end markets business and provides additional stability.   Solid relationships with blue-chip customers.  We have strong relationships with many of the largest customers in the markets we serve, includingthe building and construction, machinery and general manufacturing industries. Through acquisitions, we have gained new longstanding relationships and we have maintained and developed those relationships by offering an increasing range of productsand providing quality customer support. We have long-standing relationships with many large market leaders such as The Home Depot, other big box retailers, national building products wholesalers, industrial equipment manufacturers and contractors.   Commitment to quality . We place great importance on providing our customers with high quality products for use in criticalconstruction applications. We carefully select our raw material vendors and use inspection and analysis to maintain our quality standards so our products meet critical customer specifications. To meet customer specifications, we use documentedprocedures utilizing statistical process control systems linked directly to processing equipment to monitor many stages of production. A number of our facilities quality systems are registered under ISO 9001, an internationally recognized setof quality-assurance standards, and other industry standards.    History of substantial debt reduction and strong liquidity profile .Since 2007, we have been committed to debt reduction and used cash generated from operations, as well as certain proceeds of asset sales, to make significant repayments against our outstanding debt. Our total debt declined from $487.5 million atDecember 31, 2007 to $207.8 million as of December 31, 2012. We had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2012, and our liquidity as of December 31, 2012 was $165 million, including$48 million of cash and $117 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. We believe that our low leverage and substantial liquidity allows us to successfully manage our business, meet the demands of our customers and weather thecyclicality of certain end markets.    Proven acquisition track record.  Over the last eight years, we have successfully acquired andintegrated over fifteen businesses, including D.S. Brown, Florence Manufacturing and Alabama Metal Industries Corporation. These acquisitions have helped to diversify our products and customers while growing our net sales and earnings.   Experienced management team.  Brian J. Lipke has been our Chief Executive Officer since 1987, the Chairman of our Board since 1992 and a directorsince our formation. Henning N. Kornbrekke, President and Chief Operating Officer, has been with us for nine years and has extensive experience in manufacturing, marketing and distribution from his previous employment at Rexam, PLC and The StanleyWorks. Kenneth W. Smith, our Chief Financial Officer, joined our company in 2008 with extensive experience at Circor International, North Safety Products and Digital Equipment Corporation. Our executive management team is supported by a talented andexperienced divisional management team. Overall, our management team has broad experience in operational excellence, quality and merchandising gained over multiple business cycles.       21     Operational excellence.  Our strategy is to position Gibraltar as a low-cost provider and a marketshare leader in product areas that offer the opportunity for sales growth and margin enhancement over the long-term. We focus on operational excellence, including lean initiatives throughout the company to position Gibraltar as our customerslow-cost provider of the products we offer. We continuously seek to improve our on-time delivery, quality and service to position Gibraltar as a preferred supplier to our customers. During recent years, Gibraltar invested in new enterprise resourceplanning (ERP) systems which, among other things, have enabled us to more effectively manage our inventory, forecast customer orders, improve supply chain management and respond more timely to volatile raw material costs. At the sametime, we have significantly reduced our working capital levels while maintaining a high level of customer service.    Acquisitions   During 2012, Gibraltar purchased the assets of four businesses in separate transactions. The acquired product lines complement and expandthe Companys product portfolio and customer base in four key U.S. and Canadian markets:                   Metal grating products for the oil sands region of Western Canada ;                  Function-critical components for public infrastructure construction and maintenance;                  Perforated metal products for industrial applications; and                  Sun protection products for new residential construction and home remodeling.   Gibraltar funded the aggregate investment of $43 million from existing cash on hand.    Gibraltar acquired D.S. Brown on April 1, 2011 for $98 million. D.S. Brown is the largest U.S. manufacturer of specialty components for the transportation infrastructure industry and has establisheda leading market position for many of the products offered. Products manufactured and distributed by D.S. Brown include expansion joint systems, structural bearing assemblies, pavement sealing systems, and other specialty components for bridges,highways, and other infrastructure projects.    On June 3, 2011, the Company acquired Award Metals for $13 million. Award Metals is aleading regional manufacturer of roof ventilation, roof trims, flashing and rain ware, drywall trims, and specialty clips and connectors for concrete forms used in the new construction and repair and remodel markets.   The D.S. Brown and Award Metals acquisitions were financed through cash on hand and debt available under our revolving credit facility. Gibraltarsresults from operations included acquisitions from the respective dates of acquisition.    Divestitures   Gibraltar sold its United Steel Products subsidiary (USP) in March 2011 for $59 million. The sale of USP, along with the acquisitions completed in 2011and 2012 provide Gibraltar with a broader product offering to construction markets and greater potential for revenue and earnings growth. These transactions are consistent with managements strategy to position Gibraltar as a market leader inthe product areas offered by our business and to expand our offering of value-added products.    On February 1, 2010, Gibraltar completedthe sale of the majority of the assets of the Processed Metal Products business. This transaction finalized our exit from steel processing. This strategic initiative began in 2005 and included the 2006 sale of our steel strapping business, the 2007sale of the Hubbell Steel business, and the 2008 sale of the SCM powdered metal business. These divestitures were an ongoing part of our objective to build a company with optimal operating characteristics and improve shareholder value. We now arefocused on the manufacture and distribution of building products where the Company has historically generated its highest operating margins. The divestitures described above were recognized as components of discontinued operations in theCompanys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.    Economic Trends   The end markets served by our business are subject to economic conditions influenced by outside factors which include but are not limited to interestrates, commodity costs, demand for residential construction, the level of non-residential construction and infrastructure projects, and demand within the repair and remodel market. The United States construction markets continued an uneven recoveryfrom an unprecedented recession that began in 2008 and led to reduced demand for the products we manufacture and distribute. In addition, tightened credit markets over the same period may have limited the ability of the end users of our products toobtain financing for construction projects. While the U.S. economy has grown since the recession, the construction markets continue to face significant challenges. Construction markets have only recovered modestly from the recession and manyeconomic indicators remain at levels well below long-term averages. As an example, the table below shows housing starts in the United States continued to remain significantly below the long-term average of 1.5 million starts per year:                             2012         2011         2010        Residential Housing Starts         767,000             607,000             585,000           22     The decrease in residential housing starts and non-residential construction had a significant impact on theoperations of our business by contributing to decreased sales volume and profitability. To respond to current economic conditions facing Gibraltar, including weakened end market conditions and volatile commodity costs, we continue to focus onproviding a high level of customer service along with maintaining our position as a market share leader and low-cost provider of our products. We strive for operational excellence through lean initiatives and the consolidation of facilities toreduce costs. As a result, we have closed or consolidated 11 facilities over the past three years, including two during 2012. We have also aggressively reduced operating costs throughout the Company to maximize cash flows generated from operatingactivities. As a result of these restructuring activities, our break-even point has decreased significantly since 2008.    As noted above,commodity raw material prices for materials such as steel, aluminum, and resins, have also fluctuated significantly during the past three years. These fluctuations impact the cost of raw materials we purchase and the pricing we offer to ourcustomers. Commodity prices fell precipitously during the fourth quarter of 2008 and continued to fall during the first two quarters of 2009. The rapid decrease in commodity prices led to lower sales prices offered to customers and falling marginson our product sales during much of 2009. Commodity prices rose in 2010 and have somewhat stabilized since such time. We believe our investment in ERP systems and decreased inventory requirements allow us to react better to these fluctuations andhave improved our margins.    As a result of the steps we have taken throughout the economic downturn, we have increased liquidity to a strongposition. Using cash generated from operations, we have made significant repayments against our outstanding debt and no longer have any amounts outstanding against our revolving credit facility as of year-end. Our liquidity as of December 31,2012 was $165 million including $48 million of cash and $117 million of availability under our revolving credit facility.    Additionally, thesteps taken since the economic downturn in 2008 allowed us to return to and sustain profitability for the past two years. We believe our reduced cost structure and lean manufacturing process will allow us to continue growing our revenue andprofitability as the economy continues to improve.

The increase from prior year was primarily the result of incremental sales generated by the two acquisitions completed in the second quarter of 2011 which contributed $25.0 million or 3.3% of the increase in net sales for 2012.Acquisitions completed in 2012 contributed additional net sales of $4.1 million or an increase of 0.5%. Net sales from businesses operating in both periods decreased 0.7% or $5.7 million, the result of a 1.4% decrease in pricing to customers offsetby a 0.7% increase in volume. While volume increased modestly compared to 2011 for our products sold into the majority of our geographic markets, this increase was net of declines in volume sold in the West Coast residential market and Europeanmarket. Lower demand for roofing materials resulting from unusually dry weather this year contributed to the lower volumes in the West Coast residential market, while weak economic conditions in Europe suppressed demand for our industrial andvehicle filtration products. The lower selling prices were primarily the result of a decline in commodity costs for steel and aluminum and meeting selective competitive situations.    Despite our increase in net sales, our gross margin remained unchanged at 18.9% for both 2012 and 2011. As we continue consolidating certain of our West Coast locations with similar products and marketcharacteristics, we have incurred costs related to this consolidation in 2012. We believe completing the initiatives to restructure the West Coast locations will lead to improved gross margins in future periods. The impact to our gross margin fromthese consolidation costs was offset equally by a more favorable alignment of material costs to customer selling prices and cost reductions.   Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased by $4.3 million, or 3.9%, to $104.7 million for 2012 from $109.0 million for 2011. The$4.3 million decrease was the net result of a $3.3 million decrease in equity compensation, $2.7 million in cost reductions due to consolidation of facilities, a $1 million decrease in other variable incentive compensation and in restructuring andacquisition related costs from 2011. The decreases were partially offset by an increase of $4.5 million in SG&A expense as a result of businesses acquired in 2012 and from having a full year of SG&A expenses from business acquired in 2011.SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 13.2% for 2012 compared to 14.2% for 2011.    During 2012, due to changes in theestimated fair value of a certain reporting unit resulting from a decrease in sales projections, along with continued underperformance in the operations of that reporting unit, we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of $4.6 million. Noimpairment charges were recognized for 2011.    Interest expense decreased $0.8 million, or 4.0%, to $18.6 million for 2012 from $19.4 millionfor 2011. The interest expense incurred in both periods primarily relates to our $204.0 million of Senior Subordinated 8% Notes. Net interest expense for 2011 was higher due to funds borrowed under our revolving credit facility to finance theacquisitions of D.S. Brown and Award Metals along with a $0.3 million charge to write-off deferred financing fees in 2011. These expenses were partially offset by $0.7 million of interest income earned on the $8.5 million note held resulting fromthe sale of SCM Metal Products in 2008. This note receivable was collected in full during November 2011. No amounts were outstanding under our revolving credit facility during 2012.    We recognized a provision for income taxes of $9.5 million for 2012, an effective tax rate of 42.9%, compared with a provision for income taxes of $7.7 million, an effective tax rate of 45.4% for 2011.The effective tax rate for 2012 was reduced by 9.3 percentage points from the 2011 rate largely due to lower non-deductible expenses incurred during 2012. This reduction was partially offset by an increase of 6.8 percentage points over 2011 due tothe effect of intangible asset impairment charges, the majority of which was not deductible for tax purposes. The effective tax rate for 2012 and 2011 exceeded the U.S. federal statutory rate due to state taxes and non-deductible permanentdifferences.       24     Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010   The following table sets forth selected results of operations data (in thousands) and its percentages of net sales for the years ended December 31:                                 2011        2010        Net sales      $  766,607            100.0  %      $  637,454            100.0  %      Cost of sales         621,492            81.1  %         533,586            83.7  %                                                     Gross profit         145,115            18.9  %         103,868            16.3  %      Selling, general, and administrative expense         108,957            14.2  %         99,546            15.6  %      Intangible asset impairment                       0.0  %         76,964            12.1  %                                                     Income (loss) from operations         36,158            4.7  %         (72,642  )         -11.4  %      Interest expense         19,363            2.5  %         19,714            3.1  %      Other income         (90  )         0.0  %         (77  )         0.0  %                                                     Income (loss) before taxes         16,885            2.2  %         (92,279  )         -14.5  %      Provision for (benefit of) income taxes         7,669            1.0  %         (16,923  )         -2.7  %                                                     Income (loss) from continuing operations         9,216            1.2  %         (75,356  )         -11.8  %      Income (loss) from discontinued operations         7,307            1.0  %         (15,712  )         -2.5  %                                                     Net income (loss)      $  16,523            2.2  %      $  (91,068  )         -14.3  %                                                                                                         Total         Change Due To             2011         2010        Change         Acquisitions         Operations        Net sales      $  766,607          $  637,454         $  129,153          $  71,422          $  57,731         Operating income (loss)      $  36,158          $  (72,642  )      $  108,800          $  5,462          $  103,338        Net sales increased by $129.1 million, or 20.3%, to $766.6 million for 2011 from net sales of $637.5 million for 2010.The most significant portion of the increase in net sales was from two acquisitions in 2011 which provided an additional $71.4 million of net sales for 2011. The remaining increase in net sales was impacted by an 8.0% increase in the pricing offeredto customers and a 1.1% increase in volume. Our selling prices increased from the prior year as a result of the higher costs we paid for steel, aluminum, and resins which impacted the selling prices offered to our customers. Sales volume improvedfrom the previous year as a result of repairs for spring storm damage and some improved macroeconomic conditions in the industrial construction markets which offset the uneven recovery in the new build housing and commercial construction markets.   Our gross margin also increased to 18.9% for 2011 compared to 16.3% for 2010. The improvement in gross margin was primarily due to a betteralignment of material costs with customer selling prices and the impact of our 2011 acquisitions which contributed sales of products with higher gross margins. Cost reductions, increased volume, and a $2.4 million reduction in restructuring costsalso contributed to our improved gross margin.    Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased by $9.4 million, or 9.4%,to $108.9 million for 2011 from $99.5 million for 2010. The $9.4 million increase was the net result of $9.7 million of additional expense from acquired businesses, increased cost of variable incentive compensation from improved operating results,$1.0 million of acquisition-related costs, and a $0.9 million charge recognized as a result of time-based equity awards surrendered by Gibraltars Chief Executive Officer partially offset by our cost reduction efforts that resulted in decreasedspending on professional services, rent, and other operating expenses. Despite the increased costs, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 14.2% for 2011 compared to 15.6% for 2010.   Due to changes in the estimated fair value of certain reporting units resulting from a significant decrease in sales projections, we recognizedintangible asset impairment charges of $77.0 million for 2010. No impairment charges were recognized for 2011.    Interest expense decreased$0.3 million, or 1.5%, to $19.4 million for 2011 from $19.7 million for 2010. The reduction in interest expense was a result of incurring a $1.4 million charge in 2010 related to an ineffective interest rate swap. The reduction was offset byincurring a $0.3 million charge to write-off deferred financing fees in 2011 and having slightly higher levels of debt outstanding during 2011 compared to 2010. In the first quarter of 2010, we repaid $50 million of debt, which constituted alloutstanding debt under our revolving credit facility. Subsequently, we borrowed funds under our revolving credit facility to finance the acquisitions of D.S. Brown and Award Metals during the second quarter of 2011 which were repaid in full duringthe third quarter of 2011.       25     We recognized a provision for income taxes of $7.7 million for 2011, an effective tax rate of 45.4%. Theeffective tax rate for 2011 exceeded the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% due to state taxes and the impact of non-deductible permanent differences. During 2010, we recognized a tax benefit of $16.9 million, an effective tax rate of 18.3%. Theeffective tax rate differed from the statutory rate due to the effect of non-deductible permanent differences, a large portion of which related to the intangible asset impairment charges that were not deductible for tax purposes. In addition, werecognized a $2.4 million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in 2010 for certain state net operating loss carryforwards which further reduced the effective tax rate.    Outlook    For the first quarter of 2012, we expect revenues to increase approximately 3%primarily from incremental revenues of our most recent acquisitions. We believe the continued recovery in the residential and non-residential construction markets will provide stronger growth opportunities in the second half of 2013. We expect thefirst quarter gross margin to approximate 19% as our cost reductions offset the margin impact of lower sales volume in a seasonally weak quarter. For 2013, we expect SG&A expense to approximate $29 million per quarter, or 13% of full yearrevenue. Our expectations for other financial measures for our continuing operations, excluding refinancing charges, include net interest at a run rate of $4 million per quarter, a full year effective tax rate of 37% and capital expenditures of $20million for the year.    Over the long-term, we believe that the fundamentals of the building and industrial markets are positive and theaggressive actions taken to streamline and improve the efficiency of our business have reduced our break-even point and positioned Gibraltar to generate marked improvements in profitability when economic and market conditions return towardhistorical levels.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    General    Our principal capital requirements are to fund our operations with workingcapital, the purchase of capital improvements for our business and facilities, and to fund acquisitions. We will continue to invest in growth opportunities as appropriate while continuing to focus on working capital efficiency and profit improvementopportunities to minimize the cash invested to grow our business. We have successfully generated positive cash flows from operating activities during the past three years to fund our capital requirements and assist in the funding of our 2011 and2012 acquisitions as noted below in the Cash Flows section of Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We generated positive operating cash flows during these periods despite the continued challenging economic conditions ourbusiness faced. In the future, we expect to continue profitable growth and sustain strong working capital management to continue to generate positive operating cash flow.    On October 11, 2011, we entered into the Senior Credit Agreement which includes a $200 million revolving credit facility and provides Gibraltar with access to capital and improved financialflexibility. As of December 31, 2012, our liquidity of $164.8 million consisted of $48.0 million of cash and $116.8 million of availability under our revolving credit facility as compared to liquidity of $169.7 million as of December 31,2011. We believe that availability of funds under our Senior Credit Agreement together with the cash generated from operations should be sufficient to provide the Company with the liquidity and capital resources necessary to support our principalcapital requirements during the next twelve months.    Our Senior Credit Agreement provides the Company with liquidity and capital resources foruse by our U.S. operations. Historically, our foreign operations have generated cash flow from operations sufficient to invest in working capital and fund their capital improvements. As of December 31, 2012, our foreign subsidiaries held $21.9million of cash. We believe cash held by our foreign subsidiaries provides our foreign operations with the necessary liquidity to meet future obligations and allows the foreign business units to reinvest in their operations. These cash resourcescould eventually be used to grow our business internationally through transactions similar to our 2012 acquisition of the Western Canadian bar grating business.    Over the long-term, we expect that future obligations, including strategic business opportunities such as acquisitions, may be financed through a number of sources, including internally available cash,availability under our revolving credit facility, new debt financing, the issuance of equity securities, or any combination of the above. Potential acquisitions are evaluated on the basis of our ability to enhance our existing products, operations,or capabilities, as well as provide access to new products, markets, and customers and improve shareholder value. Our 2012 acquisitions were funded by cash on hand, while the 2011 acquisitions of D.S. Brown and Award Metals were financed through theuse of cash on hand and debt available under our revolving credit facility.       26     Cash Flows    The following table sets forth selected cash flow data for the years ended December 31 (in millions):                          2012        2011        Cash provided by (used in):                  Operating activities of continuing operations      $  50,232         $  49,828         Investing activities of continuing operations         (55,763  )         (52,295  )      Financing activities of continuing operations         (1,173  )         (2,775  )      Discontinued operations         (151  )         (1,044  )      Effect of exchange rate changes         766            (463  )                                         Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents      $  (6,089  )      $  (6,749  )                                        During the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash provided by continuing operations totaled $50.2 million, primarilydriven by income from continuing operations of $12.7 million and non-cash charges totaling $40.8 million that included depreciation, amortization, deferred income taxes, stock compensation, and an intangible asset impairment. Net cash provided bycontinuing operations for 2011 was $49.8 million and was primarily driven by income from continuing operations of $9.2 million and $41.5 million from non-cash charges including depreciation, amortization, deferred income taxes, and stockcompensation.    During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company modestly increased its investment in working capital and other netassets from December 31, 2011 resulting in $3.3 million of cash outflow. Cash flow invested in working capital and other net assets included $6.3 million decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by a $1.0 million increase in inventoryand $3.8 million and $7.1 million decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The decrease in accounts receivable was a result of reduced net sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 2011 as customer pricing decreased year overyear. Inventory levels saw a minor increase due to the timing of our receipts near year-end. Accounts payable decreased due to the timing of vendor payments made near year-end. The decrease in accrued liabilities of $7.1 million was largely due toperformance-based variable compensation awards earned in 2009 and 2011 that were paid during 2012, partially offset by accruals for long term incentive plans earned during 2012.    Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations for 2012 of $55.8 million consisted primarily of $45.1 million of acquisitions and capital expenditures of $11.4 million. Net cash used ininvesting activities of continuing operations for 2011 of $52.3 million consisted primarily of $109.2 million of acquisitions and capital expenditures of $11.6 million offset by $67.5 million of proceeds from the sale of our USP business unit andthe collection of a note receivable related to the 2008 sale of our SCM business unit.    Net cash used in financing activities for 2012 of $1.2million primarily consisted of $1.0 million of treasury stock repurchases related to the net settlement of vested stock awards and repayments of $0.5 million on long-term debt. Net cash used in financing activities for 2011 of $2.8 million primarilyconsisted of $1.6 million of deferred financing fees related to the Senior Credit Agreement, $0.8 million of treasury stock repurchases related to the net settlement of vested stock awards, and net repayments of $0.4 million on long-term debt.   Cash used for discontinued operations was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to cash used for discontinuedoperations of $1.0 million for 2011. The 2011 cash flows related primarily to the USP business that was divested in 2011.    Senior CreditAgreement and Senior Subordinated Notes    Borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement are secured by the trade receivables, inventory,personal property and equipment, and certain real property of the Companys significant domestic subsidiaries. The Senior Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility and letters of credit in an aggregate amount that does notexceed the lesser of (i) $200 million or (ii) a borrowing base determined by reference to the trade receivables, inventories, and property, plant, and equipment of the Companys significant domestic subsidiaries. The Senior CreditAgreement provides Gibraltar with flexibility by allowing us to request additional financing from the lenders to increase the revolving credit facility to $250 million. The Senior Credit Agreement also provided Gibraltar with a commitment to enterinto a term loan subject to conditions that subsequently the Company decided not to satisfy. The Senior Credit Agreement is committed through October 10, 2016.    Borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable interest rate based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an additional margin of 2.0% to 2.5%, based on the amountof borrowings available to Gibraltar. The Senior Credit Agreement also carries an annual facility fee of 0.375% on the undrawn portion of the facility and fees on outstanding letters of credit which are payable quarterly.       27     As of December 31, 2012, we had $116.8 million of availability under the Senior Credit Agreement andoutstanding letters of credit of $13.6 million. Only one financial covenant is contained within the Senior Credit Agreement, which requires us to maintain a fixed charge ratio (as defined in the agreement) of 1.25 to 1.00 or higher on a trailingfour-quarter basis at the end of each quarter. As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant. Management expects to be in compliance with the fixed coverage ratio covenant throughout thenext twelve months.    To help finance the $109.2 million for the 2011 acquisitions of D.S. Brown and Award Metals in the second quarter of2011, we borrowed $43.0 million under the revolving credit facility which was subsequently repaid during the third quarter of 2011. No amounts were outstanding under our revolving credit facility during 2012.   At December 31, 2012, the Company had $204.0 million of Senior Subordinate 8% Notes (8% Notes) outstanding which were issued in December 2005 at adiscount to yield 8.25% and were due December 1, 2015.    Subsequent to December 31, 2012, the Company issued$210.0 million of 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes (6.25% Notes) due February 1, 2021. In connection with the issuance of the 6.25% Notes, on January 16, 2013 the Company initiated a tender offer to purchase the outstanding 8% Notes.Simultaneously with the closing of the sale of the 6.25% Notes on January 31, 2013, the Company purchased the tendered 8% Notes. The 8% Notes that were not tendered and purchased were called for redemption. In connection with the purchase andsubsequent redemption, the Company satisfied and discharged its obligations under the 8% Notes. Refer to Note 20 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more information regarding the issuance of the 6.25% Notes and redemption ofthe 8% Notes.    The provisions of the 6.25% Notes include, without limitation, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, and distributions fromrestricted subsidiaries, asset sales, affiliate transactions, dividends, and other restricted payments. Dividend payments are subject to annual limits of the greater of $0.25 per share or $25 million. The 6.25% Notes are redeemable at the option ofthe Company, in whole or in part, at any time on or after February 1, 2017, at the redemption price (as defined in the Senior Subordinated 6.25% Notes Indenture). The redemption prices will be 103.13%, and 101.56% of the principal amountthereof if the redemption occurs during the 12-month periods beginning February 1, of the years 2017 and 2018, respectively, and 100% of the principal amount thereof on and after February 1, 2019, in each case plus accrued and unpaidinterest to the applicable redemption date. In addition, prior to February 1, 2016, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings by the Company at aredemption price of 106.25% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Senior Subordinated 6.25% Notes Indenture), each holder of the 6.25% Notesmay require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of such holders 6.25% Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof.    Each of our significant domestic subsidiaries has guaranteed the obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement. The Senior Credit Agreement contains other provisions and events of default that arecustomary for similar agreements and may limit our ability to take various actions. The Senior Subordinate 6.25% Notes Indenture also contains provisions that limit additional borrowings based on the Companys consolidated coverage ratio.   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements    The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements, other than operating leases, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition,changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.       28     Contractual Obligations    The following table summarizes by category our Companys expected future cash outflows associated with contractual obligations in effect at December 31, 2012 (in thousands):                                     Payments Due by Period        Contractual Obligation      Total         Less than One Year         One to Three Years         Three to Five Years         More Than Five Years        Fixed rate debt 1      $  203,395          $  389          $  202,939          $  67          $             Interest on fixed rate debt         47,664             16,355             31,305             4                        Variable rate debt         4,408             408             800             800             2,400         Interest on variable rate debt  2         51             9             15             12             15         Operating lease obligations         35,221             11,031             13,692             6,261             4,237         Performance stock unit awards         1,639                            1,639                                       Pension and other post- retirement payments         8,933             742             1,484             1,438             5,269         Management stock purchase plan  3         1,046             530             488             28                                                                                                               Total  4      $  302,357          $  29,464          $  252,362          $  8,610          $  11,921                                                                                                    1      8% Notes were re-financed subsequent to December 31, 2012. See Note 20     2      Calculated using the interest rate in effect at December 31, 2012.     3      Includes amounts due to retired participants of the Management Stock Purchase Plan (MSPP). Excludes the future payments due to active participants ofthe MSPP, which represents a liability of approximately $9.2 million as of December 31, 2012. Future payments to active participants cannot be accurately estimated as we are uncertain of when active participants service to the Company willterminate.    Critical Accounting Policies    The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make decisions based upon estimates,assumptions, and factors it considers relevant to the circumstances. Such decisions include the selection of applicable principles and the use of judgment in their application, the results of which could differ from those anticipated.   A summary of the Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Companys consolidated financial statements includedin Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.    Our most critical accounting policies include:             valuation of accounts receivable, which impacts selling, general, and administrative expense;             valuation of inventory, which impacts cost of sales and gross margin;              the allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, which impacts our depreciation and amortization costs;             the assessment of recoverability of depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets, which impacts the impairment of long-lived assets;             the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which impacts the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; and             accounting for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities, which impact the provision for income taxes.   Management reviews these estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves, on a regular basis and makes adjustments basedon historical experience, current conditions, and future expectations. Management believes these estimates are reasonable, but actual results could differ from these estimates.       29     Valuation of Accounts Receivable    Our accounts receivable represent those amounts that have been billed to our customers but not yet collected. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, allowances for doubtful accounts of $4.5 million and$4.6 million were recorded, respectively, or approximately 5% of gross accounts receivable for both periods. We record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the portion of those accounts receivable that we believe are potentially uncollectiblebased on various factors, including experience, creditworthiness of customers, and current market and economic conditions. If the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments,additional allowances may be required. Changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing of costs recognized.    Valuation ofInventories    We state our inventories at the lower of cost or market. We determine the cost basis of our inventory on a first-in,first-out basis using a standard cost methodology that approximates actual cost. On a regular basis, we calculate an estimated market value of our inventory, considered to be the prevailing selling price for the inventory less the cost to completeand sell the product. We compare the current carrying value of our inventory to the estimated market value to determine whether a reserve to value inventory at the lower of cost or market is necessary. We recorded insignificant charges during thethree year period ended December 31, 2012 to value our inventory at the lower of cost or market.    We regularly review inventory on handand record provisions for excess, obsolete, and slow-moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends. We recorded reserves for excess, obsolete, and slow-moving inventory of $4.9 million and $4.1 million as of December 31, 2012and 2011, respectively, or approximately 4% of gross inventories for both periods. Changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand, which may require higher provisions for obsolete inventory.   Accounting for Acquired Assets and Liabilities    When we acquire a business, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their respective estimated fair values. We record any premium over the fairvalue of net assets acquired as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price involves judgments and estimates both in characterizing the assets and in determining their fair value. The way we characterize the assets has important implications, aslong-lived assets with definitive lives, for example, are depreciated or amortized, whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment, as explained below.    With respect to determining the fair value of assets, the most subjective estimates involve valuations of long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment as well as identified intangible assets.We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long-lived assets. The fair values of long-lived assets are determinedusing valuation techniques that use discounted cash flow methods, independent market appraisals, and other acceptable valuation techniques.   The following summarizes the amount of purchase price allocated to property, plant, and equipment, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill for theacquisitions completed in 2012 (in millions):                                                                                                         Initial Purchase Price         Property, Plant, and Equipment         Identified Intangible Assets         Goodwill         Other Net Assets      $  43.1          $  9.9          $  10.2          $  15.0          $  8.0        Due to the subjectivity inherent in determining the fair value of long-lived assets and the significant number ofacquisitions we have completed, we believe the allocation of purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities is a critical accounting policy.   Impairment of Depreciable and Amortizable Long-lived Assets    We test long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceed their fair value. The followingsummarizes the value of long-lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment as of December 31, 2012 (in millions):                Property, plant, and equipment, net      $  151.6         Acquired intangibles with useful lives      $  50.0         Other assets      $  6.2           30     Impairment exists if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cashflows expected to result from the use of the asset. The impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value as determined by discounted cash flow method, an independent marketappraisal of the asset, or another acceptable valuation technique. We recognized impairment charges for property, plant, and equipment as a result of restructuring activities during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.   Goodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Asset Impairment Testing    Our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances of $359.9 million and $48.8 million as of December 31, 2012, respectively, are subject to impairment testing. We test goodwill andindefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of October 31 and at interim dates when indicators of impairment are present. Indicators of impairment could include a significant long-term adverse change in businessclimate, poor indicators of operating performance, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.    During 2012, weconcluded that no indicators of impairment existed at interim dates and did not perform any interim impairment tests related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We tested goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets forimpairment during the fourth quarter of 2012 at the annual test date. As a result of the October 31, 2012 impairment test, the Company recognized an intangible asset impairment charge of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.No impairment charges were recognized for the year ended December 31, 2011. However, the Company recognized intangible asset impairment charges of $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.   We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our companyconstitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of those components. As of the October 31, 2012 impairment test, we identified ten reporting units in total, ofwhich all have goodwill. The number of reporting units declined from eleven to ten in the current year as we consolidated two reporting units due to restructuring activities that consolidated their operating activities.   The goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amountof the reporting unit exceeds the reporting units fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceedsthe implied fair value of goodwill.    The following table sets forth the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit tested forgoodwill impairment and the percentage by which the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of the October 31, 2012 goodwill impairment test (in thousands):                            Reporting Unit      Goodwill Allocated to Reporting Unit Before Impairment Charges         Percentage By Which Estimated Fair Value Exceeds Carrying Value        Goodwill Impairment Charges        Goodwill Allocated To Reporting UnitAfter Impairment Charges        #1      $  111,499             37  %      $             $  111,499         #2         89,279             33  %                       89,279         #3         46,198             29  %                       46,198         #4         27,332             57  %                       27,332         #5         20,578             7  %                       20,578         #6         19,569             45  %                       19,569         #7         18,261             25  %                       18,261         #8         8,256             35  %                       8,256         #9         4,328             N/A            (4,328  )                    #10         3,589             233  %                       3,589                                                                   Total      $  348,889                $  (4,328  )      $  344,561                                                                  The October 31, 2012 goodwill impairment test included significant assumptions. To estimate the fair value of thereporting units as a part of step one of the impairment test, we used two valuation techniques: an income approach and a market approach. The income approach included a discounted cash flow model relying on significant assumptions consisting ofrevenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, terminal value, and the weighted average cost of capital WACC used to discount future cash flows. The market approach consisted of applying an Earnings Before Interest,Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization EBITDA multiple to the forecasted EBITDA to be generated in 2012 and 2013. The market approach also relied on significant assumptions consisting of revenue growth rates and profit margins based oninternal forecasts and the EBITDA multiple selected from an analysis of peer companies.       31     The following table sets forth the compound annual revenue growth rate for the five-year period used toforecast cash flows and the average operating margin for the forecasted periods compared to actual operating margins generated over the long-term:                         Reporting Unit      Compound Annual Revenue Growth Rate For Forecasted Periods        Operating Margins For Forecasted Periods        Actual Long-term Operating Margins (a)        #1         2  %         19  %         21  %      #2         4  %         10  %         10  %      #3         5  %         17  %         18  %      #4         1  %         14  %         14  %      #5         7  %         7  %         6  %      #6         4  %         10  %         9  %      #7         8  %         7  %         5  %      #8         13  %         13  %         11  %      #9 (b)         12  %         3  %         0  %      #10 (c)         1  %         10  %         7  %          (a)  Operating margins presented exclude restructuring charges incurred by each reporting unit.     (b)  The operating margins presented only include operating results generated since the dates these reporting units were acquired by Gibraltar. The reporting unit hasundergone significant consolidation and restructuring activities in the past five years as locations were acquired, sold, and reorganized. Some of the acquisitions made occurred during the economic downturn. Significant changes have been made todownsize locations, realign operations, and change distribution patterns in order to turn the unit profitable and spur future economic growth.     (c)  This reporting unit was restructured in 2007 and 2008 to increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of production. Operating margins have improved since therestructuring was completed. As a result, we believe forecasted operating margins will continue to exceed prior results.    Weanalyzed third-party forecasts of housing starts and other macroeconomic indicators that impact each reporting unit to provide a reasonable estimate of revenue growth in future periods. Our analysis of third-party forecasts noted that housing startswere projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18% from 2012 to 2017. We considered these forecasts in developing each reporting units growth rates over the next five years depending on the level of correlation between housingstarts and net sales for each reporting unit. The correlation between housing starts and net sales was based on an analysis of historical housing starts and our historical revenue. We concluded that this approach provided a reasonable estimate oflong-term revenue growth and cash flows for each reporting unit.    Operating margins used to estimate future cash flows were consistent withlong-term margins generated by the reporting units while they have been owned and operated by Gibraltar as shown in the table above. The reporting units where forecasted operating margins exceed long-term operating margins generated by the reportingunit were for reporting units that were recently acquired and, therefore, the long-term operating margins were more significantly impacted by the economic turmoil that began in 2008 or were more significantly impacted by the decline in theresidential housing market. Additionally, we took strategic actions to consolidate facilities, reduce costs, and restructure these business units to become more profitable as the economy recovers. These actions led to increased costs and loweroperating margins in the short term. Based on our understanding of these reporting units and the actions taken by management to restructure the businesses for improved growth and profitability, we concluded that the long-term cash flows forecastedfor all of the Companys reporting units were reasonable.    In addition to revenue growth and operating margin forecasts, the discountedcash flow model used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit also uses assumptions for the amount of working capital needed to support each reporting unit. We forecasted modest improvement in working capital management for future periodsat each reporting unit based on past performance. The Company experienced a significant reduction in days of working capital from 77 days for the year ended December 31, 2008 to 65 days for the year ended December 31, 2012. We have beenable to significantly improve our working capital management through lean initiatives, efficiency improvements, and facility consolidations. We believe continued improvement in our ability to manage working capital will allow us to increase the cashflow generated from each reporting unit.       32     The terminal value of each reporting unit was based on a projected terminal year of forecasted cash flows inour discounted cash flow model. We made an assumption that cash flows would grow 3.0% each year thereafter in the North American markets, and 2.0% each year thereafter in the European markets served by the company, based on our approximation ofgross domestic product growth. This assumption was based on a third-party forecast of future economic growth over the long-term.    Thediscounted cash flow model uses the WACC to discount cash flows in the forecasted period and to discount the terminal value to present value. To determine the WACC, we used a standard valuation method, the capital asset pricing model, based onreadily available and current market data of peer companies considered market participants. Acknowledging the risk inherent in each reporting units ability to achieve long-term forecasted cash flows, in applying the income approach weincreased the WACC of each reporting unit based upon each reporting units past operating performance and their relative ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows. As a result of these analyses, we assigned a WACC between 10.7% and 13.1% foreach reporting unit.    The EBITDA multiple used in the market approach to determine the fair value of each reporting unit was applied to theforecasted EBITDA to be generated during 2012 and 2013. The market approach relies on significant assumptions consisting of revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts and the EBITDA multiple selected from an analysis of peercompanies considered market participants. The revenue growth rates and profit margins used in the market approach were the same projections used in the discounted cash flows model as described above. The EBITDA multiples were established byanalyzing each peer companies total invested capital in proportion to EBITDA derived from each peer companies most recently reported earnings. Similar to the WACC analysis, we assessed the risk of each reporting unit achieving itsforecasts with consideration given to how each reporting unit has performed historically compared to forecasts. As a result of these analyses, we assigned an EBITDA multiple between 7.7 and 9.2 for 2012 EBITDA forecasts and 7.1 and 8.6 for 2013EBITDA forecasts.    As noted above, we used two commonly accepted valuation techniques to estimate a fair value for each reporting unit. Theestimated fair value for each reporting unit was calculated using a weighted average between the calculated amounts determined under the income approach and the market approach. We weighted the income approach more heavily (67%) as thetechnique uses a long-term approach that considers the expected operating profit of each reporting unit during periods where housing starts and other macroeconomic indicators are nearer historical averages. The market approach (33%) values thereporting units using 2012 and 2013 EBITDA values which were forecasted using estimated housing starts of 761,000 and 935,000, respectively. Housing starts have historically approximated 1.5 million each year. We believe the income approachconsiders the expected recovery in the residential building market better than the market approach. Therefore, we concluded that the income approach more accurately estimated the fair value of the reporting units as it considers earnings potentialduring a longer term and does not use the short-term perspective used by the market approach. Accordingly, we concluded that the market participants who execute transactions to sell or buy a business in the current economic environment would placegreater emphasis on the income approach.    The following table sets forth the Companys estimated fair value and carrying value for eachreporting unit as of October 31, 2012 (in thousands):                     Reporting Unit      Estimated Fair Value        Carrying Value        #1      $  125,322         $  91,230         #2         223,231            167,673         #3         113,375            87,639         #4         55,159            35,136         #5         36,096            33,715         #6         26,958            18,584         #7         31,022            24,856         #8         67,495            50,167         #9         67,586            80,787         #10         24,784            7,447         Corporate         (132,623  )         7,481                                            Total      $  638,406         $  604,715                                            Net Debt            $  122,930         Equity (Net Book Value)               481,785                                  Total            $  604,715                                    33     The Corporate category includes unallocated corporate cash out flows. Unallocated corporate cashout flows include executive compensation and other administrative costs. Gibraltar has grown substantially through acquisitions and our strategy is to allow business unit management to operate the business units autonomous of corporate management.For example, each business unit has its own accounting, marketing, purchasing, information technology, and executive functions. As a result, we believe a market participant would not consider unallocated corporate cash flows when valuing eachreporting unit and these cash flows have been properly excluded from the valuation of the reporting units.    Step two of the impairmentanalysis involved estimating the implied fair value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of each reporting unit to its assets and liabilities other than goodwill and comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value. The steptwo analysis relied on a number of significant assumptions to determine the fair value of the reporting units net assets, including intangible assets. The fair value of intangible assets was determined using standard valuation methodologiesincluding the relief-from-royalty method and excess earnings method. These methods primarily employed the use of future cash flows to determine the fair value of the applicable intangible assets. The future cash flows used todetermine the fair vales of these intangible assets were derived from step one of the goodwill impairment analysis as described above. The discount rate used in the valuation of intangible assets was derived from the WACC used in step one of thegoodwill impairment analysis. Based on the analysis described above, we concluded the assumptions underlying step two of our impairment analysis were reasonable and appropriate.    In addition to the analyses described above, we performed a reconciliation of the total estimated fair values of the reporting units to our market capitalization as of October 31, 2012 to support thereasonableness of the fair value estimates used in our goodwill impairment test. The following calculation provides this reconciliation and the resulting control premium determined as of our October 31, 2012 impairment analysis (in thousands):                             Estimated Fair Value        Estimated Market Capitalization                  Estimated Fair Value of Reporting Units      $  638,406                      Less: Net Debt as of October 31, 2012         (122,930  )                                                   Shares Outstanding as of October 31, 2012               30,565                Average Stock Price from October 15, 2012 to November 7, 2012            $  12.71                                                Value of Equity      $  515,476         $  388,481                                                          Control Premium                      33  %                                     During our annual goodwill impairment test for 2012, the Company identified one reporting unit with a carrying value inexcess of fair value due to decreased revenue projections. The Company initiated step two of the goodwill impairment test which involved calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to the fairvalue of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill, calculating an implied fair value of goodwill, and comparing the implied fair value to the carrying amount of goodwill. As a result of step two of the goodwill impairment test, the Companyestimated that the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit was less than its carrying value by $4,328,000, which has been recorded as an impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2012. The remaining reporting units all hadfair values in excess of their carrying value. The difference between the total carrying value of our reporting units and the estimated fair value of equity is the result of the negative future cash flows associated with our unallocated corporatenet assets as described above. Although the book value of equity exceeds our market capitalization, we deemed the control premium as of the October 31, 2012 impairment analysis to be reasonable based upon recent comparable transactions toacquire the control of similar businesses in our industry. Accordingly, we concluded the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was reasonably estimated.    We test our intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, determined using a discounted cash flow model, with its carrying amount. An impairmentloss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value. We recognized impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of our October 31, 2012 and 2010 impairment tests. No impairments charges wererecognized as a result of the October 31, 2011 impairment test. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets are consistent with the assumptions employed in the determination of the fair values ofour reporting units.       34     Accounting for Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities   Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuationallowances. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate due to the impact of permanent differences between income or loss reported for financial statement purposes and tax purposes, provisions for uncertain tax positions, state taxes, andincome generated by international operations. Our effective tax rate was 43%, 45%, and 18%, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lowerthan anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and vice versa. Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof may also adversely affect our future effective taxrate. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations todetermine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the differencesbetween the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence, itis more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.    Regarding deferred income tax assets, we maintaineda valuation allowance of $2.6 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets, primarily consisting of state net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. Thevaluation allowances are based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable. If market conditions improve and future results of operationsexceed our current expectations, our existing tax valuation allowances may be adjusted, resulting in future tax benefits. Alternatively, if market conditions deteriorate further or future operating results do not meet expectations, futureassessments may result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realizable. As a result, we may need to establish additional tax valuation allowances for all or a portion of the gross deferred tax assets, which may havea material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.    It is our policy to record estimated interest and penaltiesdue to tax authorities as income tax expense and tax credits as a reduction in income tax expense. Insignificant amounts of interest and penalties were recognized in the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and2010.    The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will besustained on examination by tax authorities, based on the technical merits of each position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percentlikelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the liability for uncertain income tax positions was $1.7 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding thetiming of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid.   Related Party Transactions    A member ofour Board of Directors, Gerald S. Lippes, is a partner in a law firm that provides legal services to Gibraltar. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, the Company incurred costs of $1.5 million, $1.8 million, and $0.9 million,respectively, for legal services from this firm. Costs incurred increased significantly for 2011 as a result of additional legal services provided for the acquisitions completed in 2011 and our amendment of the Senior Credit Agreement. For 2012,costs included fees for four acquisitions completed during the year. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had $0.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively, recorded in accounts payable for amounts due to this law firm.   Another member of our Board of Directors, Robert E. Sadler, Jr., is a member of the Board of Directors of M&T Bank Corporation, one of the tenparticipating lenders which have committed capital to our $200 million revolving credit facility in our Senior Credit Agreement. All amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility were repaid in full as of December 31, 2011. No amountswere outstanding on the revolving credit facility in 2012. Therefore, no principal or interest was paid to the lenders in 2012.    Borrowingsunder the Senior Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable interest rate based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an additional margin of 2.0% to 2.5%, based on the amount of borrowings available to Gibraltar. The revolvingcredit facility also carries an annual facility fee of 0.375% on the undrawn portion of the facility and fees on outstanding letters of credit which are payable quarterly.       35     Recent Accounting Pronouncements    In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update Update 2012-02, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): TestingIndefinite Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment. Update 2012-02 states that an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than notthat the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative test. Gibraltarhas elected not to perform the qualitative assessment and performed the full quantitative test as of October 31, 2012.    Item 7A.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about MarketRisk     In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to various market risk factors, including changes in generaleconomic conditions, competition, and raw materials pricing and availability. In addition, the Company is exposed to other financial market risks, primarily related to its long-term debt and foreign operations.   Raw Material Pricing Risk    We aresubject to market risk exposure related to volatility in the price of steel, aluminum, and resins. A significant amount of our cost of sales relates to material costs. Our business is heavily dependent on the price and supply of our raw materials.Our various products are fabricated from steel, primarily hot-rolled and galvanized steel coils and bars, produced by mills and service centers. Many of our products are also fabricated from aluminum coils and resins. The commodity market, whichincludes the steel, aluminum, and resin industries, is highly cyclical in nature, and commodity costs have been volatile in recent years and may remain volatile in the future. Commodity costs are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control,including general economic conditions, the availability of raw materials, competition, labor costs, freight and transportation costs, production costs, import duties and other trade restrictions.   Although we have the ability to purchase steel from a number of suppliers, a production cutback by one or more of our current suppliers could createchallenges in meeting delivery schedules to our customers. The prices we offer to our customers are also impacted by changes in commodity costs. We manage the alignment of the cost of our raw materials and prices offered to customers and attempt topass changes to raw material costs through to our customers. To improve our management of commodity costs, we attempt to maintain lean inventory levels. Our investment in ERP systems was made to increase our effectiveness in this process.   We do not enter into long-term contracts for the purchase of raw materials and do not maintain inventory levels in excess of our productionrequirements. However, from time to time, we may purchase raw materials in advance of commodity cost increases.    We rely on major suppliersfor our supply of raw materials. During 2012, we purchased our raw materials from domestic and foreign suppliers in an effort to purchase the lowest cost material as possible.    We cannot accurately calculate the pre-tax impact a one percent change in the commodity costs would have on our 2012 operating results as the change in commodity costs would both impact the cost topurchase materials and the selling prices we offer our customers. The impact to our operating results would significantly depend on the competitive environment and the costs of other alternative building products, which could impact our ability topass commodity costs to our customers.    Interest Rate Risk    To manage interest rate risk, Gibraltar uses both fixed and variable interest rate debt. We repaid all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and no amounts remain outstanding as ofDecember 31, 2012. As a result, fixed rate debt consisting of the Companys Senior Subordinated 8% Notes was the only significant debt that remains outstanding at year end. We believe we limited our exposure to interest rate risk as aresult of repaying substantially all variable rate debt and the long-term nature of our fixed rate debt. However, the Company will continue to monitor changes in its debt levels and access to capital ensuring interest rate risk is appropriatelymanaged.    At December 31, 2012, our fixed rate debt consisted primarily of $202.7 million, net of discount, of our 8% Notes. TheCompanys $204.0 million of 8% Notes were issued in December 2005 at a discount to yield 8.25%. The 8% Notes were due December 1, 2015.       36     Subsequent to December 31, 2012, the Company issued $210.0 million of 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes(6.25% Notes) due February 1, 2021. In connection with the issuance of the 6.25% Notes, on January 16, 2013 the Company initiated a tender offer to purchase the outstanding $204.0 million of 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due in 2015.Simultaneously with the closing of the sale of the 6.25% Notes on January 31, 2013, the Company purchased the tendered 8% Notes. The 8% Notes that were not tendered and purchased were called for redemption. In connection with the purchase andsubsequent redemption, the Company satisfied and discharged its obligations under the 8% Notes. Refer to Note 20 of the consolidated financial statements of Item 8 for more information regarding the issuance of the 6.25% Notes and redemption ofthe 8% Notes.    Our variable rate debt consists primarily of the revolving credit facility under the Senior Credit Agreement, of which noamounts are outstanding as of December 31, 2012, and other debt. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable interest rate based upon the LIBOR plus an additional margin. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease ininterest rates would have changed the 2012 interest expense by less than $0.1 million.    Foreign Exchange Risk   Gibraltar has foreign exchange risk in our international operations, primarily located in Canada and Europe, and through purchases from foreign vendors.Therefore, changes in the values of currencies of these countries affect our financial position and cash flows when translated into U.S. Dollars. We accepted our exposure to exchange rate movements relative to Gibraltars internationaloperations and do not hedge our foreign exchange risk exposures. A change of 10% in the value of all applicable foreign currencies would not have a material effect on our financial position and cash flows.       37     Item 8.
