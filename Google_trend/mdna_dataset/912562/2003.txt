Item 7.       Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Results of Operations   Year Ended 2002 Compared to Year Ended 2001   Consolidated   Net sales increased $29.1 million, or 4.7%, to $645.1 million from net sales of $616.0 million in 2001.  This increase resulted primarily from increased sales resulting from increased production levels in the automotive industry and the July 1, 2002 acquisition of B&W Heat Treating.   Cost of sales increased $17.9 million, or 3.5%, to $517.8 million in 2002 from $499.9 million in 2001.  Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 80.3% in 2002 from 81.2% in 2001 primarily due to lower raw material and freight costs partially offset by increased direct labor and health care costs and general insurance expense.   Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $1.4 million, or 1.8%, to $77.1 million in 2002 from $78.6 million in 2001.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 12.0% for 2002 from 12.8% for 2001 primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization as a result of the implementation of new accounting rules in 2002, partially offset by increased incentive compensation.  Additionally, in 2001 we had a non-cash charge of $1.0 million relating to the Company's E-Commerce investment.   Interest expense decreased $6.0 million primarily due to lower average borrowings during 2002 due to the use of proceeds from the Company's stock offering in mid-March 2002 and lower interest rates.   As a result of the above, income before taxes increased $18.7 million, or 88%, to $39.8 million in 2002 from $21.1 million in 2001.   Income taxes approximated $15.9 million in 2002, based on a 40% effective rate compared with a 40.5% effective rate in 2001.   Segment Information   Processed Steel Products - Net sales increased $20.4 million, or 8.1%, to $272.8 million in 2002, from net sales of $252.4 million in 2001.  This increase was due primarily to increased sales resulting from increased production levels in the automotive industry in 2002.   Income from operations increased 12.6% to $32.8 million in 2002 from $29.2 million in 2001.  Operating margin increased to 12.0% of net sales from 11.6% in 2001, primarily due to lower raw material and freight costs, partially offset by increased direct labor costs and incentive based compensation.   Building Products - Net sales for 2002 of $292.2 million were comparable to net sales of $292.4 million for 2001.  Weaker demand due to general economic conditions in this segment's industry early in the year were offset by an improvement in these conditions during the third and fourth quarters, especially through sales to major retail outlets.   Income from operations increased 17.4% to $21.3 million in 2002 from $18.2 million in 2001.  Operating margin improved to 7.2% compared to 6.2% in 2001 primarily due to lower raw material costs, partially offset by increased health care costs, general insurance expense and incentive based compensation.   Heat Treating - Net sales increased $9.0 million, or 12.6%, to $80.2 million in 2002 from net sales of $71.2 million in 2001.  This increase was due primarily to the July 1, 2002 acquisition of B&W Heat treating and increased sales resulting from increased production levels in the automotive industry.   Income from operations increased 12.6% to $9.9 million in 2002 from $8.8 million in 2001.  Operating margin as a percentage of net sales of 12.4% for 2002 was comparable to 2001.   Year Ended 2001 Compared to Year Ended 2000   Consolidated   Net sales decreased $61.5 million, or 9.1%, to $616.0 million in 2001 from net sales of $677.5 million in 2000.  This decrease resulted primarily from changes in the general economy, particularly reduced production levels in the automotive industry, offset by including the net sales of Pennsylvania Industrial Heat Treating, Inc. (acquired February 13, 2001) (the 2001 acquisition) and a full year's net sales of Milcor, Inc. (acquired July 17, 2000) (the 2000 acquisition).   Cost of sales decreased $41.8 million, or 7.7%, to $499.9 million in 2001 from $541.7 million in 2000.  Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 81.2% in 2001 from 80.0% in 2000 primarily due to higher transportation, health insurance, utility, labor costs and fixed costs as a percentage of net sales due to lower sales volume in 2001 compared to 2000, partially offset by lower raw material costs in 2001.   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $2.7 million, or 3.5%, to $78.6 million in 2001 from $75.9 million in 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.8% in 2001 from 11.2% in 2000 primarily due to the non-cash charge of $1.0 million relating to the Company's E-Commerce investment and costs from the 2001 and 2000 acquisitions, which have higher selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales than our existing operations, offset by decreases in incentive based compensation.   Interest expense decreased $2.5 million from 2000 to 2001 due to reduced interest rates and decreased average borrowings in 2001.     As a result of the above, income before taxes decreased $19.9 million, or 48.6%, to $21.0 million in 2001 from $40.9 million in 2000.   Income taxes approximated $8.5 million in 2001, based on a 40.5% effective rate.   Segment Information   Processed Steel Products - Net sales decreased $69.0, or 21.5%, to $252.4 million in 2001, from net sales of $321.4 million in 2000.  This decrease was primarily due to reduced production levels in the automotive industry.   Income from operations decreased 25.5% to $29.2 million in 2001 from $39.1 million in 2000.  Operating margin decreased to 11.6% of net sales in 2001 from 12.2% in 2000, primarily due to higher health insurance, labor and utility costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by lower raw material costs and decreases in incentive based compensation.   Building Products - Net sales increased $14.8 million, or 5.3%, to $292.5 million in 2001 from $277.7 million in 2000. This increase was primarily due to including the full year's net sales of Milcor (acquired July 17, 2000) (the 2000 acquisition), partially offset by a decrease in net sales of existing operations due to changes in the general economy.   Income from operations decreased 19.2% to $18.2 million in 2001 from $22.5 million in 2000.  Operating margin decreased to 6.2% of net sales in 2001 from 8.1% in 2000, primarily due to higher costs as a percentage of net sales from the 2000 acquisition and higher material, transportation, health insurance and utility costs as a percentage of net sales at existing operations.   Heat Treating - Net sales decreased $7.3 million, or 9.3%, to $71.2 million in 2001 from $78.5 million in 2000. This decrease was primarily due to changes in the general economy, particularly reduced production levels in the automotive industry partially offset by including the net sales of Pennsylvania Industrial Heat Treaters, Inc. (acquired February 13, 2001) (the 2001 acquisition).   Income from operations decreased 32.6% to $8.8 million in 2001 from $13.1 million in 2000.  Operating margin decreased to 12.4% of net sales in 2001 from 16.6% in 2000, primarily due to higher health insurance and utility costs as a percentage of net sales at existing operations, partially offset by decreases in incentive based compensation and by lower costs as a percentage of net sales from the 2001 acquisition.     Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company's shareholders' equity increased by approximately $74.8 million or 34% to $293.1 million at December 31, 2002.  This increase was primarily due to the receipt of $50.7 million in net proceeds from the Company's stock offering in March of 2002.  These proceeds were used to repay existing debt.  During 2002, the Company's working capital increased $33.2 million or 32% to approximately $138.2 million.   The Company's principal capital requirements are to fund its operations, including working capital, the purchase and funding of improvements to its facilities, machinery and equipment and to fund acquisitions.   Net income of $23.9 million plus depreciation and amortization of $20.5 million and the provision for deferred income taxes of $5.8 million combined with an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.5 million, to provide cash of $53.7 million.  This cash was offset by $42.5 million used for working capital purposes, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $9.2 million as a result of increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2002 compared to the fourth quarter of 2001 and a $30.3 million increase in inventory levels to support this increased sales volume and to insure continued availability of material.   The $12.2 million of net cash provided by operations and the net proceeds of $50.7 million from the Company's stock offering plus cash on hand at the beginning of the period were used to pay down $45.4 million of the Company's revolving credit facility, to fund operations, the $8.8 million acquisition of B&W Heat Treating, capital expenditures of $16.0 million and cash dividends of $2.3 million.    At December 31, 2002, the Company had in use approximately $112 million of its $225 million secured revolving credit facility resulting in $113 million of availability.  Additionally, this credit facility also includes a $50 million expansion feature.   During 2002, the Company entered into a $50 million private placement of debt with a financial institution.  The private placement, which has an average term of 5.25 years and a blended rate of 8.17%, consists of a $25 million senior secured note and a $25 million senior subordinated note.  The proceeds of this private placement were used to pay down the Company's secured revolving credit facility.   The Company believes that availability of funds under its credit facility together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to provide the Company with the liquidity and capital resources necessary to support its principal capital requirements.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143  Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations  which requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred.  Implementation of SFAS No. 143 in 2003 will not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations.   In 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146  Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities  which requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.  The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002 and will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.   In 2002, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 148  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123  which provides alternative methods for the optional transition of the accounting for stock based compensation from the intrinsic method to the fair value method.  The Company does not plan to change its accounting for stock based compensation from the intrinsic method and, therefore, SFAS No. 148 will not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations.   In addition, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45  Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others  (FIN No. 45) in late 2002.  FIN No. 45 requires the fair-value measurement and recognition of a liability for the issuance of certain guarantees issued or modified January 1, 2003 or after.  The Company has implemented the enhanced disclosure requirements required by FIN No. 45.  Implementation of the fair-value measurement and recognition provisions of FIN No. 45 in 2003 will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.        Safe Harbor Statement     The Company wishes to take advantage of the Safe Harbor provisions included in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act").  Statements by the Company, other than historical information, constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Act and may be subject to a number of risk factors.  Factors that could affect these statements include, but are not limited to, the following:  the impact of changing steel prices on the Company's results of operations; changing demand for the Company's products and services; and changes in interest or tax rates.           Item 8.        Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
