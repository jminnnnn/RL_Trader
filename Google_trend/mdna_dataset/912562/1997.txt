Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of               Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Results of Operations       Year Ended 1996 Compared to Year Ended 1995       Net sales increased by $60.1  million, or 21%, to a record      $343.0 million in 1996 from $282.8 million in 1995.  This      increase primarily resulted from including twelve months      of net sales of Hubbell Steel (acquired April 1995) for      1996 compared to nine months in 1995, including net sales      of CCHT (acquired February 14, 1996) and sales growth at      existing operations.       Cost of sales increased by $41.3 million, or 17%, to      $281.7 million in 1996 from $240.3 million in 1995.  As a      percentage of net sales, cost of sales decreased to 82% of      net sales from 85%.  This decrease was primarily due to      higher margins attributable to CCHT sales and lower raw      material costs at other operations.       Selling, general and administrative expense increased by      $8.5 million, or 39%, to $30.6  million in 1996 from $22.1      million in 1995.  As a percentage of net sales, selling,      general and administrative expense increased to 8.9% from      7.8 % in 1995 primarily due to higher costs as a      percentage of sales attributable to CCHT and performance      based compensation linked to the Company's sales and      profitability.       Interest expense decreased by $.2 million primarily due to      lower interest rates in 1996 compared to 1995 which were      partially offset by higher average borrowings resulting      from higher inventory levels to service increased sales      and capital expenditures.       As a result of the above, income before taxes increased by      $10.4 million, or  64%, to a record $26.8 million in 1996      from $16.4 million in 1995.       Income taxes approximated $10.8 million in 1996, an      effective rate of 40.4% in comparison with 40.7% for 1995.        Year Ended 1995 Compared to Year Ended 1994       Net sales increased by $82.7 million, or 41%, to $282.8      million in 1995 from $200.1 million in 1994.  This      increase includes $63.2 million in net sales of Hubbell      since the acquisition at the beginning of the second      quarter.  The remaining net sales increase was      attributable to sales growth from existing operations and      new operations begun during 1995.       Cost of sales increased by $73.9 million, or 44%, to      $240.3 million in 1995 from $166.4 million in 1994.  As a      percentage of net sales, cost of sales increased to 85% of      net sales from 83.2%.  This increase was primarily due to      lower margins attributable to sales from Hubbell and lower      margins generated by startup operations.       Selling, general and administrative expense increased by      $4.6 million, or 26%, to $22.1 million in 1995 from $17.5      million in 1994.  As a percentage of net sales, selling,      general and administrative expense decreased to 7.8% from      8.8% in 1994 primarily as a result of the lower costs as a      percentage of sales attributable to Hubbell.         -13-       Interest expense increased by $2.6 million primarily as a      result of the Hubbell acquisition which resulted in higher      average borrowings, in addition to higher interest rates      compared to 1994 and additional borrowings resulting from      higher inventory levels to service increased sales and      capital expenditures.       As a result of the above, income before taxes increased by      $1.6 million, or 11%, to $16.4 million in 1995 from $14.8      million in 1994.       Income taxes approximated $6.7 million in 1995, an      effective rate of  40.7% in comparison with 40.5% for      1994.       Liquidity and Capital Resources       During 1996, the Company increased working capital by      19.4% to $68.7 million.  Long term debt was reduced to      $48.6 million and to 28.5% of total capitalization.      Additionally, shareholders' equity increased by 73.3% to      $121.7 million at December 31, 1996.       The Company's principal capital requirements are to fund      its operations including working capital requirements, the      purchase and funding of improvements to its facilities,      machinery and equipment and to fund acquisitions.       Net cash provided by operations of $13.6 million resulted      primarily from net income of $16.0 million and      depreciation of $6.2 million offset by the net increase in      inventory and payables of $7.8 million to support record      sales.       Net proceeds of the public offering of $34.4 million were      used to repay debt of $23.7 million incurred for the      acquisition of CCHT.       Significant capital expenditures included the completion      of the installation of a new slitting line and 45,000      square foot of production and storage space at a Buffalo,      New York facility and the construction relating to the new      cold rolling mill expansion at the Cleveland, Ohio      facility.       During 1996, the Company extended the expiration date of      its $125 million credit facility to November 17, 2000.      This facility may be converted to a four year amortizing      loan at any time prior to expiration.  At December 31,      1996, the Company had borrowings of $43 million and      additional availability of $82 million.       The Company believes that availability under its credit      facility, together with funds generated from operations,      will be more than sufficient to provide the Company with      the liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund its      anticipated working capital requirements, acquisitions and      capital expenditure commitments for the next twelve      months.       The Company believes that environmental issues will not      require the expenditure of material amounts for      environmental compliance in the future.         -14-              Company Responsibility For Financial Statements        The accompanying consolidated financial statements of      Gibraltar Steel Corporation have been prepared by      management, which is responsible for their integrity and      objectivity.  The statements have been prepared in      conformity with generally accepted accounting principles      and include amounts based on management's best estimates      and judgments.  Financial information elsewhere in this      Annual Report is consistent with that in the consolidated      financial statements.       The Company has established and maintains a system of      internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance      that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records      reflect the authorized transactions of the Company.       The financial statements have been audited by Price      Waterhouse LLP, independent accountants.  As part of their      audit of the Company's 1996 financial statements, Price      Waterhouse LLP considered the Company's system of internal      control to the extent they deemed necessary to determine      the nature, timing and extent of their audit tests.       The Board of Directors pursues its responsibility for the      Company's financial reporting through its Audit Committee,      which is composed entirely of outside directors.  The      independent accountants have direct access to the Audit      Committee, with and without the presence of management      representatives, to discuss the results of their audit      work and their comments on the adequacy of internal      accounting controls and the quality of financial      reporting.
