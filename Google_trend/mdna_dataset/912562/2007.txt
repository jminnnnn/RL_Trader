Item 7.   Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.   Overview     The consolidated financial statements present the financial condition of the Company as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.   We are a leading manufacturer, processor and distributor of residential and commercial building products and processed metal products for industrial applications. We serve over 10,000 customers in a variety of industries in all 50 states, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Asia, and Central and South America. We operate 81 facilities in 27 states, Canada, England, Germany, Poland and China.   Segments     We operate in two reportable segmentsBuilding Products and Processed Metal Products.                       Building Products.  We process sheet steel to produce over 5,000 building and construction products, including mailboxes, ventilation products, structural connectors, bar grating, metal lath and expanded metal. We sell these products primarily to major retail home centers, such as The Home Depot, Lowes, Menards, metal service centers, wholesalers and contractor suppliers.                           Processed Metal Products.  We produce a wide variety of cold-rolled strip steel products, coated sheet steel products and powdered metal products. In this segment, we primarily serve the automotive industrys leaders, such as General Motors, Ford, DaimlerChrysler and Honda, and other major manufacturers such as 3M Company, as well as the automotive supply, commercial and residential metal building, power and hand tool and other industries.       The following table sets forth our net sales from continuing operations by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006.                                                                                     Year ended December 31,           (Dollars in thousands)         2006              2005              2004              Statement of income data:                                                                  Net sales                                                                  Building products         $    872,639              $    615,386              $    477,316           Processed metal products              430,716                   421,437                   359,725                                                               Total consolidated net sales         $    1,303,355              $    1,036,823              $    837,041                                                                 24         We also hold equity positions in a steel cold-rolled strip steel joint venture and a pickling joint venture, both of which are included in our Processed Metal Products segment.

The increase in net sales was attributable to the acquisition of AMICO in October 2005, which provided an additional $270.1 million in net sales in 2006, and the acquisition of EMC in November 2006, which provided $10.4 million in net sales in 2006. The decrease in net sales excluding the effect of these acquisitions was the result of sales declines in our historic building products business, the result of volume decreases due to softening in the domestic automotive and new build housing markets, along with the reduction in severe weather during 2006 as compared to 2005, which drove volumes during 2005 at certain subsidiaries.   Cost of sales increased $196.4 million, or 23.2%, to $1,041.5 million in 2006 from $845.1 million in 2005. The increase was due to higher sales volumes due to acquisitions noted above. The acquisitions of AMICO in October 2005 and EMC in November 2006 added $211.9 million to cost of sales in 2006. The $15.5 million decrease in cost of sales for the remainder of the business was the result of product mix and lower material costs as a percentage of sales. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 79.9% in 2006, from 81.5% in 2005. The increase in gross margin is attributable mainly to lower material costs in the building products segment which more than offset higher material costs in the processed metals segment in 2006 compared to 2005.   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $30.9 million, or 27.9%, to $141.6 million in 2006, from $110.7 million in 2005. The acquisition of AMICO in October 2005 and EMC in November 2006 caused $22.0 million of the increase in 2006. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased 0.2%, to 10.9% in 2006 from 10.7% in 2005, due mainly to higher legal costs associated with acquisition activities, higher compensation costs and higher health insurance costs.   As a result of the above, income from operations increased by approximately $39.2 million, to $120.3 million in 2006 from $81.1 million in 2005.   Interest expense increased 32.5% or $6.7 million, to $27.3 million in 2006 from $20.6 million in 2005. The increase in interest was the result of higher average borrowings in 2006 and higher weighed average interest rates.   Equity in income (loss) of partnerships and other income decreased by $13.3 million in 2006. This decline was due mainly to the impairment of our investment in Gibraltar DFC Strip Steel, LLC, a joint venture. During December 2006, the Company determined that its investment in this joint venture was other than temporarily impaired, and recognized a $12.9 million charge related to the joint venture.   Income taxes related to continuing operations for 2006 approximated $30.1 million based upon an effective tax rate of 37.6% versus 38.3% in 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate during 2006 was the result of a benefit from a permanent difference and a reduction in state income taxes in Texas.   Income from discontinued operations increased $1.4 million, to $7.4 million in 2006, from $6.0 million in 2005.   Segment Information     Building products.  Net sales increased 41.8% or $257.2 million, to $872.6 million in 2006 from $615.4 million in 2005. The increase was the result of the acquisitions of AMICO in October 2005 and EMC in November 2006, which provided an additional $280.5 million. The decrease in net sales excluding the effect of these acquisitions was the result of the factors described under Consolidated above.   Income from operations increased $46.8 million, or 57.5%, to $128.1 million in 2006 from $81.3 million in 2005. Operating margin increased to 14.7% in 2006 from 13.2% in 2005. The increase in operating margin was mainly the result of lower material costs as a percentage of sales, partially offset by an increase in amortization expense related to intangibles.   26         Processed metal products.  Net sales increased $9.3 million, or 2.2%, to $430.7 million in 2006 from $421.4 million in 2005. The increase in net sales was primarily the result of increased copper costs which resulted in higher selling prices.   Income from operations declined $1.4 million, or 5.2%, to $26.1 million in 2006 from $27.5 million in 2005. Income from operations as a percentage of net sales declined to 6.1% in 2006 from 6.5% in 2005. The decrease was the result of higher material costs partially offset by lower profit sharing expenses.   Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004     Consolidated     Net sales increased by approximately $199.8 million, or 23.9%, to $1,036.8 million in 2005, from $837.0 in 2004. The increase in sales was attributable to the acquisition of AMICO in October 2005, which provided $77.8 million, the acquisitions of the Gutter Helmet product line (September 2005), American Wilcon (October 2005), and SCM Asia (September 2005) provided an additional $4.6 million in sales, and a full years results from SCM Metal Products Inc. (SCM) (acquired in June 2004), which resulted in an additional $28.6 million. The remaining increase was the result of increases in both volume and selling prices. The volume increases were driven by our strategy of using our national manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities to sell products from a greater number of our product lines to both new and existing customers, especially national customers, and from offering product extensions and design enhancements to existing product lines, particularly in the Building Products segment.   Cost of sales increased by approximately $179.1 million, or 26.9%, to $845.1 million in 2005, from $666.0 million in 2004. The increase was due mainly to the higher sales volumes resulting from acquisitions and expanded penetration noted above, along with the higher cost of steel and other materials used in our products. The 2005 acquisitions of AMICO, the Gutter Helmet product line, American Wilcon and SCM Asia, along with the 2004 acquisition of SCM contributed $88.3 million of the increase in cost of sales. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 81.5% in 2005, from 79.6% in 2004. The decrease in gross margins is attributable to higher raw material costs, and to a lesser extent, increased energy costs. In particular, we had purchased extra steel in early 2005 to build up our inventory because we were concerned that rising steel prices at that time could lead to steel shortages. These shortages did not materialize, and, when steel prices began to decline in mid-2005, our margins were compressed as we sold relatively high-cost inventory at the lower prices demanded by the market in the Processed Metal Products segment and at prices in the Building Products segment that did not fully pass on the costs of inventory. The decline in gross margins in 2005 was partially offset by better cost absorption due to higher volumes, as compared to the same period in the prior year.   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $10.0 million, or 10.0%, to $110.7 million in 2005, from $100.7 million in 2004. The primary reason for the increase was due to the acquisition of AMICO in October 2005 and a full year of expense at SCM which contributed $8.3 million of the increase. Excluding the effect of the acquisitions, selling, general and administrative costs were relatively flat as increases in salaries were more than offset by the decline in bonuses. As a result, selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 10.7% in 2005, from 12.0% in 2004.   As a result of the above, income from operations increased to approximately $81.1 million in 2005, from $70.4 million in 2004.   Interest expense increased $10.1 million, or 96.2%, to $20.6 million in 2005 from $10.5 million in 2004. The increase was the result of prepayment penalties of $6.8 million incurred in connection with the repayment of certain senior secured and private placement notes, with the remaining increase the result of higher average borrowings during 2005, and higher weighted average interest rates.   Equity in income of partnerships and other income decreased $4.5 million to $0.3 million in 2005 from $4.8 million in 2004. The decrease was primarily due to our share of the losses incurred during 2005 from our equity interest in   27           Gibraltar DFC Strip Steel LLC, a joint venture. The losses were incurred as the joint venture lost significant volume to a competitor that reduced selling prices and relatively high inventory costs at the joint venture.   Income taxes related to continuing operations for 2005 approximated $23.3 million based upon an effective tax rate of 38.3% versus a 39% effective tax rate in 2004. The qualified production activities deduction under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate.   Income from discontinued operations for 2005 was $6.0 million compared to $11.3 million in 2004.   Segment information    Building products.  Net sales increased by approximately $138.1 million, or 28.9%, to $615.4 million in 2005, from $477.3 million in 2004. The increase in net sales was due primarily to the acquisition of AMICO in October 2005, which accounted for $77.8 million in sales. The remaining increase in net sales was the result of expanded sales penetration due to the factors described under Consolidated above and price increases.   Income from operations increased $22.2 million, or 37.7%, to $81.3 million in 2005 from $59.1 million in 2004. Operating margin increased to 13.2% in 2005 from 12.4% in 2004. The increase was driven by the acquisition of AMICO, which has slightly higher margins than the pre-existing building products businesses, and a reduction in selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales, mainly a function of increased sales.   Processed Metal Products.  Net sales increased by approximately $61.7 million, or 17.2%, to $421.4 million in 2005, from $359.7 million in 2004. The increase in net sales was primarily a function of higher average selling prices in 2005 driven by the rise in steel prices that occurred throughout 2004, as well as the acquisition of SCM in June 2004, which accounted for $28.6 million of the increase. Although steel prices declined in 2005, our selling prices were still higher on average than our selling prices in 2004.   Income from operations as a percentage of net sales decreased to 6.5% in 2005 from 10.6% in 2004. The decrease in operating margin was primarily the result of increased material costs partially offset by lower labor costs as percentage of net sales and a full year of operations of SCM which has slightly higher operating margins than the remainder of our Processed Metals Products business. The reduction in margins was most notable in our service center business.   Critical Accounting Policies     The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make decisions based upon estimates, assumptions, and factors it considers relevant to the circumstances. Such decisions include the selection of applicable principles and the use of judgment in their application, the results of which could differ from those anticipated.   A summary of the Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Companys consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.   Our most critical accounting policies include:                       valuation of accounts receivable, which impacts selling, general and administrative expense;                           valuation of inventory, which impacts cost of sales and gross margin;                           revenue recognition, which impacts net sales, gross margin and net income;                           the allocation of the purchase price of our acquisition-related assets and liabilities, which affects our depreciation and amortization costs; and      28                              the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible and long-lived assets, which impacts write-offs of goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets.       Management reviews the estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experience, current conditions and future expectations. Management believes these estimates are reasonable, but actual results could differ from these estimates.   Valuation of accounts receivable.  Our accounts receivable represent those amounts that have been billed to our customers but not yet collected. We record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the portion of those accounts receivable that we believe are potentially uncollectible based on various factors, including historical experience, creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions. If the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing of costs recognized.   Valuation of inventories.  We state our inventories at the lower of cost or market. We determine the cost basis of our inventory on a first-in-first-out basis using either actual costs or a standard cost methodology that approximates actual cost. We regularly review inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete and slow-moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends. Changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand, which may require higher provisions for obsolete inventory.   Revenue recognition.  We recognize revenue when all of the following have occurred: products are shipped or service is provided, the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss, collection of the relevant receivable is probable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable. We treat sales returns, allowances and customer incentives as reductions to sales, and we accrue for those items based on historical experience and current estimates of future sales, revising our estimates throughout the year when necessary.   Allocation to purchase price of acquired assets and liabilities.  When we acquire a new business, we must allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the transaction at their respective estimated fair market values. We record any premium over the fair market value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price involves judgments and estimates both in characterizing the assets and in determining their fair market value. The way we characterize the assets has important implications, as long-lived assets, for example, are depreciated or amortized, whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment, as explained below. With respect to determining the fair market value of assets, the most difficult estimations of individual fair market values are those involving long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and identified intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair market value determinations and, for major business acquisitions, engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair market value determination of the acquired long-lived assets. Due to the subjectivity inherent in determining the estimated fair market value of long-lived assets and the significant number of business acquisitions that we have completed, we believe that the recording of acquired assets and liabilities is a critical accounting policy.   Depreciation, amortization and impairment testing of long-lived assets.  We depreciate long-lived assets with estimated useful lives over those useful lives. We amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives (which consist primarily of acquired customer lists, non-competition agreements and unpatented technology) over those estimated useful lives. The specific lives are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 herein.   We test long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceeds their fair market value. This circumstance exists if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. The impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair market value as determined by discounted cash flow method or in the case of negative cash flow, an independent market appraisal of the asset.   Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing.  We test goodwill annually for impairment (or more often if indicators of impairment exist) at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair market value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. A reporting unit is either the same as, or one level below, an operating segment. We have   29           more reporting units than operating segments, and our reporting units may change over time. The primary valuation method for determining the fair market value of the reporting unit is a discounted cash flow analysis. If the goodwill is indicated as being impaired (i.e., the fair market value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount), the fair market value of the reporting unit is then allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. This implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill, and, if it is less, we then recognize an impairment loss.   The Company tests its indefinite-lived assets from impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset could be below its carrying amount. The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, determined using discounted cash flows, with its carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value.   Liquidity and Capital Resources     The Companys principal capital requirements are to fund its operations, including working capital; to purchase new facilities and fund improvements to its existing facilities; to purchase new and maintain existing machinery and equipment; and to fund acquisitions.   We regularly consider various strategic business opportunities including acquisitions. We evaluate such potential acquisitions on the basis of our ability to enhance our existing products, operations, or capabilities, as well as provide access to new products, markets and customers. If we enter into any future acquisition transaction, we may finance that acquisition through a number of sources, including internally available cash resources, new debt financing, the issuance of equity securities or any combination of the above.   Working capital    During 2006, our Companys working capital (inclusive of the impact of working capital acquired from acquisitions of EMC, Home Impressions and Steel City) increased by approximately $64.6 million, or 24.2%, to approximately $331.4 million at December 31, 2006 from $266.8 million at December 31, 2005. This increase in working capital was primarily the result of an increase in inventories of $65.0 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $20.5 million, a decrease of $12.4 million in other liabilities and increases in accounts receivable of $6.9 million, partially offset by a $23.5 million decrease in assets from discontinued operations and a $15.1 million reduction in cash and cash equivalents.   Our working capital also typically undergoes seasonal variations. Our net sales are generally lower in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, and we usually begin the fourth quarter with lower inventory and higher accounts payable. To address these fluctuations, we generally increase working capital in the second and third quarters, and working capital then generally decreases in the fourth quarter. At December 31, 2006, our working capital was higher than normal due to a reduction in sales during the fourth quarter that reduced the rate of liquidation of our inventories that we would normally expect.   Cash flows     Operating activities.  Net cash used in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 was approximately $20.9 million compared to net cash provided by continuing operations of approximately $116.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net cash used in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of increases in inventories of $55.1 million, decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $31.7 million, and decreases of deferred taxes of $29.0 million, partially offset by net income from continuing operations of $49.9 million, depreciation and amortization of $27.5 million, and equity in partnerships' loss of $13.9 million. Net cash provided by continuing operations in 2005 resulted primarily from net income from continuing operations of $37.5 million, depreciation and amortization of $20.5 million, decreases in inventories of $42.2 million and decreases in accounts receivable and other assets of $16.3 million .    30         Investing activities.  Net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 was approximately $72.5 million, consisting primarily the net proceeds of the sale of our thermal processing and steel strapping businesses of $ 151.5 million, partially offset by the acquisitions of EMC, Home Impressions and the assets of Steel City in the amount of $57.4 million, and capital expenditures of $21.9 million. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 was approximately $245.3 million, consisting primarily of the acquisitions of AMICO, the Gutter Helmet product line, the assets of American Wilcon, and SCM Asia in the amount of $271.0 million, and capital expenditures of $17.5 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of Milcor of $42.6 million.   Financing activities.  Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $69.2 million, consisting primarily of repayments of long-term debt under our senior term facility of $106.2 million and dividend payments of $6.0 million, partially offset by proceeds of $50.8 million under our revolving credit facility. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $137.3 million, consisting primarily of borrowings of long-term debt under our senior term facility of $230.0 million and the proceeds of $200.6 million from the issuance of senior subordinated notes, partially offset by payments of $132.6 million under our revolving credit facility, $114.6 in senior secured and private placement notes, the repayment of $39.6 million in acquisition notes, the payment of $10.8 million in deferred financing costs and dividend payments of $5.9 million.   Senior credit facility and senior subordinated notes    We and our wholly-owned subsidiary Gibraltar Steel Corporation of New York are co-borrowers under an amended and restated credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders providing for (i) a revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of up to $300.0 million including a $25.0 million sub-limit for letters of credit and a swing line loan sub-limit of $20.0 million and (ii) a term loan in the original principal amount of $230 million. At December 31, 2006, outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility were $74.6 million, $17.2 million of letters of credit were outstanding and $208.2 million was available to be borrowed. During 2006, we repaid $106.2 million of the term loan and at December 31, 2006, we had $123.8 million outstanding on the term loan. The amended and restated credit agreement will permit the borrowers to enter into agreements with the administrative agents and any willing lenders to increase the revolving commitments of those lenders or add new term loans from those lenders up to an aggregate amount of $75.0 million without obtaining the consent of the majority lenders.   The senior credit facility is guaranteed by each of our material domestic subsidiaries other than Gibraltar Steel Corporation of New York, which is a co-borrower. The senior credit facility and the related guarantees are secured by a first priority security interest (subject to permitted liens, as defined in the credit agreement) in substantially all the tangible and intangible assets of our Company and our material domestic subsidiaries and one of our foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, and a pledge of 65% of the voting stock of our other foreign subsidiaries. The senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by each of our material domestic subsidiaries.   The credit agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants customary for similar working capital facilities, including, but not limited to, several financial covenants. We must maintain a total funded debt to consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement) ratio not to exceed 4.25 to 1.00 through September 29, 2006, 4.00 to 1.00 from September 30, 2006 through September 29, 2007 and 3.75 to 1.00 thereafter. We must also maintain a senior funded debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio not to exceed 3.25 to 1.00 through September 29, 2006, 3.00 to 1.00 from September 30, 2006 through September 29, 2007 and 2.75 to 1.00 thereafter. Our interest coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of consolidated Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT, as defined in the credit agreement) to consolidated interest expense, must not be less than 2.75 to 1.00, and our net worth must be at least $325.0 million plus 50% of cumulative net income in each fiscal quarter after September 30, 2005. Consolidated EBITDA, as defined under our credit agreement, is not calculated in the same manner as under the senior subordinated notes.   The Company believes that availability of funds under its existing credit facility, together with the cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to provide it with the liquidity and capital resources necessary to support its principal capital requirements, including operating activities, capital expenditures, dividends and future acquisitions.   31         Contractual Obligations    The following table summarizes our companys contractual obligations at December 31, 2006:                                                                                                                   (Dollars in thousands)         Payments due by period                                         Less                                                      More                                         than                                                      than           Contractual obligations         Total              1 year              1-3 years              3-5 years              5 Years              Variable rate debt         $    199,679              $    2,300              $    4,600              $    80,429              $    112,350           Interest on variable rate debt (1)              64,884                   12,426                   24,852                   20,422                   7,184           Fixed rate debt              200,874                   36                   13                                      200,825           Interest on fixed rate debt              147,732                   16,569                   33,136                   33,136                   64,891           Operating lease obligations              54,190                   12,176                   18,755                   11,814                   11,445           Pension and other post-retirement obligations              4,844                   193                   535                   898                   3,218           Employment agreement              500                   500                                                                                                                                                      Total (2)         $    672,703              $    44,200              $    81,891              $    146,699              $    399,913                                                                                                                      (1)         Calculated using the interest rate in effect at December 31, 2006, assuming no payments were made to reduce the revolving credit facility until its maturity date.           (2)         Excludes contingent consideration relating to our acquisitions of Construction Metals and Home Impressions. In 2006 we paid $2.2 million pursuant to these obligations.        Related Party Transactions     In connection with the acquisition of Construction Metals in April 2003, the Company entered into two unsecured subordinated notes payable, each in the amount of $8.75 million (aggregate total of $17.5 million). These notes were payable to the former owners of Construction Metals and are considered related party in nature due to the former owners current employment relationship with the Company. These notes were payable in three equal annual principal installments of approximately $2.9 million per note, beginning on April 1, 2004, and the final principal payment was paid on April 1, 2006. These notes required quarterly interest payments at an interest rate of 5.0% per annum. Interest expense related to these notes payable aggregated approximately $72,000, $364,000 and $658,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2005, the current portion of these notes payable aggregated approximately $5.8 million and accrued interest aggregated approximately $74,000.   The Company has certain operating lease agreements related to operating locations and facilities with the former owners of Construction Metals (related parties) or companies controlled by these parties. Rental expense associated with these related party operating leases aggregated approximately $1,353,000, $1,418,000 and $1,304,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.   Two members of our Board of Directors are partners in law firms that provide legal services to the Company. During 2006 and 2005, we incurred $1,869,000 and $2,114,000 for legal services from these firms, respectively. Of the amount incurred, $1,567,000 and $1,024,000 was expensed and $302,000 and $1,090,000 was capitalized as acquisition costs and deferred financing issuance costs in 2006 and 2005, respectively.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements     The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share-Based Payment, in December 2004. SFAS No. 123R is a revision of FASB Statement 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. The Statement focuses   32           primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. SFAS No. 123R requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. This statement was effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that began after June 15, 2005 and the Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2006. Implementation of this statement caused expense of approximately $296,000 as the Company recognized expense related to unvested stock options.   In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, (SFAS 151) which clarifies the types of costs that should be expensed rather than capitalized as inventory. This statement also clarifies the circumstances under which fixed overhead costs associated with operating facilities involved in inventory processing should be capitalized. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 were effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005 and the Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2006. Implementation of this statement did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.   In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes(FIN 48 or the Interpretation) which defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the taxing authority. Uncertainty in income taxes, as used in the title of the new Interpretation, refers to uncertainty about how some transactions will be treated under the tax law. This uncertainty leads to questions about whether tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns should be reflected in the financial statements before they are finally resolved with the taxing authorities. FIN 48 applies to all tax positions, regardless of their level of uncertainty or the nature of the position. However, the Interpretations recognition and measurement requirements are likely to have the most impact on positions for which current or future deductions may be disallowed or reduced in a tax examination. The Interpretation applies to situations where the uncertainty is about the timing of the deduction, the amount of the deduction, or the validity of the deduction. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and we will adopt this Interpretation during the first quarter of 2007. We do not expect that this Interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures about fair-value measurements. SFAS 157 applies only to fair-value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards and is expected to increase the consistency of those measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fair-value measures already required or permitted by other standards for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We have not yet evaluated the effect that this standard may have upon our consolidated financial position or results of operations.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158), which requires employers to recognize on their balance sheets the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans. SFAS No. 158 also requires companies to recognize actuarial gains and losses, prior service cost, and any remaining transition amounts from the initial application of Statements 87 and 106 when recognizing a plans funded status, with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive income. The provisions of SFAS 158 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006 and we have adopted this standard effective December 31, 2006. Adoption of this standard resulted in a $1.6 million increase in other non-current liabilities, a $1.0 million decrease in other comprehensive income, and a $.6 million increase in deferred tax assets.   In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159), which allows measurement of specified financial instruments, warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in each period. SFAS 159 is effective at the beginning of the fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007, and will be effective for the Company in fiscal 2008. The Company has not yet determined the effect that the implementation of this standard will have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations   33           Item 7A .  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk     In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to various market risk factors, including changes in general economic conditions, competition and raw materials pricing and availability. In addition, the Company is exposed to market risk, primarily related to its long-term debt. To manage interest rate risk, the Company uses both fixed and variable interest rate debt. The Company also entered into interest rate swap agreements that converted a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $115 million of revolving credit borrowings that was fixed rate debt pursuant to these agreements.   The following table summarizes the principal cash flows and related interest rates of the Companys long-term debt at December 31, 2006 by expected maturity dates. The weighted average interest rates are based on the actual rates that existed at December 31, 2006. The variable rate debt consists primarily of the revolving credit facility and term loan, of which $198.4 million is outstanding at December 31, 2006. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would have changed the 2006 interest expense by approximately $2.0 million.                                                                                                                                                                     (in thousands)                2007         2008         2009         2010         2011         Thereafter         Total         Long-term debt (fixed)         $    36              $    13                                                                       $    200,825              $    200,874                                                                                                                                                              Weighted average interest rate              8.25    %              8.25    %              8.25    %              8.25    %              8.25    %              8.25    %                                                                                                                                                                             Long-term debt (variable)         $    2,300              $    2,300              $    2,300              $    78,129              $    2,300              $    112,350              $    199,679                                                                                                                                                              Weighted average interest rate              6.82    %              6.82    %              6.82    %              6.82    %              7.13    %              7.13    %                                                                                                                                                                             Interest rate swaps (notional amounts)         $    57,500                                                    $    57,500                                                    $    115,000                                                                                                                                                              Interest pay rate              4.99    %              5.03    %              5.03    %              5.03    %                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Interest receive rate              5.37    %              5.37    %              5.37    %              5.37    %                                                                  The fair value of the Companys debt was $401.7 million at December 31, 2006.
