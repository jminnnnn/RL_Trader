Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition               and Results of Operations       Results of Operations       Year Ended 1998 Compared to Year Ended 1997       Net sales increased $108.2 million, or 24%, to a record      $557.9 million in 1998 from $449.7 million in 1997.  This      increase primarily resulted from including the net sales      of Solar (acquired March 1, 1998), Appleton (acquired      April 1, 1998), USP (acquired June 1, 1998) and Harbor      (acquired October 1, 1998) (collectively, the 1998      acquisitions) from their respective acquisition dates with      the net sales of the Company's existing operations, and      from sales growth at existing operations.       Cost of sales increased $80.9 million,  or 22%, to $456.4      million in 1998 from $375.5 million in 1997.  Cost of      sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 81.8% in      1998 from 83.5% in 1997.  This improvement was due to the      1998 acquisitions, which have historically generated      higher margins than the Company's existing operations, and      due to lower raw material costs at existing operations.       Selling, general and administrative expenses increased      $15.5 million, or 37%, to $57.0 million in 1998 from $41.6      million in 1997.  Selling, general and administrative      expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 10.2%      in 1998 from 9.2% in 1997.  This increase was primarily      due to higher costs as a percentage of net sales due to      acquisitions and performance based compensation linked to      the Company's sales and profitability.       Interest expense increased by  $6.3 million from 1997 to      1998 primarily due to higher average borrowings during      1998 as a result of current year acquisitions and capital      expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in interest      rates in the fourth quarter of 1998.       As a result of the above, income before taxes increased by      $5.6 million, or 20%, to a record $33.1 million in 1998      from $27.5 million in 1997.       Income taxes approximated $13.2 million in 1998, based on      a 40.0% effective rate compared with a 40.3% effective      rate in 1997.        Year Ended 1997 Compared to Year Ended 1996       Net sales increased by $106.7 million, or 31%, to $449.7      million in 1997 from $343.0 million in 1996.  This      increase primarily resulted from the inclusion of net      sales of SEMCO (acquired January 1997) and sales growth at      existing operations.       Cost of sales increased $93.8 million, or 33%, to $375.5      million in 1997 from $281.7 million in 1996.  Cost of      sales increased to 83.5% of net sales in 1997 from 82.1%      of net sales in 1996.  This increase was due to higher raw      material costs which were not fully passed through to      customers, partially offset by higher margins on SEMCO      sales.       Selling, general and administrative expense increased by      $10.9 million, or 36%, to $41.6 million in 1997 from $30.6      million in 1996.  As a percentage of net sales, selling,      general and administrative expenses increased from 8.9% in      1996 to 9.2% in 1997.  This increase was primarily due to      higher costs as a percentage of sales attributable to      SEMCO.       Interest expense increased by $1.3 million from 1996 to      1997 primarily due to higher average borrowings as a      result of the SEMCO acquisition and capital expenditures.                                     14       As a result of the above, income before taxes increased by      $.7 million, or 3%, to $27.5 million in 1997 from $26.8      million in 1996.       Income taxes approximated $11.1 million in 1997, an      effective rate of 40.3% in comparison with 40.4% in 1996.        Liquidity and Capital Resources       During 1998, the Company increased its working capital by      $36.6 million to $124.2 million as a result of the      addition of working capital from the 1998 acquisitions and      due to working capital increases at the Company's existing      operations.  As a result, the Company's current ratio      improved to 3.4 to 1 at December 31, 1998 from 3.0 to 1 at      December 31, 1997.  Long-term debt increased by $117.6      million to $199.4 million and to 55% of total      capitalization at December 31, 1998.  Additionally,      shareholders' equity increased by 14% to $160.3 million.       The Company's principal capital requirements are to fund      its operations, including working capital requirements,      the purchase and funding of improvements to its property      and equipment, and to fund acquisitions.       The Company's primary sources of liquidity are from cash      provided by operating activities and the Company's      revolving credit facility.  Net cash provided by      operations of $13.3 million resulted primarily from net      income of $19.8 million and depreciation and amortization      of $13.3 million, offset by increases in accounts      receivable and inventories of $11.7 million, necessary to      service increased sales levels, and the decrease in      accounts payable and accrued expenses of $7.6 million.       During 1998, the Company amended its revolving credit      agreement with its bank group to increase the capacity of      its revolver to $240 million and secure borrowings      thereunder with its accounts receivable, inventories and      property.  At December 31, 1998, the Company had five      interest rate swap agreements outstanding which      effectively converted $75 million of borrowings under the      revolving credit agreement to fixed rates ranging from      6.60% to 7.31% and which terminate at different dates      beginning in November 2000.  The Company accounts for      interest rate swap agreements on an accrual basis.      Additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility      carry interest at LIBOR plus a fixed rate.  The weighted      average interest rate of these borrowings was 6.71% at      December 31, 1998.       Net cash provided by operations of $13.3 million combined      with net proceeds from long-term debt of $107.3 million      and $.6 million of cash on hand were primarily used for      the acquisition of Solar, Appleton, USP and Harbor, and      for capital expenditures.       The Company believes that availability under its credit      facility, together with funds generated from operations,      will be more than sufficient to provide the Company with      the liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund its      anticipated working capital requirements, acquisitions and      capital expenditure commitments for the next twelve      months.       The Company believes that environmental issues will not      require the expenditure of material amounts for      environmental compliance in the future.                                     15       Impact of Year 2000       The Year 2000 issue concerns the inability of some      computer hardware and software to distinguish between the      year 1900 and the year 2000.  If not corrected, computer      applications could fail or create erroneous results.       The Company is conducting a detailed assessment of all of      its information technology and non-information technology      hardware and software with regard to Year 2000 issues.      The Company's plan to ensure that its systems are Year      2000 ready is comprised of: cataloging all processes and      systems which may have a date-related component and      identifying those which are not Year 2000 ready;      correcting or replacing those systems which are not Year      2000 ready; and testing the corrected or replaced      processes and systems to insure that they will, in fact,      operate as desired according to Year 2000 requirements.      The Company is in various stages of its Year 2000      readiness process at each of its facilities and expects to      complete testing of the corrected or replaced systems and      be fully Year 2000 ready by July 1999.  In addition, the      Company is working with its major customers and major      vendors, including raw material suppliers and utility      companies, to assess their internal state of Year 2000      readiness.  These customer and vendor responses are      evaluated for any possible risk to, or effect on, the      Company's operations and are incorporated into its own      detailed Year 2000 readiness assessment.       Costs specifically associated with modifying internal use      software for Year 2000 readiness are expensed as incurred      but have not been, and are not expected to be, material to      the Company's net income.  Costs of  replacing some of the      Company's systems with Year 2000 ready systems have been      capitalized as these new systems were acquired for      business reasons and not to remediate Year 2000 problems,      if any, in the former systems.       Based upon the results of Year 2000 readiness efforts      underway, the Company believes that all critical      information and non-information technology systems and      processes will be Year 2000 ready and allow the Company to      continue operations beyond the Year 2000 without a      material impact on its results of operations or financial      position.  However, unanticipated problems which may be      identified in the ongoing Year 2000 readiness process      could result in an undetermined financial risk.      Contingency plans to counter these unanticipated problems      will be developed as part of the ongoing Year 2000      readiness process.        Recent Accounting Pronouncement       In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board      issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133      Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging      Activities (FAS No. 133) which requires recognition of the      fair value of derivatives in the statement of financial      position, with changes in the fair value recognized either      in earnings or as a component of other comprehensive      income dependent upon the hedging nature of the      derivative.  Implementation of FAS No. 133 is required for      fiscal 2000.  FAS No. 133 will not have a material impact      on the Company's earnings or other comprehensive income.                                      16                           Safe Harbor Statement       The Company wishes to take advantage of the Safe Harbor      provisions included in the Private Securities Litigation      Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act").  Statements by the      Company, other than historical information, constitute      "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Act      and may be subject to a number of risk factors.  Factors      that could affect these statements include, but are not      limited to, the following:  the impact of changing steel      prices on the Company's results of operations; changing      demand for the company's products and services; the impact      of the Year 2000 issue; and changes in interest or tax      rates.                                      17                  Company Responsibility For Financial Statements        The accompanying consolidated financial statements of      Gibraltar Steel Corporation have been prepared by      management, which is responsible for their integrity and      objectivity.  The statements have been prepared in      conformity with generally accepted accounting principles      and include amounts based on management's best estimates      and judgments.  Financial information elsewhere in this      Annual Report is consistent with that in the consolidated      financial statements.       The Company has established and maintains a system of      internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance      that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records      reflect the authorized transactions of the Company.       The financial statements have been audited by      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants.  As      part of their audit of the Company's 1998 financial      statements, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP considered the      Company's system of internal control to the extent they      deemed necessary to determine the nature, timing and      extent of their audit tests.       The Board of Directors pursues its responsibility for the      Company's financial reporting through its Audit Committee,      which is composed entirely of outside directors.  The      independent accountants have direct access to the Audit      Committee, with and without the presence of management      representatives, to discuss the results of their audit      work and their comments on the adequacy of internal      accounting controls and the quality of financial      reporting.
