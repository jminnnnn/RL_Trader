Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition               and Results of Operations       Results of Operations       Year Ended 1999 Compared to Year Ended 1998       Net sales increased $64.0 million, or 11.5%, to a record      $621.9 million in 1999 from $557.9 million in 1998.  This      increase primarily resulted from including the net sales      of Southeastern Heat Treating (acquired April 1, 1999),      Weather Guard (acquired July 1, 1999), Hi-Temp (acquired      August 1, 1999), Brazing Concepts (acquired November 1,      1999) and Hughes (acquired December 1, 1999) (the 1999      acquisitions) from their respective acquisition dates, and      a full year of net sales of Solar (acquired March 1,      1998), Appleton (acquired April 1, 1998), USP (acquired      June 1, 1998) and Harbor (acquired October 1, 1998) (the      1998 acquisitions), together with sales growth at existing      operations.       Cost of sales increased $37.5 million, or 8.2%, to $493.9      million in 1999 from $456.4 million in 1998.  Cost of      sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 79.4% in      1999 from 81.8% in 1998.  This improvement was due to the      1999 and 1998 acquisitions, which have historically      generated higher margins than the Company's existing      operations, and due to lower raw material costs at      existing operations.       Selling, general and administrative expenses increased      $15.5 million, or 27.1%, to $72.5 million in 1999 from      $57.0 in 1998.  Selling, general and administrative      expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.7%      in 1999 from 10.2% in 1998.  This increase was due to      higher costs as a percentage of net sales attributable to      the 1999 and 1998 acquisitions, and due to performance      based compensation linked to the Company's sales and      profitability.       Interest expense increased by $2.0 million from 1998 to      1999 primarily due to higher borrowings in 1999 as a      result of the Company's current year acquisitions and      capital expenditures and due to a higher effective      interest rate in 1999 than in 1998.       As a result of the above, income before taxes increased      $9.0 million, or 27.1%, to a record $42.0 million in 1999      from $33.1 million in 1998.       Income taxes approximated $17.0 million in 1999, based on      a 40.5% effective rate compared with a 40.0% effective      rate in 1998.        Year Ended 1998 Compared to Year Ended 1997       Net sales increased $108.2 million, or 24%, to $557.9      million in 1998 from $449.7 million in 1997.  This      increase primarily resulted from including the net sales      of Solar (acquired March 1, 1998), Appleton (acquired      April 1, 1998), USP (acquired June 1, 1998) and Harbor      (acquired October 1, 1998) (the 1998 acquisitions) from      their respective acquisition dates with the net sales of      the Company's existing operations, and from sales growth      at existing operations.       Cost of sales increased $80.9 million,  or 22%, to $456.4      million in 1998 from $375.5 million in 1997.  Cost of      sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 81.8% in      1998 from 83.5% in 1997.  This improvement was due to the      1998 acquisitions, which have historically generated      higher margins than the Company's existing operations, and      due to lower raw material costs at existing operations.                               14       Selling, general and administrative expenses increased      $15.5 million, or 37%, to $57.0 million in 1998 from $41.6      million in 1997.  Selling, general and administrative      expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 10.2%      in 1998 from 9.2% in 1997.  This increase was primarily      due to higher costs as a percentage of net sales due to      acquisitions and performance based compensation linked to      the Company's sales and profitability.       Interest expense increased by  $6.3 million from 1997 to      1998 primarily due to higher average borrowings during      1998 as a result of current year acquisitions and capital      expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in interest      rates in the fourth quarter of 1998.       As a result of the above, income before taxes increased by      $5.6 million, or 20%, to $33.1 million in 1998 from $27.5      million in 1997.       Income taxes approximated $13.2 million in 1998, based on      a 40.0% effective rate compared with a 40.3% effective      rate in 1997.        Liquidity and Capital Resources       During 1999, the Company's working capital decreased to      $112.9 million due to an increase in accounts payable to      support higher sales levels and an increase in accrued      income taxes.  Long-term debt increased by $35.9 million      to $235.3 million and to 56% of total capitalization at      December 31, 1999.  Additionally, shareholders' equity      increased by 16% to $185.5 million.       The Company's principal capital requirements are to fund      its operations, including working capital requirements,      the purchase and funding of improvements to its property      and equipment, and to fund acquisitions.       The Company's primary sources of liquidity are from cash      provided by operating activities and the Company's      revolving credit facility.  Net cash provided by      operations of $60.7 million resulted primarily from net      income of $25.0 million, depreciation and amortization of      $17.5 million, a decrease in inventory of $6.9 million,      exclusive of acquisitions, and an increase in accounts      payable and accrued expenses of $10.2 million.       During 1999, the Company amended its revolving credit      agreement with its bank group to increase the capacity of      its revolver to $280 million.  Borrowings thereunder are      secured with its accounts receivable, inventories and      property and equipment.  At December 31, 1999, the Company      had interest rate swap agreements outstanding which      effectively converted $75 million of borrowings under the      revolving credit agreement to fixed rates ranging from      6.37% to 7.08% and which terminate at different dates      beginning in November 2000.  The Company accounts for      interest rate swap agreements on an accrual basis.      Additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility      carry interest at LIBOR plus a fixed rate.  The weighted      average interest rate of these borrowings was 7.07% at      December 31, 1999.       Net cash provided by operations of $60.7 million combined      with net proceeds from long-term debt of $26.9 million      were primarily used for the acquisition of Southeastern      Heat Treating, Weather Guard, Hi-Temp, Brazing Concepts      and Hughes, and for capital expenditures.                               15       The Company believes that availability under its credit      facility, together with funds generated from operations,      will be more than sufficient to provide the Company with      the liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund its      anticipated working capital requirements, acquisitions and      capital expenditure commitments for the next twelve      months.       The Company believes that environmental issues will not      require the expenditure of material amounts for      environmental compliance in the future.        Impact of Year 2000       The Year 2000 issue concerns the ability of computer      hardware and software to distinguish between the year      1900 and the year 2000.  An inability to make this      distinction could result in computer application failure.       During 1999, the Company completed a detailed assessment      of all its information technology and non-information      technology hardware and software with regard to the Year      2000 issue, with special emphasis on mission critical      systems.  Information and non-information technology      hardware and software were inventoried and those not Year      2000 ready were identified, remediated (i.e., corrected      or replaced) and tested to ensure that they would, in      fact, operate as desired according to Year 2000      requirements.  The Company expensed approximately      $500,000 during 1999 in connection with remediating its      systems.       As a result of its Year 2000 readiness efforts, the      Company's mission critical information technology and non-      information technology systems successfully distinguished      between the year 1900 and the year 2000 on January 1,      2000, without any mission critical application failure.      However, the Company will continue to monitor its mission      critical computer applications throughout the year 2000      to ensure that any latent Year 2000 matters that may      arise are addressed promptly.        Recent Accounting Pronouncement       In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board      issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.      133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging      Activities (FAS No. 133) which requires recognition of      the fair value of derivatives in the statement of      financial position, with changes in the fair value      recognized either in earnings or as a component of other      comprehensive income dependent upon the hedging nature of      the derivative.  Implementation of FAS No. 133 is      required for fiscal 2001.  FAS No. 133 will not have a      material impact on the Company's earnings or other      comprehensive income.                            Safe Harbor Statement       The Company wishes to take advantage of the Safe Harbor      provisions included in the Private Securities Litigation      Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act").  Statements by the      Company, other than historical information, constitute      "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Act      and may be subject to a number of risk factors.  Factors      that could affect these statements include, but are not      limited to, the following:  the impact of changing steel      prices on the Company's results of operations; changing      demand for the company's products and services; the impact      of the Year 2000 matter; and changes in interest or tax      rates.                                  16                 Company Responsibility For Financial Statements        The accompanying consolidated financial statements of      Gibraltar Steel Corporation have been prepared by      management, which is responsible for their integrity and      objectivity.  The statements have been prepared in      conformity with generally accepted accounting principles      and include amounts based on management's best estimates      and judgments.  Financial information elsewhere in this      Annual Report is consistent with that in the consolidated      financial statements.       The Company has established and maintains a system of      internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance      that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records      reflect the authorized transactions of the Company.       The financial statements have been audited by      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants.  As      part of their audit of the Company's 1999 financial      statements, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP considered the      Company's system of internal control to the extent they      deemed necessary to determine the nature, timing and      extent of their audit tests.       The Board of Directors pursues its responsibility for the      Company's financial reporting through its Audit Committee,      which is composed entirely of outside directors.  The      independent accountants have direct access to the Audit      Committee, with and without the presence of management      representatives, to discuss the results of their audit      work and their comments on the adequacy of internal      accounting controls and the quality of financial      reporting.
