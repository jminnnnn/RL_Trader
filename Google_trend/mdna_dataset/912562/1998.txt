Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition          and Results of Operations  Results of Operations  Year Ended 1997 Compared to Year Ended 1996  Net sales increased by $106.7 million, or 31%, to a record $449.7 million in 1997 from $343.0 million in 1996.  This increase primarily resulted from the inclusion of net sales of SEMCO (acquired January 1997) and sales growth at existing operations.  Cost of sales increased $93.8 million, or 33%, to $375.5 million in 1997 from $281.7 million in 1996.  Cost of sales increased to 83.5% of net sales in 1997 from 82.1% of net sales in 1996.  This increase was due to higher raw material costs which were not fully passed through to customers, partially offset by higher margins on SEMCO sales.  Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $10.9 million, or 36%, to $41.6 million in 1997 from $30.6 million in 1996.  As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 8.9% in 1996 to 9.2% in 1997.  This increase was primarily due to higher costs as a percentage of sales attributable to SEMCO.  Interest expense increased by $1.3 million from 1996 to 1997 primarily due to higher average borrowings as a result of the SEMCO acquisition and capital expenditures.  As a result of the above, income before taxes increased by $.7 million, or 3%, to a record $27.5 million in 1997 from $26.8 million in 1996.  Income taxes approximated $11.1 million in 1997, an effective rate of 40.3% in comparison with 40.4% in 1996.   Year Ended 1996 Compared to Year Ended 1995  Net sales increased by $60.1 million, or 21%, to $343.0 million in 1996 from $282.8 million in 1995.  This increase primarily resulted from including twelve months of net sales of Hubbell Steel (acquired April 1995) for 1996 compared to nine months in 1995, including net sales of CCHT (acquired February 14, 1996) and sales growth at existing operations.  Cost of sales increased by $41.3 million, or 17%, to $281.7 million in 1996 from $240.3 million in 1995.  As a percentage of net sales, cost of sales decreased to 82% of net sales from 85%.  This decrease was primarily due to higher margins attributable to CCHT sales and lower raw material costs at other operations.  Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $8.5 million, or 39%, to $30.6  million in 1996 from $22.1 million in 1995.  As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expense increased to 8.9% from 7.8% in 1995 primarily due to higher costs as a percentage of sales attributable to CCHT and performance based compensation linked to the Company's sales and profitability.                       -13-  Interest expense decreased by $.2 million primarily due to lower interest rates in 1996 compared to 1995 which were partially offset by higher average borrowings resulting from higher inventory levels to service increased sales and capital expenditures.  As a result of the above, income before taxes increased by $10.4 million, or 64%, to $26.8 million in 1996 from $16.4 million in 1995.  Income taxes approximated $10.8 million in 1996, an effective rate of 40.4% in comparison with 40.7% for 1995.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   During 1997, the Company increased working capital by $19 million to $87.6 million and the current ratio improved to 3.0 to 1 versus 2.7 to 1 at December 31, 1996.  Long term debt increased by $33.2 million to $81.8 million and to 37% of total capitalization.  Additionally, shareholders' equity increased by 15% to $140 million at December 31, 1997.  The Company's principal capital requirements are to fund its operations including working capital requirements, the purchase and funding of improvements to its facilities, machinery and equipment and to fund acquisitions.  Net cash provided by operations of $24.4 million resulted primarily from net income of $16.4 million, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and provision for deferred income taxes of $2.2 million offset by the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $2.6 million.  Net cash provided by operations of $24.4 million combined with net proceeds from long-term debt of $18.5 million and $3.1 million of cash on hand were used for the acquisition of SEMCO and capital expenditures.  The most significant capital expenditure included the construction and installation of a new cold rolling mill at the Cleveland, Ohio facility.  During 1997, the Company amended its revolving credit agreement with its bank group to increase the capacity of the revolver to $185 million and borrow on an unsecured basis.  At December 31, 1997, $107.6 million of the revolver was unused.  The Company believes that availability under its credit facility, together with funds generated from operations, will be more than sufficient to provide the Company with the liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund its anticipated working capital requirements, acquisitions and capital expenditure commitments for the next twelve months.  The Company believes that environmental issues will not require the expenditure of material amounts for environmental compliance in the future.
