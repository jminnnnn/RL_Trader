ITEM 7  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Forward Looking Statements          Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, including managements discussion of the Companys 2004 fiscal year in comparison to fiscal 2003 contains forward-looking statements regarding current expectations, risks and uncertainties for fiscal 2005 and beyond. The actual results could differ materially from those discussed here. As well as those factors discussed in the section entitled Business in this Report, other factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, among other items, the general economic and business conditions affecting the Contract Manufacturing, specialty printing services, imaging paper products, significant changes in the cost of base paper stock, competition in the Companys product areas, or an inability of management to successfully reduce operating expenses in relation to net sales without damaging the long-term direction of the Company. Therefore, the selected financial data for the periods presented may not be indicative of the Companys future financial condition or results of operations.   General          Tufco is a leader in providing diversified contract wet and dry wipes converting and printing, as well as specialty printing services and business imaging products. The Companys business strategy is to continue to place our wipes converting at the leading edge of existing and emerging wipes growth opportunities. The Company works closely with its Contract Manufacturing clients to develop products or perform services, which meet or exceed the customers quality standards, and then uses the Companys operating efficiencies and technical expertise to supplement or replace its customers own production and distribution functions.        The Companys technical proficiencies include wide web flexographic printing, wet and dry wipe converting, hot melt adhesive lamination, folding and integrated downstream packaging.   Results of Operations          The following discussion relates to the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 (current year or fiscal 2004), in comparison to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 (prior year or fiscal 2003), as well as the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 (fiscal 2002).   9        Results of Operations (continued)

$22.6 million due primarily to a $23.7 million (79%) increase in the Contract Manufacturing segment offset by a $1.1 million (4.3%) decrease in the Business Imaging paper products segment. The increase in Contract Manufacturing related primarily to the start-up of new contracts in the wet and dry converting markets. Several new production lines were brought on line during the year as well as the wet wipe folding line, which was utilized in production for the entire year. The Contract Manufacturing segment purchases materials for some of its customers and in other situations has materials supplied by customers. In 2004, purchases of materials increased $20.8 million, which increase was passed through to customers, generating additional sales revenue.        The Business Imaging segment sales decrease resulted from the loss of several large retail customers and declining sales to several of its Hamco brand distributorships. Sales of wide format and data processing products also declined during the year. This segment continues to experience strong competition from numerous suppliers in point of sale and wide format goods creating negative impacts on sales volume.         Gross profit  decreased $0.1 million (0.7%) and gross profit percentage decreased to 9.9% from 14.0% in 2003. The margin in the Contract Manufacturing segment decreased to 9% in 2004 compared to 17% in 2003 on a gross profit increase of $0.1 million. The Contract Manufacturing segment purchases materials for some of its customers and in other situations has materials supplied by customers. In 2004, purchases of materials increased $20.8 million, which increase was passed through to customers, generating additional sales revenue. These additional material purchases were the major factor in the margin percentage decline of 8%. The gross profit increase in Contract Manufacturing was primarily due to the increase in net sales offset by higher costs associated with the start-up of new projects. The Business Imaging segment experienced a decrease of $0.4 million in gross profit and a slight decrease in margin to 10.7% from 11% in 2003. This decrease is primarily related to increased raw material costs and increasing price competition from numerous suppliers in the segments major product lines.         Selling, general and administrative expenses  increased $0.1 million in 2004 from 2003. Reductions in salaries and benefits of $378,000, resulting primarily from the move of Corporate Services from Dallas, TX to Green Bay, WI, and depreciation of $327,000 were offset by increases in legal and audit fees of $159,000, bad debt expense of $294,000 and selling expenses of $212,000.         Amortization of goodwill  was not recorded for fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002 as the result of implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in which the Company no longer records goodwill amortization expense.         Severance expense  of $0.3 million in 2003 relates primarily to severance paid to employees at the Dallas corporate services and IT location. Those services were moved to Green Bay during 2003. There was no severance expense for 2004.         Loss (gain) on asset sales  was not material in 2004 and was a loss of $0.1 million in 2003 due to the Company selling various pieces of equipment which were no longer used in the manufacturing process at amounts less than book value. In 2004, the Company reached an agreement to sell its LA-2 thermal laminating asset, with an expected gain of $0.4 million. The sale was completed in November.         Interest expense  decreased $0.2 million in fiscal 2004 as a result of lower average debt outstanding. Effective with the sale of the Paint Sundries segment, during the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company repaid approximately $5.4 million of outstanding debt on which interest was being paid.         Income taxes  increased $0.2 million as a result of increased profits. The effective tax rate was 41% in 2004 compared to 42% in 2003. The decreased rate results from the mix of tax rates from the various state jurisdictions in which the Company operates.   11        Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2004 Compared to September 30, 2003 (Continued)           Loss from operations of discontinued segment  net of tax was zero for 2004 and $0.2 million for 2003. During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company sold the Paint Sundries segment. The loss from discontinued operations reflects the short period results for fiscal 2003.         Gain (loss) from sale of discontinued operations  net of tax was a gain of $0.4 million in 2004 and a loss of $0.2 million in 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company changed its estimate of income taxes payable in relationship to its sale of the Paint Sundries segment in 2003. That change was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 when the tax return was filed. In 2003, the Company recorded a $0.4 million loss ($0.2 million after tax) on the sale of the Paint Sundries segment, which included a $0.1 million gain on the sale of assets offset by $0.5 million of fees and expenses associated with the sale.         Basic and diluted net earnings per share  were $0.43 for 2004 compared to $0.17 for 2003.   Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2003 Compared to September 30, 2002           Net sales  for fiscal 2003 increased $4.8 million due primarily to a $2.2 million (7.9%) increase in the Contract Manufacturing segment and a $2.1 million (9.1%) increase in the Business Imaging paper products segment. The increase in Contract Manufacturing related primarily to increases in printing as the new flexographic press started commercial production midway through the year and also increases in contract manufacturing from new contracts brought on line during the year as the wet wipe folding line began commercial production during the third quarter. The Contract Manufacturing segment purchases materials for some of its customers and in other situations has materials supplied by customers. In 2003, purchases of materials increased $1.5 million and this was passed through to customers, generating additional sales revenue.        The Business Imaging segment sales increase resulted primarily from an increase in point of sale rolls to a major discount retail customer and through its network of distributors. This segment continues to experience strong competition from numerous suppliers creating negative impacts on sales volume in the engineering and data processing products manufactured in this segment. The segment manufactured and sold engineering paper from its Newton facility, following the close of its Dallas operation at the end of fiscal year 2002.         Gross profit  increased $1.3 million (20.0%) and gross profit percentage increased to 14.0% from 12.8% in 2002. The gross profit percentage in the Contract Manufacturing segment remained at 17% compared to 2002 on a gross profit increase of $0.3 million. The Business Imaging segment increased gross profit by $1.1 million and increased gross profit percentage to 11% from 8% in 2002. This increase is primarily related to reduced overhead following the closure of the Dallas, Texas manufacturing operations at the end of fiscal 2002 and moving that production to the Newton facility.         Selling, general and administrative expenses  increased $0.9 million in 2003 compared to 2002. This increase was primarily due to increases in legal and other fees, costs relating to the relocation of corporate services and IT from Dallas, Texas to Green Bay, Wisconsin (exclusive of severance costs), increases in the number of sales personnel, sales and administrative bonuses paid in 2003 which were not paid for in 2002 and increased health care costs.         Amortization of goodwill  was not recorded for fiscal 2003 or 2002 as the result of implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in which the Company no longer records goodwill amortization expense.         Facility restructuring costs  of $0.2 million for fiscal 2002 was recorded following the Companys decision to exit the contract sheeting market in March 2002. These costs are mostly related to building lease abandonment. There were no facility restructuring costs in 2003.         Facility closing expense  of $0.4 million for fiscal 2002 was recorded as a result of a strategic decision to close the Dallas, Texas manufacturing and distribution facility in September 2002 to control costs in order to remain competitive with the Companys engineering paper products by moving the decreased production to its Newton, North Carolina facility. Certain assets used to produce Paint Sundries products were moved to the   12        Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2003 Compared to September 30, 2002 (Continued)     Companys Manning, South Carolina facility. This expense mostly includes costs to move equipment and inventory, employee severances, building and equipment lease abandonment. There was no facility closing expense for 2003.         Severance expense  of $0.3 million in 2003 relates primarily to severance paid to employees at the Dallas corporate services and IT location. Those services were moved to Green Bay during 2003. Severance expense of $0.2 million for 2002 relates primarily to payments made by the Company to a former executive pursuant to an employee agreement with such former executive.         Asset write-downs  of $0.5 million in 2002 includes $0.2 million for an adjustment related to misappropriation of inventory by former employees of a supplier in Mexico to which the Paint Sundries segment outsourced production. Property write-downs of $0.3 million are related to the restructuring and eventual closing of the Dallas, Texas facility mentioned and includes adjustments to leasehold improvements and production equipment. There were no asset write-downs for 2003.         Loss (gain) on asset sales  was a loss of $0.1 million in 2003 due to the Company selling various pieces of equipment, which were no longer used in the manufacturing process, at amounts less than book value.         Interest expense  decreased $0.3 million to $0.2 million in fiscal 2003 due to decreased borrowings. Effective with the sale of the Paint Sundries segment sale, the Company repaid approximately $5.4 million of outstanding debt on which interest was being paid.         Income taxes  increased $0.6 million as a result of increased profits. The effective tax rate was 42% in 2003 compared to 44% in 2002. The decreased rate results from the impact of certain non-deductible expenses, as well as the mix of tax rates from the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates.         Loss from discontinued operations,  net of tax was $0.2 for 2003 and $1.1 million for 2002. During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company sold the Paint Sundries segment. The loss from discontinued operations reflects the short period results for fiscal 2003.         Basic and diluted net earnings per share  were $0.17 for 2003 compared to a net loss of $1.17 for 2002.

This information is derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company and includes, in the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments that management considers necessary for a fair statement of results for such periods. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period.   13        Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Continued)     Fiscal 2004  (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)                                                                                                          First         Second         Third         Fourth                Quarter         Quarter         Quarter         Quarter         Net sales         $    13,046              $    20,199              $    20,262              $    24,348            Gross profit              1,574                   1,866                   1,798                   2,452            Operating expenses              1,122                   1,297                   1,209                   1,373            Operating income               452                   569                   589                   1,079            Income before income taxes               437                   563                   566                   1,072            Income tax expense              184                   241                   243                   407            Income from continuing operations              252                   322                   323                   665            Gain from discontinued operations                                                                       400            Net income               252                   322                   323                   1,065            Income from continuing operations per share:                                                                                       Basic              0.05                   0.07                   0.07                   0.15            Diluted              0.05                   0.07                   0.07                   0.14            Net income per share:                                                                                       Basic              0.05                   0.07                   0.07                   0.24            Diluted              0.05                   0.07                   0.07                   0.23               Fiscal 2003  (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)(1)                                                                                                          First         Second         Third         Fourth                Quarter         Quarter         Quarter         Quarter         Net sales         $    12,529              $    12,794              $    14,272              $    15,612            Gross profit              1,489                   1,552                   2,353                   2,348            Operating expenses              1,078                   1,249                   1,581                   1,419            Operating income               411                   303                   772                   929            Income from continuing operations before income taxes              317                   227                   737                   883            Income tax expense              134                   91                   309                   382            Income from continuing operations               183                   136                   428                   501            Loss from discontinued operations              (16    )              (391    )              (58    )              (4    )       Net income (loss)               167                   (255    )              370                   497            Income from continuing operations per share:                                                                                       Basic               0.04                   0.03                   0.09                   0.11            Diluted               0.04                   0.03                   0.09                   0.11            Net income (loss) per share:                                                                                       Basic              0.04                   (0.06    )              0.08                   0.11            Diluted              0.04                   (0.06    )              0.08                   0.11                    In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, sales increased $8.7 million or 56% as compared to fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The Contract Manufacturing segment sales were up $9.9 million or 121% in fourth quarter fiscal 2004 when compared to the same period last year as a result of increased product demand from a major customer for which the Company manufactures and packages a variety of consumer products. This increase in Contract Manufacturing in 2004 relates primarily to the start-up of new contracts in the wet and dry converting markets. Several new production lines were brought on line during the year as well as the wet wipe folding line and the second press, both of which were utilized in production for the entire year. The Contract Manufacturing segment purchases materials for some of its customers and in other situations has materials supplied by customers. For fourth quarter fiscal 2004, Business Imaging segment sales were down $1.3 million (18%) compared to the same quarter of fiscal year 2003 due to the loss of several large retail customers, declining sales to several Hamco brand distributorships and lower sales of wide format rolls. For the fourth quarter of 2003, results included $0.2 million for severance costs, primarily relating to the transfer of corporate services and IT services, from Dallas, Texas. During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company sold the assets and business of its Paint Sundries segment (See note 1 below) and incurred a loss of $0.2 million (net of tax) from that sale.   14        Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Continued)          (1) Reflects the sale of the Paint Sundries segment on March 31, 2003, effective for financial purposes as of February 28, 2003. See Footnote 14  Discontinued Operations to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements attached as an Appendix to this Report.   Liquidity and Capital Resources          Cash flow used in or provided by continuing operations was ($0.7) million for fiscal 2004, ($0.5) million in 2003 and $6.6 million in 2002. Accounts Receivable increased $4.3 million in 2004 resulting from increased revenues compared to 2003. Accounts Payable increased $4.1 million in 2004, compared to 2003, primarily due to materials purchased for new customer projects. This increase reflects a trend of more customers requesting that the Company purchase materials rather than supplying them.        Cash used in investing activities was $4.3 million in 2004 as the Company completed its $3.6 million capital equipment expansion program announced by the Company on December 4, 2003. In addition, Contract Manufacturing spent approximately $0.4 million on capital expenditures for various equipment upgrades. In Business Imaging, the amount spent on capital expenditures was $0.3 million. Cash used in investing activities for 2003 was $2.2 million as the Company completed the purchase and start-up of its wet wipes converting line.        Cash provided by financing activities was $1.7 million in 2004 as a result of the Company borrowing from its revolving credit line to fund a portion of its increased working capital needs. Cash used in financing activities was $5.5 million in 2003 resulting primarily from repayments of outstanding indebtedness. In 2003, the Company repaid all of its outstanding term loan debt and cancelled that portion of its credit facility. In March 2003, the Companys Board of Directors approved the purchase by the Company of up to 100,000 of its shares of common stock after concluding that the cash and debt position would enable these purchases without impairment to the Companys capital. The purchase plan began in April 2003, and expired in January, 2004. During that period, the Company purchased 45,500 shares of its common stock on the open market for an aggregate of $0.3 million pursuant to the purchase plan.        The Companys primary need for capital resources is to finance inventories, accounts receivable, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. At September 30, 2004, cash recorded on the balance sheet was $7,692.        The Contract Manufacturing segments sales are made pursuant to project-specific purchase orders as well as contract service agreements with terms of 12 months to three years. Sales under such contract service agreements are typically derived from customer directed purchase orders based on unit volume projections supplied by the customers and demand generated by the customers consumer bases. During fiscal 2003, the Company was informed by a customer, which accounted for more than 33% of consolidated sales during fiscal 2003, that at the end of the contract term (December 31, 2003), the customer had decided to stop ordering certain products from the Company and would manufacture those products at its own facility. Those products accounted for approximately 20% of fiscal 2003 revenues. Subsequently, the Company announced it had signed significant contracts with new and existing customers for both printing and contract manufacturing which have more than replaced the lost contracts as evident in year-to-date performance. One of these customers, a large consumer products company, accounted for 41% of total sales in fiscal 2004, which more than offset the loss of the contract described above. However, because the Companys contract revenue agreements described above generally do not have minimum purchase requirements, there can be no assurances that the revenues attributable to the new contracts will be without normal business fluctuations.        To satisfy the manufacturing requirements of the new contracts discussed above, the Company undertook a capital equipment expansion program aggregating approximately $3.6 million for fiscal 2004. Included in that expansion program was doubling the capacity for wet wipes production, a new flat pack folder, and a rebuild of an existing quarter folder. The Company funded such amounts by cash generated from the sale of the Paint Sundries segment, cash from operations and bank borrowings.   15        Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)          On March 31, 2003, the Company sold its Paint Sundries segment for approximately $12.2 million in cash to Trimaco, LLC and its affiliate. The sale included all Paint Sundries segment assets, including the stock of Foremost, Inc. and the Companys Manning, South Carolina facility. The effective date for the closing of the sale of the Paint Sundries segment for financial purposes was February 28, 2003, with the purchasers being entitled to the revenues attributable to the Paint Sundries segment from and after February 28, 2003, and being obligated to reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred and liabilities satisfied by the Company in connection with the operation of the Paint Sundries segment from and after February 28, 2003. The net proceeds from this sale were used to repay outstanding indebtedness consisting of term and revolving loans in the aggregate of $7.9 million outstanding under the Companys Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of August 15, 2002, with JP Morgan Chase Bank (the Prior Credit Facility), and for general corporate purposes.        On June 1, 2004, the Prior Credit Facility expired. In May 2004, the Company replaced this credit facility with a new unsecured, $10 million facility comprised of three bank lenders (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility expires in May, 2007.        As of September 30, 2004, the Company had approximately $7.5 million available under its revolving credit line under the Credit Facility. According to the terms of its Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain certain financial and operational covenants. As of September 30, 2004, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants under the Credit Facility. On December 15, 2004, the Company had approximately $9.25 million available under its revolving credit line.        Management believes its operating cash flow, together with amounts available under its Credit Facility, are adequate to service the Companys long-term obligations as of September 30, 2004 and any budgeted capital expenditures.        On May 6, 2004, the Company redeemed $0.75 million of outstanding Industrial Development Revenue Bonds with the Village of Ashwaubenon. These bonds paid variable rates of interest, which was 1.35% at September 2003.        During fiscal 2003, the Company entered into a lease to own and operate an eight color flexographic printing press. The lease is structured as an operating lease over 7 years with payments totaling approximately $0.5 million annually. The Company has the right to purchase the asset at varying points during the lease.        The Company intends to retain earnings to finance future operations and expansion and does not expect to pay any dividends within the foreseeable future. In addition, pursuant to the Credit Facility, the Companys primary lenders must approve the payment of any dividends over $2.0 million.        Sharp increases or decreases in the costs of key commodities, such as paper or polyethylene, could periodically impact the Companys inventory values and net income. In fiscal years 2004 and 2003, the impact of inflation was minimal on the Companys inventory and net income. Management believes that the Company is generally successful in eventually passing these fluctuations in raw material prices to its customers through increases or decreases in the selling price of the Companys products, although the timing of selling price increases may lag behind cost increases. Prior to these periods, the impact of inflation has been minimal on the Companys inventory and net income.   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements          The Company has no Off Balance Sheet Arrangements (as defined in Item 303 (a)(4) of Regulation S-K).   16        Contractual Obligation Data     The following table sets forth obligations and commitments to make future payments of debt, operating lease agreements, and future payments under purchase contracts:                                                                                                                             Payments Due By Period                                    Less                                                 More                                    Than 1         2-3         4-5         Than                Total         Year         Years         Years         5 Years         Long Term Debt (1)              2,500,000                                      2,500,000                                                  Capital Lease Obligations and Other Long Term Liabilities                                                                                                      Operating Leases              6,166,276                   1,276,127                   2,361,027                   1,993,515                   535,607            Unconditional Purchase Obligations (2)                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Total Contractual Cash Obligations              8,666,276                   1,276,127                   4,861,027                   1,993,915                   535,607                                                                                                                                   (1)         Based on the rates and the current amount of debt outstanding at September 30, 2004, cash payments for interest on long-term debt would be approximately $102,150 for 2005 and 2006 and $68,100 for 2007.           (2)         The Company had no unconditional purchase obligations at September 30, 2004.        Critical Accounting Policies          Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies, practices and estimates as described below. We believe the reported financial disclosures are reliable and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations for the Company.        Financial statement preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. Actual amounts could differ from the amounts estimated. Differences from those estimates are recognized in the period they become known.        Revenue Recognition- The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and there is evidence of an agreement and collectibility of consideration to be received is reasonably assured, all of which generally occur at the time of shipment. Sales are recorded net of sales returns and allowances. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as revenue and costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales. Amounts related to raw materials provided by customers are excluded from revenue and cost of sales.        Accounts Receivable- Management estimates allowances for collectibility related to its accounts receivable balances. These allowances are based on the customer relationships, the aging and turns of accounts receivable, credit worthiness of customers, credit concentrations and payment history. Although management monitors collections and credit worthiness, the inability of a particular customer to pay its debts could impact collectibility of receivables and could have an impact on future revenues if the customer is unable to arrange other financing. Management does not believe these conditions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the collectibility of its receivables or future revenues.   17        Critical Accounting Policies (Continued)          Management estimates sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits, and applies these trend rates to the most recent 12 months sales data to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. Management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age, applying historical trend rates to the most recent 12 months sales, less actual write-offs to date. Managements estimates include providing for 100 percent of specific customer balances when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectible. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions.        Inventories- Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation. The Company estimates reserves for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization. A large portion of the Companys inventory is saleable to multiple customers and a portion of the inventory is manufactured to specifications provided by original equipment manufacturers and is not subject to rapid technological change.        Management does not believe changes are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the valuation of its inventories.        Goodwill- Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. In order to calculate goodwill, management applies judgment in determining the reporting units, which represent distinct parts of the business. The annual goodwill impairment analysis involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying amount. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment loss. Calculating the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant estimates and long-term assumptions. Any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects, or any changes in market conditions, interest rates or other externalities, could result in an impairment charge.        Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Prior to October 1, 2001, the Company amortized goodwill on a straight-line basis over 25 to 40 years. Management has continued to review the carrying values of goodwill for recoverability based on fair market value estimated using estimated future cash flows and prices of comparable companies.        In accordance with SFAS 144,  Accounting for the Impairment for Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,  we evaluate the recoverability of the recorded amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value using discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques.        Additional information on the Companys accounting policies is set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report as referenced to the Appendix to this Report.   Recently Issued Accounting Standards          In December, 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation- Transition and Disclosure . SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,  and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require disclosures in interim financial statements of the effects of stock-based compensation. The interim disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 are effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The Companys stock-based compensation related to employees and non-employee directors is recognized using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , and thus there is no compensation expense for options granted with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the Companys common stock on the date of the grant.   18         ITEM 7A  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK           Interest Rate Risk - In August 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract as a cash flow hedge under which the interest rate on its term debt under the then-existing credit facility was fixed at 5.87%, plus a profit spread for the lender. Prior to entering into the swap agreement, management had reviewed the 40-year history of interest rates and had determined that the Companys risk of liability resulting from a material decline in interest rates over the life of the swap below the fixed level under the swap was not significant. In May 2003, the Company paid $26,000 to cancel the swap, as there was no longer any outstanding term debt.   Because of the level of variable interest rate debt in the Companys capital structure, the Company is exposed to earnings or cash flow fluctuations due to changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2004, the Company had $2.5 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 4.09%. This debt exposes the Company to changes in interest expense brought about by changes in interest rates. If the weighted average interest rate were to increase by 10.0% for fiscal 2004, net income would have decreased by approximately $0.4 million.         Foreign Currency Exchange Risk -The Company had no transactions in foreign currencies, nor had it entered into any foreign currency futures contracts as of September 30, 2004.         Commodity Price Risk -The Company had not entered into any forward buying agreements for the raw materials it uses to produce its goods and services as of September 30, 2004. An assessment of the risks of short-term commodity price fluctuations is set forth in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the caption Raw Materials and Suppliers.         Other Relevant Market Risks- The Company does not own any marketable securities, and management is not aware of any other relevant market risks.
