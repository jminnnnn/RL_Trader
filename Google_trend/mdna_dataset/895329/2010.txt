ITEM 7   MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Forward Looking Statements          Managements discussion of the Companys fiscal 2010 results in comparison to fiscal 2009 contains forward-looking statements regarding current expectations, risks and uncertainties for future periods. The actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein due to a variety of factors such as its ability to increase sales, changes in customer demand for its products, cancellation of production agreements by significant customers including two Contract Manufacturing customers it depends upon for a significant portion of its business, its ability to meet competitors prices on products to be sold under these production agreements, the effects of the economy in general, including the current economic downturn, the Companys ability to refinance or replace its line of credit, which expires January 31, 2012, the Companys inability to benefit from any general economic improvements, material increases in the cost of raw materials, competition in the Companys product areas, the ability of management to successfully reduce operating expenses including labor and waste costs in relation to net sales, the Companys ability to increase sales and earnings as a result of new projects, including its canister line introduced in fiscal 2009, the Companys ability to successfully install new equipment on a timely basis, the Companys ability to continue to produce new products, the Companys ability to return to profitability and then continue to improve profitability, the Companys ability to successfully attract new customers through its sales initiatives and strengthening its new business development efforts and the Companys ability to improve the run rates for its products. Therefore, the financial data for the periods presented may not be indicative of the Companys future financial condition or results of operations.

Results of Operations          The following discussion relates to the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 (current year or fiscal 2010) in comparison to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 (prior year or fiscal 2009).   8                 The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years ended September 30, (i) the percentage relationship of certain items from the Companys statements of operations to net sales, and (ii) the year-to-year changes in these items:                                                                                     Percentage of              Year-to-Year                Net Sales              Percentage Change                2010              2009              2010 to 2009         Net sales              100.0    %              100.0    %              4    %      Cost of sales              94.6                   95.6                   3                                                                    Gross profit              5.4                   4.4                   30                                                                              Selling, general and administrative expenses              6.0                   5.9                   6                                                                                                                                       Operating loss              (0.6    )              (1.5    )              (61    )      Interest expense              (0.2    )              (0.1    )              50           Interest income and other income              (0.0    )              0.0                   NM                                                                     Loss before income taxes              (0.8    )              (1.6    )              (53    )      Income tax benefit              (0.3    )              (0.6    )              (55    )                                                                                                                                  Net (loss)              (0.5    %)              (1.0    %)              (51    %)                                                                 NM = Not Meaningful         The components of net sales and gross profit are summarized in the table below (Dollars in millions):                                                                                                         2010              2009                                         % of                                  % of                     Amount              Total              Amount              Total              Net Sales                                                                                      Contract Manufacturing and printing         $    66.2                   73    %         $    63.9                   74    %      Business Imaging paper products              24.4                   27                   22.9                   26                                                                              Net Sales         $    90.6                   100    %         $    86.8                   100    %                                                                                                                                                                                                     Margin                                  Margin                     Amount              %              Amount              %              Gross Profit                                                                                      Contract Manufacturing and printing         $    2.9                   4    %         $    2.4                   4    %      Business Imaging paper products              2.0                   8    %              1.4                   6    %                                                                         Gross profit         $    4.9                   5    %         $    3.8                   4    %                                                                           9             Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to September 30, 2009           Net Sales  for fiscal 2010 increased $3.8 million (4%) from net sales for fiscal 2009, due to a $2.3 million (4%) increase in the Contract Manufacturing segment and a $1.5 million (7%) increase in the Business Imaging paper products segment. In Contract Manufacturing, the increase in revenues for fiscal 2010 related primarily to the Companys success in its efforts to expand its customer base. The Business Imaging segment sales increase was primarily due to increased sales to several of the segments Hamco brand distributors as well as several of its large retail accounts. The overall economic slowdown had a negative impact on the improvement for both segments.        The Company depends on two Contract Manufacturing customers for a significant portion of its business. One customer accounted for 30% of the Companys total sales in fiscal 2010, compared to 35% in fiscal 2009. The second customer accounted for 20% of the Companys total sales in fiscal 2010, compared to 25% in fiscal 2009.         Gross profit  for fiscal 2010 increased $1.1 million (30%) and gross profit margin increased to 5% compared to 4% in fiscal 2009. The gross profit margin for fiscal 2010 in the Contract Manufacturing segment remained unchanged at 4% compared to fiscal 2009 on a gross profit increase of $0.5 million (22%). The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the above mentioned sales increase in addition to a decrease in overhead costs. The Business Imaging segment experienced an increase of $0.6 million (42%) in gross profit and an increase in gross profit margin to 8% in fiscal 2010 from 6% in fiscal 2009. This increase was largely due to increased sales volume and increased utilization of assets. The overall economic slowdown had a negative impact on the improvement for both segments.         Selling, general and administrative expenses  increased $288,000 (6%) in fiscal 2010 when compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of additional sales personnel and marketing initiatives.         Interest expense  increased $56,000 (50%) in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due to higher average debt outstanding as a result of the Company borrowing under its revolving credit line to fund a portion of its increased working capital and equipment needs.         Income tax benefit  was ($0.2) million in fiscal 2010 compared to $(0.5) million in fiscal 2009. The income tax benefit represents a net operating loss carryforward that the Company expects to realize in the future.         Basic and diluted net loss per share  was $(0.10) for fiscal 2010 compared to $(0.20) for fiscal 2009.   Selected Quarterly Financial Data          Not required for a smaller reporting company.   10            Liquidity and Capital Resources          Cash flows (used in) provided by operations were $(1.0) million for fiscal 2010, and $4.4 million in fiscal 2009. Inventories increased $3.7 million (35%) in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of new customer inventories, a build up of appropriate safety stock levels for printing sales that moved into commercial production at the start of the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and purchases in advance of anticipated significant raw material price increases. Accounts receivable increased $3.1 million (28%) in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of increased revenues. Accounts payable increased $3.1 million (45%) in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, largely due to an increase in materials purchased. Depreciation was $2.7 million for fiscal 2010 and $2.4 million for fiscal 2009. The Companys working capital position for the years ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 was $13.4 and $13.8 million, respectively, as a result of the change in components discussed above.        Cash used in investing activities was $2.1 million in fiscal 2010. Contract Manufacturing spent approximately $2.0 million on capital expenditures during fiscal 2010, related to capital expenditures to support ongoing operational needs and the purchase of a W&H 8-color press for $0.8 million, which had previously been accounted for as an operating lease. In the Business Imaging segment, the amount spent on capital expenditures during fiscal 2010 was $86,000.        In June, 2010, the Company entered into a long-term note for the purchase of a second W&H 8-color press for $1.3 million, previously accounted for as an operating lease, which is being shown as a supplemental non-cash acquisition in the statement of cash flows. The note which has a five-year term, bears interest at a rate of 5.75% per annum with payments, including principal and interest, of approximately $26,000 per month. The note is collateralized by the press.        Cash provided by financing activities was $3.1 million in fiscal 2010, related to the Company borrowing from its revolving credit line to fund a portion of its increased working capital and equipment needs. Cash used in financing activities was $2.3 million in fiscal 2009, resulting primarily from the Company paying down its revolving credit line. On January 22, 2009, the Companys Board of Directors approved a further extension of its February 2008 stock repurchase program through September 30, 2009 and an increase in the number of shares from 200,000 to 300,000. A total of 226,697 shares were purchased under the plan for an aggregate purchase price of $1,016,000 from the commencement of the plan through September 30, 2009. There was no stock repurchase program in fiscal year 2010.        The Companys primary need for capital resources is to finance inventories, accounts receivable, and capital expenditures. At September 30, 2010, cash recorded on the balance sheet was $7,899.        The Contract Manufacturing segments sales are made pursuant to project-specific purchase orders as well as contract service agreements with multi-year terms. Sales under such contract service agreements are typically derived from customer directed purchase orders based on unit volume projections supplied by the customers and demand generated by the customers consumer bases. The Company has contracts for both printing and Contract Manufacturing. One of these contract customers, a multinational consumer products company, accounted for approximately 35% of total sales in fiscal 2009 and 30% of total sales in fiscal 2010. The current contract with this customer expires in April 2012. Another multinational consumer products company accounted for approximately 25% of total sales in fiscal 2009 and 20% of total sales in fiscal 2010. The current contract with this customer has been extended until June 2013. However, because the Companys contract revenue agreements described above generally do not have minimum purchase requirements, the revenues attributable to the contracts are subject to normal business fluctuations.        The Company replaced its prior credit agreement on March 15, 2010 with a new $8.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit facility with a termination date of January 31, 2011. On December 28, 2010, the Company amended the new credit agreement to, among other things, increase the amount available for borrowing to $10.0 million and extend its termination date to January 31, 2012. The Companys revolving line of credit is classified as a current liability on the accompanying balance sheets because provisions in the credit agreement include deposit account requirements and a material adverse effect covenant which is subjective in nature. It is also the Companys policy to classify borrowings under the revolving line of credit as current based on how it manages working capital. Borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.50%. The Company is required to pay a non-usage fee of .50% per annum on the unused portion of the facility.   11            Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)          Borrowings under the previous $10 million unsecured revolving line of credit facility were made under the Eurodollar account. Interest on amounts borrowed under the Eurodollar account was calculated based on LIBOR plus 2.25%. The Company was required to pay a non-usage fee of .50% per annum on the unused portion of the facility.        The Company had $3.5 million available under the line of credit as of September 30, 2010. Availability under the facility is based upon specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory. The credit agreement contains certain covenants, including requirements to maintain a minimum tangible net worth and after tax net income (or loss within specified levels). At September 30, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the credit agreement. On December 28, 2010, the Company amended its credit agreement to increase the revolving credit availability from $8.0 million to $10.0 million, extended its termination date to January 31, 2012 and modified the required levels of after tax net income (or loss) under its financial covenants for periods commencing December 31, 2010 and thereafter. On December 28, 2010, the Company had approximately $3.3 million available and $6.7 million outstanding under its revolving credit line pursuant to its credit agreement.        Consistent with the sales concentration previously discussed, amounts due from two multinational consumer products customers represent 53% and 49% of total accounts receivable at September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.        Management believes that the Companys operating cash flow, together with amounts available under its credit agreement, are adequate to service the Companys current obligations as of September 30, 2010 and any budgeted capital expenditures, assuming the Company meets its business plan.        The Company intends to retain earnings to finance future operations and expansion and does not expect to pay any dividends within the foreseeable future. In addition, pursuant to the credit agreement, the Companys primary lenders must approve the payment of any dividends over $2.0 million.   Inflation          In fiscal years 2010 and 2009, the impact of inflation was minimal on the Companys inventory and net income. Management believes that the Company is generally successful in eventually passing these fluctuations in raw material prices to its customers through increases or decreases in the selling price of the Companys products, although the timing of selling price increases may lag behind cost increases. Prior to these periods, the impact of inflation has been minimal on the Companys inventory and operations.   Credit Environment          The credit markets continue to be volatile and experience liquidity shortages due to the instability in the lending industry and overall downturn in the economy. The Company does not engage in any business activities in the lending industry. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity under its credit agreement at variable interest rates and from cash provided by operations.   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements          The Company has no Off Balance Sheet Arrangements (as defined in Item 303 (a)(4) of Regulation S-K).   12            Critical Accounting Policies          Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies, practices and estimates as described below. We believe the reported financial disclosures are reliable and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations for the Company.        Financial statement preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. Actual amounts could differ from the amounts estimated. Differences from those estimates are recognized in the period they become known.        Revenue Recognition- The Company only has one type of revenue recognition activity which recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and there is evidence of an agreement and collectability of consideration to be received is reasonably assured, all of which generally occur at the time of shipment. Sales are recorded net of sales returns and allowances. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as revenue and costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales. Amounts related to raw materials provided by customers are excluded from revenue and cost of sales.        Accounts Receivable- Management estimates allowances for collectability related to its accounts receivable balances. These allowances are based on the customer relationships, the aging and turns of accounts receivable, credit worthiness of customers, credit concentrations and payment history. Managements estimates include providing for 100 percent of specific customer balances when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectable. Management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age, applying historical trend rates to the most recent 12 months sales, less actual write-offs to date. Although management monitors collections and credit worthiness, the inability of a particular customer to pay its debts could impact collectability of receivables and could have an impact on future revenues if the customer is unable to arrange other financing. Management does not believe these conditions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the collectability of its receivables or future revenues. Recoveries of accounts receivables previously written off are recorded when received. Credit terms to customers in the Contract Manufacturing segment are generally net 30 days. Credit terms to customers in the Business Imaging segment are generally discounted net 30 terms.        Management estimates sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits, and applies these trend rates to the most recent 12 months sales data to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions.        Inventories- Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation. The Company estimates reserves for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization.        Goodwill- As previously disclosed, the Company tests goodwill annually at the reporting unit level for impairment as of June 30. The operating segments herein also represent the Companys reporting units for goodwill purposes. The Company uses a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate reporting unit fair values and also considers multiples of relevant companies. In determining the fair values of the reporting units, the Company was required to make certain assumptions and cannot predict what future events may occur that could adversely affect the reported value of its goodwill. Management has completed the Companys annual impairment test and determined there were no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reporting unit at June 30, 2010. However, there can be no assurance that valuation multiples will not decline, growth rates will not be lower than expected, discount rates will not increase, or the projected cash flows of the individual reporting units will not decline. The Company prepared the discounted cash flow analysis in the same manner as in prior years. The Company further updated all significant assumptions in light of current market and regulatory conditions. The key assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow analysis were (1) projected cash flows, (2) risk of adjusted discount rates, and (3) expected long term growth rates. Because each of the reporting units has distinct characteristics, the Company developed these assumptions separately. Any variance in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the evaluation of goodwill impairment. These assumptions included the Companys actual operating results,   13            Critical Accounting Policies (Continued)     future business plans, economic projections and market data, as well as estimates by its management regarding future cash flows and operating results. For example, lower than expected growth or an increase to the discount rate due to changes in risk premiums or other factors may suggest that an impairment has occurred under Step 1 and require the Company to proceed to Step 2 to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities of the reporting units. At the annual measurement date of June 30, 2010, the estimated fair value of Contract Manufacturing exceeded its carrying value by approximately 30%. The estimated fair value of Business Imaging exceeded its carrying value by approximately 63% at June 30, 2010. The current discount rate would need to increase 1.7% for Contract Manufacturing and increase 4.5% for Business Imaging before the Company would be required to proceed to Step 2. The Company recognizes that its common stock regularly trades below book value per share and will continue to monitor the relationship of its market capitalization to both its book value and tangible book value. While management plans to return the Companys business fundamentals to levels that support the book value per share, there is no assurance that the plan will be successful, or that the market price of the common stock will increase to such levels in the foreseeable future.         In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360-10 (formerly SFAS No. 144), Accounting for the Impairment for Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Company evaluates the recoverability of the recorded amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell. The Company determines fair value using discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques.        Additional information on the Companys accounting policies is set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report as referenced to the Appendix to this Report.
