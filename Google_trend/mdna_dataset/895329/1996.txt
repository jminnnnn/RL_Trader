ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GENERAL           Tufco manufactures and distributes business imaging paper products, performs custom converting and specialty printing services and manufactures and distributes paint sundry products. The Company's strategy is to work closely with its customers to develop products or perform services which meet or exceed the customers' quality standards, and to then use the Company's operating efficiencies and broad distribution base to supplement or replace its customers' own production and distribution functions.           The Company's technical proficiencies include slitting and rewinding, sheeting, multi-color printing, laminating, folding and packaging.           In January 1994, the Company completed an initial public offering of its stock and concurrently purchased substantially all of the assets of Executive Converting Corporation (ECC). The Company issued 900,000 shares of its common stock on the NASDAQ Market at $9.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $6.8 million. The total cost of the ECC acquisition was $8.7 million consisting of $7.5 million in cash and 127,778 shares of the Companies common stock.           In August 1995, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Hamco Industries, Inc. for a total cost of $14.2 million funded by the issuance of $1.2 million shares of the Company's common stock and additional bank borrowings.           Management's discussion of the Company's 1996 year in comparison to 1995, contains forward looking statements regarding current expectations, risks and uncertainties for 1997 and beyond. The actual results could differ materially from those discussed here. As well as those factors discussed in the section entitled Business in this report, other factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, among other items, significant changes in the cost of base paper stock, competition in the Company's product areas, or an inability of management to successfully reduce operating expenses in relation to net sales without damaging the long-term direction of the Company. Therefore, the selected financial data for the periods presented may not be indicative of the Company's future financial condition or results of operations.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS           The following discussion relates to the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1996 (current year or fiscal 1996), in comparison to the fiscal year ended September 30, 1995 (prior year or fiscal 1995), as well as the fiscal year ended September 30, 1994 (fiscal 1994).                                           -10-    11 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)           The following table sets forth, for the years ended September 30 (i) the percentage relationship of certain items from the Company's statements of income to total revenues and (ii) the year-to-year changes in these items:                                                PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE    YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGE                                            -----------------------------   -------------------                                                                             1995 TO   1994 TO                                             1996       1995       1994       1996       1995                                            -------    -------    -------    -------    -------            Net sales ..............................     100.0%     100.0%     100.0%        42%        33% Cost of sales ..........................      82.0       82.9       82.1         41         34                                            -------    -------    -------    -------    -------           Gross margin ..................      18.0       17.1       17.9         51         26  Selling and administrative expense .....       9.9       10.2       10.5         38         29  Amortization & postacquisition    expenses   ...........................       1.1        0.9        1.3         66         -4                                            -------    -------    -------    -------    -------           Operating income ..............       7.1        5.9        6.2         70         28  Net interest expense ...................       1.6        1.8        1.6         23         54 Other income ...........................       0.0        0.1        0.2        -89        -28                                            -------    -------    -------    -------    -------           Income before income taxes ....       5.5        4.2        4.7         88         17  Income tax expense .....................       2.2        1.7        1.9         87         17                                            -------    -------    -------    -------    -------           Net income ....................       3.3%       2.5%       2.8%        88%        17%                                            =======    =======    =======    =======    =======             The components of net sales are summarized in the table below:                                                      1996           1995           1994                                                      ------------   -------------  -------------                                                       % Of            % Of          % Of                                                Amount Total   Amount  Total  Amount  Total                                                ------------   -------------  -------------                                                         (Dollars In Millions)              Business imaging products ...................   $  34.9  51%   $  18.1  38%   $  11.8  33% Custom converting and specialty printing ....      24.3  36       20.6  43       15.6  43 Paint sundry products .......................       9.2  13        9.3  19        8.8  24                                                 ------- ---    ------- ---    ------- ---  Total net revenue ...........................   $  68.4 100%   $  48.0 100%   $  36.2 100%                                                 ======= ===    ======= ===    ======= ===      FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1996 COMPARED TO SEPTEMBER 30, 1995           Net sales for the fiscal 1996 increased $20.4 million, or 42%, primarily due to the $17.8 million additive impact of Hamco Industries, Inc. Hamco which was acquired on August 23, 1995, produces and distributes business imaging products. After adjustment for the impact of Hamco, the Company's revenue increased 5.4% ($2.6 million) in fiscal 1996. The Company lowered the prices it charges its customers for certain paper products by 7% to 9% during the second, third and fourth quarters of 1996 in response to sharp reductions in the costs of various base paper grades. This reduction in unit price resulted in a reduction in total annual revenue of approximately $0.9 million (1.8%) on comparable unit volumes. Management feels that the adjusted growth rate of 7.2% (considering the above 5.4% and 1.8% factors) is in line with management's expectations for internal growth.                                         -11-    12  FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1996 COMPARED TO SEPTEMBER 30, 1995 (CONTINUED)           Gross margin increased to 18.0% in fiscal 1996 from 17.1% in fiscal 1995, primarily due to a combination of two factors. A decrease in the cost of base paper resulted in an increase in gross margin of 0.2 points due to the portion of the cost decrease which the Company was able to retain. Additionally, approximately 36% of the Company's inventory is valued using the Last In First Out (LIFO) method, and the sharp reduction in paper prices resulted in a reduction in the LIFO reserve and a corresponding increase in gross profit of $0.5 million (0.7 points of margin), of which $0.3 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996. The Company has planned for a nominal increase in paper prices in 1997, but management does not anticipate any significant increase in this chief raw material.           Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 9.9% in fiscal 1996 from 10.2% in fiscal 1995. Selling and administrative expenses increased $1.9 million in fiscal 1996 due to the inclusion of Hamco's selling and administrative expenses. Also, the Company accrued approximately $0.6 million in post employment costs associated with the resignation of its Chief Executive Officer and other management personnel in September 1996. After adjustment for these two factors, selling and administrative costs decreased $0.8 million from comparable operations for the prior fiscal year. The decrease was the result of lower payroll and travel costs in 1996 due to sales and management positions which were either vacant for a portion of the year or eliminated as a result of organizational restructuring.           Goodwill amortization and post-acquisition expenses increased to $0.7 million in fiscal 1996 due to the Hamco acquisition and consulting fees resulting from a consulting agreement between the Company and Bradford Ventures, Ltd. (BVP). In fiscal 1995, a portion of the management fees paid to BVP were capitalized as a result of the Hamco acquisition, such was not the case in 1996 as all fees paid to BVP were expensed.           Net interest expense increased by $0.2 million to $1.1 million in fiscal 1996 from $0.9 million in fiscal 1995. The increase was due to the fact that interest costs were incurred as a result of the Hamco acquisition. The acquisition of Hamco resulted in a net increase in total debt of $5 million at fiscal year end 1995. However, the Company worked with its primary lender to restructure all of its outstanding debt and its cash management in the second quarter of fiscal 1996. The effect of the restructuring was a reduction of one (1) full point in the weighted average interest rate which the Company pays on its debt. Additionally, the restructuring of cash management along with strong cash flow from operations allowed the Company to lower its total borrowings under its working capital line of credit. The combination of these factors allowed the Company to significantly mitigate the impact of the additional long-term debt incurred as a result of the Hamco acquisition and resulted in an increase in interest expense of only 24%in fiscal 1996 versus fiscal 1995.           Income taxes were 40% of pretax earnings for fiscal 1996 and for the previous year. Earnings per share were 51 cents in fiscal 1996 compared to 37 cents for fiscal 1995 and 43 cents for the pro forma fiscal 1995 results (see Note 2 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1995 COMPARED TO SEPTEMBER 30, 1994           Net sales for fiscal 1995, increased $11.8 million, or 33%, to $48.0 million. The increase was primarily due to price increases and growth in sales of business imaging products and custom converting services, which rose $11.3 million to $38.7 million, primarily from the $5.7 million additive effect of four additional months of ECC's sales. The ECC acquisition was completed effective January 28, 1994. Sales of paint sundry products increased $0.5 million to $9.3 million due to expansion of the Company's customer base and a rebound from the harsh winter of 1994.           Gross margin decreased to 17.1% in fiscal 1995 from 17.9% in fiscal 1994. The primary cause for the decrease in margins is the significant increase in the price of base paper stock in 1995 and the principal raw material in approximately 41% of the Company's revenue base. The Company experienced sharp increases in the costs of paper and polyethylene during the first three quarters of fiscal 1995 which increased the Company's inventory values, but had no material effect on 1995 profits as the Company was able to pass these increases on to its customers. Prices on these commodities stabilized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995.                                          -12-    13 FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1995 COMPARED TO SEPTEMBER 30, 1994 (CONTINUED)            Selling and administrative expenses increased $1.1 million in 1995 primarily due to the inclusion of ECC's selling and administrative expenses for four additional months in 1995 versus 1994, when ECC was acquired. Three additional salespersons were added during fiscal 1995 to facilitate market growth during the upcoming fiscal year. Additionally, the Company incurred approximately $200,000 in costs to restructure the Green Bay organization, including severance costs and legal and professional fees.           Goodwill amortization and post-acquisition expenses remained relatively constant at $437,000 in fiscal 1995 versus $454,000 in fiscal 1994. The expenses were due to goodwill amortization arising from the ECC acquisition and consulting fees resulting from a consulting agreement between the Company and Bradford Ventures, Ltd. (BVP). In fiscal 1995, a portion of the management fees paid to BVP were capitalized as a result of the Hamco acquisition, resulting in the decrease in expense from 1994.           Net interest expense increased by $310,000 to $885,000 in fiscal 1995 from $575,000 in fiscal 1994. The increase was largely due to the fact that interest costs were incurred as a result of the ECC acquisition for a full year in 1995. Additionally, the Company increased its average borrowing under its working capital line of credit during 1995 due to the increasing costs of raw materials. The Company refinanced its bank debt in the final quarter of 1995 resulting in decreased interest rates.           Income taxes were  $808,000 or 40% of pretax  earnings,  for fiscal  1995  compared to $690,000,  or 40% of pretax earnings, for the previous year.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           Cash flow from operations increased $4.5 million to $5.7 million in fiscal 1996. Net income adjusted for non-cash items accounted for $4.7 million in cash flow in fiscal 1996. Additionally, $0.6 million in separation costs for the former CEO and other employees expensed in fiscal 1996 will be paid in 1997 and 1998. The Company's increase in accounts receivable and inventory values appears disproportionately small compared to its increase in revenues from 1995 to 1996, primarily because of the Hamco acquisition late in fiscal 1995.           Cash used in investing activities totaled $1.5 million in fiscal 1996 and resulted from capital additions, principally improvements to the Company's Green Bay facility. Also, the Company redeemed $0.8 million in certificates of deposit purchased in the Hamco acquisition. Cash used in financing activities totaled $5.5 million in fiscal 1996 due to the repayment of long term debt.           The Company's primary need for capital resources is to finance inventories, accounts receivable, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. During the second quarter of fiscal 1996, the Company restructured its borrowing arrangement with Bank One, Wisconsin, its primary lender, resulting in a reduction in the Company's weighted average borrowing rate from 7.98% to 6.98% on approximately $13.8 million in debt at the time that the new agreement became effective on February 1, 1996. The maximum available borrowings and the term under the restructured revolving credit agreement remained unchanged at $9.8 million through March 31, 1998. At December 13, 1996, the Company had approximately $11.8 million in total borrowings outstanding with $8.3 million available under the revolving credit agreement. Management believes that the Company's operating cash flow is adequate to service its long-term obligations as of September 30, 1996, and any budgeted capital expenditures.           The Company's credit facilities are with one bank with the exception of $1.8 million and are secured by substantially all of the Company's assets. The credit facilities with Bank One contain certain restrictive covenants, including minimum required cash flow, limits on capital additions and debt service coverage ratios.           On January 28, 1994, the Company sold 900,000 shares of its previously unissued Common Stock in a public offering. The net proceeds to the Company from this offering was approximately $6.8 million. An additional 127,778 shares were issued on January 28, 1994, in conjunction with the Company's acquisition of Executive Converting Corporation. On August 23, 1995, the Company issued 1.2 million shares of its Common Stock in conjunction with the Company's acquisition of Hamco, Inc. for $6.2 million.                                        -13-    14 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (CONTINUED)           Sharp increases in the costs of paper and polyethylene impacted the Company's inventory values and net income during fiscal 1995. In 1996, the prices of these commodities dropped dramatically which again impacted inventories and net income. The Company is generally successful in passing these fluctuations in raw material prices to its customers through increases or decreases in the selling price of the Company's products. Prior to this period, the impact of inflation has been minimal on the Company's inventory and net income.           The Company intends to retain earnings to finance future operations and expansion and does not expect to pay any dividends within the foreseeable future. In addition, the Company's primary lender must approve the payment of any dividends.           The Company's allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $149,000 at December 13, 1996. Management believes that this allowance is adequate to provide for losses inherent in its accounts receivable.

Generally, the Company's sales volume and operating income are at their lowest levels in the first and second fiscal quarters. Sales and operating income are generally at higher levels in the third and especially the fourth fiscal quarters. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996 and 1995, the Company performed custom printing services for customers which market printed paper products with holiday themes. The technical aspects of the printing and the time sensitive nature of the services enable the Company to generate higher gross margins than at other times during the year.
