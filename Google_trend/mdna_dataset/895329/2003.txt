ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS               Forward Looking Statements                  Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, including managements discussion of the Companys 2003 fiscal year in comparison to fiscal 2002 contains forward-looking statements regarding current expectations, risks and uncertainties for fiscal 2004 and beyond. The actual results could differ materially from those discussed here. As well as those factors discussed in the section entitled Business in this Report, other factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, among other items, the general economic and business conditions affecting the contract manufacturing, specialty printing services, imaging paper products, significant changes in the cost of base paper stock, competition in the Companys product areas, or an inability of management to successfully reduce operating expenses in relation to net sales without damaging the long-term direction of the Company. Therefore, the selected financial data for the periods presented may not be indicative of the Companys future financial condition or results of operations.              General                   Tufco performs contract manufacturing and specialty printing services and manufactures and distributes business imaging paper products. The Companys strategy is to provide services and manufacture and distribute products in niche markets, relying on close customer contact and high levels of quality and service. The Company works closely with its contract manufacturing clients to develop products or perform services which meet or exceed the customers quality standards, and then uses the Companys operating efficiencies and technical expertise to supplement or replace its customers own production and distribution functions.                 The Companys technical proficiencies include folding, packaging, coating, slitting and rewinding, sheeting, multi-color flexographic printing and laminating.             Results of Operations                   The following discussion relates to the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 (current year or fiscal 2003), in comparison to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 (prior year or fiscal 2002), as well as the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 (fiscal 2001).  11    Results of Operations (continued)         The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years ended September 30 (i) the percentage relationship of certain items from the Companys statements of operations to net sales and (ii) the year-to-year changes in these items:

                                  12     Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2003 Compared to September 30, 2002          Net sales  for fiscal 2003 increased $4.8 million due primarily to a $2.2 million (7.9%) increase in the Contract Manufacturing segment and a $2.1 million (9.1%) increase in the Business Imaging paper products segment. The increase in Contract Manufacturing related primarily to increases in printing as the new flexographic press started commercial production midway through the year and also increases in contract manufacturing from new contracts brought on line during the year as the wet wipe folding line began commercial production during the third quarter. The Contract Manufacturing segment purchases materials for some of its customers and in other situations has materials supplied by customers. In 2003, purchases of materials increased $1.5 million and this was passed through to customers, generating additional sales revenue.       The Business Imaging segment sales increase resulted primarily from an increase in point of sale rolls to a major discount retail customer and through its network of distributors. This segment continues to experience strong competition from numerous suppliers creating negative impacts on sales volume in the engineering and data processing products manufactured in this segment. The segment manufactured and sold engineering paper from its Newton facility, following the close of its Dallas operation at the end of fiscal year 2002.        Gross profit  increased $1.3 million (20.0%) and gross margin increased to 14.0% from 12.8% in 2002. The margin in the Contract Manufacturing segment remained at 17% compared to 2002 on a gross profit increase of $0.3 million. The Business Imaging segment increased gross profit by $1.1 million and increased margin to 11% from 8% in 2002. This increase is primarily related to reduced overhead following the closure of the Dallas, Texas manufacturing operations at the end of fiscal 2002 and moving that production to the Newton facility.        Selling, general and administrative expenses  increased $0.9 million in 2003 compared to 2002. This increase was primarily due to increases in legal and other fees, costs relating to the relocation of corporate services and IT from Dallas, Texas to Green Bay, Wisconsin (exclusive of severance costs), increases in the number of sales personnel, sales and administrative bonuses paid in 2003 which were not paid for in 2002 and increased health care costs.        Amortization of goodwill  was not recorded for fiscal 2003 or 2002 as the result of implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in which the Company no longer records goodwill amortization expense. See Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change below.        Facility restructuring costs  of $0.2 million for fiscal 2002 was recorded following the Companys decision to exit the contract sheeting market in March 2002. These costs are mostly related to building lease abandonment. There were no facility restructuring costs in 2003.        Facility closing expense  of $0.4 million for fiscal 2002 was recorded as a result of a strategic decision to close the Dallas, Texas manufacturing and distribution facility in September 2002 to control costs in order to remain competitive with the Companys engineering paper products by moving the decreased production to its Newton, North Carolina facility. Certain assets used to produce Paint Sundries products were moved to the Companys Manning, South Carolina facility. This expense mostly includes costs to move equipment and inventory, employee severances, building and equipment lease abandonment. There was no facility closing expense for 2003.        Severance expense  of $0.3 million in 2003 relates primarily to severance paid to employees at the Dallas corporate services and IT location. Those services were moved to Green Bay during 2003. Severance expense of $0.2 million for 2002 relates primarily to payments made by the Company to a former executive pursuant to an employee agreement with such former executive.  13    Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2003 Compared to September 30, 2002-Continued          Asset write-downs  of $0.5 million in 2002 includes $0.2 million for an adjustment related to misappropriation of inventory by former employees of a supplier in Mexico to which the Paint Sundries segment outsourced production. Property write-downs of $0.3 million are related to the restructuring and eventual closing of the Dallas, Texas facility mentioned and includes adjustments to leasehold improvements and production equipment. There were no asset writedowns for 2003.        (Gain) loss on asset sales  was a loss of $0.1 million in 2003 due to the Company selling various pieces of equipment which were no longer used in the manufacturing process at amounts less than book value.        Interest expense  decreased $0.3 million to $0.2 million in fiscal 2003 due to decreased borrowings. Effective with the sale of the Paint Sundries segment sale, the Company repaid approximately $5.4 million of outstanding debt on which interest was being paid.        Income taxes  increased $0.6 million as a result of increased profits. The effective tax rate was 42% in 2003 compared to 44% in 2002. The decreased rate results from the impact of certain non-deductible expenses, as well as the mix of tax rates from the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates.        Loss from discontinued operations,  net of tax was $0.2 for 2003 and $1.1 million for 2002. During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company sold the Paint Sundries segment. The loss from discontinued operations reflects the short period results for fiscal 2003 and the unfavorable trends identified in fiscal 2002.        Basic and diluted net earnings per share  were $0.17 for 2003 compared to a net loss of $1.17 for 2002.  Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2002 Compared to September 30, 2001          Net sales  for fiscal 2002 decreased $9.6 million or 16% related to lower sales at the Contract Manufacturing segment (down $6.5 million or 19%) and a decrease of $2.9 million (11%) from the Business Imaging segment. The most significant decline in Contract Manufacturing segment was related to reduced product demand from a major customer for which the Company manufactures and packages a variety of consumer products as well as unit price adjustments to the customer. Contract Manufacturing also declined due to strong competition from numerous suppliers of converting services to produce branded sheeting, copier papers and engineering rolls for OEM customers and who compete primarily on low pricing for a declining market of available sales. In the second quarter of fiscal 2001, this segment received its last significant order from a large manufacturer of wide-format printers and copiers before the customers decision to reassess its inventory stocking program and change suppliers. Printing and laminating services offered by the Contract Manufacturing segment were down slightly from the prior year as well. The Companys Business Imaging segment continued to experience strong competition from numerous suppliers resulting in a negative impact on sales volume in the engineering and data processing products from the segment. The decline in sales for those products in the Business Imaging segment were somewhat offset by an increase in receipt roll sales to the segments network of product distributors. Additionally, in March 2002, the Company made a strategic decision to exit the contract sheeting market and reached an agreement to sell its most significant production assets and sublease a portion of its facility. Later in fiscal 2002 the Company closed its Dallas, Texas manufacturing and distribution facility to control costs in order to remain competitive with its engineering paper products.  14    Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2002 Compared to September 30, 2001-Continued          Gross profit  declined $2.0 million (24%) and margins declined to 13% in fiscal 2002 from 14% in fiscal 2001. The largest factor contributing to the decline in margin percentages was the pass through of raw material costs in certain Contract Manufacturing agreements which basically contribute additional sales dollars with little or no margin dollar contributions. For this segment, reductions in volume as well as unit price adjustments to a major customer also contributed to the $2.5 million (35%) decline in gross profit. The decline in sales due to strong competition from numerous suppliers of converting services to produce branded sheeting, copier papers and engineering rolls mentioned earlier accounted for part of the decline in gross profit. Business Imaging gross profit increased $0.5 million or 36% due to a change in sales mix related to growth in receipt roll sales to the segments network of products distributors discussed previously. Also the segment improved margins by shedding overhead from underutilized production assets and reducing its Dallas, Texas manufacturing facility size when it exited from the contract sheeting market mentioned earlier        Selling, general and administrative expenses  for fiscal 2002 were up $0.2 million or 4%, compared to $3.8 million for 2001, primary due to increased expenses for outside professional services, rising health care costs, increases to the sales force late in fiscal 2001 and employee recruiting costs. Additionally, the Company increased its bad debt reserves following the bankruptcy of a large discount retail store chain.        Amortization of goodwill  was not recorded for fiscal 2002 as the result of implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in which the Company no longer records goodwill amortization expense which was $0.5 million for fiscal 2001. Had goodwill not been amortized for the year ended September 30, 2001, the net income per share would have been $0.42 per share instead of the $0.31 per share as reported. See Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change below.        Facility restructuring costs  of $0.2 million for fiscal 2002 was recorded following the Companys decision to exit the contract sheeting market in March 2002, mentioned above. These costs are mostly related to a building lease abandonment.        Facility closing expense  of $0.4 million for fiscal 2002 was recorded as a result of a strategic decision to close the Dallas, Texas manufacturing and distribution facility in September 2002 to control costs in order to remain competitive with the Companys engineering paper products by moving the decreased production to its Newton, North Carolina facility. Also, certain assets used to produce Paint Sundries products were moved to the Companys Manning, South Carolina facility. This expense mostly includes costs to move equipment and inventory, employee severances, building and equipment lease abandonment.        Severance expense  was $0.2 million in fiscal 2002, and relates primarily to payments by the Company pursuant to an employment agreement with a former executive.        Asset write-downs  of $0.5 million includes $0.2 million for an adjustment related to misappropriation of inventory by former employees of a supplier in Mexico to which the Paint Sundries segment outsourced production. Property write-downs of $0.3 million are related to the restructuring and closing of the Dallas Texas facility mentioned above and includes adjustments to leasehold improvements and production equipment.        Gain on asset sales  were nominal in fiscal 2002, compared to $0.1 million for 2001. The gain was related to the sale of sheeting equipment from its Dallas, Texas facility mentioned above which was mostly offset by disposals of unutilized equipment at the Companys Green Bay, Wisconsin facility.        Interest Expense  decreased $0.5 million to $0.5 million in fiscal 2002. The decline resulted from debt elimination of $6.2 million throughout fiscal 2002 and reductions in the interest rate on borrowings.  15    Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2002 Compared to September 30, 2001-Continued           Income taxes  decreased $1.2 million as a result of a decline in pre-tax profit as discussed above. The effective tax rate was 44% in 2002 compared to 40% in 2001 as a result of the impact that certain non-deductible expenses, such as meal and entertainment expense, as well as the mix of tax rates from the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates.        Loss from discontinued operations  net of tax was $1.1 million in 2002 compared to $0.8 million in 2001. The decrease in profitability of the Paint Sundries segment is due to reduced gross margins related to a change in sales mix and an increase in bad debt reserves following the bankruptcy of a large discount retail store chain.        Cumulative effect of accounting change  is the result of the Company adopting certain provisions of SFAS No. 142, effective October 1, 2001. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and certain other intangible assets are no longer systematically amortized but instead are reviewed for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to results of operations. In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company completed the transitional goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result, an impairment charge of $ 6.4 million ($4.7 million after tax, or $1.01 per diluted share) was recorded related to goodwill at certain Business Imaging and Paint Sundry reporting units. The fair value of the reporting units was estimated using a combination of valuation techniques including the expected present value of future cash flows and prices of comparable businesses. For the year ended September 30, 2001, amortization of goodwill related to continuing operations was $227,940, net of tax, or $0.05 per share, and $284,400, net of tax, or $0.06 per share related to discontinued operations.        Basic and diluted net loss per share  was $1.17 for fiscal 2002 compared to basic and diluted net earnings per share of $0.31 in fiscal 2001 as a result of matters discussed above.  Selected Quarterly Financial Data         The following table sets forth selected quarterly financial information. This information is derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company and includes, in the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments that management considers necessary for a fair statement of results for such periods.

The Contract Manufacturing segment sales were up $1.5 million or 28% in fourth quarter fiscal 2003 when compared to the same period last year as a result of increased product demand from a major customer for which the Company manufactures and packages a variety of consumer products. Contract Manufacturing also increased due to the start-up of the second printing press and the wet wipes production line in 2003. For fourth quarter fiscal 2003, Business Imaging segment sales were up $1.2 million (21%) in fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 compared to the same quarter of fiscal year 2002 due to increase sales of point of sale rolls by the segments network of products distributors and to a major retail discount customer. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 included asset write-downs and facility closing costs of $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively, related to the closing of the Companys Dallas, Texas facility in September 2002. For the fourth quarter of 2003, results included $0.2 million for severance costs, primarily relating to the transfer of corporate services and IT services, respectively, from Dallas, Texas. During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company sold the assets and business of its Paint Sundries segment (See Note 1 below) and incurred a loss of $0.2 million (net of tax) from that sale.                         (1)    Reflects the sale of the Paint Sundries segment on March 31, 2003 effective for financial purposes as of February 28, 2003. See Footnote 14  Discontinued Operations to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements attached as an Appendix to this Report.       Liquidity and Capital Resources         Cash flow from continuing operations was ($0.5) million for fiscal 2003, a positive $6.8 million in 2002 and $4.6 million in 2001. Accounts Receivable increased $2.4 million in 2003, primarily due to higher sales late in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to 2002. Accounts Payable decreased $2.2 million in 2003, compared to 2002.       Cash used in investing activities was $2.2 million in 2003 as the Company completed the purchase and start-up of its wet wipes converting line. Cash used in investing activities for 2002 was $0.6 million as  17    expenditures for production and office equipment were somewhat offset by proceeds from the sale of certain underutilized equipment.        Cash used in financing activities was $5.5 million in 2003 and $6.1 million in 2002 resulting primarily from repayments of outstanding indebtedness. In 2003, the Company repaid all of its outstanding term loan debt and cancelled that portion of its credit facility. In March 2003, the Companys Board of Directors approved the purchase by the Company of up to 100,000 of its shares of common stock after concluding that the cash and debt position would enable these purchases without impairment to the Companys capital. The purchase plan began in April 2003, and extends over a nine-month period. During 2003, the Company purchased 45,500 shares of its common stock on the open market for an aggregate of $0.3 million.       The Companys primary need for capital resources is to finance inventories, accounts receivable, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. At September 30, 2003, cash recorded on the balance sheet was $2.9 million.       The Contract Manufacturing segments sales are made pursuant to project-specific purchase orders as well as contract service agreements with terms of 18 months to three years. Sales under such contract service agreements are typically derived from customer directed purchase orders based on unit volume projections supplied by the customers and demand generated by the customers consumer bases. During fiscal 2003, the Company was informed by a customer which accounted for more than 33% of consolidated sales during fiscal 2003 that at the end of the contract term (December 31, 2003), the customer had decided to stop ordering certain products from the Company and would manufacture those products at its own facility. Those products accounted for approximately 20% of fiscal 2003 revenues. While the loss of these products could result in a significant reduction in revenues, on December 4, 2003 the Company announced it had signed significant contracts with new and existing customers for both printing and contract manufacturing. The Company believes that the revenue generated from these new contracts, on an annualized basis, should more than offset any revenue decline resulting from the products being removed. However, because the Companys contract revenue agreements described above do not have minimum purchase requirements, there can be no assurances that the revenues attributable to such contracts will be sufficient to offset the loss associated with the products being removed.       To satisfy the manufacturing requirements of the new contracts discussed above, the Company is undertaking a capital equipment expansion program aggregating approximately $3.6 million for fiscal 2004. Included in this expansion program is doubling the capacity for wet wipes production, a new flat pack folder, and a rebuild of an existing quarter folder. The Company anticipates such amounts will be funded by cash generated from the sale of the Paint Sundries segment, cash from operations and bank borrowings.       On March 31, 2003 the Company sold the Paint Sundries segment for approximately $12.2 million in cash to Trimaco, LLC and its affiliate. The sale included all Paint Sundries segment assets, including the stock of Foremost, Inc. and the Companys Manning, South Carolina facility. The effective date for the closing of the sale of the Paint Sundries segment for financial purposes was February 28, 2003, with the purchasers being entitled to the revenues attributable to the Paint Sundries segment from and after February 28, 2003, and being obligated to reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred and liabilities satisfied by the Company in connection with the operation of the Paint Sundries segment from and after February 28, 2003. The net proceeds from this sale were used to repay outstanding indebtedness consisting of term and revolving loans in the aggregate of $7.9 million outstanding under the Companys Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of August 15, 2002 with JP Morgan Chase Bank (the Prior Credit Facility), and for general corporate purposes.       On March 31, 2003, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Facility with JP Morgan Chase Bank (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility supersedes the Prior Credit Facility in its  18    Liquidity and Capital Resources-Continued    entirety and, among other things, reflects the release of the lenders security interest in the assets of the Paint Sundries segment and reduces the available amount of the revolving loan under the Prior Credit Agreement from $10.0 million to $6.0 million. The Credit Facility expires June 2004. Management has received a proposal from JP Morgan Chase to extend the Credit Facility for two and one half years and to increase the available revolving amount from $6.0 million to $9.0 million on substantially similar terms as currently exist. The Company can make no assurances that the Credit Facility will be extended or replaced. At December 18, 2003, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility, with $6.0 million available under the revolving credit agreement. Management believes its operating cash flow, together with amounts available under its Credit Facility, are adequate to service the Companys long-term obligations as of September 30, 2003, and any budgeted capital expenditures.       The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the Companys assets and contains certain restrictive covenants, including, minimum required cash flow, maximum allowable indebtedness and maximum allowable capital expenditures. At September 30, 2003 the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants under the Credit Facility.       On July 30, 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with Wachovia Bank, NA (formerly First Union) which had the effect of creating a fixed interest rate on the Companys term debt. This swap was terminated effective with the repayment of the term debt under the Prior Credit Agreement.       The Company has a $0.75 million standby letter of credit issued under the Credit Facility with its senior lender for amounts payable in connection with certain Village of Ashwaubenon Industrial Development Revenue Bonds. These bonds pay variable rates of interest which were 1.35% and 2.00% at September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively.       During fiscal 2003, the Company entered into a lease to own and operate an eight color flexographic printing press. The lease is structured as an operating lease over 7 years with payments totaling approximately $0.5 million annually. The Company has the right to purchase the asset at varying points during the lease.       The Company intends to retain earnings to finance future operations and expansion and does not expect to pay any dividends within the foreseeable future. In addition, the Companys primary lender must approve the payment of any dividends over $4.0 million pursuant to the Credit Facility.       Sharp increases or decreases in the costs of key commodities, such as paper or polyethylene, could periodically impact the Companys inventory values and net income. In fiscal years 2003 and 2002, the impact of inflation was minimal on the Companys inventory and net income. Management believes that the Company is generally successful in eventually passing these fluctuations in raw material prices to its customers through increases or decreases in the selling price of the Companys products, although the timing of selling price increases may lag behind cost increases. Prior to these periods, the impact of inflation has been minimal on the Companys inventory and net income.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements         The Company has no Off Balance Sheet Arrangements (as defined in Item 303 (a)(4) of Regulation S-K).   19         Contractual Obligation Data    The following table sets forth obligations and commitments to make future payments of debt, operating lease agreements, and future payments under purchase contracts:                                                                                                                            Payments Due By Period                                                                                           Less                                                 More                                    Than 1         2-3         4-5         Than                Total         Year         Years         Years         5 Years                                                     Long-Term Debt              750,000                   250,000                   500,000                                                  Capital Lease Obligations and Other Long Term Liabilities                                                                                                      Operating Leases              7,399,450                   1,278,725                   2,458,568                   2,167,941                   1,494,216            Unconditional Purchase Obligations (1)                                                                                                                                                                                                      Total Contractual Cash Obligations              8,149,450                   1,528,725                   2,958,568                   2,167,941                   1,494,216                                                                                                                (1)         The Company had no unconditional purchase obligations at September 30, 2003. As of December 18, 2003 the Company had incurred unconditional purchase obligations of approximately $2.3 million for equipment for the capital equipment expansion program announced by the Company on December 4, 2003.    Critical Accounting Policies         Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies, practices and estimates as described below. We believe the reported financial disclosures are reliable and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of the Company.       Financial statement preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. Actual amounts could differ from the amounts estimated. Differences from those estimates are recognized in the period they become known.       Revenue Recognition- The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and there is evidence and there is an agreement and collectibility of consideration to be received is reasonably assured, all of which generally occur at the time of shipment. Sales are recorded net of sales returns and allowances. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as revenue and costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales. Amounts related to raw materials provided by customers are excluded from revenue and cost of sales.       Trade Accounts and Notes Receivable- Management estimates allowances for collectibility related to its trade accounts and note receivables. These allowances are based on the customer relationships, the aging and turns of accounts receivable, credit worthiness of customers, credit concentrations and payment history. Although management monitors collections and credit worthiness, the inability of a particular customer to pay its debts could impact collectibility of receivables and could have an impact on future revenues if the customer is unable to arrange other financing. Management does not believe these conditions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the collectibility of its receivables or future revenues.  20    Critical Accounting Policies-Continued         Management estimates sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits, and applies these trend rates to the most recent 12 months sales data to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. Management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age, applying historical trend rates to the most recent 12 months sales, less actual write-offs to date. Managements estimates include providing for 100 percent of specific customer balances when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectible. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions.       Inventories- Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory evaluation. The Company estimates reserves for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization. A large portion of the Companys inventory is saleable to multiple customers and a portion of the inventory is manufactured to specifications provided by original equipment manufacturers and is not subject to rapid technological change.       Management does not believe changes are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the valuation of its inventories.       Goodwill- Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. In order to calculate goodwill, management applies judgment in determining the reporting units, which represent distinct parts of the business. The annual goodwill impairment analysis involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying amount. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment loss. Calculating the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant estimates and long-term assumptions. Any changes in key assumptions about he business and its prospects, or any changes in market conditions, interest rates or other externalities, could result in an impairment charge.       The annual test for impairment of goodwill was done during the third quarter of fiscal 2003 at the reporting unit level. The fair value of the reporting units was calculated using a combination of an income and market approach with the conclusion that no impairment existed as of October 1, 2002.       Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains additional information on the Companys accounting policies.  21    Recently Issued Accounting Standards         In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets . SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,  and the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30,  Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transaction . SFAS No. 144 also amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary. SFAS No. 144 requires that one accounting model be used for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired. SFAS No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. The Company adopted SFAS No. 144, effective October 1, 2002. Adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. The sale and discontinued operations of the Paint Sundries segment in the second quarter 2003 have been recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 144.       In December, 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure . SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,  and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require disclosures in interim financial statements of the effects of stock-based compensation. The interim disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 are effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The Companys stock-based compensation related to employees and non-employee directors is recognized using the intrinsic value method in accordance with       Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,  and thus there is no compensation expense for options granted with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the Companys common stock on the date of the grant.    ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK          Interest Rate Risk - In August 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract as a cash flow hedge under which the interest rate on its term debt under the then existing Credit Facility was fixed at 5.87%, plus a profit spread for the lender (see Note 6 to the Companys Financial Statements). Prior to entering into the swap agreement, management had reviewed the 40-year history of interest rates and had determined that the Companys risk of liability resulting from a material decline in interest rates over the life of the swap below the fixed level under the swap was not significant. In May 2003, the Company paid $26,000 to cancel the swap as there was no longer any outstanding term debt.        Foreign Currency Exchange Risk -The Company had no transactions in foreign currencies, nor had it entered into any foreign currency futures contracts as of September 30, 2003.        Commodity Price Risk -The Company had not entered into any forward buying agreements for the raw materials it uses to produce its goods and services as of September 30, 2003. An assessment of the risks of short-term commodity price fluctuations is set forth in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the caption Raw Materials and Suppliers.        Other Relevant Market Risks- The Company does not own any marketable securities, and management is not aware of any other relevant market risks.  22      ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
