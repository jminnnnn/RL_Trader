ITEM 7  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Forward Looking Statements          Managements discussion of the Companys fiscal 2005 results in comparison to fiscal 2004 contains forward-looking statements regarding current expectations, risks and uncertainties for future periods. The actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein due to a variety of factors such as changes in customer demand for its products, cancellation of production agreements by significant customers, material increases in the cost of base paper stock, competition in the Companys product areas, an inability of management to successfully reduce operating expenses in relation to net sales without damaging the long-term direction of the Company, the Companys ability to increase sales as a result of new projects, the Companys ability to successfully install new equipment on a timely basis, the Companys ability to continue the run rates for its product, or the Companys ability to successfully integrate its western region warehouse facility. Therefore, the selected financial data for the periods presented may not be indicative of the Companys future financial condition or results of operations.

                             11         Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2005 Compared to September 30, 2004           Net Sales  for fiscal 2005 increased $1.9 million due primarily to a $1.5 million (3%) increase in the Contract Manufacturing segment and a $0.4 million (2%) increase in the Business Imaging paper products segment. The increase in Contract Manufacturing related primarily to the utilization of wet and dry production lines for the entire year which started up in late fiscal 2004. These increases were partially offset by reduction in demand for certain dry wipe product lines. These increases were further offset by revenues lost through the sale of the Companys LA-2 thermal laminating asset, which generated $2.5 million in fiscal 2004. In 2005, the Company completed the transition to being the primary provider of raw materials for its customers. Raw materials are passed through in customer prices. Material costs in revenues for fiscal 2005 were $2.2 million higher than 2004.        The Business Imaging segment sales increase was primarily due to increased sales to several of its Hamco brand distributorships, as well as several of its retail customers. This segment continues to experience strong competition from numerous suppliers in point of sale and wide format goods creating negative impacts on sales volume.         Gross profit  decreased $2.4 million (31%) and gross profit percentage decreased to 6.7% from 9.9% in 2004. The margin in the Contract Manufacturing segment decreased to 6% in 2005 compared to 9% in 2004 on a gross profit decrease of $1.7 million. The decline in gross profit was primarily due to lower non-material revenues of $2.9 million compared to 2004. The Business Imaging segment experienced a decrease of $0.7 million in gross profit and a decrease in margin to 8% from 11% in 2004. This decrease was primarily related to increased raw material costs and the inability to quickly pass along these increases due to price competition from numerous suppliers in the segments major product lines.         Selling, general and administrative expenses  decreased $0.4 million in 2005 from 2004. Reductions in salaries of $237,000 and depreciation of $327,000 were offset by an increase in employee benefits of $102,000.         (Gain) loss on asset sales  was a gain of $0.4 million in 2005 and not material in 2004. In 2004, the Company reached an agreement to sell its LA-2 thermal laminating asset, with an expected gain of $0.4 million. The sale was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.         Interest expense  remained relatively unchanged in fiscal 2005 as a result of lower average debt outstanding.         Income taxes  decreased $0.6 million as a result of decreased profits. The effective tax rate was 39% in 2005 compared to 41% in 2004. The decreased rate relates to a change in the federal and state tax bracket more in line with the Companys earnings level.         Gain (loss) from sale of discontinued operations  net of tax was zero in 2005 and a gain of $0.4 million in 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company changed its estimate of income taxes payable in relationship to its sale of the Paint Sundries segment in 2003. That change was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 when the tax return was filed.         Basic and diluted net earnings per share  were $0.15 for 2005 compared to $0.43 for 2004.   12        Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2004 Compared to September 30, 2003           Net Sales  for fiscal 2004 increased $22.6 million due primarily to a $23.7 million (79%) increase in the Contract Manufacturing segment offset by a $1.1 million (4.3%) decrease in the Business Imaging paper products segment. The increase in Contract Manufacturing related primarily to the start-up of new contracts in the wet and dry converting markets. Several new production lines were brought on line during fiscal 2004 as well as the wet wipe folding line, which was utilized in production for the entire year. The Contract Manufacturing segment purchases materials for some of its customers and in other situations has materials supplied by customers. In 2004, purchases of materials increased $20.8 million, which increase was passed through to customers, generating additional sales revenue.        The Business Imaging segment sales decrease resulted from the loss of several large retail customers and declining sales to several of its Hamco brand distributorships. Sales of wide format and data processing products also declined during the year. This segment continues to experience strong competition from numerous suppliers in point of sale and wide format goods creating negative impacts on sales volume.         Gross profit  decreased $0.1 million (0.7%) and gross profit percentage decreased to 9.9% from 14.0% in 2003. The margin in the Contract Manufacturing segment decreased to 9% in 2004 compared to 17% in 2003 on a gross profit increase of $0.1 million. Previously, the Contract Manufacturing segment purchased materials for some of its customers and in other situations has materials supplied by customers. In 2004, purchases of materials increased $20.8 million, which increase was passed through to customers, generating additional sales revenue. These additional material purchases were the major factor in the margin percentage decline of 8%. The gross profit increase in Contract Manufacturing was primarily due to the increase in net sales offset by higher costs associated with the start-up of new projects. The Business Imaging segment experienced a decrease of $0.4 million in gross profit and a slight decrease in margin to 10.7% from 11% in 2003. This decrease is primarily related to increased raw material costs and increasing price competition from numerous suppliers in the segments major product lines.         Selling, general and administrative expenses  increased $0.1 million in 2004 from 2003. Reductions in salaries and benefits of $378,000, resulting primarily from the move of Corporate Services from Dallas, TX to Green Bay, WI, and depreciation of $327,000 were offset by increases in legal and audit fees of $159,000, bad debt expense of $294,000 and selling expenses of $212,000.         Amortization of goodwill  was not recorded for fiscal 2004 or 2003 as the result of implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in which the Company no longer records goodwill amortization expense.         Severance expense  of $0.3 million in 2003 relates primarily to severance paid to employees at the Dallas corporate services and IT location. Those services were moved to Green Bay during 2003. There was no severance expense for 2004.         (Gain) loss on asset sales  was not material in 2004 and was a loss of $0.1 million in 2003 due to the Company selling various pieces of equipment which were no longer used in the manufacturing process at amounts less than book value.         Interest expense  decreased $0.2 million in fiscal 2004 as a result of lower average debt outstanding. Effective with the sale of the Paint Sundries segment, during the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company repaid approximately $5.4 million of outstanding debt on which interest was being paid.         Income taxes  increased $0.2 million as a result of increased profits. The effective tax rate was 41% in 2004 compared to 42% in 2003. The decreased rate results from the mix of tax rates from the various state jurisdictions in which the Company operates.         Loss from operations of discontinued segment  net of tax was zero for 2004 and $0.2 million for 2003. During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company sold the Paint Sundries segment. The loss from discontinued operations reflects the short period results for fiscal 2003.   13        Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2004 Compared to September 30, 2003 (Continued)           Gain (loss) from sale of discontinued operations  net of tax was a gain of $0.4 million in 2004 and a loss of $0.2 million in 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company changed its estimate of income taxes payable in relationship to its sale of the Paint Sundries segment in 2003. That change was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 when the tax return was filed. In 2003, the Company recorded a $0.4 million loss ($0.2 million after tax) on the sale of the Paint Sundries segment, which included a $0.1 million gain on the sale of assets offset by $0.5 million of fees and expenses associated with the sale.         Basic and diluted net earnings per share  were $0.43 for 2004 compared to $0.17 for 2003.

The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period.    14          Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Continued)     Fiscal 2005 ( Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)                                                                                                          First         Second         Third         Fourth                Quarter         Quarter         Quarter         Quarter         Net sales         $    20,004              $    21,215              $    18,612              $    19,949           Gross profit              1,451                   1,391                   1,199                   1,292           Operating expenses              762                   1,158                   1,115                   1,111           Operating income              689                   234                   85                   181           Income before income taxes              690                   231                   67                   164           Income tax expense              282                   91                   14                   64           Income from continuing operations              408                   140                   53                   100           Net income              408                   140                   53                   100           Income from continuing operations per share:                                                                                      Basic              0.09                   0.03                   0.01                   0.02           Diluted              0.09                   0.03                   0.01                   0.02           Net income per share:                                                                                      Basic              0.09                   0.03                   0.01                   0.02           Diluted              0.09                   0.03                   0.01                   0.02             Fiscal 2004  (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)                                                                                                          First         Second         Third         Fourth                Quarter         Quarter         Quarter         Quarter         Net sales         $    13,046              $    20,199              $    20,262              $    24,348           Gross profit              1,574                   1,866                   1,798                   2,452           Operating expenses              1,122                   1,297                   1,209                   1,373           Operating income              452                   569                   589                   1,079           Income before income taxes              437                   563                   566                   1,072           Income tax expense              184                   241                   243                   407           Income from continuing operations              252                   322                   323                   665           Gain from discontinued operations                                                                       400           Net income              252                   322                   323                   1,065           Income from continuing operations per share:                                                                                      Basic              0.05                   0.07                   0.07                   0.15           Diluted              0.05                   0.07                   0.07                   0.14           Net income per share:                                                                                      Basic              0.05                   0.07                   0.07                   0.24           Diluted              0.05                   0.07                   0.07                   0.23                  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, sales decreased $4.4 million or 18% as compared to fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The Contract Manufacturing segment sales were down $4.8 million or 27% in fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 when compared to the same period last year as a result of decreased product demand from a major customer for which the Company manufactures and packages a variety of consumer products. This decrease also includes $1.0 million of revenue lost through the sale of the Companys LA-2 thermal laminating asset. For fourth quarter fiscal 2005, Business Imaging segment sales were up $0.4 million (7%) compared to the same quarter of fiscal year 2004 due to increased sales to several Hamco brand distributorships as well as to several retail customers.   15        Liquidity and Capital Resources          Cash flows provided by (used in) continuing operations were $2.6 million for fiscal 2005, ($0.7) million in 2004 and ($0.5) million in 2003. Accounts Receivable decreased $2.9 million in 2005 resulting from lower fourth quarter revenue compared to 2004. Accounts Payable decreased ($1.2) million in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to a decrease in materials purchased.        During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its thermal bond laminator for $475,000. In connection with such agreement, the Company received a $95,000 non-refundable deposit. The sale was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Consistent with accounting principles for revenue recognition, the Company accounted for and reported a gain of approximately $414,000 (which includes the non-refundable deposit) from this sale when it was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.        Cash used in investing activities was $1.0 million in 2005. Contract Manufacturing spent approximately $1.5 million on capital expenditures primarily related to the purchase of two new wipe converting lines. On June 8, 2005, the Company announced plans to acquire two new wipe converting lines to support its growth in the expanding disposable nonwovens wipes market. The two new wipe converting lines will be financed through cash flow generated by operating activities and/or short term borrowing from the Companys current line of credit. Other equipment was purchased throughout the year to support ongoing operations. In Business Imaging, the amount spent on capital expenditures was $0.1 million. This was offset by the sale of a 72" slitter for $185,000. Cash used in investing activities for 2004 was $4.3 million as the Company completed its $3.6 million capital equipment expansion program announced by the Company on December 4, 2003. In 2003, cash used in investing activities was $2.2 million as the Company completed the purchase and start-up of its wet wipes converting line.        Cash used in financing activities was $1.6 million in 2005, resulting primarily from repayments of outstanding indebtedness. Cash provided by financing activities was $1.7 million in 2004 as a result of the Company borrowing from its revolving credit line to fund a portion of its increased working capital needs. Cash used in financing activities was $5.5 million in 2003 resulting primarily from repayments of outstanding indebtedness. In 2003, the Company repaid all of its outstanding term loan debt and cancelled that portion of its credit facility. In March 2003, the Companys Board of Directors approved the purchase by the Company of up to 100,000 of its shares of common stock after concluding that the cash and debt position would enable these purchases without impairment to the Companys capital. The purchase plan began in April 2003, and expired in January 2004. During that period, the Company purchased 45,500 shares of its common stock on the open market for an aggregate of $0.3 million pursuant to the purchase plan. In March 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved the purchase by the Company of up to 300,000 of its shares of common stock. The purchase plan was scheduled to terminate in December 2005 but has been extended through June 30, 2006. A total of 37,200 shares were purchased for $0.2 million under the plan as of September 30, 2005.        The Companys primary need for capital resources is to finance inventories, accounts receivable, and capital expenditures. At September 30, 2005, cash recorded on the balance sheet was $5,672.        The Contract Manufacturing segments sales are made pursuant to project-specific purchase orders as well as contract service agreements with multi-year terms. Sales under such contract service agreements are typically derived from customer directed purchase orders based on unit volume projections supplied by the customers and demand generated by the customers consumer bases. During fiscal 2003, the Company was informed by a customer, which accounted for more than 33% of consolidated sales during fiscal 2003, that at the end of the contract term (December 31, 2003), the customer had decided to stop ordering certain products from the Company and would manufacture those products at its own facility. Those products accounted for approximately 20% of fiscal 2003 revenues. Subsequently, the Company announced it had signed significant contracts with new and existing customers for both printing and contract manufacturing. One of these customers, a large consumer products company, accounted for 41% of total sales in fiscal 2004, which more than offset the loss of the contract described above and accounted for 51% of the total sales in fiscal 2005. However, because the Companys contract revenue agreements described above generally do not have minimum purchase requirements, there can be no assurances that the revenues attributable to the new contracts will be without normal business fluctuations.   16        Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)          To satisfy the manufacturing requirements of the new contracts discussed above, the Company undertook a capital equipment expansion program aggregating approximately $3.6 million for fiscal 2004. Included in that expansion program was doubling the capacity for wet wipes production, a new flat pack folder, and a rebuild of an existing quarter folder. The Company funded such amounts by cash generated from the sale of the Paint Sundries segment, cash from operations and bank borrowings. On June 8, 2005, the Company announced plans to acquire two new wipe converting lines to support its growth in the expanding disposable, nonwovens wipes market. The two new wipe converting lines will be financed through cash flow generated by operating activities and/or short term borrowing from the Companys current line of credit.        On March 31, 2003, the Company sold its Paint Sundries segment for approximately $12.2 million in cash to Trimaco, LLC and its affiliate. The sale included all Paint Sundries segment assets, including the stock of Foremost, Inc. and the Companys Manning, South Carolina facility. The effective date for the closing of the sale of the Paint Sundries segment for financial purposes was February 28, 2003, with the purchasers being entitled to the revenues attributable to the Paint Sundries segment from and after February 28, 2003, and being obligated to reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred and liabilities satisfied by the Company in connection with the operation of the Paint Sundries segment from and after February 28, 2003. The net proceeds from this sale were used to repay outstanding indebtedness consisting of term and revolving loans in the aggregate of $7.9 million outstanding under the Companys Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of August 15, 2002, with JP Morgan Chase Bank (the Prior Credit Facility), and for general corporate purposes.        On June 1, 2004, the Prior Credit Facility expired. On May 20, 2004, the Company signed a new credit agreement. The credit agreement includes a $9.0 million revolving line of credit facility as well as a $1.0 million swing line available for overdrafts. The agreement expires on May 18, 2007. Borrowings under the line of credit are made under the base rate account or the Eurodollar account. Interest on amounts borrowed under the base rate account is calculated based on the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 1/2 of 1% or the Prime Rate on the date of the borrowing. Interest on amounts borrowed under the Eurodollar account is calculated based on LIBOR. As of September 30, 2005, the Company had $0.6 million outstanding under the base rate account and $0.5 million outstanding under the Eurodollar account at a rate of 6.75% and 5.05%, respectively. The revolving line of credit also includes a commitment to issue commercial and standby letters of credit not to exceed $1.0 million. The Company had no amounts outstanding under the letter of credit commitment as of September 30, 2005. The Company has $8.9 million available under the line of credit as of September 30, 2005. The revolving line-of-credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including requirements to maintain a minimum tangible net worth and restrictions on maximum allowable debt, stock purchases, mergers, and payment of dividends. At September 30, 2005, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants under the line-of-credit agreement. On December 16, 2005, the Company had approximately $8.0 million available under its revolving credit line.        Management believes its operating cash flow, together with amounts available under its Credit Facility, are adequate to service the Companys long-term obligations as of September 30, 2005 and any budgeted capital expenditures.        On May 6, 2004, the Company redeemed $0.75 million of outstanding Industrial Development Revenue Bonds with the Village of Ashwaubenon. These bonds paid variable rates of interest, which was 1.35% at September 30, 2003.        The Company intends to retain earnings to finance future operations and expansion and does not expect to pay any dividends within the foreseeable future. In addition, pursuant to the Credit Facility, the Companys primary lenders must approve the payment of any dividends over $2.0 million.        Sharp increases or decreases in the costs of key commodities, such as paper or polyethylene, could periodically impact the Companys inventory values and net income. In fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, the impact of inflation was minimal on the Companys inventory and net income. Management believes that the Company is generally successful in eventually passing these fluctuations in raw material prices to its customers through increases or decreases in the selling price of the Companys products, although the timing of selling price increases may lag behind cost increases. Prior to these periods, the impact of inflation has been minimal on the Companys inventory and net income.   17        Off Balance Sheet Arrangements          The Company has no Off Balance Sheet Arrangements (as defined in Item 303 (a)(4) of Regulation S-K).   Contractual Obligation Data          The following table sets forth obligations and commitments to make future payments of debt, operating lease agreements, and future payments under purchase contracts:                                                                                                                             Payments Due By Period                                         Less                                                      More                                         Than 1              2-3              4-5              Than                     Total              Year              Years              Years              5 Years              Long Term Debt (1)              1,112,636                                      1,112,636                                                 Capital Lease Obligations and Other Long Term Liabilities                                                                                                     Operating Leases              4,920,119                   1,238,464                   2,185,429                   1,496,226                              Unconditional Purchase Obligations (2)              997,175                   997,175                                                                                     Total Contractual Cash Obligations              7,029,930                   2,235,639                   3,298,065                   1,496,226                                                                        (1)         Based on the rates and the current amount of debt outstanding at September 30, 2005, cash payments for interest on long-term debt would be approximately $110,922 for 2006 and 2007.           (2)         As of December 16, 2005 the Company had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately $1.4 million for two new wipe converting lines related to the capital equipment expansion program announced by the Company on June 8, 2005.        Critical Accounting Policies          Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies, practices and estimates as described below. We believe the reported financial disclosures are reliable and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations for the Company.        Financial statement preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. Actual amounts could differ from the amounts estimated. Differences from those estimates are recognized in the period they become known.        Revenue Recognition- The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and there is evidence of an agreement and collectability of consideration to be received is reasonably assured, all of which generally occur at the time of shipment. Sales are recorded net of sales returns and allowances. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as revenue and costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales. Amounts related to raw materials provided by customers are excluded from revenue and cost of sales.   18        Critical Accounting Policies (Continued)          Accounts Receivable- Management estimates allowances for collectability related to its accounts receivable balances. These allowances are based on the customer relationships, the aging and turns of accounts receivable, credit worthiness of customers, credit concentrations and payment history. Managements estimates include providing for 100 percent of specific customer balances when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectable.  Management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age, applying historical trend rates to the most recent 12 months sales, less actual write-offs to date. Although management monitors collections and credit worthiness, the inability of a particular customer to pay its debts could impact collectability of receivables and could have an impact on future revenues if the customer is unable to arrange other financing. Management does not believe these conditions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the collectability of its receivables or future revenues.        Management estimates sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits, and applies these trend rates to the most recent 12 months sales data to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions.        Inventories- Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation. The Company estimates reserves for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization. A large portion of the Companys inventory is saleable to multiple customers and a portion of the inventory is manufactured to specifications provided by original equipment manufacturers and is not subject to rapid technological change.        Goodwill- Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. In order to calculate goodwill, management applies judgment in determining the reporting units, which represent distinct parts of the business. The annual goodwill impairment analysis involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying amount. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment loss. Calculating the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant estimates and long-term assumptions. Any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects, or any changes in market conditions, interest rates or other externalities, could result in an impairment charge. Management has continued to review the carrying values of goodwill for recoverability based on fair market value estimated using estimated future cash flows and prices of comparable companies in accordance with SFAS No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . The fair value of the reporting units was estimated using a combination of valuation techniques, including the expected present value of future cash flows and prices of comparable businesses.        In accordance with SFAS 144,  Accounting for the Impairment for Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,  the Company evaluates the recoverability of the recorded amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value using discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques.        Additional information on the Companys accounting policies is set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report as referenced to the Appendix to this Report.   Recently Issued Accounting Standards          In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued the revised SFAS No. 123, Share-Based Payment (SFAS   123(R)). SFAS 123(R) requires compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements. Generally, compensation cost will be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued using an option pricing model. In addition, liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period. Compensation cost will be recognized over the requisite service period, generally as the award vests. The Company is required to adopt SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of the Companys 2006 fiscal year. SFAS 123(R) applies to all awards granted after October 1, 2005 and to previously-granted awards unvested as of the adoption date. The effect of adoption of SFAS 123(R) is currently estimated to be approximately $75,000 to $100,000 (approximately $0.02 per share) after-tax for 2006. However, our actual share-based compensation expense in 2006 depends on a number of factors, including fair value of awards at the time of grant.   19        Recently Issued Accounting Standards (Continued)       In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage be recognized as current-period charges. Further, SFAS 151 requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. Unallocated overheads must be recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. SFAS 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company believes that the effect of SFAS 151 on its financial statements and related disclosures is immaterial.   20          ITEM 7A  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK           Interest Rate Risk - In August 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract as a cash flow hedge under which the interest rate on its term debt under the then-existing credit facility was fixed at 5.87%, plus a profit spread for the lender. Prior to entering into the swap agreement, management had reviewed the 40-year history of interest rates and had determined that the Companys risk of liability resulting from a material decline in interest rates over the life of the swap below the fixed level under the swap was not significant. In May 2003, the Company paid $26,000 to cancel the swap, as there was no longer any outstanding term debt.        Because of the level of variable interest rate debt in the Companys capital structure, the Company is exposed to earnings or cash flow fluctuations due to changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2005, the Company had $1.1 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 5.98%. This debt exposes the Company to changes in interest expense brought about by changes in interest rates. If the weighted average interest rate were to increase by 10.0% for fiscal 2005, the impact on net income would be immaterial.         Foreign Currency Exchange Risk -The Company had no transactions in foreign currencies, nor had it entered into any foreign currency futures contracts as of September 30, 2005.         Commodity Price Risk -The Company had not entered into any forward buying agreements for the raw materials it uses to produce its goods and services as of September 30, 2005. An assessment of the risks of short-term commodity price fluctuations is set forth in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the caption Raw Materials and Suppliers.         Other Relevant Market Risks- The Company does not own any marketable securities, and management is not aware of any other relevant market risks.
