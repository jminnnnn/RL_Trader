ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS        Management's discussion of the Company's 2002 fiscal year in comparison to fiscal 2001, contains forward-looking statements regarding current expectations, risks and uncertainties for fiscal 2003 and beyond. The actual results could differ materially from those discussed here. As well as those factors discussed in the section entitled "Business" in this report, other factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, among other items, the general economic and business conditions affecting the contract manufacturing, specialty printing services, imaging paper products and paint sundry products industries, significant changes in the cost of base paper stock, competition in the Company's product areas, or an inability of management to successfully reduce operating expenses in relation to net sales without damaging the long-term direction of the Company. Therefore, the selected financial data for the periods presented may not be indicative of the Company's future financial condition or results of operations.  GENERAL        Tufco performs contract manufacturing and specialty printing services, manufactures and distributes business imaging paper products and paint sundry products. The Company's strategy is to provide services, manufacture and distribute products in niche markets relying on close customer contact and high levels of quality and service. The Company works closely with its contract manufacturing clients to develop products or perform services which meet or exceed the customers' quality standards, and to then use the Company's operating efficiencies and technical expertise to supplement or replace its customers' own production and distribution functions.        The Company's technical proficiencies include folding, packaging, coating, slitting and rewinding, sheeting, multi-color printing and laminating.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        The following discussion relates to the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 ("current year" or "fiscal 2002"), in comparison to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 ("prior year" or "fiscal 2001"), as well as the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000 ("fiscal 2000").                                           12  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)        The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years ended September 30 (i) the percentage relationship of certain items from the Company's statements of operations to net sales and (ii) the year-to-year changes in these items:                                                  PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES         YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGE

NET SALES for fiscal 2002 decreased $6.5 million or 8% related to lower sales at the Contract Manufacturing sector (down $10.3 million or 25%) offset by an increases of $3.1 million or 15% in the Paint Sundry sector and $0.8 million (4%) from the Business Imaging sector. The most significant decline in Contract Manufacturing sector was related to reduced product demand from a major customer for which the Company manufactures and packages a variety of consumer products as well as unit price adjustments to the customer. The Company has service agreements with this major customer to manufacture and package a baby care product and two cleaning products. For the Contract Manufacturing sector the Company is dependent on unit volume projections provided by its customers and demand generated by the customers' consumer base. Contract Manufacturing also declined due to strong competition from numerous suppliers of converting services to produce branded sheeting, copier papers and engineering rolls for OEM customers and who compete primarily on low pricing for a declining market of available sales. In the second quarter of fiscal 2001, this sector received its last significant order from a large manufacturer of wide-format printers and copiers before the customer's decision to reassess its inventory stocking program and change suppliers. Printing and laminating services offered by the Contract Manufacturing sector were down slightly from the prior year as well. The increase in the Paint Sundry sector was the result of higher demand for certain new products launched in fiscal 2001 sold mostly to the sector's largest customer, a large do-it-yourself home center as well as volume increases to this customer. The Company's Business Imaging sector continued to experience strong competition from numerous suppliers continued to have a negative impact on sales volume in the engineering and data processing products from the sector. The decline in sales for those products in the Business Imaging sector were more than offset by an increase in receipt roll sales to the sector's network of products distributors. Additionally, in March 2002, the Company made a strategic decision to exit the contract sheeting market and reached an agreement to sell its most significant production assets and sublease a portion of its facility. Later in fiscal 2002 the Company closed its Dallas, Texas manufacturing and distribution facility to control costs in order to remain competitive with its engineering products.        GROSS PROFIT declined $1.7 million (16%) and margins declined to 11.5% in fiscal 2002 from 12.6% in fiscal 2001. The largest factor contributing to the decline in margin percentages was the pass through of raw material costs in certain Contract Manufacturing agreements which basically contribute additional sales dollars with little or no margin dollar contributions. For this sector, reductions in volume as well as unit price adjustments to a major customer also contributed to the $2.3 million (35%) decline in gross profit. The decline in sales due to strong competition from numerous suppliers of converting services to produce branded sheeting, copier papers and engineering rolls mentioned earlier accounted for part of the decline in gross profit. Business Imaging gross profit increased $0.4 million or 22% due to growth in receipt roll sales to the sector's network of products distributors discussed previously. Also the sector improved margins by shedding overhead from underutilized production assets and reducing its Dallas, Texas manufacturing facility size when it exited from the contract sheeting market mentioned earlier. The Paint Sundry sector gross profit increased $0.2 million, with margins decreasing to 10.3% in fiscal 2002 from 10.7% in fiscal 2001. The improvement in gross profit for the Paint Sundry sector came from increased sales mentioned earlier and cost savings from the consolidation of the Company's St. Louis operations into the expanded Manning, South Carolina plant in April of fiscal 2001 offset by higher than expected freight cost. Additionally, the Paint Sundry sector gross profits declined as a result of unit price adjustments to a major customer of the sector offset by sales volume growth to this customer mentioned earlier.        SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES for fiscal 2002 were up $0.7 million or 11%, compared to $6.8 million for 2001, primary due to increased expenses for outside professional services, rising health care costs, increases to the sales force late in fiscal 2001 and employee recruiting costs. Additionally, the Company increased its bad debt reserves following the bankruptcy of a large discount retail store chain.                                           14  FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 COMPARED TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2001-CONTINUED        AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL was not recorded for fiscal 2002 as the result of implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" in which the Company no longer records goodwill amortization expense which was $0.6 million for fiscal 2001. Had goodwill not been amortized for the year ended September 30, 2001, the income per share would have been $0.42 per share instead of the $0.31 per share as reported. See cumulative effect of accounting change below.        FACILITY RESTRUCTURING COSTS of $0.2 million for fiscal 2002 was recorded following the Company's decision to exit the contract sheeting market in March 2002, mentioned above. These costs are mostly related building lease abandonment.        FACILITY CLOSING EXPENSE of $0.4 million for fiscal 2002 was recorded as a result of a strategic decision to close the Dallas, Texas manufacturing and distribution facility in September 2002 to control costs in order to remain competitive with the Company's engineering products by moving the decreased production to its Newton, North Carolina facility. Also, certain assets used to produce Paint Sundry products were moved to the Company's Manning, South Carolina facility. This expense mostly includes costs to move equipment and inventory, employee severances, building and equipment lease abandonment. The Company expects to reduce ongoing costs at an annual rate of approximately $0.7 million through this closing and consolidation.        SEVERANCE EXPENSE was $0.2 million in fiscal 2002, and relates primarily to payments by the Company pursuant to an employment agreement with a former executive.        PROPERTY AND INVENTORY WRITE-DOWNS of $0.7 million includes $0.2 million for an adjustment related to misappropriation of inventory by former employees of a supplier in Mexico to which the Paint Sundry sector outsourced production. Property write-downs of $0.5 million are related to the restructuring and eventual closing of the Dallas, Texas facility mentioned and includes adjustments to leasehold improvements and production equipment.        GAINS ON ASSET SALES were nominal in fiscal 2002, compared to $0.1 million for 2001. The gain was related to the sale of sheeting equipment from its Dallas, Texas facility mentioned above which was mostly offset by disposals of unutilized equipment at the Company's Green Bay, Wisconsin facility.        INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME decreased $0.2 million to $0.4 million in fiscal 2002. The decline was due to a decrease in interest expense of $0.5 million from fiscal 2001 as a result of debt elimination of $6.2 million throughout fiscal 2002 and reductions in the interest rate on borrowings. Additionally, other income decreased $0.2 million in fiscal 2002, from the settlement of a lawsuit under which the Company had been required to indemnify a related party in fiscal 2001. The actual settlement was less than the liability previously accrued by the Company resulting in this gain in fiscal 2001.        INCOME TAXES decreased $1.2 million as a result of declines in gross profit, increases in selling and administrative expenses and other expenses mentioned above. Income tax benefit for fiscal 2002 was 12% of pre-tax losses compared to income tax expense of 42% of pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2001. The decreased rate was the result of the impact that certain non-deductible expenses, such as meal and entertainment expense, on the pre-tax losses incurred in fiscal 2002 as well as the mix of tax rates from the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates.        CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE is the result of the Company adopting certain provisions of SFAS No. 142, effective October 1, 2001. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and certain other intangible assets are no longer systematically amortized but instead are reviewed for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to results of operations. In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company completed the transitional goodwill                                           15  FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 COMPARED TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2001-CONTINUED  impairment test during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result, an impairment charge of $ 6.4 million ($4.7 million after tax, or $1.01 per diluted share) was recorded related to goodwill at certain Business Imaging and Paint Sundry reporting units. The fair value of the reporting units was estimated using a combination of valuation techniques including the expected present value of future cash flows and prices of comparable businesses. For the year ended September 30, 2001, amortization of goodwill was $512,340, net of tax, or $0.11 per share.        BASIC AND DILUTED LOSS PER SHARE was $1.17 for fiscal 2002 compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.31 in fiscal 2001.  FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 COMPARED TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2000        NET SALES for fiscal 2001 increased $3.2 million or 4% primarily due to increased sales in the Company's Contract Manufacturing sector, which increased $6.5 million or 19% over fiscal 2000. The increase in Contract Manufacturing sales were the result of three service agreements with a Fortune 500 consumer products company, under which the Company manufactured and packaged a baby care product and two cleaning products. Unlike other agreements the Company has with its Contract Manufacturing customers, the agreement for the baby care product requires the Company to purchase the primary raw materials used in the manufacturing process and pass through this raw material cost, plus a small handling charge, to the customer in addition to the revenue from typical manufacturing services. This arrangement results in higher sales but lower effective margins. Manufacturing of the cleaning products began late in third quarter of fiscal 2000 and reached a peak in the second and third quarter of fiscal 2001. Sales of the baby care product began in the second quarter of fiscal 2001. Offsetting these increases, Contract Manufacturing sales to a large manufacturer of wide-format printers and copiers decreased during fiscal 2001 due to decisions by that customer's management to reassess its inventory-stocking program. The Company's Business Imaging sales decreased $5.1 million or 20% during fiscal 2001 as strong competition from numerous suppliers continued to have a negative impact on sales volume in the sector, especially in the engineering, data processing and contract sheeting products. In addition, during fiscal 2001 the Company was unsuccessful in retaining existing business including sales of receipt rolls to a large retail video rental company and three large retail grocers, all of which were lost during annual competitive bid processes. Sales in the Company's Paint Sundry sector rose $1.8 million (9%) in fiscal 2001 over fiscal 2000, primarily due to increased sales to a large do-it-yourself home center. In addition, during fiscal 2001, the Paint Sundry sector was successful in launching two new product portfolios.        GROSS PROFIT declined $0.5 million (5%) and margins declined to 12.6% in fiscal 2001 from 13.8% in fiscal 2000. The largest factor contributing to the decline in margins was the pass through of raw material costs in the new Contract Manufacturing agreement to manufacture and package a baby care product discussed earlier. Gross profit for Contract Manufacturing declined $0.6 million or 8% in fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000 due to a decline in sales to a large manufacturer of wide-format printers and copiers mentioned earlier. Gross profit in the Paint Sundry sector increased $1.3 million or 158% increasing margins to 11% in fiscal 2001. This was primarily due to the aforementioned increase in sales to a large do-it-yourself home center and the consolidation of the Company's two Paint Sundry plants. In April of fiscal 2001, the Company completed its consolidation of its St Louis, Missouri operations into the expanded Manning, South Carolina plant. Management believes that this consolidation will provide almost $1 million in annual cost savings, most of which will help to increase gross profit. Business Imaging sector gross margins decreased $1.3 million (44%) during fiscal 2001. As discussed earlier, the Company's Business Imaging sales decreased during fiscal 2001 due to loss of customers from strong competition in the Company's engineering, contract sheeting and data processing product groups and the loss of business as a result of competitive bid processes for sales receipt business during fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000.                                           16  FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 COMPARED TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2000-CONTINUED        SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES for fiscal 2001 were down $0.3 million or 5%, compared to $7.1 million for fiscal 2000, primary due to reductions in cost for outside professional services. Additionally telephone expenses were down in fiscal 2001 from installation of communications hardware which reduced long distance telephone costs and internal network communication costs.        FACILITY CLOSING EXPENSE was a one-time charge in fiscal 2000 associated with the closing of the Company's St. Louis distribution facility and the moving of the related inventory equipment and personnel to Manning, South Carolina.        SEVERANCE EXPENSE was $0.7 million in fiscal 2000, and relates to payments due to a former executive of the Company pursuant to an employment agreement with an acquired company.        GAINS ON ASSET SALES were $0.1 million in fiscal 2001, compared to $0.3 million for fiscal 2000, resulting from the sale of certain under-utilized equipment in the Green Bay, Wisconsin facility.        INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME increased $0.2 million in fiscal 2001 due to the settlement of a lawsuit under which the Company had been required to indemnify a related party. The actual settlement was less than the liability previously accrued by the Company resulting in this gain.        INCOME TAXES were 42% of pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2001, compared to 48% for fiscal 2000. The decreased rate was the result of the impact that certain non-deductible expenses, such as goodwill amortization, on the relatively low level of pre-tax income in fiscal 2000.        BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE were $0.31 for fiscal 2001 compared to $0.12 and $0.11, respectively, in fiscal 2000. Adjusted for the after tax effects of the plant costing costs and executive severance, basic and diluted earnings per share would have been $0.32 in fiscal 2000.                                          17  SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA        The following table sets forth selected quarterly financial information. This information is derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company and includes, in the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments that management considers necessary for a fair statement of results for such periods.

(.20)         .17         .20         .14         In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, sales declined $1.6 million or 8% as compared to fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The Contract Manufacturing sector sales were down $3.0 million or 28% in fourth quarter fiscal 2002 when compared to the same period last year as a result of reduced product demand from a major customer for which the Company manufactures and packages a variety of consumer products as well as unit price adjustments to the customer. Contract Manufacturing also declined due to strong competition from numerous suppliers of converting services to produce branded sheeting, copier papers and engineering rolls for OEM customers and who compete primarily on low pricing for a declining market of available sales offset slightly by printing and laminating services which were up from fiscal 2001. For fourth quarter fiscal 2002, Business Imaging sector sales were up $0.7 million (14%) in fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 when compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2001 due to increased sales of receipt roll sales to the sector's network of products distributors. The Paint Sundry sector sales were up $0.7 million or 12% for fourth quarter fiscal 2002 when compared to the same quarter last year mostly due to sales to a large                                           18  SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA-CONTINUED  do-it-yourself home center in the Paint Sundry sector. Gross profit for the Company decreased $1.5 million (49%) and margin percentages declined to 8% from 15% in fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2001. Gross profit for the Contract Manufacturing sector declined $1.6 million. The largest factor contributing to the decline in gross profit was the decline is sales volume discussed earlier. Also for this sector, unit price adjustments to a major customer contributed to the gross profit decline. Business Imaging gross profit increased $0.3 million due to growth in receipt roll sales to the sector's network of products distributors discussed previously. Also the sector improved margins by shedding overhead from underutilized production assets and reducing its Dallas, Texas manufacturing facility size when it exited from the contract sheeting market mentioned earlier. The Paint Sundry sector gross profit increased $0.3 million, with margins decreasing to 8% in fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 from 14% in the same quarter of fiscal 2001. The decrease in margin percent for the Paint Sundry sector came from higher than expected freight cost discussed earlier. Additionally, the Paint Sundry sector gross profits increased as a result of sales growth to a large do-it-yourself home center mentioned earlier offset partially by unit price adjustments to this same customer. Operating income declined from $1.2 million in fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 to an operating loss of $1.2 million in fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. This decline in fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 included property and inventory write-downs of $0.4 million related to an inventory misappropriation discussed earlier and $0.4 million related to the closing of the Company's Dallas, Texas facility in September 2002.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES        Cash flow from operations increased to $6.6 million in fiscal 2002 from $2.2 million in fiscal 2001. Cash generated from net income adjusted for non-cash expenses and gains was $3.1 million in fiscal 2002 compared to $4.7 million in the prior year. In addition, inventories were $2.3 million lower in fiscal 2002 compared with fiscal 2001 due to working capital improvement strategies undertaken by the Company's management and completion of the product launch of two new Paint Sundry products started late during fiscal 2001. Accounts payable increased $1.9 million due to timing of payment due dates relative to the last day of fiscal 2002. The Company has an arrangement with its largest customer whereby the Company purchases and installs the customer's production equipment, and is later reimbursed by the customer. The balance of these reimbursement payments due were $0.1 million and $1.0 million on the last day of fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively.        Cash used in investing activities totaled $0.7 million in fiscal 2002 and was related to cost to purchase and install production or office equipment. Cash used in investing activities totaled $1.9 million in fiscal 2001 resulting from cost to expand the Manning, South Carolina plant ($1.2 million) and purchase and install production and office equipment. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of sheeting equipment in fiscal 2002 mentioned above and other under-utilized production equipment in the current and prior years.        Cash used in financing activities totaled $6.1 million and $0.6 million in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 respectively, resulting from the repayment of long-term debt offset by repayment of shareholder notes receivable in fiscal 2002 and proceeds from the issuance of common stock in fiscal 2001.        The Company's primary need for capital resources is to finance inventories, accounts receivable, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. As of September 30, 2002, the Company had commitments for the purchase of a flexographic printing press for $3.2 million and a wet wipe converting machine for $2.2 million. The Company plans to enter into an operating lease for a flexographic printing press during fiscal 2003. The company anticipates making capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 of approximately $4.0 million and expects such amounts to be funded by cash from operations, bank and other financing sources.                                           19  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES-CONTINUED        On August 15, 2002, the Company entered into an amended and restated financing arrangement with JPMorgan Chase Bank (the "Credit Facility"). Under the Credit Facility, the Company had $3.4 million of term debt outstanding at September 30, 2002, repayable in equal quarterly payments maturing in May 2007, and availability up to $10.0 million under a revolving credit agreement through June 2004. On July 30, 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with Wachovia Bank, NA (formerly First Union) which had the effect of creating a fixed interest rate on the Company's term debt, expiring August 2003. As a result of this arrangement, the interest rate on the term debt is fixed at 5.87%, plus a profit spread for the bank. Management believes that this hedge arrangement creates a desirable stability of future interest payments. At December 26, 2002, the Company had approximately $8.1 million in total borrowings outstanding under this agreement, with $5.6 million available under the revolving credit agreement. Management believes its operating cash flow is adequate to service its long-term obligations as of September 30, 2002, and any budgeted capital expenditures.        The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets and contains certain restrictive covenants, including, minimum required cash flow, maximum allowable indebtedness and maximum allowable capital expenditures. In December 2002, the Company received a waiver by its principal lender as of September 30, 2002, in connection with the Company's failure to achieve the required fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Facility. Management believes its failure to achieve this ratio was the result of facility closing cost, and property and inventory write-downs experienced late in fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Other than the fixed charge coverage ratio described above, at September 30, 2002 the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants under the credit facility. At September 30, 2001, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants under its prior credit facility.        The Company has a $1.0 million standby letter of credit with its former senior lender for amounts payable in connection with certain Village of Ashwaubenon Industrial Development Revenue Bonds. Pursuant to the terms of the Village of Ashwaubenon Industrial Development Revenue Bonds, the Company is required to replace the standby letter of credit in May 2003. The Company expects to replace this standby letter of credit with a substitute letter of credit issued under the Credit Facility.        The Company entered into an agreement with a third party to construct and lease for an initial 5-year term a 62,000 square foot facility in Manning, South Carolina, which the Company occupied in October 1996. The facility was financed pursuant to a $1.5 million industrial revenue bond for which the Company was indirectly liable pursuant to a lease backed by a letter of credit issued by its former senior lenders. As a result of the refinancing with JPMorgan Chase Bank, the Company was required to replace this letter of credit with a substitute letter of credit issued under the Credit Facility. On December 5, 2002 the Company caused the prepayment of the $1.1 million principal amount and related accrued interest on the industrial revenue bonds and in connection therewith purchased the building for $1.1 million. This transaction was funded by additional borrowings under the Credit Facility.        During the first quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company entered into a lease to own and operate a Windmoeller and Hoelscher eight color flexographic printing press. The lease is structured as an operating lease over ten years with payments totaling approximately $0.5 million annually. The Company will have the right to purchase the asset at varying points during the lease.        The Company intends to retain earnings to finance future operations and expansion and does not expect to pay any dividends within the foreseeable future. In addition, the Company's primary lender must approve the payment of any dividends pursuant to the Credit Facility.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION DATA  The following table sets forth obligations and commitments to make future payments of debt, operating lease agreements, and future payments under contracts:                                                                       Payments Due By Period                                             ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               Less                                                              Than 1           1-3           4-5           After                                               Total           Year           Years         Years         5 Years                                             ----------     ----------     ----------     ----------     ----------             Long-Term Debt                               6,156,608        922,726      3,638,430      1,595,452  Operating Leases                             5,547,137      1,070,261      1,616,428      1,327,463      1,532,985  Unconditional  Purchase Obligations (1)      6,500,000      6,500,000                                              ----------     ----------     ----------     ----------     ---------- Total Contractual Cash Obligations          18,203,745      8,492,987      5,254,858      2,922,915      1,532,985                                             ==========     ==========     ==========     ==========     ==========   (1) The unconditional purchase obligations includes $3.2 million for a flexographic printing press which the Company ultimately plans to finance through an operating lease, $2.2 million for a wet wipe converting machine and $1.1 million for the Company to exercise its option to purchase a building in Manning, South Carolina.        The Company's allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $0.5 million at November 30, 2002. Management believes that this allowance is adequate to provide for losses inherent in its accounts receivable.                                           20  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES-CONTINUED        Sharp increases or decreases in the costs of key commodities, such as paper or polyethylene, periodically impact the Company's inventory values and net income. This was the case in fiscal 2000 as rising paper costs had a negative impact on the Company's profit. In fiscal years 2002 and 2001, the impact of inflation was minimal on the Company's inventory and net income. Management believes that the Company is generally successful in eventually passing these fluctuations in raw material prices to its customers through increases or decreases in the selling price of the Company's products, although the timing of selling price increases may lag behind cost increases. Prior to these periods, the impact of inflation has been minimal on the Company's inventory and net income.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the United States of America. The reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies, practices and estimates as described below. We believe the reported financial disclosures are reliable and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of the Company.        The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Certain items in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation.        Financial statement preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. Differences from those estimates are recognized in the period they become known.        Revenue Recognition- The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with revenue terms, typically revenues are recognized as sales when goods are shipped and title transfers to the customer.        Trade Accounts and Notes Receivable- Management estimates allowances for collectibility related to its trade accounts and note receivables. These allowances are based on the customer relationships, the aging and turns of accounts receivable, credit worthiness of customers, credit concentrations and payment history. Although management monitors collections and credit worthiness, the inability of a particular customer to pay its debts could impact collectibility of receivables and could have an impact on future revenues if the customer is unable to arrange other financing. Management does not believe these conditions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the collectibility of its receivables or future revenues.        Management estimates sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits, and applies these trend rates to the most recent 12 months' sales data to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. Management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age, applying historical trend rates to the most recent 12 months' sales, less actual write-offs to date. Management's estimates include providing for 100 percent of specific customer balances when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectible. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions.        Inventories- Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory evaluation. The Company estimates reserves for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization. A large portion of the Company's inventory is saleable to multiple customers and a portion of the inventory is manufactured to specifications provided by original equipment manufacturers and is not subject to rapid technological change.        Management does not believe changes are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the valuation of its inventories.        Goodwill- Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations in fiscal 1998 and prior years and, before October 1, 2001, was amortized on a straight-line basis over 25 to 40 years and is stated net of accumulated amortization of $3,873,464 at September 30, 2001. Management has continued to review the carrying values of goodwill for recoverability using estimated future cash flows (see Recently Issued Accounting Standards, SFAS No. 142, below).        The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 effective October 1, 2001. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and certain other intangible assets are no longer systematically amortized but instead are reviewed for impairment, and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to results of operations. The previous method for determining impairment prescribed by SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, utilized an undiscounted cash flow approach for the initial impairment assessment, while SFAS No. 142 utilizes a fair value approach. The goodwill impairment charge discussed below is the result of the change in the accounting method for determining the impairment of goodwill.        In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company allocated goodwill to each of its reporting units and tested this goodwill for impairment as of the beginning of fiscal 2002. The Company completed the transitional goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result, an impairment charge of $6.4 million ($4.7 million after tax, or $1.01 per diluted share) was recorded related to goodwill at certain Business Imaging and Paint Sundry reporting units. The fair value of the reporting units was estimated using a combination of valuation techniques, including the expected present value of future cash flows and prices of comparable businesses.                                           21  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES-CONTINUED        The charges have been recorded as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the amount of $6.4 million ($4.7 million after tax, or $1.01 per diluted share) as of October 1, 2001, in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.        Financial Statements are attached as an Appendix to this report. The index to the financial statements is found on F-1 of the Appendix. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain additional information on the Company's accounting policies.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS        SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", became effective for the Company October 1, 2001 as discussed earlier. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and certain other intangible assets are no longer systematically amortized but instead are reviewed for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to results of operations. In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company completed the transitional goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result, an impairment charge of $6.4 million ($4.7 million after tax) was recorded related to goodwill at certain Business Imaging and Paint Sundry reporting units. The fair value of the reporting units was estimated using a combination of valuation techniques including the expected present value of future cash flows and prices of comparable businesses.      SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which was issued by the FASB in August 2001, is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of." SFAS 144 provides a single method of accounting for long-lived assets to be disposed of and retains requirements found in SFAS 121 with regard to the impairment of long-lived assets. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the provisions of SFAS 144.      SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit of Disposal Activities", which was issued by the FASB in July 2002, requiring companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS No. 146 supercedes EITF Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Cost Incurred in a Restructuring)". Statement SFAS No. 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. Management does not believe that adoption of SFAS No. 146 will have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.                                          22  ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK        Interest Rate Risk- In August 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract as a hedge under which the interest rate on its term debt under the credit facility is fixed at 5.87%, plus a profit spread for the lender (see Note 6 to the Company's Financial Statements). At September 30, 2002 and 2001, prevailing market interest rates were lower than the fixed rate in the Company's swap agreement, and the Company would have paid a premium of $65,941 and $124,713, respectively, to its lender if the swap were to have been terminated and paid at those times. Prior to entering into the swap agreement, management had reviewed the 40-year history of interest rates and had determined that the Company's risk of liability resulting from a material decline in interest rates over the life of the swap below the fixed level under the swap was not significant.        Foreign Currency Exchange Risk- The Company had no transactions in foreign currencies, nor had it entered into any foreign currency futures contracts as of September 30, 2002.        Commodity Price Risk- The Company had not entered into any forward buying agreements for the raw materials it uses to produce its goods and services as of September 30, 2002. An assessment of the risks of short-term commodity price fluctuations is set forth in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the caption "Raw Materials and Suppliers".        Other Relevant Market Risks- The Company does not own any marketable securities, and management is not aware of any other relevant market risks.  ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
