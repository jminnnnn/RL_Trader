ITEM 7  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Forward Looking Statements          Managements discussion of the Companys fiscal 2007 results in comparison to fiscal 2006 contains forward-looking statements regarding current expectations, risks and uncertainties for future periods. The actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein due to a variety of factors such as changes in customer demand for its products, cancellation of production agreements by significant customers including two Contract Manufacturing customers it depends upon for a significant portion of its business, material increases in the cost of base paper stock, competition in the Companys product areas, an inability of management to successfully reduce operating expenses including labor and waste costs in relation to net sales without damaging the long-term direction of the Company, the Companys ability to increase sales and earnings as a result of new projects, the Companys ability to successfully install new equipment on a timely basis, the Companys ability to produce new products, the Companys ability to continue to improve profitability, the Companys ability to successfully attract new customers, the effects of the economy in general and the Companys ability to improve the run rates for its products. Therefore, the selected financial data for the periods presented may not be indicative of the Companys future financial condition or results of operations.

      Net Sales  for fiscal 2007 increased $19.4 million, primarily due to a $21.5 million (29%) increase in the Contract Manufacturing segment partially offset by $2.1 million (8%) decrease in the Business Imaging paper products segment. The increase in Contract Manufacturing related primarily to new wipes converting contracts that were not in production during fiscal 2006. The Business Imaging segment sales decrease was primarily due to decreased sales to several of its Hamco brand distributorships, as well as several of its larger retail customers. This segment continues to experience strong price competition from numerous suppliers in point of sale and wide format goods creating negative impacts on sales volume.        The Company depends on two Contract Manufacturing customers for a significant portion of its business. One customer accounted for 30% of the Companys total sales in fiscal 2007, compared to 45% in fiscal 2006. The second customer accounted for 41% of the Companys total sales in fiscal 2007, compared to 17% in fiscal 2006.         Gross profit  increased $1.1 million (21%) and gross profit percentage remained unchanged at 5% compared to 2006. The margin in the Contract Manufacturing segment remained constant at 4% in 2007 compared to 4% in 2006 on a gross profit increase of $1.7 million. The increase in gross profit was due to an increase in toll revenue of $5.6 million, offset by increases in labor of $2.1 million and overhead of $1.6 million. Toll revenue is revenue which does not include a pass through of material costs. The Business Imaging segment experienced a decrease of $0.6 million in gross profit and a decrease in margin to 7% from 9% in 2006. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in sales volume and strong price competition.         Selling, general and administrative expenses  increased $80,000 in fiscal 2007 when compared to the same period in fiscal 2006.         Interest expense  increased $0.2 million in 2007 from 2006 due to higher average debt outstanding as a result of the Company borrowing from its revolving credit line to fund a portion of its increased working capital and equipment needs         Income taxes  increased $0.3 million as a result of increased profits.         Basic and diluted net earnings per share  were $0.22 for 2007 compared to $0.12 for 2006.   15            Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2006 Compared to September 30, 2005           Net Sales  for fiscal 2006 increased $20.5 million due primarily to a $18.9 million (34%) increase in the Contract Manufacturing segment and a $1.6 million (7%) increase in the Business Imaging paper products segment. The increase in Contract Manufacturing related primarily to a new wipes converting contract that began production in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The Business Imaging segment sales increase was primarily due to increased sales to several of its Hamco brand distributorships, as well as several of its larger retail customers. This segment experienced strong competition from numerous suppliers in point of sale and wide format goods creating negative impacts on sales volume.         Gross profit  decreased $0.3 million (5%) and gross profit percentage decreased to 5% from 7% in 2005. The margin in the Contract Manufacturing segment decreased to 4% in 2006 compared to 6% in 2005 on a gross profit decrease of $0.8 million. The decline in gross profit was primarily due to higher than expected direct labor and material cost related to the start-up of the new wipes converting contract mentioned above. The Business Imaging segment experienced an increase of $0.5 million in gross profit and an increase in margin to 9% from 8% in 2005. This increase was primarily related to some stabilization in raw material prices compared to 2005 and improved success in passing along raw material cost increases to customers during the year.         Selling, general and administrative expenses  decreased $0.6 million in 2006 from 2005 due to reductions in legal and audit of $0.3 million, depreciation of $0.1 million and bad debt expense of $0.2 million.         (Gain) loss on asset sales  was zero in 2006 and a gain of $0.4 million in 2005. In 2004, the Company reached an agreement to sell its LA-2 thermal laminating asset, with an expected gain of $0.4 million. The sale was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.         Interest expense  increased $0.2 million in 2006 from 2005 due to higher average debt outstanding as a result of the Company borrowing from its revolving credit line to fund a portion of its increased working capital and equipment needs, as well as an overall increase in the interest charged on outstanding borrowing.         Income taxes  decreased $0.2 million as a result of decreased profits. The effective tax rate was reduced to 31.1% following completion of IRS audits for fiscal years 2003 and 2004.         Basic and diluted net earnings per share  were $0.12 for 2006 compared to $0.15 for 2005.   16            Selected Quarterly Financial Data          The following table sets forth selected quarterly financial information.

The Contract Manufacturing segment sales were up $7.1 million or 32% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 when compared to the same period last year as a result of new wipes converting contracts that were not in production during fiscal 2006. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, Business Imaging segment sales were down $0.3 million (4%) when compared to the same quarter of fiscal year 2006, primarily due to decreased sales to several retail customers.    17              Liquidity and Capital Resources          Cash flows provided by (used in) operations were $2.8 million for fiscal 2007, ($0.7) million for fiscal 2006 and $2.5 million in 2005. Inventories increased $2.2 million in 2007, primarily related to an inventory build-up associated with a new product launch. Accounts receivable increased $0.2 million in 2007 resulting from increased sales compared to 2006. Accounts payable increased $2.2 million in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the increase in materials purchased. The Companys working capital position for the years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 was $19.9 and $19.4 million, respectively, as a result of the change in components discussed above.        During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its thermal bond laminator for $475,000. In connection with such agreement, the Company received a $95,000 non-refundable deposit. The sale was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Consistent with accounting principles for revenue recognition, the Company accounted for and reported a gain of approximately $414,000 from this sale when it was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.        Cash used in investing activities was $2.1 million in 2007. Contract Manufacturing spent approximately $1.7 million on capital expenditures primarily related to the purchase of automation equipment to support two new wipe converting lines installed in fiscal 2006. The two new wipe converting lines were financed through cash flow generated by operating activities, short term borrowing from the Companys line of credit, and a $575,000 long-term note with a specific customer. Other equipment was purchased throughout the year to support ongoing operations. In Business Imaging, the amount spent on capital expenditures was $46,000. Cash used in investing activities was $5.2 million in 2006 and $0.9 million in 2005.        Cash used in financing activities was $0.7 million in 2007, resulting primarily from repayment of outstanding indebtedness. Cash provided by financing activities was $5.9 million in 2006 as a result of the Company borrowing from its revolving credit line to fund a portion of its increased working capital and equipment needs. Cash used in financing activities was $1.6 million in 2005, resulting primarily from repayment of outstanding indebtedness. In March 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved the purchase by the Company of up to 300,000 of its shares of common stock, given that the Companys cash and debt position would enable these purchases without impairment to the Companys capital. On December 16, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors extended the plan through June 30, 2006. A total of 49,100 shares were purchased for an aggregate purchase price of $0.3 million from approval of the plan through June 30, 2006, at which time the plan expired.        The Companys primary need for capital resources is to finance inventories, accounts receivable, and capital expenditures. At September 30, 2007, cash recorded on the balance sheet was $6,663.        The Contract Manufacturing segments sales are made pursuant to project-specific purchase orders as well as contract service agreements with multi-year terms. Sales under such contract service agreements are typically derived from customer directed purchase orders based on unit volume projections supplied by the customers and demand generated by the customers consumer bases. In fiscal 2004, the Company announced it had signed significant contracts with new and existing customers for both printing and Contract Manufacturing. One of these customers, a multinational consumer products company, accounted for 51% of total sales in fiscal 2005, 45% in fiscal 2006, and 30% in fiscal 2007. The contracts with this customer expire on June 30, 2008. The Company is currently negotiating a three-year extension to these contracts. In fiscal 2006, the Company started up two new production lines producing over 50 SKUs under a new contract. This was the single largest and most complex start-up ever undertaken by Tufco. This customer accounted for approximately 5% of total sales in fiscal 2005, 17% in fiscal 2006, and 41% in fiscal 2007. However, because the Companys contract revenue agreements described above generally do not have minimum purchase requirements, the revenues attributable to the contracts are subject to normal business fluctuations.        On May 20, 2004, the Company signed a new credit agreement. The credit agreement, as amended on February 9, 2007 and August 14, 2007, includes a $14.0 million revolving line of credit facility as well as a $1.0 million swing line available for overdrafts and expires on May 18, 2009. Borrowings under the line of credit are made under the base rate account or the Eurodollar account. Interest on amounts borrowed under the base rate account is calculated based on the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 1/2 of 1% or the Prime Rate on the date of the borrowing. Interest on amounts borrowed under the Eurodollar account is calculated based on LIBOR. As of September 30, 2007, the Company had $0.5 million outstanding under the base rate account at a rate of 7.75%, $3.5 million outstanding   18            Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)    under one Eurodollar account at a rate of 7.30% and $2.0 million outstanding under a second Eurodollar account at a rate of 7.00%. The credit agreement also includes a commitment to issue commercial and standby letters of credit not to exceed $1.0 million. The Company had no amounts outstanding under the letter of credit commitment as of September 30, 2007. The Company has $9.0 million available under the line of credit as of September 30, 2007 The credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including requirements to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, after tax net income and restrictions on maximum allowable debt, stock purchases, mergers, and payment of dividends. At September 30, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the credit agreement. On December 18, 2007, the Company had approximately $10.0 million available under its revolving credit line.         Consistent with the sales concentration previously discussed, amounts due from two multinational consumer products customers represent 70% and 69% of total accounts receivable at September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.        Management believes that the Companys operating cash flow, together with amounts available under its credit agreement, are adequate to service the Companys long-term obligations as of September 30, 2007 and any budgeted capital expenditures.        The Company intends to retain earnings to finance future operations and expansion and does not expect to pay any dividends within the foreseeable future. In addition, pursuant to the credit agreement, the Companys primary lenders must approve the payment of any dividends over $2.0 million.   Inflation          In fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, the impact of inflation was minimal on the Companys inventory and net income. Management believes that the Company is generally successful in eventually passing these fluctuations in raw material prices to its customers through increases or decreases in the selling price of the Companys products, although the timing of selling price increases may lag behind cost increases. Prior to these periods, the impact of inflation has been minimal on the Companys inventory and net income.   Credit Environment          In fiscal year 2007, the credit markets were volatile and have experienced a shortage in overall liquidity due to the instability in the sub-prime lending industry. The Company does not engage in any business activities in the mortgage industry. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity under its credit agreement at variable interest rates and from cash provided by operations. Sales are concentrated in the consumer staples markets, which are generally considered more stable during uncertain times. However, if these customers reduce their spending as a result of the difficulties in the credit markets, it is possible revenues could decline.   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements          The Company has no Off Balance Sheet Arrangements (as defined in Item 303 (a)(4) of Regulation S-K).   19            Contractual Obligation Data          The following table sets forth obligations and commitments to make future payments of debt, operating lease agreements, and future payments under purchase contracts:                                                                                                                             Payments Due By Period                                    Less                                                 More                                    Than 1         2-3         4-5         Than                Total         Year         Years         Years         5 Years            Long Term Debt Obligations(1)         $    6,191,666                                 $    6,191,666                                                                                                                                                            Capital Lease Obligations and Other Long Term Liabilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                Operating Leases              4,053,234                   1,306,764                   2,120,849                   514,468                   111,153                                                                                                                      Unconditional Purchase Obligations (2)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Total Contractual Cash Obligations         $    10,244,900              $    1,306,764              $    8,312,515              $    514,468              $    111,153                                                     (1)         Based on the rates and the current amount of debt outstanding at December 18, 2007 cash payments for interest on long-term debt would be approximately $0.6 million for 2008 and 2009.           (2)         As of December 18, 2007 the Company had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately $0.1 million relating to normal capital requirements.        Critical Accounting Policies          Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies, practices and estimates as described below. We believe the reported financial disclosures are reliable and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations for the Company.        Financial statement preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. Actual amounts could differ from the amounts estimated. Differences from those estimates are recognized in the period they become known.        Revenue Recognition- The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and there is evidence of an agreement and collectability of consideration to be received is reasonably assured, all of which generally occur at the time of shipment. Sales are recorded net of sales returns and allowances. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as revenue and costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales. Amounts related to raw materials provided by customers are excluded from revenue and cost of sales.   20            Critical Accounting Policies (Continued)          Accounts Receivable- Management estimates allowances for collectability related to its accounts receivable balances. These allowances are based on the customer relationships, the aging and turns of accounts receivable, credit worthiness of customers, credit concentrations and payment history. Managements estimates include providing for 100 percent of specific customer balances when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectable. Management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age, applying historical trend rates to the most recent 12 months sales, less actual write-offs to date. Although management monitors collections and credit worthiness, the inability of a particular customer to pay its debts could impact collectability of receivables and could have an impact on future revenues if the customer is unable to arrange other financing. Management does not believe these conditions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the collectability of its receivables or future revenues.        Management estimates sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits, and applies these trend rates to the most recent 12 months sales data to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions.        Inventories- Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation. The Company estimates reserves for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization. A large portion of the Companys inventory is saleable to multiple customers and a portion of the inventory is manufactured to specifications provided by original equipment manufacturers and is not subject to rapid technological change.        Goodwill- Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. In order to calculate goodwill, management applies judgment in determining the reporting units, which represent distinct parts of the business. The annual goodwill impairment analysis involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying amount. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment loss. Calculating the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant estimates and long-term assumptions. Any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects, or any changes in market conditions, interest rates or other externalities, could result in an impairment charge. Management has continued to review the carrying values of goodwill for recoverability based on fair market value estimated using estimated future cash flows and prices of comparable companies in accordance with SFAS No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . The fair value of the reporting units was estimated using a combination of valuation techniques, including the expected present value of future cash flows and prices of comparable businesses.        In accordance with SFAS No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment for Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,  the Company evaluates the recoverability of the recorded amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value using discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques.        Additional information on the Companys accounting policies is set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report as referenced to the Appendix to this Report.   Recently Issued Accounting Standards          In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,  The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. Under SFAS No. 159, a business entity is required to report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings (or another performance indicator if the business entity does not report earnings) at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities.   21            Recently Issued Accounting Standards (Continued)    SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company has not yet evaluated the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on its consolidated financial statements.         In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB No. 108), Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements. SAB No. 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB No. 108 requires an entity to evaluate misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The requirements of SAB No. 108 are effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The Company has determined that the adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.        In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting For Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This Interpretation requires that the Company recognize in its financial statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The accounting provisions of FIN 48 will be effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2007, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on its consolidated financial statements.        In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. SFAS No. 157 is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2008, with early adoption permitted. The Company has not yet evaluated the effect, if any ,  the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on its consolidated financial statements.        In November 2007, the SEC issued SAB No. 109 to express its views on the identification and measurement of a derivative in written loan commitments. SAB No. 109 is based on the guidance in SAB No. 105, Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments, which refers to several pronouncements on derivatives and the fair value of other financial instruments. SAB No. 109 is effective for all derivative loan commitments issued or modified in fiscal quarters beginning after December 15, 2007. The Company has not yet evaluated the effect, if any, the adoption of SAB No. 109 will have on its consolidated financial statements.        In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) revised the requirements of SFAS No. 141 related to fair value principles, the cost allocation process and together with other revisions from past practice. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company has not yet evaluated the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on its consolidated financial statements.        In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 amends ARB 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, and requires all entities to report noncontrolling (minority) interests in subsidiaries within equity in the consolidated financial statements, but separate from the parent shareholders equity. SFAS No. 160 also requires any acquisitions or dispositions of noncontrolling interests that do not result in a change of control to be accounted for as equity transactions. Further, SFAS No. 160 requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company has not yet evaluated the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on its consolidated financial statements.   22             ITEM 7A  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK          Because of the level of variable interest rate debt in the Companys capital structure, the Company is exposed to earnings or cash flow fluctuations due to changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2007, the Company had $6.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 7.24%. This debt exposes the Company to changes in interest expense brought about by changes in interest rates. If the weighted average interest rate were to increase by 10.0% for fiscal 2007, the impact on net income would be immaterial.         Foreign Currency Exchange Risk -The Company has not entered into any foreign currency futures contracts as of September 30, 2007. The Company does enter into transactions denominated in foreign currency for inventory purchases as required by a specific customer. The foreign currency fluctuations are either credited back to or paid by the customer, the impact of which was not significant to the consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2007.         Commodity Price Risk -The Company had not entered into any forward buying agreements for the raw materials it uses to produce its goods and services as of September 30, 2007. An assessment of the risks of short-term commodity price fluctuations is set forth in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the caption Raw Materials and Suppliers. Under contracts at Green Bay, most material cost price changes are passed on to customers.         Other Relevant Market Risks- The Company does not own any marketable securities, and management is not aware of any other relevant market risks.
