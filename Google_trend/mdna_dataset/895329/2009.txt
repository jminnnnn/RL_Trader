ITEM 7   MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Forward Looking Statements          Managements discussion of the Companys fiscal 2009 results in comparison to fiscal 2008 contains forward-looking statements regarding current expectations, risks and uncertainties for future periods. The actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein due to a variety of factors such as its ability to increase sales and earnings in fiscal year 2010 and achieve profitability in fiscal year 2010, changes in customer demand for its products, cancellation of production agreements by significant customers including two Contract Manufacturing customers it depends upon for a significant portion of its business, its ability to meet competitors prices on products to be sold under these production agreements, the effects of the economy in general, including the current economic decline, the Companys ability to refinance or replace its line of credit, which expires in May 2010, the Companys inability to benefit from any general economic improvements, material increases in the cost of raw materials, competition in the Companys product areas, an inability of management to successfully reduce operating expenses including labor and waste costs in relation to net sales, the Companys ability to increase sales and earnings as a result of new projects, including its new canister line, the Companys ability to successfully install new equipment on a timely basis, the Companys ability to continue to produce new products, the Companys ability to return to profitability and then continue to improve profitability, the Companys ability to successfully attract new customers through its sales initiatives and the Companys ability to improve the run rates for its products. Therefore, the financial data for the periods presented may not be indicative of the Companys future financial condition or results of operations.   9             General          Tufco is a leader in providing diversified contract wet and dry wipes converting and printing, as well as specialty printing services and business imaging products. The Companys business strategy is to continue to place our converting at the leading edge of existing and emerging growth opportunities.

Results of Operations          The following discussion relates to the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 (current year or fiscal 2009) in comparison to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 (prior year or fiscal 2008).        The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years ended September 30, (i) the percentage relationship of certain items from the Companys statements of operations to net sales, and (ii) the year-to-year changes in these items:                                                                                     Percentage of         Year-to-Year                Net Sales         Percentage Change                2009         2008         2009 to 2008         Net sales              100.0    %              100.0    %              (22    %)      Cost of sales              95.6                   94.3                   (21    )                                                                         Gross profit              4.4                   5.7                   (40    )                                                                         Selling, general and administrative expenses              5.9                   4.7                   (1    )                                                                                                                                            Operating (loss) income              (1.5    )              1.0              NM      Interest expense              (0.1    )              (0.2    )              (58    )      Interest income and other income              0.0                   0.0              NM                                                                         (Loss) income before income taxes              (1.6    )              0.8              NM      Income tax (benefit) expense              (0.6    )              0.3              NM                                                                                                                                            Net (loss) income              (1.0    %)              0.5    %         NM                                                                                                NM = Not Meaningful            The components of net sales and gross profit are summarized in the table below (Dollars in millions):                                                                                                         2009              2008                                         % of                                  % of                     Amount              Total              Amount              Total             Net Sales                                                                                      Contract manufacturing and printing         $    63.9                   74    %         $    86.8                   78    %      Business imaging paper products              22.9                   26                   24.5                   22                                                                              Net sales         $    86.8                   100    %         $    111.3                   100    %                                                                                                                                                                                                     Margin                                  Margin                     Amount              %              Amount              %             Gross Profit                                                                                      Contract manufacturing and printing         $    2.4                   4    %         $    4.7                   5    %      Business imaging paper products              1.4                   6    %              1.6                   7    %                                                                         Gross profit         $    3.8                   4    %         $    6.3                   6    %                                                                           10             Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2009 Compared to September 30, 2008           Net Sales  for fiscal 2009 decreased $24.5 million from net sales for fiscal 2008, due to a $22.9 million (26%) decrease in the Contract Manufacturing segment and a $1.6 million (7%) decrease in the Business Imaging paper products segment. In Contract Manufacturing, the decrease in revenues for fiscal 2009 related primarily to a difficult continuing consumer environment for our customers. While the Company did generate new business during the year, the new business, along with cost reductions and productivity improvements, was not enough to offset the drop in demand. The Company is pursuing many opportunities to grow revenue. For example, the Companys new canister line became operational late in the fourth fiscal quarter. However, there can be no assurance that there will be sustained revenues from the Companys new canister line, that the new line will be profitable, that the general business climate will improve or that the Company would benefit from such improvement. The Business Imaging segment sales decrease was due to the recession and very competitive industry pricing. Both segments were negatively affected by the recession.        The Company depends on two Contract Manufacturing customers for a significant portion of its business. One customer accounted for 35% of the Companys total sales in fiscal 2009, compared to 36% in fiscal 2008. The second customer accounted for 25% of the Companys total sales in fiscal 2009, compared to 32% in fiscal 2008.         Gross profit  decreased $2.5 million (40%) and gross profit percentage decreased to 4% in 2009 compared to 6% in 2008. The margin in the Contract Manufacturing segment decreased to 4% in 2009 compared to 5% in 2008 on a gross profit decrease of $2.3 million. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a substantial decline in demand from our consumer products customers. The Company aggressively sought to cut operating costs with reductions in direct labor and overhead costs as a result of the Companys continuing Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma and cost cutting initiatives and added a number of new wipes customers. As a result of these actions, in the second half of our fiscal year 2009, Contract Manufacturing operating results improved over the first half of fiscal year 2009 operating results. The Business Imaging segment experienced a decrease of $0.2 million in gross profit and a decrease in margin to 6% in 2009 from 7% in 2008. This was primarily due to decreased demand for our customers products and very competitive industry pricing. As the result of expense reductions and the addition of new customers, Business Imaging showed improvements in sales and operating income during the last six months of fiscal year 2009 as compared to the first six months of fiscal year 2009. Both segments were negatively affected by the recession.         Selling, general and administrative expenses  decreased $71,000 in fiscal 2009 when compared to fiscal 2008, consistent with cost reductions in general. Operating expenses were offset by a gain of $37,900, reflecting the gain on the sale of a bag sealer and case packer that was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.         Interest expense  decreased $155,000 in 2009 from 2008 due to lower average debt outstanding and lower interest rates on borrowings.         Income tax (benefit) expense  was $(0.5) million in 2009 compared to $0.3 million in 2008, mainly as a result of decreased profits.         Basic and diluted net (loss) earnings per share  were $(0.20) for 2009 compared to $0.13 for 2008.   Selected Quarterly Financial Data          Not required for a smaller reporting company.   11            Liquidity and Capital Resources          Cash flows provided by operations were $4.4 million for fiscal 2009, and $4.9 million in 2008. Inventories decreased $4.3 million in 2009 as a result of efforts to reduce average inventory levels for major raw material components in relation to decreases in net sales. Accounts receivable decreased $0.7 million in 2009 resulting from decreased sales compared to 2008. Accounts payable decreased $1.5 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to the decrease in materials purchased. Depreciation was $2.4 million for fiscal 2009 and $2.2 million for fiscal 2008. The Companys working capital position for the years ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 was $13.8 and $18.2 million, respectively, as a result of the change in components discussed above.        Cash used in investing activities was $2.2 million in fiscal 2009. Contract Manufacturing spent approximately $2.2 million on capital expenditures throughout the year to support ongoing operational needs and for payments on a canister line that became operational late in the fourth fiscal quarter and associated packaging equipment to support the Companys growth efforts in the expanding, disposable nonwovens wipes market. In Business Imaging, the amount spent on capital expenditures was $35,000.        The Company will purchase for $788,000 in December 2009 one of the presses currently being leased and has given notice to purchase the second press under lease in June 2010, of which the amount is unknown.        Cash used in financing activities was $2.3 million in fiscal 2009 and $3.7 million in fiscal 2008, resulting primarily from the Company paying down its revolving credit line. In February 2008, the Companys Board of Directors approved a program for open market stock repurchases through December 31, 2008 for up to 100,000 shares of its common stock at prevailing market prices after concluding that the Companys cash and debt position would enable these purchases without impairment to the Companys capital. On October 15, 2008, the Companys Board of Directors approved an extension of its February 2008 stock repurchase program through June 30, 2009 and an increase in the number of shares from 100,000 to 200,000. On January 22, 2009, the Companys Board of Directors approved a further extension of its February 2008 stock repurchase program through September 30, 2009 and a increase in the number of shares from 200,000 to 300,000. A total of 226,697 shares were purchased under the plan for an aggregate purchase price of $1,016,000 from approval of the plan through September 30, 2009.        The Companys primary need for capital resources is to finance inventories, accounts receivable, and capital expenditures. At September 30, 2009, cash recorded on the balance sheet was $4,092.        The Contract Manufacturing segments sales are made pursuant to project-specific purchase orders as well as contract service agreements with multi-year terms. Sales under such contract service agreements are typically derived from customer directed purchase orders based on unit volume projections supplied by the customers and demand generated by the customers consumer bases. The Company has contracts for both printing and Contract Manufacturing. One of these contract customers, a multinational consumer products company, accounted for approximately 36% of total sales in fiscal 2008 and 35% of total sales in fiscal 2009. The contract with this customer expires in April 2012. Another multinational consumer products company accounted for approximately 32% of total sales in fiscal 2008 and 25% of total sales in fiscal 2009. The contract with this customer has been extended until June 2013. However, because the Companys contract revenue agreements described above generally do not have minimum purchase requirements, the revenues attributable to the contracts are subject to normal business fluctuations.        The Company replaced its credit agreement on May 13, 2009 with a new $10.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit facility that expires in May 2010. The Company currently intends to extend or replace the agreement prior to its expiration. Borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25%. The Company is required to pay a non-usage fee of .50% per annum on the unused portion of the facility.        Availability under the facility is based upon specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory. The credit agreement is unsecured. If the Company fails to meet a specified funded debt to EBITDA ratio, the Companys lender will have the right to take a security interest in the Companys accounts receivables and inventory.   12            Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)     Borrowings under the previous $15 million unsecured credit agreement were made under the base rate account or the Eurodollar account. Interest on amounts borrowed under the base rate account were calculated based on the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 1/2 of 1% or the Prime Rate on the date of the borrowing. Interest on amounts borrowed under the Eurodollar account were calculated based on LIBOR.         The Company had $8.7 million available under the line of credit as of September 30, 2009. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including requirements to maintain a minimum tangible net worth and after tax net income (or loss within specified levels). At September 30, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the credit agreement. On December 18, 2009, the Company had approximately $7.6 million available and $2.4 million outstanding under its revolving credit line pursuant to its credit agreement.        Consistent with the sales concentration previously discussed, amounts due from two multinational consumer products customers represent 49% and 58% of total accounts receivable at September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.        Management believes that the Companys operating cash flow, together with amounts available under its credit agreement, are adequate to service the Companys current obligations as of September 30, 2009 and any budgeted capital expenditures, including the purchase of the leased presses, assuming the Company meets its business plan.        The Company intends to retain earnings to finance future operations and expansion and does not expect to pay any dividends within the foreseeable future. In addition, pursuant to the credit agreement, the Companys primary lenders must approve the payment of any dividends over $2.0 million.   Inflation          In fiscal years 2009 and 2008, the impact of inflation was minimal on the Companys inventory and net income. Management believes that the Company is generally successful in eventually passing these fluctuations in raw material prices to its customers through increases or decreases in the selling price of the Companys products, although the timing of selling price increases may lag behind cost increases. Prior to these periods, the impact of inflation has been minimal on the Companys inventory and operations.   Credit Environment          The credit markets continue to be volatile and experience liquidity shortages due to the instability in the lending industry and overall downturn in the economy. The Company does not engage in any business activities in the lending industry. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity under its credit agreement at variable interest rates and from cash provided by operations.   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements          The Company has no Off Balance Sheet Arrangements (as defined in Item 303 (a)(4) of Regulation S-K).   13            Critical Accounting Policies          Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies, practices and estimates as described below. We believe the reported financial disclosures are reliable and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations for the Company.        Financial statement preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. Actual amounts could differ from the amounts estimated. Differences from those estimates are recognized in the period they become known.        Revenue Recognition- The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and there is evidence of an agreement and collectability of consideration to be received is reasonably assured, all of which generally occur at the time of shipment. Sales are recorded net of sales returns and allowances. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as revenue and costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales. Amounts related to raw materials provided by customers are excluded from revenue and cost of sales.         Accounts Receivable- Management estimates allowances for collectability related to its accounts receivable balances. These allowances are based on the customer relationships, the aging and turns of accounts receivable, credit worthiness of customers, credit concentrations and payment history. Managements estimates include providing for 100 percent of specific customer balances when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectable. Management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age, applying historical trend rates to the most recent 12 months sales, less actual write-offs to date. Although management monitors collections and credit worthiness, the inability of a particular customer to pay its debts could impact collectability of receivables and could have an impact on future revenues if the customer is unable to arrange other financing. Management does not believe these conditions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the collectability of its receivables or future revenues. Recoveries of accounts receivables previously written off are recorded when received. Credit terms to customers in the Contract Manufacturing segment are generally net 30 days. Credit terms to customers in the Business Imaging segment are generally discounted net 30 terms.        Management estimates sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits, and applies these trend rates to the most recent 12 months sales data to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions.        Inventories- Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation. The Company estimates reserves for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization.        Goodwill- Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Management has continued to review the carrying values of goodwill for recoverability on the annual measurement date of June 30. In order to calculate goodwill, management applies judgment in determining the reporting units, which represent distinct parts of the business. The annual goodwill impairment analysis involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying amount. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment loss. Calculating the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant estimates and long-term assumptions. Any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects, or any changes in market conditions, interest rates or other externalities, could result in an impairment charge. Management has continued to review the carrying values of goodwill for recoverability based on fair market value estimated using estimated future cash flows and prices of comparable companies in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350-10 (formerly SFAS No. 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The fair value of the reporting units was estimated using a combination of valuation techniques, including the expected present value of future cash flows and prices of comparable businesses. In the event that valuation multiples decline, discount rates increase, or the projected cash flows of the individual reporting units decline, the Company may be required to proceed through an analysis of impairment as provided in ASC 350-10. For example, an increase to the discount rate due to changes in risk premiums or other factors may suggest that an impairment has occurred under Step 1 of ASC 350-10 and require the Company to proceed to Step 2 of ASC 350-10 to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities of the reporting units. The current discount rate would need to increase 3.7% for Contract Manufacturing   14            Critical Accounting Policies (Continued)     and increase 5.6% for Business Imaging before the Company would be required to proceed to Step 2 of ASC 350-10. The Company recognizes that its common stock regularly trades below book value per share and will continue to monitor the relationship of its market capitalization to both its book value and tangible book value. While management is seeking to return the Companys business fundamentals to levels that support the book value per share, there is no assurance that it will be successful in doing so, or that the market price of the common stock will increase to such levels in the foreseeable future.         In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment for Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Company evaluates the recoverability of the recorded amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell. The Company determines fair value using discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques.         Additional information on the Companys accounting policies is set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report as referenced to the Appendix to this Report.   Recently Issued Accounting Standards          In May 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 855-10  Subsequent Events . ASC 855-10 establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. Specifically, this standard sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The Company has adopted this standard during the fiscal period ended September 30, 2009 and has evaluated any subsequent events through December 29, 2009. During the period subsequent to September 30, 2009, the Company did not have any material recognizable subsequent events.
