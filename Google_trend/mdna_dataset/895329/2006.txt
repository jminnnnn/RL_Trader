ITEM 7  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Forward Looking Statements          Managements discussion of the Companys fiscal 2006 results in comparison to fiscal 2005 contains forward-looking statements regarding current expectations, risks and uncertainties for future periods. The actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein due to a variety of factors such as changes in customer demand for its products, cancellation of production agreements by significant customers, material increases in the cost of base paper stock, competition in the Companys product areas, an inability of management to successfully reduce operating expenses including labor and waste costs in relation to net sales without damaging the long-term direction of the Company, the Companys ability to increase sales and earnings as a result of new projects, the Companys ability to successfully install new equipment on a timely basis, the Companys ability to produce new products, the Companys ability to continue to improve profitability, and the Companys ability to improve the run rates for its products. Therefore, the selected financial data for the periods presented may not be indicative of the Companys future financial condition or results of operations.

due primarily to a $18.9 million (34%) increase in the Contract Manufacturing segment and a $1.6 million (7%) increase in the Business Imaging paper products segment. The increase in Contract Manufacturing related primarily to a new wipes converting contract that began production in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The Business Imaging segment sales increase was primarily due to increased sales to several of its Hamco brand distributorships, as well as several of its larger retail customers. This segment continues to experience strong competition from numerous suppliers in point of sale and wide format goods creating negative impacts on sales volume.         Gross profit  decreased $0.3 million (5%) and gross profit percentage decreased to 5% from 7% in 2005. The margin in the Contract Manufacturing segment decreased to 4% in 2006 compared to 6% in 2005 on a gross profit decrease of $0.8 million. The decline in gross profit was primarily due to higher than expected direct labor and material cost related to the start-up of the new wipes converting contract mentioned above. The Company currently has programs in place that it believes will lead to lower labor and material waste costs, but cannot assure that it will be successful in the implementation of these programs. The Business Imaging segment experienced an increase of $0.5 million in gross profit and an increase in margin to 9% from 8% in 2005. This increase was primarily related to some stabilization in raw material prices compared to 2005 and improved success in passing along raw material cost increases to customers during the year.         Selling, general and administrative expenses  decreased $0.6 million in 2006 from 2005 due to reductions in legal and audit of $0.3 million, depreciation of $0.1 million and bad debt expense of $0.2 million.         (Gain) loss on asset sales  was zero in 2006 and a gain of $0.4 million in 2005. In 2004, the Company reached an agreement to sell its LA-2 thermal laminating asset, with an expected gain of $0.4 million. The sale was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.         Interest expense  increased $0.2 million in 2006 from 2005 due to higher average debt outstanding as a result of the Company borrowing from its revolving credit line to fund a portion of its increased working capital and equipment needs, as well as an overall increase in the interest charged on outstanding borrowing.         Income taxes  decreased $0.2 million as a result of decreased profits. The effective tax rate was reduced to 31.1% following completion of IRS audits for fiscal years 2003 and 2004.         Basic and diluted net earnings per share  were $0.12 for 2006 compared to $0.15 for 2005.   15         Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2005 Compared to September 30, 2004           Net Sales  for fiscal 2005 increased $1.9 million due primarily to a $1.5 million (3%) increase in the Contract Manufacturing segment and a $0.4 million (2%) increase in the Business Imaging paper products segment. The increase in Contract Manufacturing related primarily to the utilization of wet and dry production lines for the entire year which started up in late fiscal 2004. These increases were partially offset by reduction in demand for certain dry wipe product lines. These increases were further offset by revenues lost through the sale of the Companys LA-2 thermal laminating asset, which generated $2.5 million in fiscal 2004. In 2005, the Company completed the transition to being the primary provider of raw materials for its customers. Raw materials are passed through in customer prices. Material costs in revenues for fiscal 2005 were $2.2 million higher than 2004.        The Business Imaging segment sales increase was primarily due to increased sales to several of its Hamco brand distributorships, as well as several of its retail customers. This segment continues to experience strong competition from numerous suppliers in point of sale and wide format goods creating negative impacts on sales volume.         Gross profit  decreased $2.4 million (31%) and gross profit percentage decreased to 6.7% from 9.9% in 2004. The margin in the Contract Manufacturing segment decreased to 6% in 2005 compared to 9% in 2004 on a gross profit decrease of $1.7 million. The decline in gross profit was primarily due to lower non-material revenues of $2.9 million compared to 2004. The Business Imaging segment experienced a decrease of $0.7 million in gross profit and a decrease in margin to 8% from 11% in 2004. This decrease was primarily related to increased raw material costs and the inability to quickly pass along these increases due to price competition from numerous suppliers in the segments major product lines.         Selling, general and administrative expenses  decreased $0.4 million in 2005 from 2004. Reductions in salaries of $237,000 and depreciation of $327,000 were offset by an increase in employee benefits of $102,000.         (Gain) loss on asset sales  was a gain of $0.4 million in 2005 and not material in 2004. In 2004, the Company reached an agreement to sell its LA-2 thermal laminating asset, with an expected gain of $0.4 million. The sale was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.         Interest expense  remained relatively unchanged in fiscal 2005 as a result of lower average debt outstanding.         Income taxes  decreased $0.6 million as a result of decreased profits. The effective tax rate was 39% in 2005 compared to 41% in 2004. The decreased rate relates to a change in the federal and state tax bracket more in line with the Companys earnings level.         Gain (loss) from sale of discontinued operations  net of tax was zero in 2005 and a gain of $0.4 million in 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company changed its estimate of income taxes payable in relationship to its sale of the Paint Sundries segment in 2003. That change was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 when the tax return was filed.         Basic and diluted net earnings per share  were $0.15 for 2005 compared to $0.43 for 2004.   16         Selected Quarterly Financial Data          The following table sets forth selected quarterly financial information.

The Contract Manufacturing segment sales were up $8.7 million or 66% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 when compared to the same period last year as a result of a new wipes converting contract that began production in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, Business Imaging segment sales were down $0.2 million (3%) when compared to the same quarter of fiscal year 2005, primarily due to decreased sales to several retail customers.   17         Liquidity and Capital Resources          Cash flows (used in) provided by continuing operations were ($0.7) million for fiscal 2006, $2.5 million in 2005 and ($0.8) million in 2004. Inventories increased $4.0 million in 2006, representing inventory builds primarily related to the support of increased wet wipes business that began during the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Accounts receivable increased $5.3 million in 2006 resulting from increased sales compared to 2005. Accounts payable increased $5.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in materials and equipment purchased. The Companys working capital position for the years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 was $19.4 million and $15.4 million, respectively, as a result of the change in components discussed above.        During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its thermal bond laminator for $475,000. In connection with such agreement, the Company received a $95,000 non-refundable deposit. The sale was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Consistent with accounting principles for revenue recognition, the Company accounted for and reported a gain of approximately $414,000 from this sale when it was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.        Cash used in investing activities was $5.2 million in 2006. Contract Manufacturing spent approximately $5.1 million on capital expenditures primarily related to the purchase of two new wipe converting lines to support its growth in the expanding disposable nonwovens wipes market. The two new wipe converting lines were financed through cash flow generated by operating activities, short term borrowing from the Companys line of credit, and a $575,000 long-term note with a specific customer. Other equipment was purchased throughout the year to support ongoing operations. In Business Imaging, the amount spent on capital expenditures was $0.1 million. Cash used in investing activities was $0.9 million in 2005 and in 2004 was $4.2 million as the Company completed its $3.6 million capital equipment expansion program announced by the Company on December 4, 2003.        Cash provided by financing activities was $5.9 million in 2006 as a result of the Company borrowing from its revolving credit line to fund a portion of its increased working capital and equipment needs. Cash used in financing activities was $1.6 million in 2005, resulting primarily from repayment of outstanding indebtedness. Cash provided by financing activities was $1.7 million in 2004 as a result of the Company borrowing from its revolving credit line to fund a portion of its increased working capital needs. In March 2003, the Companys Board of Directors approved the purchase by the Company of up to 100,000 of its shares of common stock after concluding that the cash and debt position would enable these purchases without impairment to the Companys capital. The purchase plan began in April 2003, and expired in January 2004. During that period, the Company purchased 45,500 shares of its common stock on the open market for an aggregate of $0.3 million pursuant to the purchase plan. In March 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved the purchase by the Company of up to 300,000 of its shares of common stock, and on December 16, 2005, the Board extended the plan through June 30, 2006. A total of 49,100 shares were purchased for an aggregate purchase price of $0.3 million from approval of the plan through June 30, 2006, at which time the plan expired.        The Companys primary need for capital resources is to finance inventories, accounts receivable, and capital expenditures. At September 30, 2006, cash recorded on the balance sheet was $5,267.        The Contract Manufacturing segments sales are made pursuant to project-specific purchase orders as well as contract service agreements with multi-year terms. Sales under such contract service agreements are typically derived from customer directed purchase orders based on unit volume projections supplied by the customers and demand generated by the customers consumer bases. In fiscal 2004, the Company announced it had signed significant contracts with new and existing customers for both printing and contract manufacturing. One of these customers, a multinational consumer products company, accounted for 41% of total sales in fiscal 2004, 51% of the total sales in fiscal 2005 and 45% of total sales in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2006, the Company started up two new production lines producing over 50 SKUs under a new contract. This was the single largest and most complex start-up ever undertaken by Tufco. This customer accounted for approximately 5% of total sales in fiscal 2005 and 17% in fiscal 2006. However, because the Companys contract revenue agreements described above generally do not have minimum purchase requirements, the revenues attributable to the new contracts are subject to normal business fluctuations.   18         Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)          On May 20, 2004, the Company signed a new credit agreement. The credit agreement includes a $9.0 million revolving line of credit facility as well as a $1.0 million swing line available for overdrafts. The agreement as amended on June 20, 2006, expires on May 18, 2008. Borrowings under the line of credit are made under the base rate account or the Eurodollar account. Interest on amounts borrowed under the base rate account is calculated based on the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 1/2 of 1% or the Prime Rate on the date of the borrowing. Interest on amounts borrowed under the Eurodollar account is calculated based on LIBOR. As of September 30, 2006, the Company had $3.2 million outstanding under the base rate account and $3.5 million outstanding under the Eurodollar account at a rate of 8.25% and 6.83%, respectively. The credit agreement also includes a commitment to issue commercial and standby letters of credit not to exceed $1.0 million. The Company had no amounts outstanding under the letter of credit commitment as of September 30, 2006. The Company has $3.3 million available under the line of credit as of September 30, 2006. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including requirements to maintain a minimum tangible net worth and restrictions on maximum allowable debt, stock purchases, mergers, and payment of dividends. At September 30, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants under the credit agreement. On December 18, 2006, the Company had approximately $4.1 million available under its revolving credit line.        Consistent with the sales concentration previously discussed, amounts due from two multinational consumer products customers represent 69% and 48% of total accounts receivable at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.        Management believes that the Companys operating cash flow, together with amounts available under its credit agreement, are adequate to service the Companys long-term obligations as of September 30, 2006 and any budgeted capital expenditures.        On May 6, 2004, the Company redeemed $0.75 million of outstanding Industrial Development Revenue Bonds with the Village of Ashwaubenon. These bonds paid variable rates of interest.        The Company intends to retain earnings to finance future operations and expansion and does not expect to pay any dividends within the foreseeable future. In addition, pursuant to the credit agreement, the Companys primary lenders must approve the payment of any dividends over $2.0 million.        Sharp increases or decreases in the costs of key commodities, such as paper or polyethylene, could periodically impact the Companys inventory values and net income. In fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, the impact of inflation was minimal on the Companys inventory and net income. Management believes that the Company is generally successful in eventually passing these fluctuations in raw material prices to its customers through increases or decreases in the selling price of the Companys products, although the timing of selling price increases may lag behind cost increases. Prior to these periods, the impact of inflation has been minimal on the Companys inventory and net income.   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements          The Company has no Off Balance Sheet Arrangements (as defined in Item 303 (a)(4) of Regulation S-K).   19         Contractual Obligation Data          The following table sets forth obligations and commitments to make future payments of debt, operating lease agreements, and future payments under purchase contracts:                                                                                                                             Payments Due By Period                                    Less                                                 More                                    Than 1         2-3         4-5         Than                Total         Year         Years         Years         5 Years         Long Term Debt (1)              7,073,011                                      7,073,011                                                                                                                                                            Capital Lease Obligations and Other Long Term Liabilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                Operating Leases              5,160,054                   1,304,566                   2,477,132                   1,039,349                   339,007                                                                                                                      Unconditional Purchase Obligations (2)              154,206                   154,206                                                                                                                                                                                                Total Contractual Cash Obligations              12,387,271                   1,458,772                   9,550,143                   1,039,349                   339,007                                                        (1)         Based on the rates and the current amount of debt outstanding at September 30, 2006, cash payments for interest on long-term debt would be approximately $455,356 for 2007 and 2008.           (2)         As of December 18, 2006 the Company had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately $0.4 million relating to the automation of the two new wipe converting lines which were purchased to support the Companys growth in the expanding disposable nonwovens wipes market.        Critical Accounting Policies          Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies, practices and estimates as described below. We believe the reported financial disclosures are reliable and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations for the Company.        Financial statement preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. Actual amounts could differ from the amounts estimated. Differences from those estimates are recognized in the period they become known.        Revenue Recognition- The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and there is evidence of an agreement and collectability of consideration to be received is reasonably assured, all of which generally occur at the time of shipment. Sales are recorded net of sales returns and allowances. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as revenue and costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales. Amounts related to raw materials provided by customers are excluded from revenue and cost of sales.   20         Critical Accounting Policies (Continued)          Accounts Receivable- Management estimates allowances for collectability related to its accounts receivable balances. These allowances are based on the customer relationships, the aging and turns of accounts receivable, credit worthiness of customers, credit concentrations and payment history. Managements estimates include providing for 100 percent of specific customer balances when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectable. Management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age, applying historical trend rates to the most recent 12 months sales, less actual write-offs to date. Although management monitors collections and credit worthiness, the inability of a particular customer to pay its debts could impact collectability of receivables and could have an impact on future revenues if the customer is unable to arrange other financing. Management does not believe these conditions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the collectability of its receivables or future revenues.        Management estimates sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits, and applies these trend rates to the most recent 12 months sales data to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions.        Inventories- Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation. The Company estimates reserves for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization. A large portion of the Companys inventory is saleable to multiple customers and a portion of the inventory is manufactured to specifications provided by original equipment manufacturers and is not subject to rapid technological change.        Goodwill- Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. In order to calculate goodwill, management applies judgment in determining the reporting units, which represent distinct parts of the business. The annual goodwill impairment analysis involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying amount. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment loss. Calculating the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant estimates and long-term assumptions. Any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects, or any changes in market conditions, interest rates or other externalities, could result in an impairment charge. Management has continued to review the carrying values of goodwill for recoverability based on fair market value estimated using estimated future cash flows and prices of comparable companies in accordance with SFAS No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . The fair value of the reporting units was estimated using a combination of valuation techniques, including the expected present value of future cash flows and prices of comparable businesses.        In accordance with SFAS 144,  Accounting for the Impairment for Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,  the Company evaluates the recoverability of the recorded amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value using discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques.        Additional information on the Companys accounting policies is set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report as referenced to the Appendix to this Report.   Recently Issued Accounting Standards          In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,  Accounting For Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109  (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This Interpretation requires that the Company recognize in its financial statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The accounting provisions of FIN 48 will be effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2007, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company is in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of FIN 48 will have on its consolidated financial statements.   21         Recently Issued Accounting Standards (Continued)          In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. SFAS 157 is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2008, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating SFAS No. 157.    22            ITEM 7A  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK          Because of the level of variable interest rate debt in the Companys capital structure, the Company is exposed to earnings or cash flow fluctuations due to changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2006, the Company had $6.7 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 7.41%. This debt exposes the Company to changes in interest expense brought about by changes in interest rates. If the weighted average interest rate were to increase by 10.0% for fiscal 2006, the impact on net income would be $0.1 million.         Foreign Currency Exchange Risk -The Company has not entered into any foreign currency futures contracts as of September 30, 2006. The Company does enter into transactions denominated in foreign currency for inventory purchases as required by a specific customer. The foreign currency fluctuations are either credited back to or paid by the customer, the impact of which is not significant to the consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2006.         Commodity Price Risk -The Company had not entered into any forward buying agreements for the raw materials it uses to produce its goods and services as of September 30, 2006. An assessment of the risks of short-term commodity price fluctuations is set forth in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the caption Raw Materials and Suppliers. Under contracts at Green Bay, most material cost price changes are passed on to customers.         Other Relevant Market Risks- The Company does not own any marketable securities, and management is not aware of any other relevant market risks.
