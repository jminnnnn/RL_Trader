Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   General             We  are a  leading supermarket chain in the densely populated New York - New Jersey and Philadelphia metropolitan areas, operating 143 supermarkets. These metropolitan areas contain over 10% of the population in the United States. All of our supermarkets are located within 100 miles of our corporate headquarters in Carteret, New Jersey and our Company-operated and outsourced distribution facilities. We design our stores to provide customers with one-stop shopping with a wide assortment of foods and general merchandise, as well as additional conveniences, including 130 in-store full-service pharmacies and a wide array of financial services offered by 83 in-store banks. We are a leading filler of prescriptions among our supermarket competitors in the New York - New Jersey and Philadelphia metropolitan areas and, through our agreements with Bank of America and New York Community Bank, we believe we are the leading provider of in-store banking services in our market area.             Our sales are derived from the retail sale of products at our stores. Internally, we look to a variety of indicators to evaluate our sales and gross profit performance, including, among others: comparable store sales; sales per store; sales per selling square foot; percentage of total sales by department; shrink and department gross margins. We focus on increasing comparable store sales, sales per selling square foot and sales per store through programs focused on greater customer service and better store-level execution, promotional activities and merchandising, as well as a continued focus on our high sanitation standards.             Our operating  expenses are primarily incurred from selling, general and administrative costs. Over 70% of these costs are for labor and labor-related benefits. Internally, we focus on a variety of indicators to evaluate our expense performance, including, among others: labor costs, including labor hours and hourly labor rates and labor-related expenses such as welfare costs, pension costs, payroll taxes and workers' compensation costs. In fiscal 2003, we focused on controlling labor costs through a labor buyout initiative and implementation of a new time and attendance system. Selling, general and administrative expenses other than labor and labor-related costs include occupancy expenses, supplies and customer accident claims, among others. In fiscal 2004, we continued to focus on other expense control initiatives through our Best Ball and Focus Store programs in which best operating practices are implemented throughout our chain.             Major initiatives currently in place or implemented during fiscal 2004 include:    Implemented a comprehensive program involving merchandising, operations,      distribution and vendors to improve our in-stock position.   Implemented a health and beauty care pricing initiative to improve our pricing image.   Implemented a home-office merchandise section, called Corporate Express, in ten of our stores.   Maintained our "Best Ball" program to identify best operating practices and implement these throughout our chain.   Maintained our "Focus Stores" program in which stores identified as having significant upside opportunities are mentored by members of senior management.  Maintained our mystery shopper program to evaluate and improve customer service.   Maintained our store-level audits of food safety and sanitation.   Invested in technology, including a new back-door receiving system, a multi-year upgrade to our merchandising system and the continuing leverage of our existing systems for increased productivity.             We believe  these programs, together with overall operational improvements, resulted in increased sales metrics and improved productivity. These gains were largely offset by increases in pension and welfare costs.     15               As has been our practice in the past, we will continue to evaluate the profitability, strategic positioning, impact of potential competition, and sales growth potential of all our stores on an ongoing basis. We may, from time to time, make decisions regarding acquisitions, closures, relocations or renovations in accordance with such evaluations. On February 20, 2004, we purchased the remaining 67% of the common stock of Community Supermarket Corporation (CSC) that we did not already own from the other shareholder for $4.5 million in cash (the Acquisition). As a result of the Acquisition, the Company owns 100% of CSC (now known as Bergen Street Pathmark, Inc.). CSC has been a tenant under a lease for a supermarket in Newark, New Jersey (the Newark Store). During fiscal 2004, we opened three new stores, including the Newark Store which was previously included in our store count, closed two stores, one of which was operated by a joint venture, and completed 19 store renovations. During fiscal 2005, we plan to open two new stores, close two stores and complete eight store renovations. One of the new stores is a replacement for one of the stores being closed.    Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003             The following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data  (dollars in millions):          52 Weeks Ended         January 29, 2005       January 31, 2004         Amount         %         Amount         %     Sales              $  3,978.5           100.0    %    $  3,991.3           100.0    %                     Gross profit        $  1,132.4           28.5    %    $  1,138.7           28.5    %     Selling, general and administrative expenses          (984.9    )      (24.8    )      (953.9    )      (23.9    )     Depreciation and amortization          (89.4    )      (2.2    )      (84.0    )      (2.1    )     Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets          (309.0    )        (7.8    )                                           Operating earnings (loss)          (250.9    )        (6.3    )       100.8              2.5          Interest expense          (67.0    )       (1.7    )      (72.5    )       (1.8    )                     Earnings (loss) before income taxes          (317.9    )        (8.0    )        28.3             0.7          Income tax benefit (provision)          9.3           0.2           (11.8    )      (0.3    )                     Net earnings (loss)        $     (308.6    )      (7.8    )%    $     16.5           0.4    %                              Sales.  The following table sets forth data related to sales for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003:          52 Weeks Ended        January 29, 2005         January 31, 2004     Total sales increase (decrease)                (0.3    )%      1.4    %     Same-store sales increase (decrease)          (0.8    )%      1.2    %     Sales per selling square foot        $    724         $    734                   Sales in fiscal 2004 were $3.98 billion compared to $3.99 billion in fiscal 2003, a decrease of 0.3%. The sales decrease in fiscal 2004 was due to a 0.8% decrease in same-store sales (stores open the entire year in both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, including replacement stores and enlargements) and by a 0.6% decrease from closed stores, partially offset by a 1.1% increase from new stores. We believe sales in fiscal 2004 were affected by continuing weakness in consumer demand, which resulted in a decrease in our customer traffic, partially offset by an increase in our average order size. The change to an everyday low price concept in our health and beauty care category in February 2004 has not yet achieved the sales we expected, resulting in lower sales in this category, although our unit volume has increased. We operated 143 stores at the end of fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003.              Gross Profit.  Gross profit represents the difference between sales and cost of goods sold, which includes the costs of inventory sold and the related purchase and distribution costs, net of vendor allowances and rebates. Gross profit in fiscal 2004 was $1.13 billion or 28.5% of sales compared to $1.14 billion or 28.5% of sales for fiscal 2003. The decrease in gross profit dollars in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to lower sales. The gross profit margin in fiscal 2004 was impacted by the inability to pass on the full cost of increases in wholesale prices earlier in the fiscal year, offset by improved margins in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.    16                SG&A . SG&A in fiscal 2004 was $984.9 million or 24.8% of sales compared to $953.9 million  or 23.9% of sales in fiscal 2003. SG&A in fiscal 2004 is net of a $1.4 million credit  to correct, on a cumulative basis, the accounting for our operating leases and long-term disability plan (see Note 1  Significant Accounting Policies) and a $1.5 million gain from the disposition of real estate. SG&A in fiscal 2003 included a $13.7 million gain from the  disposition of real estate related to the assignment of two real estate leases and a $8.1  million charge related to our store labor buyout initiative and corporate headcount reduction program, which was commenced and completed during the first six months of fiscal  2003 in order to reduce labor costs. Excluding the aforementioned items of $2.9 million and $5.6 million in fiscal 2004 and in fiscal 2003, respectively, SG&A in fiscal 2004 increased by $28.3 million, or 0.7% of sales,  compared to fiscal 2003, primarily due to the following factors: (1) welfare, pension  and medical expenses increased by 0.3% of sales, (2) store labor expenses  increased by 0.2% of sales, due to the negative sales leverage, and (3) rent and real estate taxes increased  by 0.1% of sales due to three new stores compared to fiscal 2003.  The remaining increases  were primarily due to professional fees associated with implementing the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as well as system expenses and costs related to the Company's strategic alternative.               Depreciation and Amortization.  Depreciation and amortization of $89.4 million in fiscal 2004 was $5.4 million higher than the $84.0 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to an increase of $30.0 million in capital expenditures, including technology investment, in fiscal 2004, and a charge to depreciation and amortization expense of $2.0 million in fiscal 2004 related to leasehold improvements (see  Summary of Operations  below).              Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets.  Based on our valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $309.0 million. The goodwill impairment of $293.8 million, which is not deductible for income tax purposes, represents the write down of the carrying value of our goodwill to its implied fair value and is due to our declining operating performance in fiscal 2004 and the reduced valuation multiples in the retail grocery industry. Such negative factors are reflected in our stock price and market capitalization. The long-lived assets impairment of $15.2 million represents the write downs of under-performing stores to their fair market values.              Operating Earnings (Loss).  The operating loss was $250.9 million in fiscal 2004 compared to operating earnings of $100.8 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease in operating earnings in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the non-cash goodwill and long-lived assets impairment charge of $309.0 million and higher SG&A expenses.              Interest Expense.  Interest expense was $67.0 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $72.5 million in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in fiscal 2004 included a write off of deferred financing costs of $1.7 million related to the refinancing of our credit agreement dated September 19, 2000 (the 2000 Credit Agreement). Interest expense in fiscal 2003 included a derivative settlement charge of $3.7 million related to the termination and settlement of $150 million of our interest rate zero-cost collar and the write off of deferred financing costs of $2.6 million resulting from the repayment of $171 million of our Term Loan primarily from proceeds of additional borrowings of $150 million under the Senior Subordinated Notes. Excluding these items, interest expense in fiscal 2004 decreased by $0.9 million compared to fiscal 2003. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to lower interest rates.              Income Tax Benefit (Provision).  The income tax benefit in fiscal 2004 was $9.3 million compared to an income tax provision in fiscal 2003 of $11.8 million. During fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, we made income tax payments of $3.9 million and $6.1 million, respectively. Refer to Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements for information related to our income taxes.              Summary of Operations.  The net loss in fiscal 2004 was $308.6 million compared to net earnings of $16.5 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease in net earnings in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the non-cash goodwill and long-lived assets impairment charge of $309.0 million in fiscal 2004.    17              We reviewed our lease accounting practices following the Securities and Exchange Commissions recent clarification to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of operating leases and leasehold improvement issues. Based on this review, we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 a credit of $4.4 million to correct, on a cumulative basis, the calculation of straight-line rent expense by reducing our deferred rent liability account. We also recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 a charge of $2.0 million to correct, on a cumulative basis, the amortization of certain leasehold improvements.             In addition, we reviewed the accounting for our long-term disability medical plan. Based on this review, we concluded that we had not correctly accounted for the plan on an accrual basis and recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 a charge of $3.0 million to record a liability for such disability expenses. We also recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 a credit of $1.3 million to correct, on a cumulative basis, certain book and tax basis differences by reducing our deferred income tax liability account.   A summary of the aforementioned charges (credits) are as follows (in millions):          Pre-Tax         Tax Impact         Post-Tax     Straight-line rent expense              $ (4.4    )    $  1.8         $ (2.6    )     Depreciation and amortization           2.0           (0.8    )       1.2          Long-term disability - medical expense           3.0           (1.2    )       1.8          Deferred income tax benefit                     (1.3    )      (1.3    )                           $  0.6         $ (1.5    )    $ (0.9    )                           We did not restate our prior years financial statements for such adjustments since the impact was immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2004, prior years or any interim periods. The impact is also not expected to have a material impact on our future financial condition or results of operations.   Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002             The following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data (dollars in millions):          52 Weeks Ended         January 31, 2004       February 1, 2003         Amount         %         Amount         %     Sales              $  3,991.3           100.0    %    $  3,937.7           100.0    %                     Gross profit        $  1,138.7           28.5    %    $  1,121.0           28.5    %     Selling, general and administrative expenses          (953.9    )      (23.9    )      (944.4    )      (24.0    )     Depreciation and amortization          (84.0    )      (2.1    )      (84.6    )      (2.2    )                     Operating earnings          100.8           2.5           92.0           2.3          Interest expense          (72.5    )      (1.8    )      (65.1    )      (1.7    )                     Earnings before income taxes and cumulative    effect of an accounting change          28.3           0.7           26.9           0.6          Income tax provision          (11.8    )      (0.3    )      (13.0    )      (0.3    )                     Earnings before cumulative effect of an accounting change          16.5           0.4           13.9           0.3          Cumulative effect of an accounting change, net of tax                                (0.6    )                                Net earnings        $     16.5           0.4    %    $     13.3           0.3    %                          Sales.   The following table sets forth data related to sales for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002:          52 Weeks Ended        January 31, 2004         February 1, 2003     Total sales increase (decrease)                1.4    %      (0.6    )%     Same-store sales increase (decrease)          1.2    %      (1.7    )%     Sales per selling square foot        $    734         $    724          18               Sales in fiscal 2003 were $3.99 billion compared to $3.94 billion in fiscal 2002, an increase of 1.4%. The sales increase in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to higher same-store sales (stores open the entire year in both fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, including replacement stores and enlargements) of 1.2% and new stores, partially offset by closed stores. We believe sales benefited from our successful marketing and operations initiatives, including the change in the start of our weekly ad at the beginning of fiscal 2003. Sales were also favorably impacted by increased customer shopping preceding several major snowstorms in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2003, we opened two stores of which one was a replacement store, closed two stores and renovated 16 stores. We operated 143 and 144 stores at the end of fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, respectively.              Gross Profit.  Gross profit represents the difference between sales and cost of goods sold, which includes the costs of inventory sold and the related purchase and distribution costs, net of vendor allowances and rebates. Gross profit in fiscal 2003 was $1.14 billion or 28.5% of sales compared to $1.12 billion or 28.5% of sales for fiscal 2002. The increase in gross profit dollars for fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to higher sales.              SG&A.  SG&A in fiscal 2003 was $953.9 million or 23.9% of sales compared to $944.4 million or 24.0% of sales in fiscal 2002. SG&A in fiscal 2003 includes higher medical, workers compensation and pension expenses, as well as higher snow removal costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and higher occupancy expenses, primarily associated with new stores, partially offset by lower payroll expenses resulting from the store labor buyout and corporate headcount reduction programs implemented in fiscal 2003. SG&A in fiscal 2003 also included an $8.1 million charge related to our aforementioned store labor buyout initiative and corporate headcount reduction program during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2003, and is net of a $13.7 million gain from the disposition of real estate related to the assignment of two real estate leases. Fiscal 2002 included a $2.0 million charge related to a labor buyout program.              Depreciation and Amortization.  Depreciation and amortization of $84.0 million in fiscal 2003 was $0.6 million lower than the $84.6 million in fiscal 2002. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures since fiscal 2001.              Operating Earnings.  Operating earnings were $100.8 million, or 2.5% of sales, in fiscal 2003 compared to $92.0 million, or 2.3% of sales, in fiscal 2002. The increase in operating earnings in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.              Interest Expense.  Interest expense was $72.5 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $65.1 million in fiscal 2002. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to a derivative settlement charge of $3.7 million related to the termination and settlement of our $150 million interest rate zero-cost collar, the write off of deferred financing costs of $2.1 million as a result of the repayment of $153 million of our term loan primarily from proceeds from the issuance of an additional $150 million ($100 million on September 19, 2003 and $50 million on December 18, 2003) aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes. Interest expense in fiscal 2003 also included the write off of deferred financing costs of $0.5 million as a result of the repayment in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 of $18 million of our term loan and an increased interest rate as a result of the January 28, 2003 amendment to our Credit Agreement. Fiscal 2002 included the reversal of an accrued interest liability of $2.2 million related to the favorable resolution of certain tax issues.              Income Tax Provision.  The income tax provision of $11.8 million in fiscal 2003 was based on an effective tax rate of 41.6% and the income tax provision of $13.0 million in fiscal 2002 was based on an effective income tax rate of 39.6%. During fiscal 2003, we made income tax payments of $6.1 million. During fiscal 2002, we made income tax payments of $4.1 million and received income tax refunds of $2.6 million. Refer to Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements for information related to our income taxes.    19               Cumulative Effect of an Accounting Change.  We adopted, as of the beginning of fiscal 2002, EITF Issue No. 02-16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor. In adopting EITF Issue No. 02-16, vendor payments related to advertising reimbursements are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold when both the required advertising is performed and the inventory is sold; prior to this change, these reimbursements were recorded as a reduction of advertising expense when the required advertising was performed. As a result, we recorded a charge, as of the first quarter of fiscal 2002, of $0.6 million, net of an income tax benefit of $0.4 million, for the cumulative effect of an accounting change.              Summary of Operations.  Net earnings in fiscal 2003 were $16.5 million compared to $13.3 million in fiscal 2002. The increase in net earnings in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to increased operating earnings, partially offset by higher interest expense.   Liquidity and Capital Resources             Cash Flows.   The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of cash flow data (in millions):           52 Weeks Ended        January 29, 2005         January 31, 2004         February 1, 2003     Cash provided by (used for):                                               Operating activities        $  101.2         $   90.8         $   92.0            Investing activities          (99.6    )      (51.5    )      (105.3    )       Financing activities          32.1           (41.7    )                         The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to higher cash generated by operating assets and liabilities due to the timing of certain disbursements, partially offset by lower cash provided by operating earnings. The increase in the cash balance from $8.9 million at January 31, 2004 to $42.6 million at January 29, 2005 was due to the transfer in fiscal 2004 of our depository accounts to a new financial institution. Since we no longer had the right of offset against our disbursing accounts, book overdrafts of $20.6 million were reflected as accounts payable at January 29, 2005 rather than being netted against cash. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to an increase in cash interest resulting from the derivative settlement charge related to the termination and settlement of our $150 million interest rate zero-cost collar, partially offset by higher net earnings and less cash used for operating assets and liabilities. The increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was due higher capital expenditures, including technology investments, and the acquisition of CSC, partially offset by lower proceeds from the sale of real estate. The decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures, including technology investments, partially offset by proceeds of $17.3 million from the disposition of real estate and lower lease financings. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to net increased borrowings under the Working Capital Facility and the Term Loan (see  Debt Service and Liquidity  below); fiscal 2003 included a $171.5 million repayment of the Term Loan, primarily from proceeds of $153.9 million from additional issuances of Senior Subordinated Notes. The increase in cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the repayment of $171.5 million of our term loan and reduced borrowings under the working capital facility, partially offset by proceeds from additional issuances of Senior Subordinated Notes of $153.9 million.              Debt Service and Liquidity . On October 1, 2004, we entered into the Credit Agreement with a group of lenders led by Fleet Retail Group, a Bank of America company. The term of the Credit Agreement is five years and consists of a $180 million revolving working capital facility (the Working Capital Facility) (including a maximum of $125 million in letters of credit) and a $70 million term loan (the Term Loan). Under the Term Loan, we are required to make a balloon payment of $70 million on October 1, 2009. The proceeds from the Credit Agreement were used to completely repay the outstanding balance under the 2000 Credit Agreement. As of January 29, 2005, borrowings under the Term Loan and the Working Capital Facility were $70.0 million and $34.4 million, respectively, outstanding letters of credit were $61.5 million and borrowing availability under the Working Capital Facility was $84.1 million.    20              Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, among other things, the maximum permitted leverage ratio, the minimum consolidated interest and rental expense coverage ratio, the minimum fixed-charge ratio and the maximum consolidated capital expenditures covenants were all eliminated and replaced with three financial covenants: minimum annual consolidated EBITDA of $135 million, minimum inventory of $150 million and maximum annual cash capital expenditures of $110 million. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains certain covenants which, among other things, place limits on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, issuance of cash-pay preferred stock, repurchase of Company stock, incurrence of liens, sale-leaseback transactions, hedging activities, sale or discount of receivables, investments, loans, advances, guarantees with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, changing lines of business, repayments of other indebtedness, amendments to organizational documents and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. Also, the Credit Agreement prohibits the payment of cash dividends. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including without limitation, payment defaults, material breaches of representations, warranties and covenants, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and a change of control. There are no credit agency ratings-related triggers in either the Credit Agreement or in the indenture related to the Senior Subordinated Notes (the Indenture) that would adversely impact the cost of borrowings, annual amortization of principal or related debt maturities. We were in compliance with all Credit Agreement covenants as of January 29, 2005.             Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates equal to LIBOR plus a premium that ranges between 1.5% to 2.25%, depending on the average remaining availability under the Credit Agreement, and at January 29, 2005 was at LIBOR plus 2.0%. The weighted-average interest rate in effect on all borrowings under the Term Loan was 5.2% during fiscal 2004.             All of the obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Companys 100% owned subsidiaries, except our nonguarantor subsidiaries, which are comprised of four 100% owned and consolidated single-purpose entities. Each of these single-purpose entities owns the real estate on which a supermarket leased to Pathmark is located. The obligations under the Credit Agreement and those of the subsidiaries guaranteeing the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets including, without limitation, intellectual property, real property, including leasehold interests, and the capital stock in each of these subsidiaries.             We believe that cash flows generated from operations, supplemented by the unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement and the availability of capital lease financing will be sufficient to provide for our debt service requirements, working capital needs and capital expenditure program. However, in the event that cash flows from operations are lower in fiscal 2005 and beyond, we may need to adjust our future cash capital expenditure program.             We have outstanding $350 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes which pay cash interest semi-annually on February 1 and August 1. The Indenture contains a number of restrictive covenants, including a restriction on our ability to declare cash dividends on our common stock. We were in compliance with all Senior Subordinated Notes covenants as of January 29, 2005.    21               Contractual Obligations and Commitments.  We enter into a variety of legally binding obligations and commitments in the normal course of our business. The table below presents our long-term contractual obligations and commitments which represent known future cash payments that we will be required to make under existing contractual arrangements. Some amounts are based on managements estimates and assumptions and amounts actually paid may vary from those reflected below. The following table presents contractual obligations as of January 29, 2005 (in millions):          Payments Due by Fiscal Years                Total         2005         2006 and 2007         2008 and 2009         Thereafter        Debt obligations (1)              $ 481.2         $  36.6         $   2.3         $  90.5         $ 351.8          Capital lease obligations (1)          193.4           15.1           19.9           15.7           142.7          Operating lease obligations (2)          516.7            59.7           107.8            85.5           263.7          Purchase obligations (3)          746.8           99.8           192.3           190.1           264.6          Other liabilities (4)          201.3           36.8           43.9           33.0           87.6                              Total        $  2,139.4         $    248.0         $    366.2         $    414.8         $  1,110.4                                (1)   Debt and capital lease obligations include principal  payments only.       (2)   Operating lease obligations, net of sublease income of $57.7 million, are $459.0 million.       (3)   In addition to the purchase obligations reflected in the  table above, we enter into supply contracts to purchase products for resale in  the ordinary course of business. This category of contracts covers a broad  spectrum of products and sometimes includes specific merchandising obligations  relative to those products. These supply contracts typically include either a  volume commitment or a fixed expiration date; pricing terms based on the  vendors published list price; termination provisions; and other standard  contractual considerations. Our obligation related to these contracts is typically limited to return of unearned allowances and therefore no amounts have  been included above. Purchase obligations shown above relate to the outsourcing  of a major portion of our distribution, trucking and information systems  functions through long-term agreements, as noted below.       We have a supply agreement with C&S, expiring in January 2013, pursuant to which C&S supplies substantially all of our grocery, frozen and perishable merchandise requirements. Under our arrangement with C&S, we negotiate prices, discounts and promotions with vendors. We pay C&S a per case upcharge, and have annual minimum case commitments. The table above reflects this minimum upcharge. During fiscal 2004, the products supplied from C&S accounted for approximately 60% of all of our supermarket inventory purchases. This agreement may only be terminated for cause or certain events of bankruptcy by either party.  In February 2005, we entered into a seven-year outsourcing agreement with IBM to continue to provide a wide range of information systems services, which commenced in 1991. Under the agreement, IBM provides data center operations, mainframe processing, business applications and systems development to enhance our customer service and efficiency. The charges under this agreement are based upon the services requested at predetermined rates. We may terminate this agreement with a payment of a specified termination charge.   22     We also have an agreement, expiring in January 2014, with GHI, a local trucking company, to provide us with trucking services. Under this arrangement, there is an annual fixed fee in addition to transportation charges. The fixed fee is reflected in the table above. We may terminate this agreement with a payment of a specified termination charge. In addition, in connection with the sale of the trucking business to GHI in 1997, GHI agreed to continue making (and continues to make) contributions to the Local 863 Pension Fund (the Fund), a multi-employer pension plan. The Company agreed in the sale agreement that in the event GHI were to withdraw (as defined by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)) from the Fund, to indemnify GHI under certain circumstances against all liabilities it would have arising from such a withdrawal (Fund Withdrawal Liability) and to provide a letter of credit in the full amount of the Fund Withdrawal Liability to secure the potential indemnification obligation. We delivered in 1997 letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $3 million in favor of GHI and the Fund. Subsequent to fiscal year end, we agreed to deliver an additional $7 million letter of credit in favor of GHI, and to adjust said letter of credit up or down annually beginning in 2006 to reflect any change in the maximum amount of the Fund  Withdrawal Liability estimated for a complete withdrawal by GHI from the Fund. We have also agreed with GHI that any annual increase in said letter of credit would not exceed $5 million; provided, however, that in the event of certain change of control transactions involving the Company (excluding the Yucaipa Transaction), a failure to provide an annual increase in the letter of credit when due, or a material adverse change in our financial condition, we would be required to furnish a letter of credit in the full amount of the Fund Withdrawal Liability (currently estimated to be approximately $31 million), less any outstanding letters of credit in favor of GHI and/or the Fund.      (4)   Other liabilities include estimated self-insured  obligations, estimated unfunded pension liabilities and estimated  post-retirement and post-employment obligations.               We had outstanding letters of credit of $61.5 million as of January 29, 2005, of which $60.5 million were standby letters of credit covering primarily self-insured or performance obligations. The remaining $1.0 million were commercial letters of credit supporting purchases of imported products.              Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.  In the normal course of business, we have assigned to third parties various leases related to former businesses that we sold as well as former operating Pathmark supermarkets (the Assigned Leases). When the Assigned Leases were assigned, we generally remained secondarily liable with respect to these lease obligations. As such, if any of the assignees were to become unable to continue making rental payments under the Assigned Leases, under certain circumstances we could be required to assume the lease obligation. As of January 29, 2005, 66 Assigned Leases remain in place. Assuming that each respective assignee became unable to continue to make rental payments under an Assigned Lease, an event we believe to be remote, management estimates our maximum potential obligation with respect to the Assigned Leases to be approximately $109 million, which could be partially or totally offset by reassigning or subletting such leases. We have recognized a liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 29, 2005 of $2.7 million, which represents certain guarantees attributable to our secondary liability in connection with Assigned Leases assigned after December 31, 2002. Additionally, during 1997, the Company sold its distribution operation to C&S and its trucking operation to GHI. In each case, C&S and GHI agreed to continue making (and continue to make) contributions to the applicable multi-employer pension plan. In connection with each sale, the Company agreed that, in the event of a withdrawal from the plan by the applicable acquiring party, it would, under certain circumstances and to a limited extent with respect to C&S, indemnify each of the acquirers with respect to such contingent withdrawal liability. The Company is also a party to a variety of contracts under which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to the Companys commercial contracts, purchase and sale agreements, leases, financial agreements and various other agreements. Under these contracts, the Company may provide routine indemnification relating to representations and warranties, or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. Historically, the Company has not made a significant payment for these indemnifications.              Capital Expenditures.  Capital expenditures, including property acquired under capital leases, technology investments and the Acquisition, were $119.0 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $79.3 million in fiscal 2003 and $121.1 million in fiscal 2002. Capital expenditures included $23.5 million, $20.7 million and $36.5 million in technology spending in fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, respectively. During fiscal 2004, we opened three new stores, one of which was formerly operated by joint venture and was previously included in our store count, closed two stores, one of which was formerly operated by a joint venture, and completed 19 store renovations. During fiscal 2003, we opened two new stores, closed three stores and renovated 16 stores. One of the new stores is a replacement for one of the stores being closed. In fiscal 2005, our capital expenditure plan is to invest approximately $67 million in new stores, major store renovations and technology investments. During fiscal 2005, we plan to open two new stores, close two stores and complete eight store renovations. One of the new stores is a replacement for one of the stores being closed.    23                 Contingencies.  We are a party to a number of legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings will not, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the our financial statements taken as a whole. We have taken certain tax positions, which may be challenged, and have reserved for such tax positions in noncurrent liabilities as payment, if any, is not expected within one year. While the ultimate resolution of these positions cannot be determined with any degree of certainty, we believe that the aggregate contingencies, if any, when compared to the amounts reserved, will not have a material effect on our financial statements taken as a whole.   Critical Accounting Policies             Our discussion of results of operations and financial condition relies on our financial statements that are prepared based on certain critical accounting policies that require management to make judgments and estimates that are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty. We believe that investors need to be aware of these policies and how they impact our financial statements as a whole, as well as our related discussion and analysis presented herein. While we believe that these accounting policies are based on sound measurement criteria, actual future events can and often do result in outcomes that can be materially different from these estimates or forecasts. The accounting policies and related risk described in this report are those that depend most heavily on these judgments and estimates.              Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.  It is our accounting policy to assess the carrying value of our long-lived assets for possible impairment on an individual store basis to determine if the carrying value of such assets are recoverable from their related undiscounted cash flows. In fiscal 2004, we estimated future cash flows based on economic and business assumptions and concluded that there was an impairment of $15.2 million. Since our estimates project cash flow several years into the future, they could be affected by variable factors such as inflation and economic conditions. In fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, there was no impairment of our long-lived assets.              Goodwill Impairment.  We performed the annual evaluation of our goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in fiscal 2004 and, based on such evaluation of fair value, concluded that there was a $293.8 million impairment of our goodwill. Since such impairment analysis is based on economic and business assumptions, the goodwill impairment analysis in the future could be affected by changes in these business and economic conditions, changes in consumer spending, the competitive environment in which we operate and other risks detailed elsewhere in this report. In fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, we concluded there was no impairment of our goodwill.              Pension Plans.  Pension income for all our pension plans was $4.1 million, $4.3 million (net of a $2.1 million retirement incentive program charge) and $9.0 million for fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, respectively, and was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions. The expected return on assets of our qualified pension plan (the Qualified Plan) represents the weighted-average of expected returns for each asset category, which have been developed using information from a number of third-party consultants and long-term historical data on returns for different asset categories and inflation. We also considered the Qualified Plans historical 10-year and 20-year compounded returns of 12.9% and 13.1%, respectively, which have exceeded broad market returns over comparable periods, indicating a significant premium has been gained through active management of plan assets. Based on these factors and the asset allocation discussed below, we elected to use a 9.00% expected return on plan assets in determining pension income for fiscal 2004. This was consistent with fiscal 2003, but represented a 0.5% decrease from the expected returns on plan assets used in determining pension income for fiscal 2002. Both assumptions were net of expected plan expenses payable from the trust fund, which are less than 0.5% of plan assets.    24              The expected long-term rate of return on our Qualified Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 70% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 10.5%, and 30% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 5.5%. Because of market fluctuation, our actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2004 was 74% with equity managers and 26% with fixed income managers. We believe, however, that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 70% with equity managers and 30% with fixed income managers. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. An additional 0.5% reduction in our expected long-term rate of return on Qualified Plan assets, holding all other factors constant, would have reduced our pension income during fiscal 2004 by approximately $1.2 million.             We base our determination of pension expense or income, in part, on a market-related valuation of assets that reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a three-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market value of assets. As of January 29, 2005, we had cumulative net actuarial gains of approximately $3.9 million, due to the differences between expected and actual return on plan assets, which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of assets. These unrecognized net actuarial gains may result in increases in our future pension income depending on several factors, including future asset gains and losses and whether such gains and losses, as recognized at each measurement date, together with other actuarial experience recognized, exceed the corridor in which gains and losses are not amortized, in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions.             The discount rate that we used for determining future pension obligations was based on a review of long-term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency at the end of the calendar year. The discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from 6.00% as of January 31, 2004 to 5.75% as of January 29, 2005. Pension income is sensitive to the discount rate and salary increase assumptions used. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate and salary increase assumptions used would have decreased pension income during fiscal 2004 by approximately $0.1 million.             Based on an expected return on plan assets assumption of 9.00%, a discount rate of 5.75% and our various other relevant current assumptions, we estimate that our pension income for all pension plans combined will approximate $2.6 million for fiscal 2005, $4.6 million for fiscal 2006 and $5.9 million for fiscal 2007. Actual pension income in the future will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension plans.             The value of our Qualified Plan assets has increased from $250.7 million at December 31, 2003 to $262.8 million at December 31, 2004. Accruing benefits, changes in economic assumptions and unfavorable actuarial experience have lowered the overfunded status of our Qualified Plan, net of benefit obligations, from $79.6 million at December 31, 2003 to $72.5 million at December 31, 2004. We believe that, based on our actuarial assumptions and due to the overfunded status of our Qualified Plan, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to our Qualified Plan for at least the next three years.              Self-Insured Claims Liabilities and Postemployment Benefits.  We are self insured for claims relating to customer, associate and vehicle accidents,  as well as certain associate medical and disability benefits, and we maintain  third-party excess insurance coverage for such claims. It is our accounting  policy to record a self-insured liability, as determined actuarially on a  consistent basis, based on the facts and circumstances of each individual claim  filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported discounted at a  risk-free interest rate. All claims and their related liabilities are reviewed  and monitored on an ongoing basis. Any actuarial projection of losses concerning  such claims is subject to variability primarily due to external factors affecting future inflation rates, litigation trends, benefit levels and claim  settlement patterns. At January 29, 2005, liabilities for self-insured claims  and benefits were $60.7 million and for postemployment benefits were $7.1  million.    25      New Accounting Pronouncements             In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosure about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit, an amendment of SFAS No. 87, 88 and 106. This statement revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It requires additional disclosures to those in the original SFAS No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, which it replaces, about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. Effective with fiscal 2003 year-end reporting, the required information was provided separately for pension plans and for other postretirement benefit plans. Effective with fiscal 2004 quarterly reporting, the required information was provided separately for pension plans and for other postretirement benefit plans. The adoption of SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003) did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.             In May 2004, the staff of the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which superseded FSP No. FAS 106-1. This FSP provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act). FSP No. FAS 106-1 allowed companies to either assess the effect of the Act on their retirement-related benefit costs and obligations or to defer accounting for the effects of the Act until authoritative guidance was issued. We elected to defer any accounting for the effects of the Act pursuant to FSP No. FAS 106-1 and made that election in our fiscal quarter ended May 1, 2004, the first period in which the plans accounting for the effects of the Act normally would have been reflected in our financial statements. We and our actuarial advisors determined that benefits provided by one of the prescription drug plans we sponsor for a collective bargaining group as of the date of enactment were at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D, and, accordingly, we will be entitled to the federal subsidy for that plan. We and our actuarial advisors based this determination on a comparison of the value of the prescription drug benefit for the bargaining group (net of retiree contributions) to the value of Medicare Part D (net of retiree premiums), using an actuarial model of prescription drug expenses for employer-sponsored medical plans. We elected to early adopt the provisions of this FSP for the second fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2004, and incorporated the required disclosure provisions into our financial statements. We performed a measurement of the effects of the Act on our expense for the year beginning January 1, 2004 and on our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) as of January 1, 2004, the date that followed the enactment of the Act. The expense for 2004 decreased by approximately $0.7 million as a result of the Act. Our APBO as of the beginning of this fiscal year decreased by approximately $4.5 million as a result of the Act. This change in the APBO due to the Act is considered an actuarial gain. In measuring the $4.5 million APBO impact of the Act, we projected that our prescription drug per capita plan costs would, effective on January 1, 2006, decrease by 20% on average for members of one of our collective-bargaining units as a result of the federal subsidy and that we would use the federal subsidy to offset Company costs for the plan and assumes there would be no change in participation rates. The effect of applying this FSP had no cumulative effect on our retained earnings as of January 31, 2004. Accordingly, in applying the guidance in SFAS No. 3, we reported a reduction in net periodic benefit costs of $0.7 million in fiscal 2004.    26                In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. This statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. This statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. This statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. This statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awardthe requisite service period (usually the vesting period). The grant-date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option-pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments. This statement eliminates the alternative to use APB Opinion No. 25s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in SFAS No. 123 as originally issued. This statement was originally effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that began after June 15, 2005. On April 14, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission amended the compliance date to permit companies to implement this statement at the beginning of their fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005, i.e., for our first quarter reporting period ending April 29, 2006. This statement applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after that date. The cumulative effect of initially applying this statement, if any, is recognized as of the required effective date. Under the transition method, compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered, based on the grant-date fair value of those awards calculated under SFAS No. 123 for either recognition or pro forma disclosures. For periods before the required effective date, a company may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statement for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by SFAS No. 123. We are in the process of evaluating the use of certain option-pricing models as well as the assumptions to be used in such models. When the evaluation is complete, we will select a transition method.   Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.             Our financial results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt which carries variable interest rates. Variable rate debt outstanding under our Term Loan was $70.0 million on January 29, 2005. During fiscal 2004, the average interest rates in effect on borrowings under our Term Loan and our Working Capital Facility were 5.2% and 5.3%, respectively. A 1% change in interest rates applied to the $70.0 million balance of floating-rate Term Loan debt and to the $34.4 million balance of floating-rate Working Capital Facility debt would affect pre-tax annual results of operations by approximately $1.0 million. Our Senior Subordinated Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.75%, and are, therefore, not subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations. The principal objective of our treasury management activities is to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to facilitate our funding needs. As part of our risk management, we may use derivative financial products such as interest rate hedges and interest rate swaps in the future.     27    Item 8. Financial Statements.
