Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations         General             We are a leading supermarket chain in the Northeast, operating 144 supermarkets in the densely populated New York-New Jersey and Philadelphia metropolitan areas. These metropolitan areas contain over 10% of the population in the United States. All of our supermarkets are located within 100 miles of our corporate office in Carteret, New Jersey.    Fiscal 2002 compared to Fiscal 2001             The following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data (dollars in millions):             52 Weeks Ended             February 1, 2003     February 2, 2002             Amount     %     Amount     %       Sales     $  3,937.7     100.0  %  $  3,963.3     100.0  %                            Gross profit     $  1,121.0     28.5  %  $  1,107.7     27.9  %    Selling, general and administrative expenses        (944.4  )  (24.0  )     (920.4  )  (23.2  )    Depreciation and amortization        (84.6  )  (2.2  )     (76.7  )  (1.9  )    Amortization of goodwill                     (265.5  )  (6.7  )                            Operating earnings (loss)        92.0     2.3        (154.9  )  (3.9  )    Interest expense, net        (65.1  )  (1.7  )     (65.3  )  (1.6  )                            Earnings (loss) before income taxes, extraordinary item and cumulative effect of an accounting change        26.9     0.6        (220.2  )  (5.5  )    Income tax provision        (13.0  )  (0.3  )     (18.5  )  (0.5  )                            Earnings (loss) before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of an accounting change        13.9     0.3        (238.7  )  (6.0  )    Extraordinary item, net of tax                     (3.3  )  (0.1  )                            Earnings (loss) before cumulative effect of an accounting change        13.9     0.3        (242.0  )  (6.1  )    Cumulative effect of an accounting change, net of tax        (0.6  )                                              Net earnings (loss)     $  13.3     0.3  %  $  (242.0  )  (6.1  )%                                       Cumulative Effect of an Accounting Change.     The Company adopted, as of the beginning of fiscal 2002, EITF Issue No. 02-16. It has been the Company's accounting policy to record vendor allowances and rebates as a reduction of cost of goods sold when both the required contractual terms are completed and the inventory is sold. It was also the Company's accounting policy to recognize vendor payments for the reimbursement of the Company's advertising costs as a reduction of advertising expense when the required advertising is performed. In adopting EITF Issue No. 02-16, the Company recorded vendor payments related to advertising reimbursements as a reduction of cost of goods sold when both the required advertising is performed and the inventory is sold. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $0.6 million, net of tax, for the cumulative effect of an accounting change, as of the beginning of fiscal 2002. In addition, as a result of EITF Issue No. 02-16, vendor payments of $17.7 million in fiscal 2002 related to advertising reimbursements, previously classified as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses, were reclassified as a reduction of cost of goods sold. Prior year financial statements were not reclassified. Excluding the charge for the cumulative effect of this accounting change, the impact of EITF Issue No. 02-16 on the Company's net earnings for fiscal 2002 was not significant.    15                 Sales.     Sales in fiscal 2002 were $3.94 billion compared to $3.96 billion in fiscal 2001, a decrease of 0.6%. The sales decrease in fiscal 2002 was primarily due to lower same-store sales (stores opened the entire year in both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, including replacement stores and enlargements) of 1.7% and closed stores, partially offset by new store sales. We believe sales were negatively impacted by weak economic conditions and declining consumer confidence in our region and its resultant effect on consumer spending. These same conditions resulted in increased promotional activity within our marketplace. During fiscal 2002, we opened seven new stores (including one former Grand Union store we purchased in fiscal 2001), three of which were replacement stores, closed one store and completed 11 store renovations. We operated 144 stores and 141 stores at the end of fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, respectively.            Gross Profit.     Gross profit represents the difference between sales and cost of goods, which includes the costs of inventory sold and the related purchase and distribution costs, net of earned vendor allowances and rebates. Gross profit in fiscal 2002 was $1.12 billion or 28.5% of sales compared to $1.11 billion or 27.9% of sales for fiscal 2001. The increase in gross profit of $13.3 million for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to the impact of EITF Issue No. 02-16, in which vendor payments of $17.7 million in fiscal 2002 related to advertising reimbursements, previously classified as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses, were reclassified as a reduction of cost of goods sold. Excluding this reclassification, the decrease in gross profit of $4.4 million for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was due to lower sales and higher shrink, partially offset by higher vendor allowances and rebates.            Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SG&A").     SG&A in fiscal 2002 increased $24.0 million or 2.6% compared to fiscal 2001. This increase in SG&A was primarily due to the impact of EITF Issue No. 02-16, in which vendor payments of $17.7 million in fiscal 2002 related to advertising reimbursements, previously classified as a reduction of SG&A, were reclassified as a reduction of cost of goods sold. Excluding this reclassification, SG&A increased $6.3 million in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 due to higher store costs related to labor, union health and welfare contributions and rent, partially offset by lower administrative expenses and favorable customer accident claims expense.            Depreciation and Amortization.     Depreciation and amortization of $84.6 million in fiscal 2002 was $7.9 million higher than the $76.7 million in fiscal 2001. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to the impact of our stepped-up capital program and technology initiatives.            Amortization of Goodwill.     The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 effective with the beginning of fiscal 2002. With the adoption of SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer being amortized but rather is being evaluated for impairment at least annually. Amortization of goodwill was $265.5 million in fiscal 2001. Based on an independent evaluation of its fair value completed when SFAS No. 142 was adopted in the first quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company concluded that there was no impairment of its goodwill. The Company performed its annual evaluation of its goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, and, based on an independent evaluation of its fair value, concluded that there was no impairment of its goodwill.            Operating Earnings (Loss).     Operating earnings were $92.0 million in fiscal 2002 compared to an operating loss of $154.9 million in fiscal 2001. The increase in operating earnings in fiscal 2002 compared to an operating loss in fiscal 2001 was primarily due to the amortization of goodwill of $265.5 million in fiscal 2001.            Interest Expense, Net.     Interest expense was $65.1 million in fiscal 2002 compared to $65.3 million in fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2002 included the reversal of an accrued interest liability of $2.2 million related to the favorable resolution of certain tax issues. Excluding the reversal of the accrued interest liability, the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to higher borrowings.    16                 Income Tax Provision.     The income tax provision was $13.0 million and $18.5 million in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, respectively. Refer to Note 19 of the consolidated financial statements for information related to our income taxes. During fiscal 2002, we made income tax payments of $4.1 million and received income tax refunds of $2.6 million. During fiscal 2001, we made income tax payments of $1.0 million and received income tax refunds of $15,000.            Extraordinary Item.     In fiscal 2001, the extraordinary item of $3.3 million, net of an income tax benefit of $2.3 million, represents costs incurred resulting from the early extinguishment of debt, including the write-off of deferred financing costs, related to the pay down of a portion of the credit agreement from certain of the proceeds of the $200 million senior subordinated notes issued on January 29, 2002.             Summary of Operations.     Net earnings in fiscal 2002 were $13.3 million compared to a net loss of $242.0 million in fiscal 2001. The increase in net earnings in fiscal 2002 compared to a net loss in fiscal 2001 was primarily due to lower operating earnings.    Fiscal 2001 compared to Fiscal 2000             We formally exited from Chapter 11 effective September 19, 2000, which we refer to as the "Plan Effective Date". For financial reporting purposes, we accounted for the consummation of the plan of reorganization effective September 16, 2000, the Saturday nearest the Plan Effective Date. Fresh-Start Reporting resulted in significant changes to the valuation of certain of our assets and liabilities, and to our stockholders' equity. With the adoption of Fresh-Start Reporting, a new entity was deemed created for financial reporting purposes. The periods prior to the Plan Effective Date have been designated "Predecessor Company" and the periods subsequent to the Plan Effective Date have been designated "Successor Company". As a result of the implementation of Fresh-Start Reporting and the substantial debt reduction from the completion of the plan of reorganization, the results of operations of the Successor Company and the Predecessor Company are not comparable. In order to provide a more meaningful analysis of the trends of certain operating accounts, management's discussion includes the pro forma combined results of the Successor Company's 20 weeks ended February 3, 2001 and the Predecessor Company's 33 weeks ended September 16, 2000.            The following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data (dollars in millions):             Successor Company     :  :      Predecessor Company             52 Weeks Ended  February 2, 2002     20 Weeks Ended  February 3, 2001     :  :      33 Weeks Ended  September 16, 2000             Amount     %     Amount     %     :      Amount     %       Sales     $  3,963.3     100.0  %  $  1,493.7     100.0  %  :     $  2,348.2     100.0  %                                          Gross profit     $  1,107.7     27.9  %  $  421.1     28.2  %  :     $  659.7     28.1  %    Selling, general and administrative expenses        (920.4  )  (23.2  )     (339.3  )  (22.7  )  :        (549.7  )  (23.4  )    Depreciation and amortization        (76.7  )  (1.9  )     (25.8  )  (1.7  )  :        (48.0  )  (2.1  )    Reorganization income (expense)                     7.4     0.5     :        (0.9  )         Amortization of goodwill        (265.5  )  (6.7  )     (98.5  )  (6.7  )  :                                                          Operating earnings (loss)        (154.9  )  (3.9  )     (35.1  )  (2.4  )  :        61.1     2.6       Interest expense, net        (65.3  )  (1.6  )     (27.7  )  (1.8  )  :        (99.1  )  (4.2  )                                          Loss before income taxes and extraordinary item        (220.2  )  (5.5  )     (62.8  )  (4.2  )  :        (38.0  )  (1.6  )    Income tax provision        (18.5  )  (0.5  )     (14.7  )  (1.0  )  :        (0.1  )                                               Loss before extraordinary item        (238.7  )  (6.0  )     (77.5  )  (5.2  )  :        (38.1  )  (1.6  )    Extraordinary item, net of tax        (3.3  )  (0.1  )               :        313.7     13.3                                             Net earnings (loss)     $  (242.0  )  (6.1  )%  $  (77.5  )  (5.2  )%  :     $  275.6     11.7  %                                            17                 Sales.     Sales in fiscal 2001 were $3.96 billion compared to sales on a combined Predecessor Company and Successor Company pro forma basis of $3.84 billion in fiscal 2000, an increase of 3.2%. Total sales, excluding the extra week in fiscal 2000, increased 5.1% in fiscal 2001. The sales increase in fiscal 2001 was primarily due to higher same-store sales (stores opened the entire year in both fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000, including replacement stores and enlargements and excluding the extra week in fiscal 2000) of 2.5% and new stores. Sales in fiscal 2001 also benefited from our various post-restructuring initiatives and increased promotional spending, such as double coupons. During fiscal 2001, we opened five new stores, closed two stores and completed 34 store renovations. We operated 141 and 138 stores at the end of fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000, respectively.            Gross Profit.     Gross profit represents the difference between sales and cost of goods, which includes the costs of inventory sold and the related purchase and distribution costs, net of earned vendor allowances and rebates. Gross profit in fiscal 2001 was $1.11 billion or 27.9% of sales compared to gross profit on a combined Predecessor Company and Successor Company pro forma basis of $1.08 billion or 28.1% of sales for fiscal 2000, which is comprised of 28.2% for the Successor Company's 20 weeks ended February 3, 2001 and 28.1% for the Predecessor Company's 33 weeks ended September 16, 2000. The increase in gross profit of $26.9 million for fiscal 2001 compared to the pro forma gross profit on a combined Predecessor Company and Successor Company basis for fiscal 2000 was due to higher sales, partially offset by higher promotional expenses and shrink. The decrease in gross profit percentage in fiscal 2001 was primarily due to the impact of our promotional initiatives to generate sales and higher shrink.             Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.     SG&A in fiscal 2001 increased $31.4 million or 3.5% compared to SG&A on a combined Predecessor Company and Successor Company pro forma basis for fiscal 2000. This increase in SG&A was primarily due to higher expenses related to store labor and related benefits and occupancy as well as preopening expenses of $2.5 million related to the six former Grand Union stores and a charge of $1.8 million related to closing of two stores on August 4, 2001, partially offset by income of $3.3 million resulting from the partial settlement of a lawsuit related to price fixing of prescription drugs. Included in the Predecessor Company's 33 weeks ended September 16, 2000 were gains on the sale of certain real estate of $1.8 million and included in the Successor Company's 20 weeks ended February 3, 2001 was an extra week. As a percentage of sales, SG&A was 23.2% in fiscal 2001 and 23.1% on a combined Predecessor Company and Successor Company pro forma basis in fiscal 2000, which is comprised of 22.7% for the Successor Company's 20 weeks ended February 3, 2001 and 23.4% for the Predecessor Company's 33 weeks ended September 16, 2000, respectively.            Depreciation and Amortization.     Depreciation and amortization was $76.7 million compared to $25.8 million in the Successor Company's 20 weeks ended February 3, 2001 and $48.0 million in the Predecessor Company's 33 weeks ended September 16, 2000. The depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2001 includes the impact of our increased capital expenditure program and technology initiatives.            Reorganization Income (Expense).     The Successor Company's reorganization income of $7.4 million in the 20 weeks ended February 3, 2001 represented a gain related to the difference between the settled lessor claims for rejected leases and the liability previously recorded for such claims by the Predecessor Company. The Predecessor Company's reorganization expenses of $0.9 million in the 33 weeks ended September 16, 2000 were comprised of $19.1 million of employee retention bonuses and professional fees related to legal, accounting and consulting services directly attributable to the plan of reorganization, net of a gain of $18.2 million related to the difference between the estimated lessor claims for rejected leases and the liabilities previously recorded for such leases.            Amortization of Goodwill.     Goodwill recorded in accordance with Fresh-Start Reporting was being amortized over three years, but in accordance with SFAS No. 142, effective with the beginning of fiscal 2002, the Successor Company will no longer amortize goodwill but rather will evaluate it at least annually for impairment. Amortization expense for the Successor Company was $265.5 million in fiscal 2001 and $98.5 million in the 20 weeks ended February 3, 2001.    18                 Operating Earnings (Loss).     The Successor Company's operating losses were $154.9 million in fiscal 2001 and $35.1 million in the 20 weeks ended February 3, 2001 compared to operating earnings of $61.1 million in the Predecessor Company's 33 weeks ended September 16, 2000. The Successor Company's operating losses were primarily due to the amortization of goodwill.            Interest Expense, Net.     The Successor Company's interest expense was $65.3 million in fiscal 2001 and $27.7 million in the 20 weeks ended February 3, 2001 compared to $99.1 million for the Predecessor Company's 33 weeks ended September 16, 2000. The Successor Company has lower interest expense compared to the Predecessor Company primarily due to the cancellation of $1.0 billion of the Predecessor Company's subordinated debt under our plan of reorganization. Interest expense in fiscal 2001 benefited from lower LIBOR borrowing rates under our credit agreement.            Income Tax Provision.     Refer to Note 19 of the consolidated financial statements for information related to our income taxes. During fiscal 2001, we made income tax payments of $1.0 million and received income tax refunds of $15,000. During fiscal 2000, we made income tax payments of $0.2 million and received income tax refunds of $0.5 million.            Extraordinary Item.     In fiscal 2001, the Successor Company's extraordinary item of $3.3 million, net of an income tax benefit of $2.3 million, represents costs incurred resulting from the early extinguishment of debt, including the write-off of deferred financing costs, related to the pay down of a portion of the credit agreement from certain of the proceeds of the $200 million senior subordinated notes issued on January 29, 2002. In the 33 weeks ended September 16, 2000, the Predecessor Company's extraordinary item of $313.7 million, net of an income tax provision of $46.6 million, represents income from the cancellation of debt related to the exchange of bond indebtedness and accrued interest for common stock and warrants; such income was reduced by the write-off of deferred financing costs related to the former bank credit facility and bond indebtedness subject to exchange.            Summary of Operations.     The Successor Company's net loss in fiscal 2001 was $242.0 million compared to a net loss of $77.5 million in the 20 weeks ended February 3, 2001 and net earnings of $275.6 million in the Predecessor Company's 33 weeks ended September 16, 2000. The Successor Company's net losses were primarily due to the amortization of goodwill; the Predecessor Company's net earnings included an extraordinary item of $313.7 million, net of tax.     Liquidity and Capital Resources             As a result of the substantial debt reduction resulting from the plan of reorganization in fiscal 2000, our debt service and liquidity have improved significantly compared to the Predecessor Company's financial condition.            Cash Flows.     The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of cash flow data (in millions):             Successor Company     :  :      Predecessor  Company             52 Weeks  Ended  February 1,  2003     52 Weeks  Ended  February 2,  2002     20 Weeks  Ended  February 3,  2001     :      33 Weeks  Ended  September 16,  2000       Cash provided by (used for):                                                    Operating activities     $  92.0     $  82.6     $  39.9     :     $  26.1          Investing activities        (105.3  )     (116.5  )     (19.9  )  :        (15.5  )       Financing activities                (26.1  )     (9.9  )  :        47.7                  The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to a reduction in cash interest paid as a result of the timing of cash interest payments related to the senior subordinated notes issued on January 29, 2002. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal    19         2001 compared to a combined Predecessor Company and Successor Company pro forma basis in fiscal 2000 was primarily due to the reduction in cash interest paid due to the cancellation of $1 billion of the Predecessor Company's subordinated debt under our plan of reorganization and the increase in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to a decrease in property and equipment expenditures. The increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2001 compared to a combined Predecessor Company and Successor Company pro forma basis in fiscal 2000 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures, including technology investments. The change in financing activities in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to borrowings under lease financings and the working capital facility in fiscal 2002. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2001 compared to a combined Predecessor Company and Successor Company pro forma basis in fiscal 2000 was primarily due to debt and lease paydowns in fiscal 2001 compared to the impact of the plan of reorganization in fiscal 2000.            Debt Service and Liquidity.     On January 29, 2002, we issued $200 million aggregate principal amount of unregistered 8.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 (the "Notes"), which pay cash interest on a semi-annual basis. The proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding loans under our bank credit facility and to repay, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002, $6.4 million of our outstanding industrial revenue bonds. During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we completed an exchange offer pursuant to which all of the Notes were exchanged for $200 million aggregate principal amount of our registered 8.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 (the "Senior Subordinated Notes"). The Senior Subordinated Notes are unconditionally guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest by the subsidiary guarantors and contain customary covenants. The indenture related to the Senior Subordinated Notes restricts the payment of cash dividends. We are in compliance with all Senior Subordinated Notes covenants as of February 1, 2003.            Upon the completion of our plan of reorganization, we entered into a credit agreement, dated as of September 19, 2000, with a group of lenders led by JP Morgan Chase Bank (the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement initially consisted of (a) term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $425 million (consisting of $125 million in Term Loan A and $300 million in Term Loan B) and (b) a $175 million revolving working capital facility (including a maximum of $125 million in letters of credit). After giving effect to the prepayment of indebtedness with the proceeds of the offering of the Senior Subordinated Notes, the Company had no indebtedness under Term Loan A and $218.0 million under Term Loan B.             The Credit Agreement requires the Company to meet certain financial tests including, without limitation, a maximum total debt to consolidated EBITDA (leverage) ratio, a minimum consolidated interest and rental expense coverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge ratio and a minimum consolidated EBITDA. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains certain covenants which, among other things, places limits on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, issuance of cash-pay preferred stock, repurchase of Company stock, incurrence of liens, sale-leaseback transactions, hedging activities, sale or discount of receivables, investments, loans, advances, guarantees, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, capital expenditures, mergers and consolidations, changing lines of business, dividends or prepayments of other indebtedness, amendments to the organizational documents and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including without limitation, payment defaults, material breaches of representations and warranties, material covenant defaults, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and a change of control. In addition, the Credit Agreement prohibits the payment of cash dividends. The Company is in compliance with all covenants as of February 1, 2003.            On January 28, 2003, the Company amended its Credit Agreement. Pursuant to this amendment, among other things, the maximum permitted leverage ratio has been increased through fiscal 2004, the minimum consolidated interest and rental expense coverage ratio has been decreased through 2004, the minimum permitted consolidated EBITDA has been decreased through fiscal 2004, and a minimum fixed-charge coverage ratio covenant has been added. Additionally, the Company has agreed to (i) an increase in the commitment fee on the revolver portion of the Credit Agreement of 25.0 basis points; and (ii) an increase in the applicable interest rates payable on outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement of 50.0 basis points.    20                 Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates equal to LIBOR, which was 1.3% as of February 1, 2003, plus an applicable rate, subject to decrease, depending on the total debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio. Effective January 28, 2003, the interest rate thereunder increased from LIBOR plus 3.0% to LIBOR plus 3.5% for borrowings under the working capital facility and from LIBOR plus 4.0% to LIBOR plus 4.5% for borrowings under Term Loan B. The Company is required to repay a portion of the borrowing under the term loan each year, so as to retire such indebtedness in its entirety by July 15, 2007. The working capital facility expires on July 15, 2005. The weighted average interest rate in effect on all borrowings under the term loan was 7.7% during fiscal 2002. As of February 1, 2003 and April 2, 2003, borrowings under the working capital facility were $10.0 million and $7.1 million, respectively, and outstanding letters of credit were $40.3 million and $41.3 million, respectively.             All of the obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company's 100% owned subsidiaries, except the Company's nonguarantor subsidiaries, which are comprised of four 100% owned and consolidated single-purpose entities. Each of these single-purpose entities owns the real estate on which a supermarket leased to Pathmark is located. The obligations under the Credit Agreement and those of the subsidiaries guaranteeing the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company's tangible and intangible assets including, without limitation, intellectual property, real property, including leasehold interests, and the capital stock in each of these subsidiaries.            The following table presents significant obligations as of February 1, 2003 (in millions):             Self-  Insured  Claims  Liabilities     Post-  Employment  Benefits     Capital  Leases     Operating  Leases     Debt     Total       2003     $  20.8     $  0.5     $  36.4     $  45.7     $  12.3     $  115.7       2004        12.0        0.4        33.9        44.4        1.3        92.0       2005        8.7        0.4        30.5        43.5        54.8        137.9       2006        6.5        0.4        25.5        40.3        108.4        181.1       2007        4.4        0.3        24.0        36.9        54.6        120.2       Thereafter        12.5        5.9        250.8        319.0        220.3        808.5                                       Total        64.9        7.9        401.1        529.8        451.7        1,455.4       Less: present-value interest        (2.7  )     (1.9  )     (199.9  )                     (204.5  )                                    Present value of obligations     $  62.2     $  6.0     $  201.2     $  529.8     $  451.7     $  1,250.9                                                  The $40.3 million in letters of credit outstanding as of February 1, 2003 expire and are renewable in fiscal 2003.            In addition, we outsourced a major portion of our distribution, trucking and information system functions through long-term agreements as follows:       In April 2001, we entered into a five-year outsourcing agreement with IBM to continue to provide a wide range of information systems services, which commenced in 1991. Under the agreement, IBM provides data center operations, mainframe processing, business applications and systems development to enhance our customer service and efficiency. The charges under this agreement are based upon the services requested at predetermined rates. We may terminate the agreement upon 90 days notice with a payment of a specified termination charge.  We have a 15-year supply agreement with C&S, expiring in fiscal 2013, pursuant to which C&S supplies substantially all of our grocery, frozen and perishable merchandise requirements. Under our arrangement with C&S, we negotiate prices, discounts and promotions with vendors. During fiscal 2002, the products supplied from C&S accounted for approximately 60% of all of our supermarket inventory purchases. This agreement may be terminated for cause or certain events of bankruptcy by either party.    21             We also have an agreement, expiring in fiscal 2014, with a local trucking company to provide us with trucking services. We may terminate this agreement with a payment of a specified termination charge.             Capital Expenditures.     Capital expenditures, including property acquired under capital leases and technology investments, were $121.1 million for fiscal 2002 compared to $130.5 million for fiscal 2001 and $24.4 million in the Successor Company's 20 weeks ended February 3, 2001 and $42.5 million in the Predecessor Company's 33 weeks ended September 16, 2000. During fiscal 2002, we opened seven new stores (including one former Grand Union store we purchased in fiscal 2001), three of which were replacement stores, closed one store and renovated 11 stores; in addition, we have installed new point-of-sale equipment in all our stores and self-checkout systems in 73 stores. During fiscal 2001, we purchased six former Grand Union stores and opened five of them as Pathmark stores; in addition, we renovated 34 stores and closed two stores. In 2003, our capital expenditure plan is to invest approximately $95 million in new stores, major store renovations and technology investments. During fiscal 2003, we expect to open three new stores, one of which will be a replacement store, close one store and complete 16 store renovations.    Critical Accounting Policies             The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The following accounting policies are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our financial statements.             Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.     It is our accounting policy to assess the carrying value of our long-lived assets for possible impairment based on an individual store basis to determine if the carrying value of such assets are recoverable from their related undiscounted cash flows. We estimated future cash flows based on several economic and business assumptions and have concluded that there is no impairment of such assets at February 1, 2003. However, our estimates project cash flow several years into the future and could be affected by variable factors such as inflation and economic conditions.            Impairment of Goodwill.     The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 effective with the beginning of fiscal 2002. With the adoption of SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer being amortized but rather is being evaluated for impairment at least annually. Based on an independent evaluation of its fair value completed when SFAS No. 142 was adopted in the first quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company concluded that there was no impairment of its goodwill. The Company performed its annual evaluation of its goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, and, based on an independent evaluation of its fair value, concluded that there was no impairment of its goodwill. Since such impairment evaluation is based on several economic and business assumptions, the goodwill impairment evaluation in the future could be affected by changes in these business and economic conditions, changes in consumer spending, the competitive environment in which the Company operates and other risks detailed elsewhere in this report.             Pension Plans.     Pension income for all Company pension plans was $9.0 million for fiscal 2002, $8.8 million for fiscal 2001 and $11.1 million on a combined Predecessor Company and Successor Company    pro forma basis for fiscal 2000 and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on our qualified plan (the "Qualified Plan") assets of 9.5%. In developing our expected long-term rate of return assumption, we evaluated input from our actuaries, including their review of asset class return expectations by several respected consultants and economists as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants and economists are based on broad equity and bond indices. We also considered our historical 10-year and 20-year compounded returns of 11.6% and 13.3%, respectively, which have been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices, despite the recent market downturn in which our Qualified Plan assets had a loss of 6.1% for fiscal 2002. Our expected long-term rate of return on Qualified Plan assets have been based on an asset allocation assumption of 70% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 11%, and 30% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 6%. Because of market fluctuation, our actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2002 was 66% with equity managers and 34% with fixed income managers. We    22         believe, however, that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 70% with equity managers and 30% with fixed income managers. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. As part of our on-going process to evaluate our actuarial assumptions, including our expected rate of return, we are reducing our expected long-term rate of return from 9.50% to 9.00% in fiscal 2003. A 0.5% reduction in our expected long-term rate of return on Qualified Plan assets, holding all other factors constant, would have reduced our pension income for fiscal 2002 by approximately $1.3 million. A 0.25% reduction in our discount rate and salary increase assumptions, holding all other factors constant, would have reduced our pension income for fiscal 2002 by approximately $0.2 million.             We base our determination of pension expense or income on a market-related valuation of assets which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a three-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a three-year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. Over the 20 years prior to our plan of reorganization in fiscal 2000, we had generated and amortized unrecognized net actuarial gains. As a result of our plan of reorganization in fiscal 2000, unrecognized net actuarial gains of approximately $56.3 million were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as part of Fresh-Start Reporting. Since the completion of our plan of reorganization, we generated unrecognized net actuarial losses due to the unfavorable performance of the equity markets. As of February 1, 2003, we had cumulative losses of approximately $71.7 million, which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of assets. These unrecognized net actuarial losses result in decreases in our future pension income depending on several factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions".            The discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension obligations is based on a review of long-term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency. The discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from 7.25% at February 2, 2002 to 6.50% at February 1, 2003.            Due to the effect of the unrecognized actuarial losses and based on an expected rate of return on our Qualified Plan assets of 9.0%, a discount rate of 6.50% and various other assumptions, we estimate that our pension income for all pension plans will approximate $6.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million in fiscal 2003, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005, respectively. Future actual pension income will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension plans.            The value of our Qualified Plan assets has decreased from $240.5 million at December 31, 2001 to $218.4 million at December 31, 2002. The investment performance returns and declining discount rates have reduced our overfunded Qualified Plan, net of benefit obligations, from $91.5 million at December 31, 2001 to $56.8 million at December 31, 2002. Despite the recent reductions in the funded status of our Qualified Plan, we believe that, based on our actuarial assumptions and due to the overfunded status of our Qualified Plan, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to our Qualified Plan for at least the next three years.             Self-Insured Claims Liabilities and Postemployment Benefits.     We are self insured for claims relating to customer, associate and vehicle accidents, as well as associate medical and disability benefits, and we maintain third-party excess insurance coverage for such claims. It is our accounting policy to record a self-insured liability, as determined actuarially on a consistent basis, based on the facts and circumstances of each individual claim filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported discounted at a risk-free interest rate. All claims and their related liabilities are reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis. Any actuarial projection of losses concerning such claims is subject to variability primarily due to external factors affecting future inflation rates, litigation trends, benefit levels and claim settlement patterns. At February 1, 2003, liabilities for self-insured claims and benefits were $62.2 million and for postemployment benefits were $6.0 million.    23         New Accounting Pronouncements             In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 requires that asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and depreciation over the useful life of the related assets. The provisions of SFAS No. 143 are required to be adopted effective with the beginning of fiscal 2003. The Company believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 143 will not have an impact on its financial position or results of operations.            In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." SFAS No. 145, among other things, rescinds the provisions of SFAS No. 4 that requires companies to classify certain gains and losses from debt extinguishments as extraordinary items and amends the provisions of SFAS No. 13 to require that certain lease modifications be treated as sale-leaseback transactions. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 related to classifications of debt extinguishments are effective with the beginning of fiscal 2003. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 145 in fiscal 2003 by applying Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 30 to all gains and losses related to extinguishment of debt. Gains and losses from extinguishment of debt will be classified within income from operations; upon adoption, prior year extraordinary items will be reclassified within income from operations. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 related to lease modification are effective for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002 and did not have an impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.            In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," which addresses financial accounting and reporting for cost associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). "SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the exit plan commitment date. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 146 will not have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations.            In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN No. 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit. It also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee, the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value, or market value, of the obligation it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements. The provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor's obligations do not apply to guarantees accounted for as derivatives. The initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure provisions are effective for fiscal 2002 (see Note 25). The Company does not expect adopting the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.            In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure," which amends SFAS No. 123. "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 and APB Opinion No. 28, "Interim Financial Reporting," to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company continues to apply APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and has adopted the amendments to SFAS No. 123 required in SFAS No. 148 for fiscal 2002 year-end reporting. The Company will adopt the amendment to APB Opinion No. 28 required in SFAS No. 148 for quarterly reporting in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.             In January 2003, FIN No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," was issued. This interpretation requires a company to consolidate variable interest entities ("VIE") if the enterprise is a primary beneficiary (holds a majority of the variable interest) of the VIE and the VIE possesses specific    24           characteristics. It also requires additional disclosure for parties involved with VIEs. The provisions of FIN No. 46 are effective for fiscal 2003. Since the Company does not have any unconsolidated VIEs, the adoption of FIN No. 46 will not have an impact on its financial position or results of operations.    NAME="de4370_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02669">      Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk                 Our financial results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt, which carries variable interest rates. As part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to interest rate risk, in July 2001, we entered into a three-year interest rate zero-cost collar, consisting of a cap with a strike of 10.5% and a floor with a strike of 8.89%, on a notional amount of $150 million of our term loan. Variable rate debt outstanding under our term loan was $217.3 million on February 1, 2003. As of February 1, 2003, the weighted average interest rate in effect on all borrowings under our term loan, including the impact of the zero-cost collar on $150 million of our term loan, was 7.7%. A 1% change in interest rates applied to the $67.3 million balance of floating-rate term loan debt would affect pre-tax annual results of operations by approximately $0.7 million. We also have $200 million of Senior Subordinated Notes outstanding on February 1, 2003, which bear interest payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 8.75%, and are therefore not subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations.             The principal objective of our investment management activities is to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to facilitate our funding needs. As part of our risk management, we may use additional derivative financial products such as interest rate hedges and interest rate swaps in the future.    25       NAME="page_fa4370_1_26">        NAME="fa4370_item_8._consolidated_financial_statements">      Item 8.
