ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and         Results of Operations      The matters discussed herein, with the exception of historical information, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the competitive environment in which the Company operates and the general economic conditions in the Company's trading areas.  Results of Operations      Fiscal 1997 v. Fiscal 1996        Sales: Sales in Fiscal 1997 were $3.70 billion compared to $3.71  billion in the prior year, a decrease of 0.4%. Same store sales increased  0.8% for the year. Sales in Fiscal 1997 compared to Fiscal 1996 were also  impacted by new store openings and remodels, offset by sold and closed  stores. During Fiscal 1997, the Company opened two new Pathmark stores,  completed 13 major renovations and enlargements to existing supermarkets, and  sold four and closed seven stores. The Company operated 135 and 144  supermarkets at the end of Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal 1996, respectively.        Gross Profit: Gross profit in Fiscal 1997 was $1.04 billion or 28.2% of sales compared to $1.09 billion or 29.4% of sales for the prior year. The decrease in gross profit in both dollars and as a percentage of sales for Fiscal 1997 compared to the prior year was due to the promotional pricing program introduced during the first quarter of Fiscal 1997, as well as the pre-Thanksgiving holiday promotions during the third quarter of Fiscal 1997. The cost of goods sold comparisons were impacted by a pretax LIFO credit of $5.4 million and $1.3 million in Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal 1996, respectively. The pretax LIFO credit for Fiscal 1997 includes a $2.0 million gain on a LIFO liquidation related to the sale of the Company's pharmaceutical warehouse inventory and a $0.8 million gain on a LIFO liquidation related to the sale of the Company's grocery, frozen and perishable merchandise in connection with the C&S Supply Agreement (see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements at Item 8, Part II of this Form 10-K).        Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SG&A"): SG&A in Fiscal 1997 decreased $16.4 million or 1.9% compared to the prior year. As a percentage of sales, SG&A was 22.8% in Fiscal 1997, down from 23.1% in the prior year. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales in Fiscal 1997 compared to the prior year was primarily due to lower administrative, advertising, claims and utilities expenses, partially offset by higher store labor expenses.        Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation and amortization of $83.4 million in Fiscal 1997 was $5.6 million lower than the prior year of $89.0 million. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in Fiscal 1997 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a pretax charge of $5.4 million in Fiscal 1996 to write down fixed assets held for sale, principally in the Company's southern region, partially offset by capital expenditures in Fiscal 1997. Depreciation and amortization excludes video tape amortization, which is recorded in cost of goods sold, of $3.4 million and $3.1 million in Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal 1996, respectively.        Operating Earnings: Operating earnings in Fiscal 1997 were $119.3 million compared to the prior year of $127.1 million. The decrease in operating earnings in Fiscal 1997 compared to the prior year was primarily due to lower gross profit, partially offset by lower SG&A and depreciation expense in Fiscal 1997 and the restructuring charge and the lease commitment charge in Fiscal 1996.                                         13          Interest Expense: Interest expense was $164.2 million in Fiscal 1997 compared to $161.5 million in the prior year. The increase in interest expense in Fiscal 1997 compared to the prior year was primarily due to increases in lease obligations and the debt accretion on the Deferred Coupon Notes, partially offset by lower amortization of debt issuance costs.        Income Taxes: The income tax benefit was $16.7 million and $14.4 million in Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal 1996, respectively. The 1997 benefit is net of a $1.9 million increase in the valuation allowance related to the Company's deferred income tax assets. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred income tax assets of $54.0 million at January 31, 1998 will be realized through the implementation of tax strategies which could generate taxable income.        During Fiscal 1997, the Company made income tax payments of $4.8 million and received income tax refunds of $4.3 million. During Fiscal 1996, the Company made income tax payments of $4.6 million and received income tax refunds of $5.5 million.        Extraordinary Items: During the second quarter of Fiscal 1997, in connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company wrote off deferred financing fees of $12.8 million related to the former bank credit agreement, resulting in a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $7.4 million. In addition, during the second quarter of Fiscal 1997, in connection with the sale of certain mortgaged property, the Company made a mortgage paydown of $2.9 million, including accrued interest and debt premiums, resulting in a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.1 million.        During the second quarter of Fiscal 1996, in connection with the sale of certain mortgaged property, the Company made a mortgage paydown of $5.3 million, including accrued interest and debt premiums, resulting in a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million. During the first quarter of Fiscal 1996, in connection with the termination of the Plainbridge, Inc. credit agreement due to the reacquisition of Plainbridge, Inc. by Pathmark, the Company wrote off deferred financing fees resulting in a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million.        Summary of Operations: For Fiscal 1997, the Company's net loss was $35.7 million compared to a net loss of $20.8 million for the prior year. The increase in net loss in Fiscal 1997 compared to the prior year was primarily due to lower operating earnings, the extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt and higher interest expense, partially offset by a higher income tax benefit.        EBITDA-FIFO: EBITDA-FIFO was $201.2 million and $236.4 million in Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal 1996, respectively. EBITDA-FIFO represents net earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, the LIFO charge (credit) and unusual transactions. EBITDA-FIFO is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company's ability to service and/or incur debt and should not be construed as an alternative to, or a better indicator of, operating income or cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.      Fiscal 1996 (52-week year)  v. Fiscal 1995 (53-week year)        Sales: Sales in Fiscal 1996 were $3.71 billion compared to $3.97 billion in Fiscal 1995. Sales comparisons were impacted by the extra week in the prior year and the disposition of the freestanding drug stores during Fiscal 1995. Sales generated by the freestanding drug stores were $110.8 million in Fiscal 1995. Same store sales from supermarkets decreased 2.8% for the year primarily due to a significant increase in competitive new store openings and remodels, particularly in the Company's southern region.                                         14    During Fiscal 1996, the Company opened four new Pathmark stores, two of which replaced smaller stores, and completed 21 major renovations and enlargements to existing supermarkets. Two stores were closed and not replaced during the year. The Company operated 144 supermarkets at the end of both Fiscal 1996 and Fiscal 1995.        Gross Profit: Gross profit in Fiscal 1996 was $1.09 billion or 29.4% of sales compared with $1.13 billion or 28.6% of sales in Fiscal 1995. Excluding the impact of the disposition of the freestanding drug stores, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 28.8% in Fiscal 1995. The improvement in gross profit, as a percentage of sales in Fiscal 1996 compared to Fiscal 1995, was primarily due to increased focus on merchandising programs, the impact of the disposition of the freestanding drug stores, as well as the Company's continuing emphasis on the Pathmark 2000 format stores which allow expanded variety in all departments particularly high margin perishables. The decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to the lower sales. The cost of goods sold comparisons were affected by a pretax LIFO credit of $1.3 million and a pretax LIFO charge of $1.1 million in Fiscal 1996 and Fiscal 1995, respectively.        Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SG&A"): SG&A decreased $8.4 million or 1.0% in Fiscal 1996 compared with Fiscal 1995. SG&A, on a proforma basis eliminating the SG&A impact of the freestanding drug stores, increased 2.0% in Fiscal 1996 compared to Fiscal 1995. As a percentage of sales, SG&A were 23.1% in Fiscal 1996, up from 21.8% in Fiscal 1995 due to the impact of lower sales, higher labor and labor related expenses, claims expenses and occupancy costs, partially offset by lower advertising expenses and the impact of the disposition of the freestanding drug stores in Fiscal 1995. SG&A for Fiscal 1996 also included a first quarter provision of $5.8 million representing the termination costs for two former executives of the Company, a first quarter gain of $5.6 million recognized on the sale of certain real estate and a second quarter curtailment gain of $2.0 million due to the elimination of postretirement medical coverage for active non-union associates. SG&A for Fiscal 1995 also included a fourth quarter gain of $3.4 million recognized on the sale of a former warehouse of Purity Supreme, Inc., a previously divested company.        Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation and amortization of $89.0 million in Fiscal 1996 was $8.6 million higher than $80.4 million in Fiscal 1995. The increase for Fiscal 1996 was primarily due to a pretax charge of $5.4 million to write down certain fixed assets held for sale, principally in the Company's southern region, to their estimated net realizable values and capital expenditures. Depreciation and amortization excludes video tape amortization, which is recorded in cost of goods sold, of $3.1 million and $2.8 million in Fiscal 1996 and Fiscal 1995, respectively.        Restructuring Charge: During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 1996, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $9.1 million for reorganization and restructuring costs related to its administrative operations. The restructuring charge included $4.2 million for the costs of a voluntary early retirement program and $1.2 million for severance and termination benefits. The remaining charge of $3.7 million primarily relates to consulting fees incurred in connection with the restructuring and exit costs for facility consolidation.        Lease Commitment Charge: During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 1996, the Company decided to divest a group of its southern region stores, certain of which have experienced unprofitable operating results. The Company concluded that the operating losses being experienced by these stores were other than temporary and that the projected operating results of such stores would not be sufficient to recover their long-lived assets and their contractual lease commitments. Further, the Company believes that these lease costs will not be significantly recoverable through any future sublease. Therefore, the Company recorded a $8.8 million pretax charge related to these unfavorable lease commitments, in addition to writing down the long-lived assets of these stores (see "Depreciation and Amortization" above).                                         15           Operating Earnings: Operating earnings for Fiscal 1996 were $127.1 million compared with $203.4 million for Fiscal 1995. The decrease in operating earnings during Fiscal 1996 compared to Fiscal 1995 was due to lower sales, higher depreciation and amortization expense, the restructuring charge and the lease commitment charge in Fiscal 1996 and the gain on disposition of freestanding drug stores in Fiscal 1995, partially offset by lower SG&A.        Interest Expense: Interest expense was $161.5 million for Fiscal 1996 compared to $164.7 million in Fiscal 1995 primarily due to reductions in the Term Loan along with lower interest rates.        Income Taxes: The income tax benefit for Fiscal 1996 was $14.4 million. The income tax provision for Fiscal 1995 was $5.9 million reflecting the reversal of the valuation allowance of $9.1 million related to the Company's deferred income tax assets. The reversal was recorded in conjunction with the Company's continuing evaluation of its deferred income tax assets.        During Fiscal 1996, the Company made income tax payments of $4.6 million and received income tax refunds of $5.5 million. During Fiscal 1995, the Company made income tax payments of $21.9 million and received income tax refunds of $10.3 million.        Extraordinary Items: During the first quarter of Fiscal 1996, in connection with the termination of the Plainbridge, Inc. credit agreement due to the reacquisition of Plainbridge, Inc. by Pathmark, the Company wrote off deferred financing fees resulting in a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million. During the second quarter of Fiscal 1996, in connection with the proceeds from the sale of certain mortgaged property, the Company made a mortgage paydown of $5.3 million, including accrued interest and debt premiums, resulting in a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million.        Summary of Operations: The Company's net loss in Fiscal 1996 was $20.8 million compared to net earnings of $32.7 million in Fiscal 1995. The decrease in net earnings for Fiscal 1996 compared to Fiscal 1995 was due to lower operating earnings in Fiscal 1996, partially offset by lower interest expense and an income tax benefit in Fiscal 1996 compared to an income tax provision in Fiscal 1995.  EBITDA-FIFO: EBITDA-FIFO was $236.4 million in Fiscal 1996 and $268.9 million in Fiscal 1995, respectively.  Financial Condition      Debt Service: During Fiscal 1997, total long-term debt decreased $38.7 million from Fiscal 1996 year end primarily due to a net decrease in borrowings under the Credit Agreement compared to the former credit agreement and a decrease in certain mortgages, partially offset by debt accretion on the Deferred Coupon Notes. In addition, during Fiscal 1997, total lease obligations decreased $3.9 million from Fiscal 1996.      On January 29, 1998, the Company sold its fee and leasehold interests in the Facilities to C&S for approximately $104 million (approximately $60 million, excluding inventory) in connection with the C&S Purchase Agreement. Simultaneously, Pathmark and C&S commenced the 15 year Supply Agreement, pursuant to which C&S will supply Pathmark with substantially all of its grocery, frozen and perishable merchandise requirements. In conjunction with the C&S Purchase Agreement, the Company used $32.5 million of the net proceeds to pay down a portion of the Term Loan. The remainder of the net proceeds were used to pay down the Working Capital Facility and invest in marketable securities of $52.0 million at January 31, 1998. As a result, there were no borrowings under the Working Capital Facility at January 31, 1998. However, subsequent to Fiscal 1997, the Company utilized its marketable securities and borrowings                                          16     under the Working Capital Facility, which have increased to $15.0 million at  April 21, 1998, primarily to paydown trade accounts payable related to the  inventory sold in connection with the C&S Purchase Agreement and other  liabilities.      During the second quarter of Fiscal 1997, the Company sold four supermarkets that it announced for divestiture at the end of Fiscal 1996 for $14.9 million and sold two former drug stores for $11.1 million. There was no gain or loss recognized on these transactions. The proceeds were used to paydown a portion of the former working capital facility and related mortgages.      On June 30, 1997, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement with a group of lenders led by The Chase Manhattan Bank. The Credit Agreement includes a $300 million Term Loan and a $200 million Working Capital Facility. In connection with this refinancing, the Company repaid in full the former term loan ($230.5 million) and the former working capital facility ($57.5 million) with the borrowings obtained under the Credit Agreement.      Under the Credit Agreement, the Term Loan and Working Capital Facility bear interest at floating rates, ranging from LIBOR plus 2.25% to LIBOR plus 2.50%. The Company is required to repay a portion of its borrowings under the Term Loan each year, so as to retire such indebtedness in its entirety by December 15, 2001. Under the Working Capital Facility, which expires on June 15, 2001, the Company can borrow or obtain letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $200 million, of which the maximum of $125 million can be in letters of credit. In addition, pursuant to a Permitted Subordinated Debt Refinancing (as defined in the Credit Agreement), the Working Capital Facility and a portion of the Term Loan can be extended up to an additional two and one-half years and the remainder of the Term Loan can be extended up to an additional three and one-half years from the original expiration dates.      The Company is required to make sinking fund payments on the Subordinated Notes (as defined in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Item 8, Part II of this Form 10-K) in the amount of 25% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Subordinated Notes on each of June 15, 2000 and June 15, 2001. The Subordinated Debentures (as defined in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Item 8, Part II of this Form 10-K) and the remaining Subordinated Notes mature on June 15, 2002. The Senior Subordinated Notes (as defined in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Item 8, Part II of this Form 10-K) and the Deferred Coupon Notes mature in Fiscal 2003. The Company has no payment obligations, through intercompany notes or otherwise, with respect to its parent's indebtedness.      The majority of the cash interest payments are scheduled in the second and fourth quarters.      The amounts of principal payments required each year on outstanding long-term debt (excluding the original issue discount with respect to the Deferred Coupon Notes) are as follows (dollars in millions):                                                           Principal             Fiscal Years                               Payments             ------------                               --------                       1998...........................      $   43.5                 1999...........................          14.9                 2000...........................          78.2                 2001...........................         263.8                 2002...........................         195.8                 2003...........................         625.2                                           17        Liquidity: The consolidated financial statements of the Company indicate that, at January 31, 1998, current liabilities exceeded current assets by $109.3 million and stockholder's deficiency was $1.08 billion. Management believes that cash flows generated from operations, supplemented by the unused borrowing capacity under the Working Capital Facility (refer to Notes 1 and 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Item 8, Part II of this Form 10-K) and the availability of capital lease financing will be sufficient to pay the Company's debts as they come due, provide for its capital expenditure program and meet its other cash requirements.     The Company believes that it will be able to make the scheduled payments or refinance its obligations with respect to its indebtedness through a combination of operating funds and borrowing facilities. Future refinancing will be necessary if the Company's cash flow from operations is not sufficient to meet its debt service requirements related to the maturity of a portion of the Term Loan and Working Capital Facility in Fiscal 2001, and the maturity of the Subordinated Notes and Subordinated Debentures in Fiscal 2002. The Company expects that it will be necessary to refinance all or a portion of the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Deferred Coupon Notes due in Fiscal 2003. The Company may undertake a refinancing of some or all of such indebtedness sometime prior to its maturity. The Company was in compliance with its various debt covenants at January 31, 1998 and, based on management's operating projections for Fiscal 1998, the Company believes that it will continue to be in compliance with its various debt covenants. The Company's ability to make scheduled payments, to refinance or otherwise meet its obligations with respect to its indebtedness depends on its financial and operating performance, which in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond its control. Although the Company's cash flow from its operations and borrowings has been sufficient to meet its debt service obligations, there can be no assurance that the Company's operating results will continue to be sufficient or that future borrowing facilities will be available for payment or refinancing of the Company's indebtedness.     While it is the Company's intention to enter into other refinancings that it considers advantageous, there can be no assurances that the prevailing market conditions will be favorable to the Company. In the event the Company obtains any future refinancing on less than favorable terms, the holders of outstanding indebtedness could experience increased credit risk and could experience a decrease in the market value of their investment, because the Company might be forced to operate under terms that would restrict its operations and might find its cash flow reduced.      Capital Expenditures: Capital expenditures for Fiscal 1997, including property acquired under capital leases, were $57.9 million compared to $94.1 million for Fiscal 1996 and $110.6 million for Fiscal 1995. During Fiscal 1997, the Company opened two new Pathmark stores, completed 13 major renovations and enlargements to existing supermarkets, and sold four and closed seven stores. During Fiscal 1998, the Company plans to open up two new Pathmark stores, close one store and complete up to an aggregate of 19 major renovations and enlargements. Capital expenditures for Fiscal 1998, including property to be acquired under capital leases, are estimated to be $70.0 million. Management believes that cash flows generated from operations, supplemented by the unused borrowing capacity under the Working Capital Facility and the availability of capital lease financing will be sufficient to provide for the Company's capital expenditure program.      Cash Flows: Cash provided by operating activities amounted to $56.5 million in Fiscal 1997 compared to $73.6 million in the prior year. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in the net loss and an increase in cash used for operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by investing activities was $95.5 million in Fiscal 1997 compared to cash used for investing activities of $46.8 million in the prior year. The increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to an increase in proceeds related to the C&S Purchase Agreement, property dispositions and a decrease in expenditures of property and equipment. Cash used for financing activities was $101.8                                          18     million in Fiscal 1997 compared to $28.6 million in the prior year. The increase in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings in conjunction with the Credit Agreement, net of repaying in full the former term loan and former working capital facility in Fiscal 1997, the proceeds from the lease financing of three supermarket locations in Fiscal 1996, a decrease in book overdrafts and an increase in deferred financing fees related to the Credit Agreement in Fiscal 1997.      Cash provided by operating activities amounted to $73.6 million in Fiscal 1996 compared to $118.3 million in Fiscal 1995. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decline in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities and a decrease in net earnings. Cash used for investing activities in Fiscal 1996 was $46.8 million due to expenditures of property and equipment of $55.0 million, offset by proceeds from property dispositions of $8.2 million. Cash used for investing activities in Fiscal 1995 was $0.7 million primarily due to property and equipment expenditures of $69.5 million, partially offset by the net proceeds from the disposition of the freestanding drug stores of $59.9 million, the proceeds from the sale of real estate of $3.4 million and the proceeds from the disposal of home centers segment of $4.7 million. Cash used for financing activities in Fiscal 1996 was $28.6 million compared to $128.0 million in Fiscal 1995. The decrease in cash used for financing activities is primarily due to an increase in borrowings under the former working capital facility, the proceeds from the lease financing of three supermarket locations, a decrease in dividends to PTK and a paydown of $25.0 million on the Term Loan in Fiscal 1995 in conjunction with the disposition of the freestanding drug stores. During Fiscal 1995, the Company paid a dividend to PTK of $26.5 million from the net proceeds related to the disposition of the freestanding drug stores and the sale of the home centers segment.      Year 2000 Compliance: The Company has initiated a program to prepare the Company's computer systems and applications for the year 2000. This is necessary because computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year. Any of the Company's computer programs that have time-sensitive software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000. This could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations, including, among other things, a temporary inability to process normal business transactions.      The Company expects that the principal costs will be those associated  with the remediation and testing of its computer applications. Through IBM,  this effort is under way across the Company, and is following a process of  inventory, scoping and analysis, modification, testing and certification, and  implementation. A major portion of these costs will be met under the existing  agreement with IBM through a reprioritization of technology development  initiatives, with the remainder representing incremental costs (refer to Note  22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Item 8, Part II of  this Form 10-K). The Company does not believe that the total cost of such  compliance will be material. Additionally, the Company believes, based on  available information, that it will be able to manage its total year 2000  transition without any material adverse effect on its operations.      In addition, the Company is communicating with major vendors to determine the extent to which the Company is vulnerable to third-party year 2000 compliance issues.                                          19    New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted      In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income ("SFAS No. 130"). SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components (revenue, expenses, gains, and losses) in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. SFAS No. 130 requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. SFAS No. 130 is not expected to have an effect on the Company's financial statements currently being presented because the Company, at this time, has no items of comprehensive income other than net income.      In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information ("SFAS No. 131"), which will be effective for financial statements beginning after December 15, 1997. SFAS No. 131 redefines how operating segments are determined and requires expanded quantitative disclosures relating to a company's operating statements. SFAS No. 131, which the Company is evaluating, will impact the financial statements to the extent that it is necessary to provide additional disclosure about the Company's segments.      In February 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132, Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits ("SFAS No. 132"), which will be effective for financial statements beginning after December 15, 1997. SFAS No. 132 revises employers' disclosure about pension and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 132 in Fiscal 1998 and believes it will impact the financial statements to the extent that it is necessary to provide additional disclosure about the Company's pensions and other postretirement benefits.  ITEM 7a.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk      Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company due to adverse changes in financial rates. The Company is exposed to market risk in the area of interest rates. This exposure is directly related to its Term Loan and borrowing activities under the Working Capital Facility. The Company does not currently maintain any interest rate hedging arrangements due to the reasonable risk that near-term interest rates will not rise significantly. The Company is continuously evaluating this risk and will implement interest rate hedging arrangements when deemed appropriate.                                            20      ITEM 8.
