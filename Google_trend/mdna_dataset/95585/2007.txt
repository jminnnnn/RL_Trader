Item 7.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   General   Our sales are derived from the retail sale of products at our stores. Internally, we look to a variety of indicators to evaluate our sales and gross profit performance, including, among others: same-store sales; sales per store; sales per selling square foot; percentage of total sales by department; inventory shrink and department gross margins.  We focus on increasing same-store sales, sales per selling square foot and sales per store through programs which provide greater customer service and better store-level execution, promotional activities and merchandising, including product placement and adjacencies, private label and enhanced use of the Pathmark Advantage Card, as well as high sanitation standards.     Our operating expenses are primarily incurred from selling, general and administrative costs.  Almost 68% of these costs are for labor and labor-related benefits.  Internally, we focus on a variety of indicators to evaluate our expense performance, including, among others: labor costs, including labor hours and hourly labor rates and labor-related expenses such as welfare costs, pension costs, payroll taxes and workers compensation costs.  Selling, general and administrative expenses other than labor and labor-related costs include occupancy expenses, supplies and customer accident claims, among others.     As has been our practice in the past, we will continue to evaluate the profitability, strategic positioning, impact of potential competition, and sales growth potential of all our stores on an ongoing basis. We may, from time to time, make decisions regarding acquisitions, closures, relocations or renovations in accordance with such evaluations. We completed 14 store renovations during fiscal 2006 and plan to complete 13 store renovations during fiscal 2007.   Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005    The following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data (dollars in millions):           53 Weeks Ended February 3, 2007       52 Weeks Ended January 28, 2006         Amount         %         Amount         %     Sales              $  4,058.0           100.0    %    $  3,977.0           100.0    %                     Gross profit        $  1,182.8           29.1    %    $  1,130.7           28.4    %     Selling, general and administrative expenses          (1,056.8    )      (26.0    )      (1,040.9    )      (26.1    )     Depreciation and amortization          (92.6    )      (2.3    )      (90.8    )      (2.3    )                     Operating earnings (loss)          33.4           0.8           (1.0    )                Interest expense, net          (62.3    )      (1.5    )      (64.7    )      (1.6    )                     Loss before income taxes          (28.9    )      (0.7    )      (65.7    )      (1.6    )     Income tax benefit          10.6           0.2           25.6           0.6                          Net loss        $    (18.3    )      (0.5    )%    $    (40.1    )      (1.0    )%                                16            Sales.  The following table sets forth data related to sales for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005:          53 Weeks Ended February 3, 2007         52 Weeks Ended January 28, 2006     Total sales increase                %(a)           %          Same-store sales increase (decrease)          0.4%(a)         (0.8)%        Sales per selling square foot        $    725(a)       $    725                   (a)        Excluding the extra week in fiscal 2006.                 Sales in 53-week fiscal 2006 were $4.06 billion compared to $3.98 billion in 52-week fiscal 2005. Sales in fiscal 2006, excluding estimated sales of $79.0 million in the extra week, were flat with sales in fiscal 2005, and were comprised of an increase of 0.4% from new stores and 0.4% from same-store sales (stores open the entire year in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, including replacement stores and enlargements), offset by a 0.8% decrease from closed stores. We operated 141 stores at the end of fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005.    Gross Profit. size=2> Gross profit represents the difference between sales and cost of goods sold, which includes the costs of inventory sold and the related purchase and distribution costs, net of vendor allowances and rebates. Gross profit in fiscal 2006 was $1.18 billion or 29.1% of sales compared to $1.13 billion or 28.4% of sales in fiscal 2005. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales of 0.7% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to higher margins in the grocery, nonfoods, produce and meat departments, lower inventory shrink in the perishable departments and lower logistic costs, partially offset by lower pharmacy margins associated with the new Medicare Part D program. We estimated that $22.5 million of the $52.1 million increase in gross profit was the result of the 53 rd  week and the remainder was primarily the result of our merchandising initiatives and lower inventory shrink.   SG&A. size=2> SG&A in fiscal 2006 was $1,056.8 million or 26.0% of sales compared to $1,040.9 million or 26.1% of sales in fiscal 2005, an increase of $15.9 million. SG&A in fiscal 2006 included: $9.7 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R), (2) $2.9 million in expenses related to the Merger Agreement, and (3) $3.5 million in gift card breakage income. SG&A in fiscal 2005 included: (1) a $14.6 million charge related to employee-related separation costs, comprised of (a) a $8.4 million charge related to a corporate headcount reduction program, (b) a $3.6 million charge related to a store labor buyout initiative, and (c) a $2.6 million charge related to separation agreements with two former executives, (2) a $4.7 million charge related to a merchandising and store initiative, (3) a $1.2 million charge related to stock-based compensation expense, and (4) a $1.1 million charge related to a review of strategic alternatives, which resulted in the Yucaipa investment. The balance of the increase in SG&A of $28.4 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the estimated impact of the extra week of $16.9 million, higher utility expenses of $4.7 million, higher self-insured workers compensation and general liability claims of $4.7 million, higher rent and real estate taxes of $3.0 million, higher incentive expenses of $2.4 million, higher technology expenses of $2.0 million, higher bank charges of $1.7 million and higher repairs of $1.4 million, partially offset by lower store payroll of $6.6 million and lower advertising expenses of $2.0 million.   Depreciation and Amortization.  Depreciation and amortization expense of $92.6 million in fiscal 2006 was $1.8 million higher than the $90.8 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was due to capital expenditures made as part of our store renovation program.   Operating Earnings (Loss).  Operating earnings were $33.4 million in fiscal 2006 compared to an operating loss of $1.0 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in operating earnings in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a higher gross margin, partially offset by higher SG&A costs.    Interest Expense, Net.  Interest expense was $62.3 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $64.7 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to lower lease obligations and the nonrecurring mortgage debt extinguishment charge of $2.8 million in fiscal 2005, partially offset by higher interest rates.        17               Income Tax Benefit.  The income tax benefit of $10.6 million in fiscal 2006 was based on an effective tax rate of 36.6% and the income tax benefit of $25.6 million in fiscal 2005 was based on an effective income tax rate of 38.9%. During fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, we made income tax payments of $5.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Refer to Note 18 for information related to our income taxes.    Summary of Operations.  The net loss in fiscal 2006 was $18.3 million compared to $40.1 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease in the net loss in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to higher operating earnings and lower interest expense, partially offset by a lower income tax benefit.    Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004   The following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data (dollars in millions):           52 Weeks Ended         January 28, 2006       January 29, 2005         Amount         %         Amount         %     Sales              $  3,977.0           100.0    %    $  3,978.5           100.0    %                     Gross profit        $  1,130.7           28.4    %    $  1,132.4           28.5    %     Selling, general and administrative expenses          (1,040.9    )      (26.1    )      (984.9    )      (24.8    )     Depreciation and amortization          (90.8    )      (2.3    )      (89.4    )      (2.2    )     Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets                                (309.0    )      (7.8    )                     Operating loss          (1.0    )                 (250.9    )      (6.3    )     Interest expense, net          (64.7    )      (1.6    )      (67.0    )      (1.7    )                     Loss before income taxes          (65.7    )      (1.6    )      (317.9    )      (8.0    )     Income tax benefit          25.6           0.6           9.3           0.2                          Net loss        $    (40.1    )      (1.0    )%    $   (308.6    )      (7.8    )%                      Sales.   The following table sets forth data related to sales for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004:          52 Weeks Ended        January 28, 2006         January 29, 2005     Total sales decrease                %           (0.3)%        Same-store sales decrease          (0.8)%         (0.8)%        Sales per selling square foot        $  725              $  724                          Sales in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 were $3.98 billion.  Sales in fiscal 2005 increased 1.2% from new stores, offset by a 0.8% decrease in same-store sales (stores open the entire year in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, including replacement stores and enlargements) and a 0.4% decrease from closed stores.  We believe sales benefited from an increase in average order size, but continued to be negatively affected by a decrease in customer traffic.  During fiscal 2005, we opened two new stores, one of which was a replacement for a closed store, closed four stores and completed eight store renovations.  We operated 141 stores at the end of fiscal 2005 and 143 stores at the end of fiscal 2004.    Gross Profit.   Gross profit represents the difference between sales and cost of goods sold, which includes the costs of inventory sold and the related purchase and distribution costs, net of vendor allowances and rebates.  Gross profit in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 was $1.13 billion.  As a percentage of sales, gross profit was 28.4% in fiscal 2005 compared to 28.5% in fiscal 2004; the reduction in the gross profit percentage in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to increased inventory shrink and logistic costs, offset by improved departmental mix.  As a result of the merchandising and store initiative, we incurred higher inventory shrink in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005 of $10.3 million, as compared to the prior year, primarily in the perishable departments.         18      SG&A. size=2> SG&A in fiscal 2005 was $1,040.9 million or 26.1% of sales compared to $984.9 million or 24.8% of sales in fiscal 2004, an increase of $56.0 million. SG&A in fiscal 2005 included: (1) a $14.6 million charge related to employee-related separation costs, (2) a $4.7 million charge related to a merchandising and store initiative, (3) a $1.2 million charge related to the amortization of stock-based compensation, and (4) a $1.1 million charge related to a review of strategic alternatives, which resulted in the Yucaipa investment. SG&A in fiscal 2004 was net of a $1.4 million credit to correct, on a cumulative basis, the accounting for our operating leases and long-term disability plan and a $1.5 million gain from the sale of real estate. The balance of the increase in SG&A in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 is primarily due to the following factors: (1) supply and utility expenses increased by 0.3% of sales, due to higher oil prices, (2) welfare, pension and medical expenses increased by 0.1% of sales, and (3) store labor expenses increased by 0.1% of sales, due to contractual increases.   Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets.   Based on the evaluation of our goodwill and long-lived assets performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we concluded there was no impairment in fiscal 2005 compared to a non-cash impairment charge of $309.0 million in fiscal 2004.     Depreciation and Amortization.   Depreciation and amortization of $90.8 million in fiscal 2005 was $1.4 million higher than the $89.4 million in fiscal 2004.  The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the amortization of the first phase, completed in fiscal 2004, of a multi-year project to upgrade our merchandising system.   Depreciation and amortization in fiscal 2004 included a charge of $2.0 million to correct, on a cumulative basis, the amortization of certain leasehold improvements.    Operating Loss.   The operating loss was $1.0 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $250.9 million in fiscal 2004.  The decrease in the operating loss in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the goodwill and long-lived assets impairment charge of $309.0 million in fiscal 2004, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses in fiscal 2005.    Interest Expense, Net.   Interest expense was $64.7 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $67.0 million in fiscal 2004.  The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to lower debt and higher cash investments resulting from the Yucaipa investment.  We used a portion of the net proceeds to pay down our Working Capital Facility borrowings and defease our mortgage borrowings, which resulted in a mortgage debt extinguishment charge of $2.8 million.  Fiscal 2004 included a write-off of deferred financing costs of $1.7 million related to the refinancing of our previous credit agreement.     Income Tax Benefit.   The income tax benefit of $25.6 million in fiscal 2005 was based on an effective tax rate of 38.9% and the income tax benefit of $9.3 million in fiscal 2004 was based on an effective income tax rate of 42.0%.  During fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, we made income tax payments of $3.2 million and $3.9 million, respectively.  Refer to Note 18 for information related to our income taxes.     Summary of Operations.   The net loss in fiscal 2005 was $40.1 million compared to $308.6 million in fiscal 2004.  The decrease in the net loss in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the goodwill and long-lived assets impairment charge of $309.0 million in fiscal 2004 and higher SG&A expenses, lower interest expense and higher income tax benefits in fiscal 2005.    Liquidity and Capital Resources     Cash Flows.   The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of cash flow data (in millions):            53 Weeks Ended February 3, 2007         52 Weeks Ended January 28, 2006         52 Weeks Ended January 29, 2005     Cash provided by (used for):                                               Operating activities        $    6.9         $   27.4         $  101.2            Investing activities          (66.0    )      (67.9    )      (99.6    )       Financing activities          13.8           71.3           32.1                   19      The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to higher cash used for operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by an increase in operating earnings. The increase in cash used for operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to (1) the transfer in fiscal 2006 of our disbursing account to the same financial institution we utilize for our depository accounts, thereby allowing for the right of offset, which resulted in the reduction of cash and book overdrafts of $23.1 million at February 3, 2007, and (2) the timing of our February 1 semi-annual Senior Subordinated Notes interest payment of $15.3 million and our prepaid rent payments of $6.8 million; such payments were made prior to February 3, 2007 in fiscal 2006, but subsequent to January 28, 2006 in fiscal 2005. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to a higher net loss, excluding the non-cash goodwill and long-lived assets impairment charge in fiscal 2004, an increase in the deferred income tax benefit and lower cash generated by operating assets and liabilities.    The decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to net sales of marketable securities, partially offset by higher capital expenditures,   including technology investments. The decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures,   including technology investments, partially offset by net purchases of marketable securities.    The decrease in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the fiscal 2005 proceeds from the issuance of the Purchased Securities, net of debt repayments (see  Debt Service and Liquidity below),  size=2>partially offset by increased borrowings under the Working Capital Facility. The increase in cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the proceeds related to the issuance of the Purchased Securities, net of debt repayments (see  Debt Service and Liquidity below) .   Debt Service and Liquidity.  On June 9, 2005, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we issued the Purchased Securities to the Investors for an aggregate purchase price of $150 million in cash. We received $137.5 million for the Purchased Securities, net of $12.5 million of costs directly attributable to the offering. We used $40.3 million of the net proceeds to pay down our working capital facility borrowings and $23.3 million to defease our mortgage borrowings. The remaining net proceeds were invested in short-term cash investments and have been used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures.    During fiscal 2004, we entered into the Credit Agreement which expires on October 1, 2009 and consists of a $180 million working capital facility, including letters of credit, (Working Capital Facility) and a $70 million term loan (Term Loan). The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants which, among other things, place limits on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, issuance of cash-pay preferred stock, repurchase of company stock, incurrence of liens, sale-leaseback transactions, hedging activities, sale or discount of receivables, investments, loans, advances, guarantees with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, changing lines of business, repayments of other indebtedness, amendments to organizational documents and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. The Credit Agreement also contains provisions permitting us to increase the size of the Working Capital Facility by $25 million and to repay and subsequently reborrow any portion of the Term Loan, in each instance subject to certain conditions. The Credit Agreement further provides that we must maintain a minimum inventory level of $150 million, that the maximum annual cash capital expenditures in a fiscal year are limited to the lesser of $150 million or an amount equal to our Consolidated EBITDA for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus any unused cash capital expenditures in the immediately preceding fiscal year up to a maximum of $20 million, and that we shall not, at any time, permit the ratio of Credit Extensions to Consolidated EBITDA (calculated on a trailing four-fiscal-quarters basis) at the end of any fiscal quarter to be more than 2.4:1.0 for each fiscal quarter (the Senior Leverage Ratio). As used in the Credit Agreement, Credit Extensions mean the sum of the principal balance of all outstanding borrowings thereunder ($70.0 million under the Term Loan and $22.7 million under the Working Capital Facility as of February 3, 2007) and the amount of outstanding letters of credit ($84.4 million as of February 3, 2007). Based on the Senior Leverage Ratio at the end of fiscal 2006, we have full availability under the Working Capital Facility after giving effect to Credit Extensions of $72.9 million. Also, the Credit Agreement prohibits the payment of cash dividends and contains customary events of default, including without limitation, payment defaults, material breaches of representations, warranties and covenants, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and a change of control (excluding the purchase by the Investors of the Purchased Securities). We were in compliance with all Credit Agreement covenants as of February 3, 2007.        20          We believe that cash flows from operations, supplemented by unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement and the availability of capital lease financing, will be sufficient to provide for our debt service requirements, working capital needs and capital expenditure program for at least the next fiscal year. However, in the event that cash flows from operations continue to decrease, we may decide to limit our future cash capital expenditure program and, subject to the Senior Leverage Ratio, our ability to utilize the full amount available under the Working Capital Facility could be limited.    There are no credit agency ratings-related triggers in either the Credit Agreement or in the indenture related to the Senior Subordinated Notes (the Indenture) that would adversely impact the cost of borrowings, annual amortization of principal or related debt maturities.   Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates equal to LIBOR plus a premium that ranges between 1.50% to 2.25%, depending on the average remaining availability under the Credit Agreement. Our interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement is currently at LIBOR plus 1.75%. Under the Term Loan, we are required to make a balloon payment of $70 million on October 1, 2009. The Working Capital Facility also expires on October 1, 2009. The weighted-average interest rate in effect on all borrowings under the Term Loan was 7.1% during fiscal 2006 and 5.3% during fiscal 2005.   All of the obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our 100% owned subsidiaries, except our nonguarantor subsidiaries, which are comprised of four 100% owned and consolidated single-purpose entities. Each of these single-purpose entities owns the real estate on which a supermarket leased to Pathmark is located. The obligations under the Credit Agreement and those of the subsidiaries guaranteeing the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Companys tangible and intangible assets including, without limitation, intellectual property, real property, including leasehold interests, and the capital stock in each of these subsidiaries.   We have outstanding $350 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes, including $150 million issued at a premium, which mature on February 1, 2012 and pay cash interest semi-annually on February 1 and August 1. The Indenture contains a number of restrictive covenants, including a restriction on our ability to declare cash dividends on our common stock. We were in compliance with all Senior Subordinated Notes covenants as of February 3, 2007.    Contractual Obligations and Commitments.  We enter into a variety of legally binding obligations and commitments in the normal course of our business. The table below presents our long-term contractual obligations and commitments which represent known future cash payments that we will be required to make under existing contractual arrangements. Some amounts are based on managements estimates and assumptions and amounts actually paid may vary from those reflected below. The following table presents contractual obligations as of February 3, 2007 (in millions):           Payments Due by Fiscal Years                Total         2007         2008 and 2009         2010 and 2011         Thereafter          Long-term debt obligations (1)              $    448.2         $     25.1         $     71.3         $      1.2         $    350.6          Interest on debt obligations          169.2           37.7           54.8           61.3           15.4          Capital lease obligations (1)          169.8           11.3           15.8           19.3           123.4          Interest on capital lease obligations          142.9           15.8           31.2           27.5           68.4          Operating lease obligations (2)          470.4           62.1           107.4           88.2           212.7          Purchase obligations (3)          681.4           105.5           209.8           205.0           161.1          Other liabilities (4)          242.3           42.2           58.9           46.8           94.4                             Total        $  2,324.2         $    299.7         $    549.2         $    449.3         $  1,026.0                                  (1)       Debt and capital lease obligations include principal payments only.         (2)       Operating lease obligations, net of sublease income of $48.8 million, are $421.6 million.           21            (3)       In addition to the purchase obligations reflected in the table above, we enter into supply contracts to purchase products for resale in the ordinary course of business.  This category of contracts covers a broad spectrum of products and sometimes includes specific merchandising obligations relative to those products.  These supply contracts typically include either a volume commitment or a fixed expiration date; pricing terms based on the vendor's published list price; termination provisions; and other standard contractual considerations.  Our obligation related to these contracts is typically limited to return of unearned allowances and therefore no amounts have been included above.  Purchase obligations shown above relate to the outsourcing of a major portion of our distribution, trucking and information systems functions through long-term agreements, as noted below.                                       We have a supply agreement with C&S, expiring in January 2013, pursuant to which C&S supplies substantially all of our grocery, frozen and perishable merchandise requirements.  Under our arrangement with C&S, we negotiate prices, discounts and promotions with vendors.  We pay C&S a per case upcharge, and have annual minimum case commitments.  The table above reflects the minimum upcharge.  During fiscal 2006, the products supplied from C&S accounted for over 60% of all of our supermarket inventory purchases.  This agreement may only be terminated for cause or certain events of bankruptcy by either party.                                        In February 2005, we entered into a seven-year extension of our existing outsourcing agreement with IBM, which commenced in 1991, to continue to provide a wide range of information systems services.  Under the agreement, expiring in January 2012, IBM provides data center operations, mainframe processing, business applications and systems development to enhance our customer service and efficiency.  The charges under this agreement are based upon the services requested at predetermined rates.  We may terminate this agreement with a payment of a specified termination charge.                                      We have an agreement, expiring in January 2014, with GHI to provide us with trucking services. Under this arrangement, there is an annual fixed fee in addition to transportation charges. The fixed fee is reflected in the table above. We may terminate this agreement with a payment of a specified termination charge.                (4)       Other liabilities include self-insured obligations, unfunded pension liabilities and post-retirement and post-employment obligations.         Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.   In the normal course of business, we have assigned to third parties various leases related to former businesses that we sold as well as former operating Pathmark supermarkets (the Assigned Leases).  When the Assigned Leases were assigned, we generally remained secondarily liable with respect to these lease obligations.  As such, if any of the assignees were to become unable to continue making rental payments under the Assigned Leases, under certain circumstances we could be required to assume the lease obligation.  As of February 3, 2007, our records indicate that 58 Assigned Leases may still have term remaining; however, we have no way of knowing in some instances if such Assigned Leases are still actually in effect or have been terminated by our assignees or their successors.  Assuming that each Assigned Lease is still in effect and that each respective assignee became unable to continue to make rental payments under an Assigned Lease, an event we believe to be remote, management estimates our maximum potential obligation with respect to the Assigned Leases to be approximately $99 million, which could be partially or totally offset by reassigning or subletting such leases.  We have a liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of February 3, 2007 of $2.4 million, which represents certain guarantees attributable to our secondary liability in connection with Assigned Leases assigned after December 31, 2002.     Additionally, in connection with the 1997 sale of our trucking business to GHI and distribution operation to C&S, GHI and C&S agreed to continue making contributions to the Local 863 Teamsters Pension Fund (the Fund), a multi-employer pension plan.  With respect to GHI, we agreed that in the event GHI were to withdraw from the Fund, to indemnify GHI under certain circumstances against all liabilities it would have arising from such a withdrawal.  We also agreed to provide GHI with a letter of credit to secure the potential indemnification obligation.  As of February 3, 2007, we have caused our bank to issue stand-by letters of credit in favor of GHI, or the Fund, in the aggregate amount of $20 million.  Under the agreement with GHI, we have        22      agreed to adjust said letters of credit up or down annually to reflect any change in the maximum estimated amount of the Fund withdrawal liability attributable to GHI, provided that any annual increase in said letters of credit will not exceed $5 million; provided further, that in the event of a change in control (excluding the Yucaipa investment), a failure to provide an annual increase in the letters of credit when due or a material adverse change in our financial condition, we would be required to furnish an increased letter of credit equal to the full amount of the estimated Fund withdrawal liability attributable to GHI, less any outstanding letters of credit in favor of GHI or the Fund.  The estimated Fund withdrawal liability attributable to GHI as of August 31, 2006 (the Funds last completed fiscal year), according to the Fund actuary, is $51.0 million.  With respect to C&S, we agreed that in the event C&S were to withdraw from the Fund, to indemnify C&S under certain circumstances against liabilities it would have arising from such a withdrawal; provided, however, that our indemnification obligation is limited to an amount not to exceed what our Fund withdrawal liability would have been as of August 31, 1997.  We are also a party to a variety of contracts under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters.  These contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts, purchase and sale agreements, leases, financial agreements and various other agreements.  Under these contracts, we may provide routine indemnification relating to representations and warranties, or personal injury matters.  The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined.  Historically, we have not made a significant payment for these indemnifications.   We had outstanding letters of credit of $84.4 million as of February 3, 2007, of which $84.0 million were standby letters of credit covering primarily self-insured or performance obligations.  The remaining $0.4 million were commercial letters of credit supporting purchases of imported products.   Capital Expenditures.   Capital expenditures, including technology investments, were $71.8 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $64.5 million in fiscal 2005 and $119.0 million in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2006, we completed 14 store renovations. During fiscal 2005, we opened two new stores, one of which was a replacement for a closed store, closed four stores and completed eight store renovations. During fiscal 2007, our capital expenditure plan is to invest approximately $80 million in 13 store renovations and in technology investments.         23      Critical Accounting Policies    Our discussion of results of operations and financial condition relies on our financial statements that are prepared based on certain critical accounting policies that require management to make judgments and estimates that are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty.  We believe that investors need to be aware of these policies and how they impact our financial statements as a whole, as well as our related discussion and analysis presented herein.  While we believe that these accounting policies are based on sound measurement criteria, actual future events can and often do result in outcomes that can be materially different from these estimates or forecasts.  The accounting policies and related risk described in this report are those that depend most heavily on these judgments and estimates.     Goodwill Impairment.   We perform our annual evaluation of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.  Based on our fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 evaluations, we concluded there were no impairments of our goodwill.  In fiscal 2004 we concluded that there was a $293.8 million impairment of our goodwill.  Since such impairment analysis is based on economic and business assumptions, the goodwill impairment analysis in the future could be affected by changes in these business and economic conditions, changes in consumer spending, the competitive environment in which we operate and other risks detailed elsewhere in this report.     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.   It is our policy to assess the carrying value of our long-lived assets for possible impairment on an individual store basis to determine if the carrying value of such assets are recoverable from their related undiscounted cash flows.  Based on our fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 assessments, we concluded there were no impairments of our long-lived assets.  In fiscal 2004, we concluded that there was an impairment of $15.2 million.  Since our estimates project cash flow several years into the future, they could be affected by variable factors such as inflation and economic conditions.     Pension Plans.   For all our pension plans, pension income was $2.0 million for fiscal 2006, pension expense was $5.3 million (including a $7.5 million charge related to the retirement incentive program and executive separations) for fiscal 2005 and pension income was $4.1 million for fiscal 2004.  Pension income and expense are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions.  The expected return on assets of the Pathmark Stores, Inc. Pension Plan (the Qualified Plan) represents the weighted-average of expected returns for each asset category, which have been developed using information from a number of third-party consultants and long-term historical data on returns for different asset categories and inflation.  We also considered the Qualified Plans historical 10-year and 20-year compounded returns of 9.4% and 11.8%, respectively, which have exceeded broad market returns over comparable periods, indicating a significant premium has been gained through active management of plan assets.  Based on these factors and the asset allocation discussed below, we elected to use a 9.0% expected return on plan assets in determining pension cost for fiscal 2006.  This was consistent with fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004.  Our assumption was net of expected plan expenses payable from the trust fund, which were less than 0.8% of plan assets.    The expected long-term rate of return on our Qualified Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 70% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 10.5%, and 30% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 5.5% (both were net of expected plan expenses payable from the trust fund).  Because of market fluctuation, our actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2006 was 73% with equity managers and 27% with fixed income managers. We believe, however, that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 70% with equity managers and 30% with fixed income managers.  We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate.  A 0.5% reduction in our expected long-term rate of return on Qualified Plan assets, holding all other factors constant, would have decreased pension income during fiscal 2006 by approximately $1.3 million.    We base our determination of pension expense or income, in part, on a market-related valuation of assets that reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a three-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market value of assets. As of February 3, 2007, due to offsetting gains and losses, the market value and market-related value of assets differed by less than 1.0%.       24       The discount rate used reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on our annual measurement date (December 31) and is subject to change each year. The discount rate was determined by matching, on an approximate basis, a theoretical zero-coupon spot yield curve derived from a portfolio of high-quality bonds as of the measurement date to the expected plan benefit payments defined by the projected benefit obligation and solving for a single equivalent discount rate that resulted in the same projected benefit obligation. The discount rate was 6.0% as of February 3, 2007 and 5.75% as of January 28, 2006. Pension income is sensitive to the discount rate and salary increase assumptions used. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate used would have decreased fiscal 2006 pension income by approximately $0.7 million. A 0.25% increase in the salary increase assumption would have decreased fiscal 2006 pension income by approximately $0.6 million.   Based on an expected return on plan assets assumption of 9.0%, a discount rate of 6.0% and our various other relevant current assumptions, we estimate that our pension income for all pension plans combined will approximate $2.5 million for fiscal 2007, $3.7 million for fiscal 2008 and $5.7 million for fiscal 2009. Actual pension income in the future will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension plans.   The value of our Qualified Plan assets has increased from $270.7 million at December 31, 2005 to $279.8 million at December 31, 2006. The actual return in excess of that expected and the increase in the discount rate have raised the overfunded status of our Qualified Plan, net of benefit obligations, from $58.3 million at December 31, 2005 to $72.9 million at December 31, 2006. We believe that, based on our actuarial assumptions and due to the overfunded status of our Qualified Plan, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to our Qualified Plan for at least the next three years.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, which requires us to recognize the funded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in our statement of financial position. We are also required to disclose information about certain effects on net periodic benefit costs for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition assets or obligations. We adopted SFAS No. 158 as of February 3, 2007, resulting in a reduction in the funded pension asset of $69.2 million, a decrease in net deferred income taxes of $26.4 million, a decrease in postretirement benefit obligations of $7.2 million, an increase in unfunded pension liabilities of $0.4 million and a reduction in stockholders equity of $36.0 million. SFAS No. 158 also requires us to measure the funded status of our plan as of the date of our fiscal year-end statement of financial position. As we have always used the calendar year for measurement, this will result in a change in our consolidated financial statements. We are not required to adopt this change until our fiscal year ending February 1, 2009. We do not expect that the adoption of this portion of SFAS No. 158 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.   Self-Insured Claims Liabilities and Postemployment Benefits.  We are self insured for claims relating to customer, associate and vehicle accidents, as well as certain associate medical and disability benefits, and, except for associate medical insurance, we maintain third-party excess insurance coverage for such claims. It is our accounting policy to record a self-insured liability, as determined actuarially on a consistent basis, based on the facts and circumstances of each individual claim filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported discounted at a risk-free interest rate of 4.75%. All claims and their related liabilities are reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis. Any actuarial projection of losses concerning such claims is subject to variability primarily due to external factors affecting future inflation rates, litigation trends, benefit levels and claim settlement patterns. At February 3, 2007, liabilities for self-insured claims and benefits were $58.3 million and for postemployment benefits were $5.7 million.   New Accounting Pronouncements    In June 2006, FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of SFAS No. 109 was issued. This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entitys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For benefits to be realized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. The amount       25       recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. FIN No. 48 is effective for our fiscal year beginning February 4, 2007. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN No. 48 will be recorded in accumulated deficit and other accounts, as applicable. We are currently evaluating the provisions of FIN No. 48 and have not yet completed our determination of the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial position.   In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus of EITF No. 06-03, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should be Presented in the Income Statement (That is, Gross Versus Net Presentation). The scope of this issue includes any tax assessed by a government authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing activity between a seller and a customer. EITF No. 06-03 states that the income statement presentation of taxes within the scope of this issue on either a gross (included in revenues at cost) basis or a net (excluded from revenues) basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed, effective for our fiscal year beginning February 4, 2007. We will continue to use the net basis for presentation.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under this statement, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. This statement is effective for our fiscal year beginning February 3, 2008, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of evaluating this statement, but do not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.   In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. This bulletin provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The SEC staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative facts are considered, is material. SAB No. 108 was effective for our fiscal year ended February 3, 2007. The adoption of SAB No. 108 did not result in any adjustments to our consolidated financial statements.   In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of SFAS No. 115. This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. This statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement, which is consistent with the FASBs long-term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments. SFAS No. 159 is effective for our fiscal year beginning February 3, 2008. We are in the process of evaluating this statement, but do not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.       Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Our financial results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt which carries variable interest rates. Variable rate debt outstanding under our Term Loan was $70.0 million on February 3, 2007. During fiscal 2006, the average interest rate in effect on borrowings under our Term Loan was 7.1%. A 1.0% change in interest rates applied to the $70.0 million balance of floating-rate Term Loan debt would affect pre-tax annual results of operations by approximately $0.7 million. Our Senior Subordinated Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.75%, and are, therefore, not subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations. The principal objective of our treasury management activities is to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to facilitate our funding needs. As part of our risk management, we may use derivative financial products such as interest rate hedges and interest rate swaps in the future.       26          Item 8.  Financial Statements.
